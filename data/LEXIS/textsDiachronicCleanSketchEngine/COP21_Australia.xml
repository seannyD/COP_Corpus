"WHAT will the Renewable Energy Target mean for our farmers?" Last year the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 We promised to do this using the Emissions Reduction Fund which purchases emission reduction credits and we also promised to increase our Renewable Energy Target to 23% by 2020. What this will mean for agriculture is that there are new investments in reforestation projects and forestry offsets. Carbon projects could become tradable internationally and popular. Landowners can benefit from approved method projects like Beef Herd Management, sequestering carbon in soils in grazing, feeding nitrates to cattle, avoiding clearing of native regrowth and savanna fire management projects, just to name a few. Perform these in accordance with the rules and credits or money could be earnt. Reliance on fossils fuels is set to reduce (these can still be offset using sinks, CCS etc) and there will be growth in clean energy and renewables. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) for example funded over $22m towards the Barcaldine Community Solar Farm. Some projects like this could be located on private land and agreements reached with private companies who wish to construct these renewable projects. Grazing may still be grazing, but what if you just grazed a little differently and were paid to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions or the emissions of some other polluter in another country?" \</doc>

\~\~Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is set to swoop on Paris for a string of talks before the United Nations Climate Change Conference . \~\~ Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will also fly into the French capital on Sunday before the fortnight-long summit aimed at achieving a global accord on tackling climate change and reducing carbon emissions. \~\~ The leaders will meet with an array of international peers, business heavyweights, scientists, climate experts and environmentalists to discuss global action on climate change. \~\~ Before he took to the skies, Mr Shorten argued the prime minister was determined to hold back Australia on climate change action and was saddled with "Tony Abbott's climate-sceptic baggage". \~\~ Mr Turnbull urged others at a special climate change session on Friday at the Commonwealth leaders' summit in Malta to sign up to the Commonwealth leaders' climate change statement. \~\~ "Ahead of COP21 it is a powerful signal to other countries of the world to show a similar level of ambition and commitment to working together for a strong result in Paris," Mr Turnbull said. \</doc>

More than 100 world leaders arrived, made speeches, posed for photos and then flew home. But the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris does not end for another two weeks. So what happens now at the world's biggest gathering on global warming? The nations get down to the nitty gritty. Howard Bamsey is an adjunct professor at the Australian National University. Previously he was deputy secretary of Australia's Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and Australia's lead negotiator at the UN climate conferences. He estimates he has been to at least 18 of the 21 conferences. "The most important event, in terms of the expectations of the people who are looking on, is the negotiations themselves," he said. In the lead-up to the Paris conference, a draft version of the international agreement to limit global warming was circulated. This week, negotiators from each nation will break into specialist teams, each taking a section of the draft to consider, Professor Bamsey said. "At this stage they're all in these smaller groups working on a limited set of issues. All separately," he said. "So in the Australian delegation, every morning there'll be a meeting where the negotiators from the different groups come together and inform one another what's been happening in their groups so they can make the connections and see how the whole thing is shaping up. "It's really difficult to judge what the whole picture is unless you're able to keep in touch with the different processes that are happening at the same time." Gruelling, complex negotiations not for the 'impatient' Professor Bamsey says negotiations happen both formally and informally, day and night, in a gruelling process for the delegates. Sometimes talks become stuck when one nation will not budge on a particular issue. "They insist on full discussion. They want their outcome and they won't back down very easily. So at different points, different parts of the text become a blockage to the agreement as a whole," he said. But judging which issue to move on from and where to stand firm is all part of complex and often unrelated issues. "What might look like a completely straightforward negotiating process is filled with all this significance that isn't apparent on the surface," Professor Bamsey said. "So you can see inordinate amounts of time given to negotiating what might seem to be quite straightforward text. "The ones that are invested in significance ... they can take a long time to resolve. "Unless you're part of the process, you can become very impatient with the time taken to resolve those because they may not look on the surface as if they're significant at all." By about Saturday, he said various pieces of the text should be settled or decisions made in a draft form. From there, the negotiating baton is passed to the next level up. That is usually the most senior negotiators, or ministers. "That's when the final trade-offs are made," he said. Circus of the talks can help negotiations The 2015 conference aims to have the text fairly well nailed down by the middle of the next week. In the meantime, outside the often closed-door haggling over draft text, businesses, activist groups, think tanks and academics all gather in what has become the world's biggest trade-fair for climate change ideas and industry. Professor Bamsey said the associated circus could be an indirect contribution to the negotiation process. "In many cases delegates won't have a lot of time to get to side events. Often what's happening there is indirectly conveyed to the negotiating process," he said. "Very often you'll hear insights that will inform an issue that's being negotiated or there's the sense of momentum that's imparted by this vast number of side events and stories about climate action. "That sense of momentum can have a positive impact on the negotiating process." \</doc>

Victoria, Nov. 5 -- The State Government of Victoria issued details of the following event: Jasmine Targett, Bethany Wheeler and Alanna Lorenzon: Return to Nature Burrinja Cultural Centre present Jasmine Targett, Bethany Wheeler and Alanna Lorenzon: Return to Nature. People go back to nature to pause and reflect, to seek insight into the nature of the universe and gain an expanded awareness of themselves. Climate change is changing all of that. You walk outside and notice that the air is warmer, the earth is dryer; storms cause more chaos and disaster and are left wondering are humans responsible? There is an ever-increasing gap between the action of countries and what science tells society. In December 2015 world leaders in science, politics, business and environment will meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21 in Paris, in an attempt to secure a legally binding global climate agreement to curb carbon emissions and ensure that the global temperature rise will stay below two degrees Celsius. The works presented by Jasmine Targett, Bethany Wheeler and Alanna Lorenzon address how artists study, map, research and make sense of significant changes in the environment both past and present. The works signal a 'return to nature', a period of contemplation in which people look to nature to gain insight and understanding into how they can live in a more healthy and collaborative way with the environment as individuals, as a community and as a species globally.

For young innovator Mitch Woolfenden, ground-breaking ideas are the way to a better future, especially when it comes to clean technology. He said Canberra was in a good position to capitalise on its knowledge economy and take advantage of trends that emerged from the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Mr Woolfenden was in a team of Australian National University students and alumni representing the capital at a pitching event in Paris, held alongside the COP21 . "Meeting other groups from other cities was also really quite interesting." In June last year, Rommel Macaraeg, Lily Wang, Joshua Petrass, Vijay Nandagiri and Mr Woolfenden devised a certification scheme for local businesses using renewable energy. Their proposal impressed judges in an international hackathon-style competition, which took place over 24 hours in 20 cities around the world. As a result, they were chosen to travel to Climate-KIC's global Climathon initiative, which aimed to accelerate solutions to the problems faced by cities. In the Grand Palais in central Paris, the local contingent developed their ideas and worked on pitching them in front of the other 11 teams. Mr Woolfenden was impressed to see "a lot of cleantech businesses" and related enterprises when he visited the Solutions 21 exhibition. "This is where the economic opportunities of the future lie," he said of the impetus towards harnessing renewable materials and alternative energy sources. "It's a bit concerning in that there's the potential for Australia to be left behind." However, Mr Woolfenden was quick to praise the ACT, which he cited as "one of the areas doing the most" in the country. In terms of innovation and economics, he said "the early movers get the advantage" and "if you wait until it's happening, it's too late". The dynamos behind the start-up company, Certified Renewable, have been quick off the mark and they are eager to give accredited local businesses the recognition they deserve. Details are available at certifiedrenewable.org. The team's twitter address is @RE-Certified. \</doc>

Fiji's plea: save us before the tide comes in By Emma Kelly The Fijian high commissioner to Australia has urged developed countries to take greater action on climate change less than a month before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Yogesh Punja used a mock climate change summit for high school students in Canberra on Wednesday to urge countries attending the global summit to "please save" Pacific Islands facing rising seawaters that threaten to inundate their homes. Mr Punja said his country wanted a global target of maintaining a rise in temperatures below 2 degrees to be revised down to 1.5 degrees. He described island nations such as Fiji as a "canary in a cage" for a warming climate. "We have had a number of simulations done to show what will happen to the planet if the temperature went up by 1.5 degrees," he said. "If we only [aim for] 2 degrees, it becomes critical. I think by 2 degrees many of the Pacific nations will disappear."Our message to COP21 is look out, we may disappear - please save us." Mr Punja said changing fish migration patterns meant communities were also becoming "economic refugees". "You have to see through your own eyes how desperate these people are,' he said. The panel discussion included representatives from the European Union, the United States, China, France and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Aside from listening and asking questions of the panel, the group of teenagers discussed climate change and renewable energy and held their own mock summit, representing some of the major players heading to the Paris negotiations. European Union ambassador to Australia Sem Fabrizi said he was impressed by the students' enthusiasm and their knowledge of the complexities of climate change. "The future belongs to them and I think the students today are very aware of it," he said. "There's an inter-generational duty to lead the next generation to a better place." \</doc>

NEXT Monday, world leaders will gather in Paris at the United Nations Climate Change Conference for further negotiations toward stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. This will be the 21st annual meeting of the "Conference of the Parties" (hence its nickname " COP21 ") to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The specific goal of this meeting is a legally binding agreement of all nations, which will come into force in 2020, with the aim of keeping warming below 2 C. It's critically important for every country to not only "tick the boxes", but go beyond obligatory efforts to do the very best they possibly can. This is especially true of wealthy developed nations. While Australia contributes a small proportion of total global emissions, both our per capita emissions and our wealth are among the highest in the world. As usual, Australia punches above its weight in influence; so we have an opportunity to make a positive impact disproportionate to our size by demonstrating a bold commitment to positive action - and polls show the majority of Australians support this. In Port Macquarie, we too have the opportunity to be influential beyond our size! This coming weekend will see climate marches and rallies all over the world, and Port Macquarie will be part of the action. A large turnout for these events will send Australian and world leaders a strong message of support for ambitious action. Hundreds of thousands of Australians and millions of people around the world will march to encourage leaders in Paris to work towards a transition to renewable energy, secure jobs, clean air and a safe climate. Whether the day brings sun or rain, I hope we'll see loads of smiling faces and bright colours at Westport Park on Saturday morning. I'm sure that the event will be positive and enjoyable. Everyone is welcome - the more the merrier! Angela E. Frimberger, VMD, DACVIM(O) Director, Veterinary Oncology Consultants Pty Ltd \</doc>

Climate change deal crucial as world heats up By Michael McCarthy in London Smoke billows from a power station during sunset in New Delhi. COMMENT It is becoming apparent that 2015 may be a critical year for the issue of climate change, in more ways than one. The obvious way, of course, is through the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop21 ) opening in Paris in six months, where the world community will try to agree a legally binding deal to limit the carbon emissions causing the atmosphere to warm. The Paris conference may be the final chance the world gets to keep rising temperatures below the agreed danger threshold of 2 degrees above the pre-industrial level. The last attempt to cut such a deal, at Copenhagen in 2009, collapsed amid fierce argument about who should do what, between the developed countries, led by the Americans, and the developing nations, led by the Chinese. This time around, some of the auguries are better, not least because last November the Americans and the Chinese announced their own bilateral climate accord, each agreeing to cut their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to a greater degree than at any point before and to work together to reach agreement. This is vital because these are the two biggest carbon emitters, between them accounting for 45per cent of the global total (China with 29per cent, and the US with 16per cent). If there is a major obstacle remaining, it is the third-biggest emitter, India, currently with 8per cent of the total, and rising. India stresses its prime national objective is economic development to pull its 1.25billion people out of poverty, and, at the moment, that will be powered by burning cheap coal. Whether or not Prime Minister Narendra Modi will agree to have development constrained by a legally binding emissions treaty remains to be seen; it looks very doubtful. However, there is something that may comprehensively alter the mood music of Cop21 , and give 2015 another significance for climate change: this may be the year when the pause in the rapid progress of rising temperatures, which began after 1998, may be over. The fact that the soaring world temperatures of the 1980s and 1990s began to flatline has puzzled climate scientists (and given comfort to climate sceptics). Computer models predicted that the mercury would steadily go up as carbon poured into the sky, and pour it has  40billion tons a year, now; and two months ago the level of atmospheric CO2 crossed 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time (when scientists began to measure it in 1958 it was 315ppm). It is likely that its effect is being buffered in some way, perhaps with increased atmospheric heat being absorbed by the deep oceans. But climate scientists' view has always been that the obvious rise in global air temperatures will, sooner or later, resume; and there are signs that this is happening now. What might seem like such a sign is India's current heatwave, one of the worst in its history, which, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees, has claimed nearly 2000 lives in 10 days; but this may be part of natural climate variability, and may end with the monsoon. We are on surer ground with the temperature figures. It appears that 2015 may be the hottest year in recorded history, by some margin. Dr Johnson famously said that "when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully". If 2015 is the year in which climate change resumes its dramatic upward march, it may concentrate a lot of minds in Paris, come December. Independent \</doc>

Start-up offers recognition for companies on greener path By Mary Lynn Mather Mitch Woolfenden and Rommel Macaraeg are part of a team from Canberra pitching a certification scheme at the Paris climate change conference. Photo: ROHAN THOMSON Five young people from Canberra are in Paris this weekend, touting the bright idea they believe could make a difference to one of the world's biggest issues. The Australian National University students and alumni are among the top entrants in an international competition to find solutions to the challenges of climate change. As part of their prize, they are sharing the thinking behind their start-up company at a pitching event being held alongside the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 . They met six months ago at Climathon, a hackathon-style event organised by Climate-KIC, where they came up with the idea for the venture they named Certified Renewable. Mr Woolfenden said the team of young entrepreneurs was keen to share its ideas on the world stage and engage with innovative thinkers from around the globe. For the young graduate in science and law, "hope and positivity are really important". He said he preferred to focus on the opportunities inherent in addressing climate change's challenges, rather than the downsides. For Ms Wang, a chemistry student, the Paris invitation and the financial support were big milestones on the team's "journey to recognition". She said she was looking forward to swapping ideas with the other winners and "seeing how world representatives react to each pitch". Mr Macaraeg was excited at the possibility of meeting leaders like French President Francois Hollande, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The young professionals and students come from the Commonwealth and ACT public services, the ANU and Windlab. Between them, they have knowledge of everything from solar power to actuarial science. Ms Wang said the start-up company owed its "entire being" to the ANU and the local community, with Certified Renewable "largely developed under the wing of the InnovationACT program". The team received $10,000 in seed funding to develop the venture further, as well as ongoing support from mentors. Mr Woolfenden and Mr Macaraeg said they were looking for pioneering companies that wanted to be certified. "We've spoken to local businesses and they're keen to embrace renewable energy and think there are real commercial benefits from sharing this with customers," Mr Woolfenden said. \</doc>

The landmark COP21 climate accord struck in Paris late last year has brightened the mood of the gas industry on the outlook for demand compared to just a year ago, according to Origin Energy chief executive Grant King. Mr King said compared with the previous major global gas conference, held in Paris in May, the industry sounded more optimistic on gas demand, despite the concerns relating to oversupply in the LNG market. "It's interesting that, what's happened in the middle is COP21 ," Mr King said in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the LNG18 conference in Perth. He said the issue of oversupply should not be too much of a concern because new chunks of LNG capacity always came onto the market "in big licks" because of the size of plants. "It's not unusual to go through periods of excess supply, the question is the rate at which that excess supply gets taken up by market," he said. Mr King said the new supply of LNG coming out of Australia and the US during the next few years wasn't surprising because "everyone knew that was coming". More important is the demand side and the implications of the COP21 commitments for fuel use, in particularly increased reliance on gas. "The reality is it's just not possible to square the 2 degrees centigrade objective and let's go for 1.5 [degrees limit to global warming] with using more coal in Europe, for example, and retiring nuclear," he said. But he said governments needed to "step up and be more honest about that equation, particularly in Europe". "It doesn't square, you can't have those ambitious targets for climate change and keep building coal-fired power stations. "If the world is serious about the 2 degrees C and the ambition of 1.5, something has to give and really the only thing that can give is more gas." He said he didn't think governments had fully accepted what would be needed to achieve the Paris climate targets. "I just don't think the world has come to grips with how it's going to achieve that aspiration in Paris without a much more early and rapid substitution for gas," he said. This week he described the views of investors that are divesting from gas companies because gas is a fossil fuel as "a bit naive" given the need for gas to enable the power sector to move to a lower-emissions future. Gas had an important role to play to ensure reliable supply in backing up renewable energy, he said. KPMG global head of LNG Mary Hemmingsen agreed that the Paris accord had to point to a brighter demand growth for gas. "If you look at the Paris accord, the fact that most of the world's countries signed on is a positive sign for the LNG industry," Ms Hemmingsen said. "Long term, there needs to be some strides to realise those objectives and gas has a very important contribution." \</doc>

PEOPLE across the world demanded action on climate change at the weekend. More than 150 people were at Burnie Park to encourage their governments to make a change. The worldwide rallies were in support of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which begins today. Supporters also held one minute's silence for the victims of the recent South Australia bushfire. Climate Action North-West member and event organiser Tom Kingston said he could not have been happier with the turnout. "We had 80 people turn out last year, so it's the biggest yet," Mr Kingston said. "We were very impressive with that number . . . the people that did turn up, their concerns are the same that we all have. "The reason that we met was to encourage our local members to get the state and federal governments to move and act." Parklands High School grade 10 student Keith Nicholls made a speech at the rally. The 15-year-old said the worst effects of climate change had not yet been seen and it would be his children and grandchildren who would pay the price. "We need the governments to work together to commit to goals to stop the negligence around the globe . . . this year we want change," Mr Kingston said. He said he had been encouraging his teenage peers to take climate change seriously. University of Tasmania student Anton Kole also spoke at the rally. Mr Kole has been studying the wind speeds in Burnie. He said the wind speeds in Burnie had increased 9.41 per cent in the past two decades. The United Nations Climate Change Conference plans to come to a universal agreement on climate change this week. NATIONAL, Page 13 \</doc>

So, which\~businesses participate in COP meetings? Will COP21 result in meaningful action by business or will it be another massive greenwashing exercise under the benevolent gaze of the United Nations? While a wide range of industry sectors participate at COP meetings, the usual suspects are not hard to identify.

Industry associations such as the Confederation of European Paper Industries, European Steel Association, European Association of Metals and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers regularly lobby EU climate policymakers, advocating business-friendly policies.

Big four professional services firms are ramping up their climate change and sustainability practices at a rate not seen since 2007 when Kevin Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The investment indicates that despite Australia's international reputation as a laggard on carbon emissions reduction, companies are moving to mitigate environmental risk to remain competitive in global supply chains. EY's domestic sustainability practice has grown to roughly 160 staff, up from 90 when it acquired boutique consultancy Net Balance a year ago. Mr Bell said the sustainability manager is emerging as a parallel role to the chief risk officer within corporations. Visiting Australia last week, former European commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard told journalists that the world has noted Australia's lack of ambition on climate change ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 or CMP11 to be held in Paris later this year. The Abbott government has set an emissions reduction target of at least 26 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. While criticised by many as lame, the Prime Minister's hand-picked economic modeller Warwick McKibbin has argued that compared with other countries in terms of economic costs, Australia's target is at the higher end of commitments. Business is emerging as the pace-setter in Australia amid ongoing policy uncertainty, according to chief executive of think-tank and advocacy group Sustainable Business Australia, Andrew Petersen. "Business has always known that climate change would be a big disrupter," Mr Petersen said. "They see opportunities." Much of the work is around "stranded asset risk" - the quickly diminishing value of assets that are suddenly on the nose, like coal. Some commodity companies and property groups are struggling to convince major shareholders that diversifying away from a singular asset class is good for value creation into the future. Mr Bell said it is not unusual for big investors to pressure businesses to stick to their knitting even though its unwise in the medium to long term. "[Some] investors prefer to adjust their portfolio to manage risk," Mr Bell said. "They don't want the company to mitigate risk." This presents a unique challenge for management. KPMG has run companies from a range of sectors in Europe, the United States, Australia and Asia through the tool. In some cases, the negative peripheral impact has completely wiped out company earnings. Many of these negative factors, such as injuries in the workplace, eventually end up weighing on balance sheets through taxes or regulatory change. KPMG's modelling shows public policy is heavily geared towards punishing bad behaviour, rather than incentivising good practices, Mr King said. Companies that undertake this work do so mainly as an internal risk management and decision-making tool, according to Mr King. However some, such as Holcim and Volvo, use it to inform public reporting. \</doc>

Resources companies are growing increasingly nervous about fossil fuel divestment as the numbers of investors that cut or reduced their exposure to oil, gas and coal surged in the lead up to critical climate talks in Paris, according to the head of one of America's best-known philanthropic foundations. Green investment campaigners HYPERLINK http://350.org 350.org and \~ HYPERLINK http://divestinvest.org/ Divest-Invest on Wednesday claimed more than 100 institutions representing $US800 billion under management divested at least some of their fossil interests in the 10 weeks ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in the French capital. Companies such as BHP Billiton believe the divestment campaign led by 350.org is having an impact on the attitudes of professional investors including fund managers and superannuation funds. The Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday that the coal divestment lobby HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/mining/coal/bhp-and-rio-tinto-are-quietly-exiting-coal-20151202-gldo0o has stopped campaigning against BHP "I think they [resources companies] are getting a little nervous," said Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. "The writing is on the wall." The divestment groups found the number of institutions reducing their exposure numbered 500 with more than $US3.4 trillion in assets under management. This represents a substantial rise on the 181 institutions representing around $US50 billion in assets that had made a similar commitment a year ago. Divest-Invest and 350.org described the numbers as "another impressive leap for the divestment effort" but conceded some of the commitments were "only partial divestments, and the $US3.4 trillion represents the total amount of assets represented by institutions, not the amount of money divested, which is difficult to track due to varying degrees of disclosure". Charities, churches, universities, government pension funds and municipal governments have shown a far greater willingness to divest fossil fuels than conventional investment firms. However, Europe's largest insurance company, Allianz, divested ???630 million from coal - and announced plans to pour over ???4 billion into wind energy - in the weeks before the UN conference. For example, Melbourne City Council is one of 14 councils that are reducing their fossil fuel investments. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund made headlines in September last year when it joined at least 70 other philanthropic foundations committed to selling at least some of their fossil-fuel holdings. The decision was particularly noteworthy because the foundation was established by the heirs of John D. Rockefeller, who made his fortune from Standard Oil. "The fact is that by divesting, all of us who are doing so are sending very significant market signals," Mr Heintz said. "Coal companies are failing and coal plants are being shut down and coal mines are being stopped and divestment is part of the that process." Mr Heintz acknowledged the irony of the foundation that owes its existence to oil, deciding to shun high-carbon fuels. "But the point is that John D. Rockefeller himself, who went to work as a relatively poor young man at age 16, made a fortune because he saw the future. And if John D. Rockefeller was alive today he would know the future is not in fossil fuels. He'd be on the leading edge of the clean energy revolution and making money doing that. So I don't think it was so strange we made this decision." "The commitments vary in their exact language and some are only partial divestment commitments, or just apply to a particular fossil fuel such as coal or tar sands," said campaigners at the UN climate talks in Paris, known as COP21 . Still, the new figures are another sign that "investors are reading the writing on the wall and dramatically shifting capital away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy", the campaign organisations 350.org and Divest-Invest said on Wednesday. \</doc>

The half-way mark in a marathon is always a testy time. So too is the mid-way point of the Paris climate negotiations. The speeches by 150 heads of state on the opening day of the conference were intended to inject some early momentum into the negotiations. Yet as soon as the formal negotiations began, the parties climbed back into their well-worn trenches and progress became painfully slow. The plan, and hope, was that the negotiators would whittle down the hefty draft text of the \' Paris Agreement' into a shorter and relatively cleaner text for the ministers to finalise by the end of the second week. Nonetheless, the hot button issues are plain to see. Those include the temperature target and the long-term goal of the agreement, the review mechanism, transparency and accountability, and above all, the crucial cross-cutting issues of differentiation and climate finance. The most vulnerable parties are desperately fighting for a temperature target of no more than 1.5 degrees. That's resisted by many major economies and especially Saudi Arabia. There's no consensus yet on whether the long-term goal should be decarbonisation (rejected by fossil fuel states), zero global emissions, net zero global emissions, carbon neutrality or a long-term low emissions transformation --\~to name only some of the bracketed options. Nor is it clear whether a specific date or time period for achieving this long-term goal can be agreed. Options include 2050, 2060-80, end of the century, or as soon as possible after mid-century. The review mechanism debate revolve around whether and how the 188 \' intended nationally determined contributions' (INDCs) that have been submitted by the parties for the post-2020 period should be reviewed, and whether subsequent contributions in the ongoing cycles of commitment must represent forward progression or simply just not go backwards. The latter would fail to generate the dynamism to drive a rapid ratcheting-up of ambition to hold warming to below two degrees (let alone 1.5 degrees). The key division in the debate over transparency in mitigation action and support turns on how much flexibility should be accorded to developing and least developed countries. The US and EU want the transparency and accountability rules to apply to all parties while many developing countries reject a one-size-fits-all approach. Cutting across and infusing all of these debates are the crucial issues of differentiation and climate finance. Developing countries have continued to point out that developed countries haven't fulfilled their obligation to lead in mitigation under the 1992 Convention or to provide adequate finance and other support to developing countries, which was promised in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009. In response, many developed countries point out that the world has change since 1992 and the old binary between developed and developing countries, as reflected in the annexes to the 1992 Convention, are now well and truly outdated. As a consequence, the draft language on finance is a sea of brackets and the multiple references to differentiation throughout the text are heavily bracketed. The US and China have made it clear that they are strongly committed to reaching a deal. However, there are 194 other parties that must also consent to this agreement. The problem is that the hyper-flexible approach favoured by the G2 doesn't provide the more climate vulnerable parties with the assurances they need to ensure their continuing existence. Saudi Arabia has also been playing its usual blocking game by rejecting proposals designed to strengthen climate protection. Sorting out these and many other differences will require major compromises. A commitment to scale up climate finance and other support (technology transfer and capacity building) by developed countries (and possibly some major developing countries) will certainly help to unlock many, if not all, of these differences. Without this support, many developed countries won't have the means to pursue a clean energy pathway and adapt to the warming that's already locked in. They also argue that they are entitled to this support given their pressing development needs and the fact that many in this large and diverse bloc are the least responsible for emissions and the least capable of adapting to a dangerously warmer world. The irony is that the lower the ambition and dynamism of the Paris agreement, the greater pressure major donor countries will face to scale up climate finance and other support to vulnerable countries for mitigation, adaptation and, increasingly, unavoidable loss and damage. If they don't pay now, they'll be called upon to pay a great deal more as time goes by. The French President of the conference, Laurent Fabius, has made it clear that he is committed to an orderly process of negotiations that respects the rules of procedure to avoid any derailments of the kind that plagued the Copenhagen negotiations. The negotiations in the second week of COP21 will be conducted in a single setting to ensure transparency for parties and observers, with smaller group negotiations over contentious issues reporting back on a regular basis. The conference President and his diplomatic team will have to draw on all of their skills and political capital, along with a little bit of wizardry, to orchestrate an acceptable text at the end of the week if an agreement is to be adopted by all 196 parties in the closing plenary.

South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has been criticised for taking a two-person camera crew to climate talks in Paris rather than a "10-buck" selfie stick. Mr Weatherill has been participating in HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-05/states-can-take-lead-over-climate-change,-jay-weatherill-says/7004114 negotiations and touting his government's commitment to carbon neutrality at the Paris talks . He has been accompanied by a two-person camera crew who have sent vision back for television stations in Adelaide, including the ABC. Opposition Leader Steven Marshall said it was a waste of money. "Jet-setting Jay is living the Hollywood dream, taking a movie crew with him over to Paris and to Europe at a time where, quite frankly, I think there's a lot better things for the South Australian Government to be spending money on," he said. "I would like to know how much we're spending on this trip - this vanity project for the Premier." Mr Marshall said he had his own budget solution to media on overseas trips. "I've got a hint for the Premier: get a selfie stick, 10 bucks," he said. "There's amazing technology on every single smartphone. "I've just come back from a trip looking at our opportunities in Japan. I did all of my own posts by myself on my phone, including layouts, headings, the entire thing." The Department of Premier and Cabinet confirmed a crew had accompanied Mr Weatherill and was shooting HYPERLINK /news/2015-12-01/bishop-defends-government-over-climate-change-talks/6989620 video at a number of locations including the HYPERLINK COP21 talks in Paris .

THE Australian Medical Association has called on the Federal Government to show leadership on tackling climate change. Releasing the revised AMA Position Statement on Climate Change and Human Health, which was previously published in 2008, AMA president Professor Brian Owler said the paper focused on the health impacts of climate change, and the need for Australia to plan for the major impacts. "It is the AMA's view that climate change is a significant worldwide threat to human health that requires urgent action, and that human activity has contributed to climate change," Prof Owler said. "The evidence is clear. We cannot sit back and do nothing. There are already significant health and social effects of climate change and extreme weather events, and these effects will worsen over time if we do not take action now. "The AMA believes that the Australian Government must show leadership on addressing climate change. "We are urging the government to go to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December in Paris with emission reduction targets that represent Australia's fair share of global greenhouse gas emissions." Prof Owler said the health effects of climate change included increased heat-related illness and deaths, more food and water-borne diseases, and changing patterns of diseases. \</doc>

The United Nations climate meeting in Paris from November 30 is possibly the last chance the world will have to create an international treaty to prevent dangerous climate change. Temperatures are a whole degree above the long-term average and scientists predict more warming unless the world acts to limit fossil fuel use and forest clearing. Climate change has the potential to affect all of humanity as well as countless plants and animals the world over. Here is everything you need to know about the Paris climate talks: Who's meeting? In 1992, a new global treaty was drawn up at a United Nations meeting in Rio de Janeiro to try to address climate change. It became known by the not-very-catchy name of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC. Since then countries which signed up to the convention (which is almost the whole world) have met regularly. This meeting in Paris is the 21st Conference of the Parties, making it COP21 . Much like any 21st, there will be many long, rambling speeches. Why are they meeting in Paris? The location for the COP moves around each year. In 1997 it was in Kyoto, where the famous Kyoto Protocol was written up. In 2009 it was in Copenhagen, a meeting which ended in anti-climax. It was decided two years ago in Warsaw that the 2015 COP21 meeting would be in Paris. Country representatives also have smaller meetings all throughout the year mostly in Bonn, Germany. Next year it will likely be held in Morocco. In 2017 COP23 will be held somewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. We hear Australia's lovely this time of year. What will they be doing? HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/adp2/eng/8infnot.pdf text has already been drafted and discussed, with points of contention marked in square brackets. Nations will make their cases for which of the square bracket options they think should stay. Countries will also discuss related matters such as forests and funding for poorer countries to deal with climate change. How does it work? The UNFCCC is an umbrella term for a whole family of committees, working groups, and assorted official bodies. In addition to the plenary session of official national delegations working on the treaty text, many of these other bodies will hold meetings at the Paris gathering. All of them are working towards the common goal of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to prevent climate change from getting out of hand. Trying to get 196 countries to agree to anything makes the process slow going. In 1997 the world signed the Kyoto Protocol which asked countries to limit their emissions but only developed countries needed to do any of the heavy lifting. It gained legal force when Russia ratified it in 2005. It's never been a trouble-free treaty. Some countries even walked away from it before it was due to expire in 2012. But in the absence of anything else, it's been extended to 2020. The real work of Paris is to come up with new text ultimately to replace the troubled Kyoto Protocol. Who will be in Paris? Who won't? Global leaders, presidents and prime ministers will lead delegations of diplomats and public servants. They will hash out the details of the new treaty text. Observer groups will be allowed to monitor the talks, staying alert to anything untoward and making helpful suggestions, if asked. In addition, lobby groups will stalk the halls trying to button-hole delegates with persuasive argument. Business people, attracted by the potential opportunities, fly in from all over. Despite their activities being curtailed by heightened terrorism concerns, protesters will find a way to make some colour and noise outside the conference hall. And the media, never one to miss a party, attend in their thousands. Why is this meeting important? Every new piece of climate research has scientists repeating more loudly their call for action to address climate change. As far back as 2006, economist Nicholas Stern pointed out that the sooner human-kind takes steps to deal with our greenhouse gas emissions, the easier and cheaper the steps will be. Meanwhile, our greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb. With the Kyoto Protocol in a holding pattern, the deadline was set for 2015 to come up with a replacement treaty. There is a growing sense that if this deadline is not met, the whole UNFCCC process may be irretrievably lost. What's expected? No-one is expecting miracles. The world will not walk away from Paris with a legally binding international treaty that will limit global warming to under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Unlike in Kyoto, countries are not negotiating greenhouse gas targets; they've already nominated their own targets. Instead, they are negotiating the treaty that will hold them to their targets. Knowing this in advance will help countries understand what they are being asked to sign. In 2014 the two biggest emitters, China and the US, agreed their greenhouse targets. The US is aiming for a reduction of at least 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. China is hoping to max out emissions before 2030. Commentators believe that this was the key to put the world in a mood to agree. There's a sense that a new treaty will emerge at Paris and it will be OK, but it won't be enough to stop climate change in its tracks. In the years ahead, countries will need to continuously update and improve their ambition. Still, most COP-watchers are considerably more optimistic than in previous years. I stopped reading. Give me the short version. Nations of the world are meeting in Paris to discuss the wording of an international treaty to try to prevent climate change getting out of hand. The mood seems to be quite positive. \</doc>

When Malcolm Turnbull sits down with Indonesian President Joko Widodo to "reset" Australia's relations with Indonesia after the troubled Tony Abbott period, Australians will begin to get a series of snapshots of a more-nuanced - and expansive - foreign policy. We can be fairly sure Turnbull will not be undertaking to "shirt-front" Vladimir Putin, or describe Japan as Australia's "best friend" in Asia. In the next four weeks an Australian leader will embark on a merry-go-round of international engagements that will take him to Jakarta (Nov 12), Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel (Nov 13-14), Antalya in Turkey for the G20 leaders' summit (Nov 15-16), and back to the region for an APEC summit in Manila (Nov 18-19) and on to the East Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur (Nov 22). Turnbull will come back to Australia briefly before going to Malta for a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Nov 27-29), and then to Paris on November 30 for the Leaders' meeting of the United Nations climate change conference known as COP21 . Turnbull strategists are leaving open the possibility of whether he goes to Paris or not. But it would be surprising if he stayed away from an event that ranks with the Kyoto Protocol as a signature moment in efforts to prevent the planet warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius, on pre-industrial levels, by the end of this century. With an agreement among participants representing the developed and developing world looking increasingly likely, it would make no sense for the representative of the world's largest per capita emitter to stay away. Insufficient to go beyond minimum obligations HYPERLINK in which he rightly points out that direct action is policy making "on the cheap" and will be insufficient to meet Australia's obligations beyond the bare minimum. Whatever Turnbull might say about existing policy to avoid unpleasantness with those on the right waiting to pounce, you can be sure he will edge towards a more comprehensive solution when the time is right. His planned travel schedule represents an extraordinary quota of rushing about, and might invite questions about whether Turnbull is neglecting the home front, but at a time of global turmoil it would be hard to argue against such engagement. Not least of the advantages will be an opportunity for a new prime minister to gauge global economic challenges in conversations with leaders of the industrialised world. In his travels, Turnbull will engage US President Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Merkel, Russian President Vladimir, Japan's Abe, France's Hollande, and Britain's Cameron, among others, over a period of three or four weeks at separate gatherings. This will amount to a process of force-feeding for a new Australian leader that is fortuitous - and unprecedented. Turnbull needs to make the most of these opportunities to reset Australian foreign policy in his own way separate from the heavy duty emphasis of his predecessor on national security. Reading Turnbull's foreign policy speeches during his time as opposition leaders - and in his six years of exile - gives encouragement to the belief he has thought a great deal about Australia's place in the world. As Andrew Carr of The University of Melbourne points out, the new Prime Minister is fond of quoting Thucydides, a general and a chronicler, whose Melian dialogue is a classic description of power relationships. Let's take him at his word. Tony Walker is the AFR's International Editor \</doc>

Yogesh Punja used a mock climate change summit for high school students in Canberra on Wednesday to urge countries attending the global summit to "please save" Pacific Islands facing rising seawaters that threaten to inundate their homes. Mr Punja said his country wanted a global target of maintaining a rise in temperatures below 2 degrees to be revised down to 1.5 degrees. He described island nations like Fiji as a "canary in a cage" for a warming climate. "We have had a number of simulations done to show what will happen to the planet if the temperature went up by 1.5 degrees," he said. "If we only [aim for] 2 degrees, it becomes critical. I think by 2 degrees many of the Pacific nations will disappear. "Our message to COP21 is look out, we may disappear - please save us." "You have to see through your own eyes how desperate these people are,' he said. Mr Punja was among a number of delegates talking to 70 Canberra high school students as part of the Young Leaders Climate Conference at Telopea Park School. The panel discussion included representatives from the European Union, the United States, China, France and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Aside from listening and asking questions of the panel, the group of teenagers discussed climate change and renewable energy and held their own mock summit, representing some of the major players heading to the Paris negotiations. European Union ambassador to Australia Sem Fabrizi said he was impressed by the students' enthusiasm and their knowledge of the complexities of climate change. "The future belongs to them and I think the students today are very aware of it," he said. "There's an inter-generational duty to lead the next generation to a better place. The students have clear understanding that climate change ... isn't something vague, isn't something remote, isn't something that doesn't affect them." Mr Fabrizi said the European Union had set a "very ambitious commitment" to climate action ahead of the Paris summit from November 30 - including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent between 2020 and 2030 - and hoped other countries would show similar ambition. He said announcements, HYPERLINK http://www.canberratimes.com.au/environment/un-climate-conference/paris-2015-china-adopts-a-drastically-different-stance-on-climate-change-20151103-gkp70f.html?skin=text-only such as France and China's proposal to revisit the progress of any global climate pact every five years , helped create "the right political climate" for a successful summit. Asked if Australia was doing enough to tackle climate change, Mr Fabriz said our country was "very much engaged in Paris, working very closely with us and sharing our own commitment to make Paris a successful outcome". "It is a collective exercise and we have to ensure the agreement is applicable to all". While Wednesday's students fell just short of negotiating a 2 per cent target among themselves, Canberra College student Egshiglen Chuluunhuu??? said the event had changed her view of climate change. "It's kind of unnerving because we're going to be living in the world they [world leaders] are making decisions for. I think events like this really ease that worry because it empowers us and tells us that we do have a voice and we do have the power to influence these major decision-makers," the 16-year-old said. "The example Australia sets is going to be really important for all of the nations around it - countries in the Pacific will all look to Australia." UN Youth ACT president Claire Paton said Wednesday's event empowered younger Australians to engage in what could be a complex topic. "Young people are really idealistic and that's one of the best things about young people, they go for the hardest option because that's the one they see as going to be more effective long-term," she said. "I think a lot of people don't look at the younger generation as being engaged or understanding issues. A lot of them are passionate about taking a stand on climate change." \</doc>

ABSTRACT Paris' climate conference, COP21 , has attracted an unprecedented level of media attention. Freelance journalist Nardine Groch is there to capture all the action. I enter the media centre around 7am, disappointed at having missed a photo of Malcolm Turnbull posed next to the Australian flag. "I would mark that spot while you can," a journalist next to me says as I dive for an empty bench.\~"Trust me, the wi-fi upstairs is shit." She is a Dutch foreign correspondent who doesn't\~seem keen on her assignment. "Are you a COP virgin?" she asks, looking up from an email she's sending.\~"Try not to freak out, these world leader days are always like this, don't expect to sleep much." We exchange details, but with 3700 other journalists bustling around, I don't expect to see her again. I have just arrived for my first day as an accredited journalist at the biggest climate change conference\~the world has ever seen. It is the 21st\~time the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties will meet to try to\~reach an international binding agreement to tackle global climate change. Located outside of Paris near the Le\~Bourget airport, the official "Blue Zone" accommodates just over 36,000 accredited participants from 198 countries and is set within a redesigned old airplane hanger with chipboard dividers and colourful animal cutouts parading the halls. A red Eiffel Tower mock-up stands at the far end of the central corridor, marking a meeting place for interviews and peaceful demonstrations while 10,000 croissants prepared by chefs every day serve as a reminder that we are\~still in Paris. The UNFCCC\~says the media attention at this year's COP is "unprecedented", with more than half of those who asked for media\~accreditation\~turned away. "I laughed when I got the email announcing they had to cut off people's accreditations for this COP," a journalist from Antigua in the Caribbean tells me.\~"I must have sent out over 200 letters just to get funding, which annoyed me because it is such an important issue, but just look at the size of some of the news teams that are here." Journalists from as far afield as Tunisia, Russia, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Samoa have all been accredited this year.\~One of the largest newspapers in Bangladesh has sent its\~entire team to cover the conference. Kawser Rahman from The Daily Janakantha \~explains why the conference is so important to his audience:\~"This climate change conference is so important for Bangladesh. If sea levels rise by even a metre, it is predicted that one-third of Bangladesh will be under water and more than 400 million people will be displaced. "COPs before did not work, but there are signs that this one could. China and the US have already made commitments, and even Russia is now interested in signing a deal to reduce carbon." Fellow Australian and The Conversation 's climate change writer, David Holmes, is also attending his first COP and admits that he is finding it hard to navigate. "You know this is the biggest newsroom in the world at the moment," he tells me. The constant turnover of journalists in and out of the 260 online workspaces somehow seems to work seamlessly over the 24 hours of newsroom operation. On world leaders day, I am pelted with over 40 different invites to unscheduled panels and press conferences as well countless side events on key climate-related issues, of which there are many. I track down journalist Adam Ramsay from UK online publication Open Democracy ; he enlightens me about the number of accredited fossil fuel and oil corporate sponsors that\~are occupying key space around the conference site. He has spent most of his two weeks chasing down climate change sceptics and fossil fuel and oil giants, who are here to have an influence over the negotiations. "I put my best suit and tie on and went along to this elite club in Paris the other night and there were senior US politicians there as well as all of the corporate lobbyists, drinking together, chatting, discussing what they are going to do next," he says. "So you have the formal proceedings but the real business of any conference does not happen in the formal proceedings but on the fringes, in the most expensive bars and cafes around Paris, what really matters is the decisions that has been made before anyone gets into the room." \</doc>

Hopes are not high for a political agreement when world leaders meet for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris. But Tim Jarvis hopes scaling the peaks of three mountains during the 12-day meeting will influence the outcome of the talks. "I want to highlight the fact that human-induced climate change is a massive problem and we want a meaningful outcome . . . i.e. an internationally legally binding agreement with teeth," he says. A polar explorer and the Australian Museum's inaugural trailblazer-in-residence, Jarvis will lead expeditions to the 4884-metre Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, 5109-metre Mount Stanley in Uganda and 6268-metre Chimborazo in Ecuador as part of 25zero. The peaks are three of the 25 mountains with glaciers at the equator. Six will be climbed by mountaineers during the Paris climate change talks that begin on November 30. Other 25zero climbers include Peter Holmes a Court and leading women mountaineers Heidi Sand and Vanessa O'Brien. The 25zero mountaineers plan to send images and commentary from the mountains, the glaciers of which are predicted to disappear within 25 years, in an effort to persuade politicians to take action on climate change. \</doc>

PARIS: Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes the latest version of a global agreement on climate change is 80 per cent there but warns there's still key issues to sort out. The fourth iteration of the United Nations climate change conference draft agreement was revealed yesterday morning, having been chopped from 29 pages to 27. Ms Bishop said negotiations were at a delicate stage. The foreign minister will make a number of interventions in the next stage of negotiations, which are expected to run throughout the night. "I suspect it's going to be a very long night," she said. However, Ms Bishop remains hopeful she'll walk away from the talks with a deal. Negotiators from 196 parties are hoping to seal a climate deal to curb emissions and limit global warming to 2C. Australia wants five yearly reviews, a transparent measuring process and for all countries to contribute to climate action. However, the foreign minister said the draft's different requirements for developed and developing countries were confusing. Oxfam Australia was pleased the draft contained a requirement for quantified funding goals for poorer countries. However, executive director Helen Szoke said it was "extremely disappointing" that references to human rights had dropped out of the text. Ms Bishop won't point fingers at countries, saying there remained a lot of goodwill around the table."Overall people don't want this to be another Copenhagen," she said., referring to the failed climate talks six years ago. \</doc>

OUR SAY LESLEY APPS Journalist PARIS is in the headlines again, for the right reason this time as the destination for the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference . As world leaders gather to ponder, argue and offer another round of empty promises (c'mon, there's lots of money at stake), the rest of us hold out hope they will actually be serious about reducing the crap - sorry, emissions - being thrust into the atmosphere at an alarming rate and stop producing products that will outlive the planet on which they were created. In perfect climate conference world they would come out of there skipping and trumpeting that all countries would be united in making serious changes to legislation to ensure we have a future powered by sustainable means in the next five years. And don't worry about the money, there's squillions to be made in green power too, for those worried about their fossil fuel fortunes. As they said in TV land in the 1970s when building the first Bionic Man, "we have the technology", so let's just do it. And while on retro television, the climate change argument is starting to feel like an episode of The Flintstones, given our caveman attitudes towards power supply and production. At least that cartoon got it right in some regards - foot-powered cars and machinery operated by obliging animals would have kept our emissions down. \</doc>

Chief executives from 10 of the world's largest oil companies, accounting for 20 per cent of global oil production, on Friday declared their support for efforts to address climate change.\~ The members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which includes Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Total SA\~said they support the "general ambition to limit global average temperature to 2 degrees centigrade and that the existing trend of the world's new global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with this ambition."\~ The CEOs of those firms, as well as of BG PLC, Eni S.p.A, Statoil ASA, Reliance Industries Ltd, Petr\'f3leos Mexicanos SA and Repsol SA, met in Paris to lay out their agenda ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris from November\~30.\~ The 10 companies said they will continue efforts to help lower global emissions, but said that "neither our contributions nor those of any one industrial sector alone will be enough to address the challenge of climate change."\~ Meeting growing energy demand with lower emissions "is likely to be more complex, at least in the short term," the group said. "Investment in gas, renewables and lower greenhouse gas technologies like carbon capture and storage today will contribute greatly to reducing the cost and impact of climate change for future generations."\~ \</doc>

THE coal industry was facing an "increasingly militant anti-mining, anti-coal campaign", Glencore coal executive Peter Freyberg said on Wednesday. But this campaign was flawed, he said, because it "fundamentally ignores the global energy reality and the resources required for economic growth and development". Mr Freyberg described one aspect of the anti-coal campaign - Newcastle City Council's recent decision on coal disinvestment - as "bizarre". "I think my views on this are obvious when you consider this city has been built on coal and continues to do very nicely from it," Mr Freyberg said. "We'd encourage the council to work with the industry on the basis of the global energy reality. "By taking a constructive role, you can influence better use of - and achieve lower emissions from - the product that has played a key role in your city's past and will play a key role in your city's future." He said India would be a major driver of coal consumption. He said the United Nations climate change conference in Paris later this year needed to acknowledge that "fossil fuels including coal will continue to be used". "We support a pragmatic and practical global approach that supports the least cost and logical transition to lowering global emissions," Mr Freyberg said. \</doc>

Governments have won or lost power on its approach to this divisive issue and once again, it looms as a decisive element in the next election. Here in Central Queensland the issue is as hot as anywhere else in the country. Today the LNP's Member for Capricornia Michelle Landry and Labor's candidate for the upcoming election Lisa Neaton have outlined their thoughts on climate change. Not surprisingly they are poles apart in their approach and accuse the other party's policy of being irresponsible. There is a responsibility on us all to have a position on climate change and act accordingly. Like everyone I worry about the potential loss of jobs and the impact this has on our region's future. But, I also worry about the future of this wonderful region if climate change is not adequately addressed and it's becoming increasingly evident that we all have to look to the future rather than the past. As the world prepares for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris towards the end of the year, it's clear we're no closer to a political consensus in Australia.

But Peter Holmes a Court is concerned with far greater issues than winning another rugby league premiership. "The impact of climate change to the world today and the world our children will inherit cannot be underestimated or perhaps even known," he says. Holmes a Court is speaking from Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo - a region devastated by two decades of genocide and war - after a training trek up the 3,740-metre Nyiragongo??? Volcano with wife Alissa Everett. Two years after rebels were driven out of the city and despite the "wet blanket" of international aid organisations, the streets of Goma are vibrant and "relatively safe to walk," he says. "The people are gracious and welcoming and the environment, which has Nyiragongo Volcano towering over the town, is spectacular." Holmes a Court also praises Goma's high-quality pastries and fantastic coffee - one of the few positive legacies of its colonial past. The six-hour ascent took the couple through forest populated by antelope and chimpanzees, across volcanic scree and to the lip of the crater, which radiated heat, sulphur and steam.

"When I am not wrestling with my writer's self doubt, I am making good progress." Holmes a Court and Everett will begin climbing Mt Kilimanjaro on December 3 and aim to reach the summit six days later. "The Kili climb is not the hardest climb," he says. "The altitude is substantial. However, the biggest job is operating heavy equipment - Alissa's challenge [is] with her cameras - and writing my challenge - when your brain is oxygen-starved." He adds: "Ours is a small act in a much bigger climbing initiative that is itself just a small part of ensuring success in Paris." \</doc>

A DARWIN Reverend is en route to Paris to join a conversation about climate change. Reverend Keith Joseph, the Dean of Darwin's Christ Church Cathedral, will attend a side event of the United - Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, called Place 2 B, to discuss rising sea levels. "It should be an interesting exchange of ideas," Mr Joseph said. Climate change became a passion when he lived in the Solomon Islands for six years. He said the islands, near Papua New Guinea, were at major risk of rising sea levels. "I could see the damage being done in front of my eyes in the Solomon Islands." The conference will also provide him the opportunity to highlight rising sea-level risks to the Northern Territory. "Given the NT has low-lying areas, we're also at (greater) risk than most other places in Australia," he said. "I'll be raising not only the plight of Solomon Islands but also the place where I live and love - Darwin. "But I probably won't be saying anything about -crocodiles." He will be among about 40,000 representatives in Paris until December 11. More than 400 will attend Place 2 B, -focusing on spirituality, art and the environment. Mr Joseph hopes he can change climate-change views."Too often we think of it as environment versus economy, but in fact the environment and the economy are one ... if the environment is buggered then the economy is also buggered," he said. \</doc>

Global perspective Malcolm Turnbull spent his time in exile developing a nuanced foreign policy. In the next few weeks, he will get the chance to try it out on most major Western leaders. When Malcolm Turnbull sits down with Indonesian President Joko Widodo in the middle of this coming week to "reset" Australia's relations with Indonesia after the troubled Tony Abbott period, Australians will begin to get a series of snapshots of a more nuanced - and expansive - foreign policy. We can be fairly sure Turnbull will not be undertaking to "shirt-front" Vladimir Putin, or describe Japan as Australia's "best friend" in Asia. In the next four weeks an Australian leader will embark on a merry-go-round of international engagements that will take him to Jakarta (Nov 12), Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel (Nov 13-14), Antalya in Turkey for the G20 leaders' summit (Nov 15-16), and back to the region for an APEC summit in Manila (Nov 18-19) and on to the East Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur (Nov 22). Turnbull will come back to Australia briefly before going to Malta for a Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Nov 27-29), and then to Paris on November 30 for the leaders' meeting at the United Nations climate change conference known as COP21 . Turnbull strategists are leaving open the possibility of whether he goes to Paris or not. But it would be surprising if he stayed away from an event that ranks with the Kyoto Protocol as a signature moment in efforts to prevent the planet warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius, on pre-industrial levels, by the end of this century. With an agreement among participants representing the developed and developing world looking increasingly likely, it would make no sense for the representative of the world's largest per capita emitter to stay away. Readers might reference a useful commentary this past week by my colleague Alan Mitchell - Turnbull must tread carefully on climate change policy transition - in which he rightly points out that direct action is policy making "on the cheap" and will be insufficient to meet Australia's obligations beyond the bare minimum. Whatever Turnbull might say about existing policy to avoid unpleasantness with those on the right who are waiting to pounce, you can be sure he will edge towards a more comprehensive solution when the time is right. Not least of the advantages will be an opportunity for a new prime minister to gauge global economic challenges in conversations with leaders of the industrialised world. In his travels Turnbull will engage America's Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Germany's Merkel, Russia's Putin, Japan's Abe, France's Hollande, and Britain's Cameron, among others, over a period of three or four weeks at separate gatherings. This will amount to a process of force-feeding for a new Australian leader that is fortuitous - and unprecedented. Turnbull needs to make the most of these opportunities to reset Australian foreign policy in his own way separate from the heavy duty emphasis of his predecessor on national security. Reading Turnbull's foreign policy speeches during his time as opposition leaders - and in his six years of exile - gives encouragement to the belief he has thought a great deal about Australia's place in the world. As Andrew Carr of The University of Melbourne points out, the new Prime Minister is fond of quoting Thucydides, a general and a chronicler, whose Melian dialogue is a classic description of power relationships. Let's take him at his word. \</doc>

\~\~Tony Abbott faces pressure within the Liberal Party not to sign a new climate agreement at a Paris summit later this year. \~\~ One of the motions being put forward for the Liberal federal council meeting this weekend in Melbourne calls on the government not to sign "any binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year". \~\~ The party's regional and rural committee says the science around climate change is "uncertain" and requires a parliamentary inquiry. \~\~ It's yet to be confirmed whether Mr Abbott will attend the Paris summit or send ministers. \~\~ But the party's controversial honorary treasurer Philip Higginson will lose his job. \~\~ Mr Higginson earlier this year said it was a conflict of interest for the prime minister's chief of staff to be married to the party's federal director. \~\~ Another controversial executive member, vice president Tom Harley, will also step aside to be replaced by ex-MP Bruce Baird. \</doc>

COUNCILS should stick to looking after roads, rates and rubbish and keep out of world affairs, Victoria's leading ratepayers association says. Ratepayers Victoria president Jack Davis said he had been flabbergasted to learn of foreign meddling by the City of Ballarat and the Mornington Peninsula Shire. Ballarat is preparing to fly two councillors and a council officer to Austria in June for the 15th World League of Historical Cities conference, at an estimated cost of $45,000-$56,000. While in Europe, mayor Des Hudson will also visit Finland to investigate waste-to-energy facilities. Ballarat is one of the councils looking to lift rates above a statewide cap set at the level of the Consumer Price Index. Also, Mornington mayor Graham Pittock and councillor Hugh Fraser were with Environment Minister Greg Hunt in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference . "Local councils should not be getting involved in world affairs," Mr Davis said. "They need to concentrate on local affairs first. Councillors were not elected to prance around on the world stage - they were elected to represent local people. "These issues have nothing to do with local government and I don't believe they offer any benefits to ratepayers. "I think some of these councillors just see it as a free trip overseas, with the reason for going coming second." Cr Hudson said Ballarat, which joined the league in 1999, was one of seven voting board members and it was important that it be represented. "There are much broader roles to councils these days than just looking after roads, rates and rubbish," he said. "It's all about growing the market."

TAMWORTH residents will join thousands of people worldwide when they gather at Bicentennial Park on Sunday for a global climate rally. The Tamworth rally will call for ambitious carbon emission reduction targets, demand support for renewable energy and show support for Liverpool Plains farmers who are battling coal mines. The event is part of a global movement, with local, national and international organisations taking to streets and parks in more than 150 countries on November 29. Event organiser Robin Gunning said the event would take place on the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, and aimed to deliver a resounding public call to world leaders to take urgent and ambitious action when they meet. "The Global Climate March is snowballing into a massive mobilisation of millions around the world who want leaders to do more to stop runaway climate change," Dr Gunning said. "Tamworth residents are taking part to show local concern that climate talks deliver a deal that will avert climate catastrophe and move the world to a new green economy with 100 per cent clean energy." New England Climate Action Group member Emma Stilts said all concerned residents were invited to the rally, which will start at noon, to show their "determined opposition" to mining activities. "This event is an opportunity for local people to voice their opposition on local fossil fuel projects like the Shenhua Coal mine and CSG fields in the Pilliga that only add to the global problem of climate change," Ms Stilts said. "What we are saying in New England is 'no new coal' but are (New England MP) Barnaby Joyce or his National colleagues listening?" \</doc>

A deal to restrict government financing for inefficient coal-fired power plants has been struck less than two weeks out from major global climate talks in Paris. After two years of negotiations, the OECD reached a historic agreement to pare back export credits for coal plants with high carbon emissions to help combat climate change. The world's richest countries will no longer provide finance support for large coal-fired plants that don't employ the most efficient technology but will still hand over credits for smaller inefficient plants in developing countries. That was a main sticking point for Australia which negotiated the exemption for countries, such as India, where at least 90 per cent of their population didn't have access to electricity. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said about one billion people would still need access to electricity and coal would play a vital role. "Coal is still a major part of the energy mix," he told ABC radio on Thursday. "Coal is not going away." The goal is to encourage coal exporters and buyers to transition away from low-efficiency technology to reduce emissions. High-quality coal, like that produced in Australia, would bring down emissions, he said. Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the new rules struck the "right balance" between cutting emissions and ensuring access to adequate power supplies to support development. World leaders head to Paris in just over a week for the United Nations climate change conference , where it's hoped 196 countries will strike a deal to limit global warming. \</doc>

A BAILAI elder was among more than 100 protesters who staged a "~sit-in' at parliament house in Canberra, calling on the Turnbull government to do more on climate change. Mabel YowYeh Quakawoot spoke passionately about the need to protect Australia, saying it was time for politicians to put the people "ahead of the big polluters". "I've seen the devastation that fossil fuels caused in my home of Gladstone," Mabel YowYeh Quakawoot said. "We need to stand together to protect our country from dangerous climate change and make sure the same mistakes at Gladstone aren't repeated in other communities." The peaceful protest came to a head with Australian Federal Police and parliamentary security staff called in to remove the protesters after about half an hour. Protestors chanted "we will not be moved" as police removed them one by one from parliament's Marble Foyer. Among those protesting were farmers, environmentalists and indigenous traditional owners urging more be done to prevent climate change. Fairfax reported Aunty Mabel was the last to be removed as the demonstrators reformed outside the parliament. It came as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull returned from the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. He confirmed the government's current carbon emissions reduction target of 26-28% by 2030, but did not promise a larger target. Website "~The People's Parliament' helped organised the protest and has warned this "is just the beginning". "In 2016, people everywhere will continue to take action like this until our politicians do what is right. With a Federal Election around the corner, they ignore us at their peril," it states on their website. \</doc>

\~\~Developing countries could lose $1.7 trillion annually by 2050 if global warming is allowed to increase to three degrees, a new report has found. \~\~ It comes as 196 countries prepare to head to Paris for the United Nations climate change conference , where it's hoped a global agreement to curb emissions will be reached. \~\~ Current pledges by individual countries would halt warming at around 2.7 degrees but Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says that's not good enough. \~\~ "World leaders need to step up," Dr Szoke said. \~\~ The federal government last year pledged $200 million to the Green Climate Fund, but directed the cash from the foreign aid budget. \~\~ Oxfam believes negotiations in Paris will come down to whether there is enough climate finance for poorer nations and whether the deal will limit warming enough. \~\~ Oxfam also wants a five-year review process to strengthen targets from 2020, something the federal government has also proposed at global negotiations. \</doc>

ENVIRONMENTALLY Concerned Citizens of Orange (ECCO) will host a public meeting tonight on climate change policies, as part of November's focus on climate action in the lead-up to next week's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Featuring guest speakers in Charles Sturt University Orange's Professor Kevin Parton and CSIRO's Ben Harmon and Peter Brown, the meeting will focus on the impact climate change policies will have on Australia as a whole. "The issue of climate change is very complex and open to misinformation. In that regard, it's important to have speakers like this because they have the expertise in the field to do so," ECCO president Nick King said. "It's all in conjunction with a new group called Futuring Orange, who we're very excited to work with." Professor Parton's presentation focuses on the comparable costs to the economy of various climate change policies, and also concentrates on likely future scenarios in Australia, including the political pressure for all parties to adopt an emissions trading scheme - expected to be international standard following the Paris summit. Mr Harmon and Dr Brown are working on a project in Orange looking at how information around climate adaption strategies is being accessed, and will continue that at tonight's meeting. The meeting kicks off at 7.30pm at the Community Information Centre in Kite Street. Everyone is welcome to attend. \</doc>

AUSTRALIA and New Zealand are expected to cop a behind-the-scenes walloping from Pacific Island leaders disappointed they are not doing more to combat climate change. The issue will likely dominate this week's Pacific Island Forum leaders summit in Port Moresby, ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Pacific leaders want the world to work on restricting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, fearing the two-degree target will threaten many islands' survival. Natural disaster recovery will be fresh on their minds. The summit starts on Monday, six months after Cyclone Pam, which flattened much of Vanuatu and caused heavy flooding on Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has said El Nino conditions have been exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who is boycotting the summit and will instead send along his foreign minister, had a crack at Prime Minister Tony Abbott at last week's meeting of his rival club of Pacific leaders - the Pacific Islands Development Forum, which excludes Australia. He urged Mr Abbott to abandon the "coalition of the selfish" and put the welfare of small Pacific island neighbours ahead of coal industry interests. The Abbott government's target of cutting carbon emissions on 2005 levels by 26-28 per cent by 2030 has been criticised for lacking ambition. New Zealand's target is a cut of 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The summit, from September 7-11, is expected to sign off on a joint disaster management strategy for the Pacific. AAP \</doc>

A day before delegates arrived at the World Gas Conference in Paris on Tuesday the chief executive of French energy group Total, Patrick Pouyanne, summed up the event in just four words: "the enemy is coal". Unlike many industry conferences comprising CEO-delivered PowerPoint presentations pitched at the investment community, the WGC prides itself as forum for the discussion of the broader issues facing the sector . "Our industry has historically been too timid to address the shortcomings of coal, but now it's time for us to stand up and we need to stand united," Woodside chief Peter Coleman said. The timing of the aggressive attacks on coal is no accident. In just over six months more than 200 nations will attend a United Nations climate change conference The big European producers underlined a more active role in the climate debate by also sending a joint letter to the UN last week supporting a global pricing system for carbon. Such a system would just happen to push up the cost of burning coal, which remains the cheapest fuel for electricity generation. JAMES CHESSELL \</doc>

Mr Turnbull, who was accompanied by his wife Lucy, as well as New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his wife Bronagh, placed bunches of flowers outside the theatre in memory of the victims. Mr Turnbull spoke in French before telling journalists: "We are here, the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister and our wives and we are here offering the people of France, the people of Paris, our most heartfelt condolences and our unflinching solidarity in the face of this terrorism. "We are all together. We are with France, we are with the people of Paris, we are with all people committed to freedom in this battle against terrorism, against violence, against violent extremism." The Bataclan remains closed and heavily guarded by large numbers of armed police with the pavements outside covered in candles, flowers and message of condolence for the victims. "New Zealand and Australia are two countries that are almost furtherest away from France, at a time of such sadness and heartache for the people of France we have never been closer together," Mr Key said. "We come at this time to pay our respects to those that lost their lives, to their families, and to show support and solidarity for the people of France. "The city of Paris has gone through a great deal with the terrible issues earlier in the year with Charlie Hebdo and now with the latest terrorist attacks, but in the end the spirit of the French people will rise about above the terrible actions of ISIL and the forces that they believe in and France will be strong." Mr Turnbull had planned to place flowers at la place de la Republique - a central square that became a popular meeting place after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January - but violent exchanges between police and a group of climate activists involving tear gas restricted movement around parts of the city already crawling with security forces. Hundreds of heavily armed riot police sealed off the square on Sunday afternoon after being pelted with bottles and other projectiles. Police used tear gas to clear the area and arrested around 100 people during the exchange, according to an estimate from media agency AP. The square was still sealed off in the early evening, guarded by riot police standing five deep.

Reports suggest the riots were sparked by a small anarchist group with some chanting: "State of emergency, police state, you will not deprive us of our right to demonstrate." Large "Day of Action" marches in other European capitals including London and Madrid took place without serous incident. Security forces are on high alert for more attacks during the two-week conference with more than 120,000 police, gendarmes and military officers deployed across France. Large numbers of armed officers, including pairs on most bridges, are visible along the roads from the capital's main airports. The vast Le Bourget conference facility was also crawling with armed police as many of the 40,000 diplomats, journalist, officials and activists expected to attend turned up to register on Saturday. Mr Turnbull will join more than 140 other world leaders including US President Barack Obama and China's Xi Jinping for the opening of the conference on Monday at the Le Bourget site in the city's north. The UN has been pushing for an agreement to cut greenhouse emissions that would cap temperature rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels - a threshold most scientists regard as safe. However, UN analysis of more than 160 national carbon reduction pledges made in the lead up to Paris shows they should instead keep temperature rises to 2.7C-3C. Mr Turnbull, who flew in to Paris from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta, HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/french-give-ground-to-us-on-paris-un-climate-negotiations-20151129-glatjg signalled he will put innovation in environmentally-friendly technologies at the heart of his pitch to world leaders on Monday. He has described Labor's plan to substantially increase Australia's pledge to cut carbon emissions by 26-28 per cent from 2005 levels over the next 15 years as "a heroic offer" that would be prohibitively expensive. It is understood Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's plans to lay a wreath in Paris have also been disrupted by the tight security. Mr Shorten is also attending on Monday. with The Telegraph \</doc>

IT HAS been one of the quietest cyclone seasons in Queensland for half a century - but the threat's not over. The state has reached autumn for the second year running without any serious storms menacing the north. However, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned that a winter cyclone is still a possibility with warmer sea temperatures persisting beyond the traditional November to April season. Bureau spokesman Jess Carey said Tropical Cyclone Raquel created a precedent when it formed in the southwest Pacific near the Solomon Islands on July 1 last year. It was the latest or earliest cyclone recorded in the state's history, depending which way you looked at it. "That is the first time we have tracked a cyclone developing in July since we began using satellite tracking equipment in the early 1970s," he said. With warm seas and a disintegrating El Nino in the mix, another winter cyclone was not entirely out of the question, Mr Carey said. Australia has entered autumn after one of the quietest openings to the cyclone season on record with "Stan" marking the first of the 2015-16 season, crossing the West Australian coast on the last day of January three months after the official cyclone season began. Queensland's first was not until February 11 when Tatiana was named. While north Queensland communities have copped heavy rainfall in the fallout from Cyclone Winston, history shows March and April regularly produce cyclones. State Environment Minister Steven Miles said clear warming seas, the basis of cyclones, stored much of the energy associated with global warming. Dr Miles, who participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December, said Kevin Trenberth from the UN National Centre for Atmospheric Research recently reaffirmed the connection between global warming and the intensity of weather events."Queensland's communities, economy and ecosystems, including the Great Barrier Reef, are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts," Dr Miles said. \</doc>

A LITTLE bit of Byron Bay will be shown off in Paris this week when Byron Shire mayor Cr Simon Richardson shares the council's experiences at the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Cr Richardson was invited to promote the shire's Zero Emissions Byron project at the United Nations Framework convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. "Whatever target countries sign up to in Paris, even if it's lower than it should be, it will give security and confidence to regions, councils and companies and they will take that security and far outstrip that target," Cr Richardson said. "I'll be involved in the Cities and Regions conference where representatives from around the world will be showcasing what we're doing and learning from each other." Byron Shire is aiming to become Australia's first council to generate zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 through an ambitious project called Zero Emissions Byron (ZEB), a joint initiative of Byron Shire Council, climate research organisation Beyond Zero Emissions, partnered with the Queensland Centre for Social Change. "When facing the low carbon future ahead of us, we have two choices: ride the wave and make Byron economically, socially and environmentally sustainable and an inspiring model, or tread water in the foam out the back of the wave and hope we don't get left behind," Cr Richardson said. "This project has the potential to secure millions of dollars of renewable energy and emission reduction investment, to secure and enhance the rich biodiversity of the region and support local communities establish co-operative models of living. "Re-navigating our economy to one powered by locally or regionally generated renewable energy with zero net emissions will create jobs, establish sustainable economies and ensure our society lives in balance with its environment." \</doc>

Allianz is the latest big company turning its back on coal, with the German financial services giant vowing to offload significant coal holdings within six months. On Tuesday morning, it was revealed Allianz chairman Oliver Bate was one of HYPERLINK https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/11/open-letter-from-ceos-to-world-leaders-urging-climate-action/ 78 corporate leaders to sign a letter urging nations to strike a bold and ambitious pact to combat climate change at the United Nations climate conference in Paris . He was joined on the list by the bosses of major companies such as Siemens, Dow Chemical, Jindal Steel and Power, Nestle and Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt, who is executive chairman of packaging company Visy Industries. But Allianz reportedly went further than the group letter, with HYPERLINK http://www.zdf.de/frontal-21/allianz-ausstieg-aus-der-kohle-41104912.html German broadcaster ZDF quoting Allianz chief investment officer Andreas Gruber as vowing to shift investments out of coal and into renewables. "We will no longer invest in mining companies and utilities that generate more than 30 per cent of their sales or energy creation from coal," Mr Gruber was quoted as saying. According to reports by Reuters, the change will be conducted over a six-month period and will see investment in wind doubled to 4 billion euros. The Australian division of Allianz did not return calls on Tuesday and there was no announcement about changes to coal investments on Allianz's global website. The comments come as Allianz, which has almost ???2 trillion ($2.95 trillion) under management, prepares to hold a major investor day in Munich on Wednesday morning Australian time. The United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris begins on November 30 and runs until December 11. Charlie Wood from advocacy group 350.org welcomed Allianz's stance. "This move is another clear sign that major investors are aware of the threats that fossil fuel investments pose to their bottom line and are increasingly refusing to take that risk," he said in a statement. \</doc>

\~\~ However, his prime ministerial weight is yet to be requested by the Australian delegation in Paris despite major hurdles in the draft agreement. \~\~ World leaders attended the opening of the United Nations climate change conference almost two weeks ago, but most have since left. \~\~ US President Barack Obama recently called India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the talks, during which both leaders reconfirmed their commitment to a strong agreement. \~\~ It's understood Mr Turnbull would also be willing to phone leaders he knows well if hosts France think his intervention would be useful. \~\~ There are doubts about the Friday night deadline, which conference president Laurent Fabius admits is extremely close. \~\~ Mr Fabius wants to release the final draft on Friday local time. \~\~ The delegation wants five-yearly reviews, a transparent measuring process, and for all countries to contribute to climate action. \~\~ The next 24 hours could determine if Mr Turnbull's influence is needed. \~\~ Comment has been sought from the prime minister's office. \</doc>

AS THE world's focus on global warming heats up, City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has joined 150 heads of state and government at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris this week. The mayor, who has been invited to speak at six events in five days, will be joining mayors from other global cities including Paris, London and New York, for the "most important global meeting in our lifetime". "The City of Sydney has ambitious targets for reducing emissions while also performing in the economic arena," she said. "Sydney is very importantly a liveable city, which is why we have the fastest growing residential population in NSW," she said. Cr Moore will speak at several high-profile talks, which she said are a platform to discuss successes achieved by cities around the world. "Even though cities only take up two per cent of the world's geography, they make up 78 per cent of the world's emissions, with more than 75 per cent of Australians living in cities. "If the national governments work with cities they can be really effective at achieving the goal target of keeping global warming below 2C." The mayor will join the Chinese city of Wuhan tomorrow in a talk hosted by Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris, and Michael Bloomberg, UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, to discuss the role of mayors in championing emissions reduction.Cr Moore will also be part of a panel on Friday with the mayors of Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Milan and Bogota to address low-carbon urban development and said the attention on cities showed a "real recognition of the work being done". \</doc>

No matter what happens at major climate talks in Paris, the globe won't "U-turn" and pull funds from emerging clean energy markets. That's the view of the Climate Institute, which has developed three possible scenarios for the United Nations climate change conference in less than two weeks. The institute's most optimistic scenario, labelled catalyst, would produce an agreement with a strong signal the globe boosts climate change action over time. That would enhance investor confidence, accelerating business actions to limit emissions. The next best option would be a momentum scenario, with a focus on robust domestic climate policies and finally the patchwork case, which the institute believes would result in vague outcomes from Paris. Under the least optimistic scenario, investment in climate change solutions would continue but mainly in countries which view those industries as part of their long-term prosperity, such as China. Climate Institute deputy chief executive Erwin Jackson said the process in the lead-up to Paris had put pressure on countries including Australia to pledge emissions reduction targets. "(The conference) won't fix everything but the best possible agreement will be one that very clearly sets the world on a path to... avoiding global warming of two degrees," he said. "We do not expect, under any of the possible outcomes, that the world will do a U-turn on clean energy investment trends." However, the agreement must ensure accountability while being bankable and fair, he said. Australia has pledged to slash carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, a goal the institute believes is weak and places the nation at the back of the developed pack. The collective pledges are expected to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees, higher than the ultimate goal keeping warming below two degrees. However, leaders insist the Paris summit is the start of the process. \</doc>

\~\~Ahead of world leaders' climate change talks in Paris, thousands of New Zealanders have taken to the streets asking for a meaningful result. \~\~ At least 3000 marched down Auckland's Queen Street and an estimated 7000 marched in Wellington, according to reports. \~\~ "Instead of seizing the opportunities from moving to a low-carbon future, the New Zealand government is lagging behind its people and the world by taking a weak target to Paris and refusing to take real action on climate change," says Auckland march convenor Kristin Gilles. \~\~ The People's Climate March NZ 2015 has the backing of 27 groups, including Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, Unicef NZ, environmentalist groups and unions. \~\~ New Zealand is taking a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 to the Paris talks. \~\~ The United Nations climate change conference starts in Paris on Monday with hopes for a legally binding agreement on climate change. \~\~ "The government should listen to the thousands of New Zealanders who took to the streets today and come up with a stronger, more ambitious plan for reducing climate pollution," said co-leader James Shaw. \~\~ "But I think we need to do more if and when we can find solutions to that agricultural portion, and I'm absolutely confident we will. \~\~ Agriculture contributes 48 per cent of New Zealand's carbon emissions. \</doc>

They're the councils leading community action to move to renewable energy, and they already have plans to go beyond the federal government's emissions reduction target. Byron Shire mayor Simon Richardson is headed to Paris in December to share his council's experiences at the United Nations Climate Change Conference . "What countries sign in Paris, even if it's lower than it should be, regions, councils and companies will take that security and far outstrip that target," Cr Richardson said. "I'll be involved in the cities and regions conference where representatives from around the world will be showing what we're doing and learning from each other," he said. Byron Shire is aiming to become Australia's first council to completely eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. It joins a number of other councils in adopting ambitious energy targets. Lismore City Council has committed to self-generating 100 per cent of its electricity needs through renewable resources by 2023. It became the first local government to achieve organic certification for its compost and boasts one of the highest uptake rates for solar power in the country. Lismore deputy mayor Simon Clough attributed the council's success to the significant support it has from the community. "Nearly 87 per cent of people who live in Lismore are opposed to the exploration or production of coal seam gas," Mr Clough said. "It's a very clear message and council has acted strongly on that. "The way to get real movement is to work from the grassroots up, working with the community to encourage it to be power independent. "There's certainly lots of opportunity for Local Government NSW to get out significant conferences for councils to share resources." The Australian Climate Leadership Summit recognised Lismore and Byron Shire councils along with the City of Sydney, the City of Adelaide, the City of Melbourne and the City of Perth for their emission reduction efforts earlier this month. \</doc>

A CAMPAIGN to raise awareness of climate change will culminate in a public street rally and concert at the end of the month in Murwillumbah. Activists have called on residents to view an "eye-opening" climate change documentary at the Regent Cinema, Murwillumbah, on November 13, ahead of the November 28 protest at Knox Park, Murwillumbah. Tweed Climate Action Now spokesperson Greg Reid said the group and its affiliates would be at the event to inform residents on the urgency of climate change and what they could do to help. "In 10 to 20 years time when we're suffering the impacts of climate change, it will be because of the emissions we're making now, so it's something we need to act on early," Mr Reid said. The event precedes the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris on November 30, which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently announced he would attend. However, Mr Reid said the pledges being made by world leaders now were not powerful enough to turn back the effects of greenhouse gas and ozone damage into the future. "There are targets but no proposed way of getting there," Mr Reid said. "Worse, a promise for the Earth to have less than a 2% increase in average global temperature within the century, if missed, will mean the Northern Arctic circle will continue to melt, releasing more methane and pushing the temperature up. This causes bush fires, floods and damage to food crops. "We can't wait for leadership from the politicians. so we must make our own region carbon-neutral." The Regent Cinema's Ken Rippin is hoping for another bumper audience at Show You Care, with a strong audience at the last screening despite clashing with the Tweed Valley Festival. In Murwillumbah, the number of days over 35 degrees has quadrupled since the 1960s, and this will double by 2050, he said. \</doc>

\~\~Almost two thirds of Australians believe the federal government should be prepared to boost its emissions reduction targets in order to reach a global deal, a new poll shows. \~\~ It comes before the United Nations climate change conference in Paris next week, where it is hoped 196 countries will sign an historic agreement to curb emissions. \~\~ The federal government maintains its targets are among the world's most ambitious in terms of per capita reductions and is pushing for five-year reviews to force countries to consider their goals. \~\~ Negotiations in Paris are not likely to centre on individual country targets, but rather on climate financing and compliance and transparency. \~\~ That's an increase of 16 points from 2012 but a decrease from 68 per cent in 2006. \~\~ The poll shows 43 per cent would rather an emissions trading scheme or carbon price to deal with CO2 pollution. \</doc>

Australia\' s new Chief Scientist wants a future free of fossil fuels and advocates consideration of nuclear power alongside expanded renew-able energy. But Alan Finkel, an engineer, neuroscientist, businessman and inventor, has joined Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to reject calls for a moratorium on new coal mines. Dr Finkel, the chancellor at Monash University, said Australia was at a critical stage when science and technological innovation could deliver prosperity and productivity.  My vision is for a country, society, a world where we don\' t use any coal, oil (or) natural gas because we have zero emissions electricity in huge abundance and we use that for transport, for heating and all the things we ordinarily use electricity, he said. However, to replace transport fuels, gas for heating and coal for electricity would require a five-fold increase in power generation.  It\' s not unreasonable to look at all viable alternatives, Dr Finkel said.  Nuclear energy is a zero emissions energy but it comes with issues.  It\' s something that should be absolutely considered for a low emissions or a zero emissions future, if that is what we are looking for. Another possible way forward with better storage could be solar and wind power. About 60 eminent Australians have signed a letter asking world leaders to support a moratorium on new coal mines and put coal exports on the agenda at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Mr Turnbull said a moratorium would make no difference to global emissions because the coal would be sourced elsewhere.  Arguably it would increase them because our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries, he said. He said it was not a sensible policy economically, for jobs or to combat global emissions. Dr Finkel replaces Ian Chubb as Chief Scientist in January. \' Nuclear energy is a zero emissions energy but it comes with issues.\' New Chief Scientist Alan Finkel \</doc>

With the Great Barrier Reef in crisis due to coral bleaching, two locals are revisiting their internationally-acclaimed film highlighting its importance. In 2009, Bega Valley filmmakers Toni Houston and Bettina Richter took their music-based film about the Great Barrier Reef to Copenhagen as part of COP15, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark. The pair were the only Australians to have an event selected as part of the COP15 official cultural calendar. Now the Great Barrier Reef is in more danger than ever due to the recent mass coral bleaching event, destroying more than 1000km of reef as a result of climate change. It is timely then, that Ms Houston and Ms Richter's film AQUA is again screened. AQUA was the brainchild of Ms Houston and was produced by Ms Richter with their production company Wish Bone Films, on the Far South Coast. Fusing the Emmy award-winning underwater cinematography of David Hannan with the percussive beats of one of Europe's biggest dance acts ' Safri Duo ' it tells the history of the Great Barrier Reef, without words. AQUA aimed to inspire government leaders to reduce carbon emissions, activate community support, and build better conservation practices on the reef. It was sponsored by Pyramid Power, the Australian Embassy in Copenhagen, the University of Copenhagen and many other local businesses and community members. It also screened at Parliament House Canberra, Screen Australia studios Sydney, and locally to schools and the community in the Bega Valley. In Copenhagen, the film screened with Safri Duo playing live to the film. According to the two Bega Valley women, it was quite an experience. On Sunday, May 15, AQUA will screen as part of the Monthly Community Doco program at The Butter Factory in Cobargo. From 3.30pm, Toni Houston and Bettina Richter will present AQUA, as well as a mini documentary made about their trip to Copenhagen. Don't miss this chance to watch AQUA, meet the filmmakers and hear about the state of the Great Barrier Reef. Coffee and tea provided ' Bring your own mug!

ELEANOR HALL: Let's go now to the climate talks in Paris, where negotiators now have just under two days to reach a global agreement, with hundreds of points still being contested. Money appears to be the one of the biggest challenges, with rich nations pitching against developing nations. Penny Timms compiled this report. PROTESTORS (chanting): We are unstoppable, another world is possible. PENNY TIMMS: It's taken two decades of planning and a week and a half of negotiations and disagreement to develop a draft agreement on what action needs to be taken to limit global warning. But some of the plan's most pressing issues are yet to be resolved. US Secretary of State John Kerry wasn't giving much away. JOHN KERRY: We were just reviewing it now, we are just beginning to dig into it and we are delighted to have it. We appreciate the hard work that has gone into it and that's what we are here to talk about. PENNY TIMMS: The biggest challenges surround what lengths should be taken to cut emissions, and by which countries, and who should pay for it. An option of aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, rather than two degrees Celsius hasn't been ruled out. Pacific leaders, including Tuvalu's Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga, are anxiously waiting for the outcome. ENELE SOPOAGA: In times like this, as we fishermen in the Pacific know, the darkest time of the night is the one that is just before dawn. So I encourage all of us here, delegations here, and our negotiators, not to blink. PENNY TIMMS: He says a binding agreement to stop global warming is vital. ENELE SOPOAGA: There is still a lot of work that needs to be done. I would rather we came out of Paris with a strong pact, global pact, a legal global pact that will protect and save the islands of the Pacific and Caribbean and also the Indian Ocean, but also address human rights of those people to exist. PENNY TIMMS: The UN's special envoy for climate change, Mary Robinson, says the coming hours are going be tough, but crucial. MARY ROBINSON: Now, the hard choices have to be made. So the next 24 hours is even more important because there are options, and we can have a really good agreement or we could have a less good agreement. I hope we will understand. This has to be a people's agreement as the leaders said the first day. It has to remember those who are most affected by climate change and least responsible. That's what I'd be looking for at the end of the day. That it is a people's document that can galvanise people worldwide. PENNY TIMMS: But the people protesting outside the talks remain sceptical that will happen. KYLE GRACEY: It is still not enough, it is not enough across the board. We are calling for much stronger action across the board. It is not enough to stop the dangerous impacts of climate change. It is not going to bring a just transition to people around the world, and it is not going to be enough to save people from the dangers of climate change, no matter what country they are in. ELEANOR HALL: And that's protester Kyle Gracey ending that report by Penny Timms. \</doc>

TAXPAYERS will fork out $800 million over five years to help poorer countries prepare for the impacts of climate change. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the funding package during his national statement at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris yesterday. The money comes on top of a $200 million pledge for the Green Climate Fund taking Australia's climate financial contribution to $1 billion. But the Greens and Labor criticised the commitment as the money will be torn from the existing foreign aid budget. Mr Turnbull told the summit some of the most vulnerable nations are Australia's Pacific neighbours, and we need to help them adapt. The top three recipients of Australian Official Development Assistance are Papua New Guinea ($554.5m), Indonesia ($375.7m) and the Solomon Islands ($175.9m). "The impacts of global warming are already being felt and will continue to be so even after we reach global net zero emissions," Mr Turnbull told the UN summit. "Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is equally important, and there too innovation is a key." Mr Turnbull, who will arrive in Canberra today, said he was optimistic the Paris talks would result in a historic global climate change agreement. When he left Paris, there were simmering divisions on a range of fronts but world leaders were bullish they could be overcome. If an agreement is reached by the end of next week there will be a road map towards limiting the Earth's warming by 2 degrees. Australia has committed to a minimum 5 per cent reduction on 2000 emissions by 2020, and a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 emissions by 2030. In the past, Australia has faced criticism for not doing enough compared with other developed countries. But Mr Turnbull told the conference Australia would ratify the second stage of the world's only current climate change agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, and double its clean energy HYPERLINK mailto:investment.annika.smethurst@news.com.au investment.annika.smethurst@news.com.au \</doc>

Danielle Tan and Phoebe Metcalf delivered the climate change report to Curtin MP Julie Bishop's electoral office. Picture: Andrew Ritchie d447123 STUDENTS from Presbyterian Ladies' College are urging Curtin MP Julie Bishop to fight for solutions to climate change. The students took part in a forum and heard from climate change experts in September, compiling a report with their recommendations for tackling environmental security. Year 11 students Phoebe Metcalf and Danielle Tan delivered the report to Ms Bishop's electoral office last week. Ms Bishop will represent Australia at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which runs until December 11. The report included the students' concerns about Australia's inaction on environmental issues and noted the international community would not condone Australia's "bystander" approach to climate change. "Hon. Julie Bishop, many students referred to you as a role model, an inspiration, and even their preferred option for Prime Minister," the report said. "They place their faith in you to take a moment to listen and consider them, and to fight for long-term sustainable solutions." Danielle said what was important about the forum was getting students to consider how climate change could affect them. "What is highly significant about this forum is that we are not aiming to lecture students about climate change, for this part of their syllabus, rather, we are helping them understand its relevance to their own lives," she said. Phoebe said she hoped Julie Bishop would take on board the student feedback. "As young people in this electorate, I believe we do hold a responsibility to ensure that when Julie Bishop goes to Paris that it is representative of her members," Phoebe said. "As students we are part of this, but in particular we are the people who will be most affected by the proposals we put forward as we are the next generation."WA student doctors marched at Wellington Square in Perth on Sunday as part of the global push for action ahead of the climate change conference. \</doc>

TASMANIA will be "front and centre of the transition to the new economy" under the Greens' RenewAustralia plan, Senator Nick McKim says. The Greens on Sunday outlined their blueprint to make Australia's energy generation at least 90 per cent renewable by 2030. Under the plan, a new $500 million government authority called RenewAustralia would use reverse auctions and direct investment to deliver a 15-year pipeline of clean-energy projects. A $1 billion clean-energy transition fund would be set up to help coal workers and communities with the transition. Coal-fired power stations would gradually be shut down. Mr McKim said Tasmania would benefit greatly from the plan. "Hydro Tasmania already has a nation-leading mix of expertise and skills in renewable energy, and RenewAustralia will give it a fantastic opportunity to build on its competitive advantages and become a global leader in renewable energy generation," he said. "The Greens' RenewAustralia framework will see large-scale renewable generation come on line far more quickly in Australia than a business-as-usual approach, which will significantly increase opportunities for Hydro Tasmania to generate jobs and prosperity for the company and for Tasmanians. "A reinstated price on carbon will also give Hydro Tasmania windfall financial gains, just as it did in the past, and allow it to pay down debt or return increased dividends to the Tasmanian government, which can be spent on essential services like schools and hospitals." Greens leader Senator Richard Di Natale said the plan would "power the new economy and create thousands of jobs". "Transitioning to clean energy is the key to unlocking Australia's economic potential and combating global warming. "While both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten talk about tackling climate change, they have locked us into the industries of the last century, supporting coal and vested interests." The government's renewable energy target is set at 23 per cent by 2020, while Labor has committed to ensuring 50 per cent of Australia's energy comes from renewables by 2030. The Greens' announcement came ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 30 to December 11. \</doc>

Renee Carr, founder of Fair Agenda and chair of Australian Youth Climate Coalition's board, was recognised in the Young Leader category at the 2015 100 Women of Influence Awards for her campaigning and advocacy work. The 29-year-old said she was proud to be recognised for her work. "We have achieved a lot since we launched our first campaign just 18 months ago," Ms Carr said. "It has been fantastic to see how much support there is for our work, and how much influence the community can have." Ms Carr said Fair Agenda's community helped win $4 million extra federal funding for family violence service 1800 RESPECT, which previously had to leave 18,631 calls unanswered because of inadequate funding. "The Federal Government still isn't providing the funding needed to ensure all women and children can access the support they need to safely escape family violence, but their recent announcements have been a step in the right direction," she said. "What is crystal clear is that they're being pushed to take stronger action by community campaigns." Ms Carr launched the site fairagenda.org two years ago, and the movement has gone on to attract about 34,000 members and mobilised dozens of campaigns for improvements to government, business and media policies on issues affecting women. Fair Agenda members are campaigning for full funding of services needed to help women and children escape family violence, to stop the Federal Government's proposed cuts to paid parental leave and to protect reproductive rights. And, having been raised in a coal mining community, Ms Carr is also finding time to advance the climate change debate. "As someone who grew up in the Latrobe Valley, climate justice is an issue particularly close to my heart," she said. "Much, much more needs to be done by our leaders, including more investment in renewables and taking a stronger (emissions reduction) target to Paris (for the United Nations Climate Change Conference )."People interested in joining Fair Agenda can visit fairagenda.org \</doc>

\~\~New climate change research shows melting Antarctic ice could increase rising sea levels more than previously calculated - starkly emphasising the need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \~\~ Using state-of-the-art computer modelling, the scientists found the only scenario that didn't generate large-scale loss of Antarctic ice was when world emissions were significantly reduced beyond 2020, says lead author, Victoria University's Nicholas Golledge. \~\~ But in 2013 there was insufficient knowledge about how the ice sheet might respond to future warming. \~\~ "If we lose these ice shelves, the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise by 2100 will be nearer 40 centimetres." \~\~ "Missing the 2C target will result in an Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise that could be up to 10 metres higher than today," Dr Golledge said. \~\~ Without significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next couple of decades, the widespread melting of the Antarctic ice sheet could become irreversible. \~\~ The United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Paris later this year, which aims to get worldwide agreement on limiting climate change effects. \~\~ Co-author Tim Naish says in order to restrict global warming to 2C the Paris meeting must agree to reduce global CO2 emissions to zero before the end of the century. \</doc>

\~\~PORT MORESBY Sept 7 AAP - Six of the smallest Pacific island nations facing a potential wipe-out from climate change have called for a global moratorium on new coal mines. \~\~ Leaders from the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau and Tuvalu met on Monday in Port Moresby before the wider 16 nation Pacific Island Forum leaders summit, which include Australia and New Zealand later this week. \~\~ "We cannot afford to lock in any further fossil fuel emissions," the declaration said. \~\~ "We are simply seeking the rights of smaller island states to survive," Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga told reporters. \~\~ The leaders are pleading with Australia and New Zealand to do more to combat global warming before the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December. \~\~ Some islands are less than a metre above sea level and face disappearing under rising seas. \~\~ Palau President Tommy Remengesau acknowledged that the small island states' declaration may not be popular with the entire PIF membership, alluding to Australia. \~\~ Mr Remengesau said the time for leadership was now. \~\~ The leaders also discussed fisheries, cervical cancer, human rights issues in Indonesia's West Papua and communications technology. \</doc>

Rank and file Liberals will push the State Government to sell or lease WA\'e2\€  s electricity network to pay off debt, legalise cycling without a helmet for over 18s, remove the first-homeowners grant and make it easier to expel students. The policies are among a host of motions listed for debate at the party\'e2\€  s two-day State conference beginning today. Policy motions are not binding on the party\'e2\€  s parliamentary wing but are designed to send a message to MPs and, if passed, become part of its official \'e2\€  platform\'e2\€ . The conference will also feature Federal motions, including calls for the coalition to oppose constitutional recognition of Aboriginals and same-sex marriage. The Liberals\'e2\€  rural policy division wants a House of Representatives committee to investigate climate change science and the Federal Government to eschew any binding agreement at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris this year. The Stirling division wants the coalition to abolish minimum shift lengths for casual workers. The motion listed first, which ensures it is debated, is a women\'e2\€  s council push for full deregulation of retail trading hours. If that fails, there is a Perth division motion \'e2\€  to amend retail trading hours legislation to remove the discriminatory distinctions between speciality and general retail stores\'e2\€ . The Canning division is concerned about the \'e2\€  negative effect\'e2\€ environmental protection laws have on private property rights in WA and calls on the State to provide fair compensation for landowners whose property is acquired or devalued by the Government. Two divisions believe the State holds too many energy assets. Swan wants the Barnett Government to follow NSW and sell or lease its poles to pay down debt and benefit consumers while Stirling wants \'e2\€  all energy utilities and their assets\'e2\€ sold. Perth division wants regulations to allow State school principals to expel students \'e2\€  after suitable attempts to address inappropriate behaviour\'e2\€ . Down the list with little chance to be debated is a renewed push for local government reform, not by changing boundaries but through procedures and accountability. \</doc>

\~\~ Mr Abbott declares the government - and Australia - did not get enough credit for its work to reduce emissions. \~\~ He's also accused other nations of abandoning their commitments. \~\~ But he indicated Australia wouldn't meet the mid-2015 timeframe for announcing its post-2020 emissions reduction target, hinting it would first be discussed at a partyroom meeting on August 11. \~\~ Many other nations - including New Zealand - have already announced their post-2020 emissions reduction targets ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris later this year. \~\~ "We'll take a very strong and credible position to Paris," Mr Abbott told reporters near Goulburn on Monday. \~\~ The government maintains Australia will meet or beat its 2020 target of five per cent reduction on 2000 levels. \~\~ A special taskforce has been designing Australia's post-2020 targets, which the coalition has repeatedly said would be in step with the nation's trading partners. \~\~ That's in line with a new Climate Council report that finds anything below a 40 to 60 per cent cut would render Australia a "global pariah". \~\~ The coalition has twice tried to abolish the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and now says if it still exists it should focus on new technologies. \~\~ A Senate committee is looking into potential health impacts of wind farms, despite the Medical Research Council finding there was no convincing evidence of the so called "wind-turbine syndrome". \</doc>

Chinese greenhouse gas emissions may peak by 2025, according to a new study from the London School of Economics (LSE). The study, commissioned by two research institutes at the\~LSE, says emissions from\~China could peak by 2025 or even earlier as its economy transitions towards a \' new normal' of better quality growth.\~ China had agreed to peak emissions by 2030 under a\~historic climate accord agreement with the US in November 2014. It was the first time the two nations, which account for 40 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, had agreed to work together. "This suggests that China's international commitment to peak emissions "around 2030" should be seen as a conservative upper limit from a government that prefers to under-promise and over-deliver" said the paper, co-authored by climate economist Nicholas Stern and analyst Fergus Green. The better-than-expected results could help spur action in developed countries ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, the report's authors say. "There is a lack of understanding in rich countries about the measures China has already taken, and its future plans, with regard to emissions." \~ "All too often, commentators and officials in rich countries highlight China's emissions as a justification for their own inaction." "Continued strong examples of Chinese emissions reduction actions, clearly communicated to other countries, could silence such voices and lower the political barriers in rich countries to stronger climate action." \~ Continued efforts by Beijing to mitigate the effects of climate change and develop\~low-carbon technology could even unleash "a large wave of clean energy investment, innovation and growth --\~a new energy-industrial revolution" the report says. "This is the only engine of domestic and global growth that can be sustained over the medium and long term --\~and China holds the keys."\~ \</doc>

French climate change activists have been placed under house arrest ahead of the opening of the UN climate change conference in Paris. Public demonstrations are banned in France under the state of emergency that was declared after the HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-14/paris-attacks-120-dead-in-shootings-explosions/6940722 Paris terrorist attacks two week ago, in which 130 people were killed . Green groups have described the move as "an abuse of power" but the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the activists were suspected of planning violent protests. "These 24 people have been placed under house arrest because they have been violent during demonstrations in the past and because they have said they would not respect the state of emergency," he said. They must remain in their home towns, report to the local police three times a day and abide by a nightly curfew until December 12, when the climate change conference winds up. A delegation of environmental organisations met with French president Francois Hollande to appeal against the measures. Greenpeace International's executive Director Kumi Naidoo said he was "disappointed" that France's political leadership would "choose to enable sporting events, trade exhibitions and other arts and culture events to go ahead, but with such a clamp down on the space for the biggest issue humanity faces". The climate talks will see world leaders gather to try to come to an agreement on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020. Major public rallies planned for this weekend were cancelled, forcing international green groups to focus on HYPERLINK /news/2015-11-28/thousands-turn-out-in-brisbane-march-for-climate-change-action/6983252 marches in major cities around the world , instead of in Paris. Australian 'guardian angels' say voices need to be heard Some activist groups plan to march at the Place de la Republic in defiance of the state of emergency on Sunday. Others are looking for creative ways to make their point whilst staying within the bounds of the law. Among them are the Climate Guardians, Australian activists dressed as angels to highlight the stewardship of natural resources. One of the "angels", Zoe Buckley Lennox, believes it is "absurd" to ban public protests and put restrictions on the people who had planned them. "I was quite shocked ... the fact they have gone so far as to target these organisers who are clearly organising for the climate talks, specifically targeting them, when it's obviously not anything to do with terrorism, it's about climate change," she said. "It's ridiculous. We obviously are going to respect the laws that are happening at the moment but at the same time we need to get these voices out no matter what situation we're in." French environmentalists plan to place shoes along the route of a cancelled march to make their point. \</doc>

\~\~ That's a message also pushed by United Nations climate change conference president Laurent Fabius, who has urged parties to ditch the ideal for the desirable. \~\~ Fabius has told negotiators to expect the final draft by Saturday morning before it's presented for adoption at midday. \~\~ Australia believes it has some ideas to resolve the major outstanding issues, which mainly focus on climate finance and who should be accountable for what under the agreement. \~\~ "Not everybody will get what they want," she told reporters in Paris on Friday evening. \~\~ "But as long as countries are able to see the whole package and embrace the whole package then we will have achieved a significant breakthrough." \~\~ "There are countries now that are instead of being aid recipients are now aid donors," she said. \~\~ United States President Barack Obama phoned his Chinese counterpart on Friday to co-ordinate efforts in the negotiations. \~\~ Australia is pushing for transparency, five-yearly reviews of country efforts to slash emissions and a requirement for all countries to do their part in climate action. \~\~ Negotiators spent Friday in informal discussions, formal bilateral meetings and negotiating group talks.

Longreach teenager speaks for the land and calls on world leaders to listen It's a long way from the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris to Longreach's drought-ravaged pastures but Lane Kinnon hopes his voice will join the many urging world leaders to reach a strong climate agreement and secure a healthy future for the planet when they meet at the end of November. 18-year old Lane was asked to contribute to a short open-letter video to world leaders and appears alongside young people from around the world and celebrity spokespeople Al Gore and Richard Branson. Lane does not have a formal scientific education but he knows about soil erosion and drought. His father, Richard Kinnon, a grazier who has diversified into tourism, says his boys have been in touch with the land all their lives and it is their future - and ours. The Kinnon family certainly do not identify as 'greenies' but they are concerned that world leaders are not doing enough and not consulting the people on the land. "Local people know how to work the land sustainably and, like the Indigenous people before us, we see ourselves as custodians of the land," Richard Kinnon said. Richard believes diversifying into tourism has not only been an economic necessity but has also enabled them to tread a little more lightly on their land and leave 10,000 acres for regrowth. "We want to find a balance and work to do things right for the next generations - if Lane and Jeremy and others like them cannot work this land, we will not have Australian food on our tables," Richard said. In the video, Lane stands in front of acres of dusty, barren pasture and creates an evocative image of the reality for many outback farmers. Reflecting on the video, Lane said it is important for people to see what's happening. "Political leaders should come and talk to us. Ask the people on the land what's happening here," Lane suggested.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's attendance at the United Nations climate change conference doesn't change Australia's "low ambition" to tackle the problem, Labor believes. Mr Turnbull intends to head to Paris for the major global conference in December, armed with a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels. It's a target set by his predecessor Tony Abbott, who was widely predicted to skip the meeting after his government scrapped Labor's carbon tax and reduced Australia's renewable energy target. Mr Turnbull has indicated no change to the Abbott government's direct action climate change policy, which pays polluters not to pollute and has been slammed for being expensive and ineffective. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is pleased the Prime Minister will represent Australia in Paris, but says symbolic attendance is not enough to stop global warming. "It's not a question of what places you visit or what selfies you take when you visit places, it's a question of your actions," he told reporters in Alice Springs on Sunday. "Whether or not Malcolm Turnbull goes to Paris or not is not going to stop global warming." The government was selling Australians short with "low targets and low ambition", he said. Meanwhile, Mr Shorten is hoping to make climate change front and centre of public debate in the lead up to the conference with a four-day trip to low-lying Pacific Island nations. He will lead a Labor team, including his deputy Tanya Plibersek and immigration spokesman Richard Marles, to Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in November. The Australian Greens have called on Mr Shorten to listen to the concerns of the island nations and withdraw his party's support for Queensland's massive Adani coal mine. Greens senator Larissa Waters said Labor must show action by heeding the islands' calls for a moratorium on new Australian coal mines. "Saying you want action on climate change and then ignoring coal exports, is like taking one step forward and a giant leap backwards, Senator Waters said. Labor has committed to introducing an emissions trading scheme, should they be returned to government at the next election. \</doc>

An international expert says ethanol may be a good starting point as Queensland looks to alternative fuels, but the state and nation have potential for much more advanced bioenergy industries. Professor David Bressler is part of the Faculty of Agricultural Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada. Speaking at the Diversify Mackay Leadership Alliance in North Queensland, Professor Bressler said Australia had many ingredients in place to succeed in the bioenergy field. "I think ethanol is a good start. It's a first generation biofuel," he said. "What we are seeing globally though is a move in terms of science and technology being able to go past ethanol into more advanced fuels, [such as] butanol. "So what you see is, once you build the infrastructure and you get the knowledge on how to develop these renewable fuels, it opens a pathway into much more valuable fuels, chemicals and materials." The Queensland Government is putting in place legislation that will mandate a level of 2 per cent ethanol in all fuel sold at the bowser. The policy is designed to grow the state's ethanol sector, which is small but considered by many to hold great potential. Prof Bressler said putting a mandate, or some other government regulation, in place could be a good idea, but the most important consideration was to ensure the policy was secure for the long term. Bioenergy comes in several forms, as Prof Bressler explained to the audience in Mackay. He said Australia had competitive advantages if it chose to spawn new bioenergy ventures. "What you guys [in Australia] have at your disposal, is very cheap feed stock at very large volumes, which is very important," he said. "You have a high-tech culture, you've got the infrastructure and the support in the universities to be able to support this. "And thirdly, you have port infrastructure all through, so you can move to global markets of very large scale quite easily. "So, you are in a perfect position to take advantage of what is happening in the carbon economy, especially with what's happening in Paris in December [at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ], and the move towards carbon strategies globally on how we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions." \</doc>

\~\~Australia needs to consider nuclear power alongside coal as part of its energy mix, says the country's new chief scientist. \~\~ Nuclear energy should be considered along with solar and wind, Dr Finkel told reporters. \~\~ "Nuclear energy is a zero-emissions energy," he said. \~\~ "It would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions," Mr Turnbull said in Canberra. \~\~ The prime minister warned that nuclear energy is expensive and poses environmental challenges. \~\~ The energy debate follows a call from Wallabies back-rower David Pocock and 60 other notable Australians to world leaders to heed a Pacific Islands call for a moratorium on new coal mines and the expansion of existing operations. \~\~ The letter - backed by former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser and Nobel Prize winner Peter Doherty - urges leaders to put coal exports on the agenda at the coming United Nations climate change conference in Paris. \~\~ Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will lead a team in a visit next week to low-lying Pacific Island nations to discuss the risk of rising sea levels, hoping to put climate change front and centre of public debate going into the UN summit in Paris. \~\~ "There's $2.5 trillion estimated to be invested in renewable energy in the Asia Pacific region by 2030 - I would like Australia to get some of that investment," Mr Shorten said. \~\~ He was not convinced an economic case had been made for nuclear energy. \</doc>

The Federal Government is set to outline its long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today, ahead of negotiations later this year for a binding international deal. Australia currently aims to reduce emissions by 5 per cent by 2020, based on the level of emissions in 2000. But the Coalition has not set a plan for beyond 2020, despite previously flagging it would do so mid-year. The long-term targets are expected to be revealed after a meeting of Liberal and National MPs and senators this morning. "It is about time the Abbott Government put its cards on the table," Labor's environment spokesman Mark Butler said. "Australia is now the only major developed economy which hasn't put a target forward for the Paris conference to be held in December." Australia will take part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which aims to strike a legally binding deal to limit global warming. "It's time Mr Abbott did the same." Environment Minister Greg Hunt vowed to take serious action. "Australia has to do its fair share," he said. "It has to be strong and it has to be credible." Mr Hunt did not reveal any details, but said the Coalition endorsed the global aim of limiting global temperature rises to two degrees Celsius. But he was adamant future action should not include taxing carbon emissions or setting up emissions trading schemes. "We need to clean up our emissions, but we need to do it in a way which is sustainable and which is acceptable and affordable," Mr Hunt said. Mr Butler said the Opposition did not have a particular figure in mind for a long-term aim to reduce emissions, but said limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius would also be "a guiding principle" for Labor. \</doc>

\~\~Federal Labor won't be pinned down on a post-2020 target for cutting carbon pollution but leader Bill Shorten promises Australians will know where the party stands by the next federal election. \~\~ The government on Tuesday announced it would aim to reduce emissions by up to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. \~\~ While Labor argues the target is inadequate to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius, its environment spokesman Mark Butler says the opposition it still consulting about a target of its own. \~\~ "We must keep global warming to no more than two degrees Celsius." \~\~ Mr Butler promised Labor's position would be clear at the next election, likely in the second half of 2016. \~\~ "But he offers no scientific evidence for the constructiveness of what he is doing to help tackle global warming," he said. \~\~ The opposition leader plans to attend the United Nations climate change conference in Paris at the end of the year and called on Mr Abbott to do likewise. \~\~ At this stage, the government will be represented by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop although that may change if more world leaders decide to attend. \~\~ It could meet the challenges "without clobbering jobs and growth", he said. \~\~ The prime minister also insists Australian coal is helping to reduce carbon emissions intensity in China and India because it's better quality. \~\~ "But I suspect more mines will open," he told ABC radio. \~\~ "We are not expecting a reduction in the coal industry." \</doc>

\~\~ Australia is one of four major offenders, with Canada, Japan and Russia, who are accused in the Africa Progress Panel's 2015 report of appearing to have withdrawn from attempts to tackle climate change. \~\~ "With one of the world's highest levels of per capita emissions, Australia has gone from leadership to free-rider status in climate diplomacy," the report said. \~\~ But Ms Bishop says the claims are "completely false". \~\~ "Australia has met its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol first commitment period, unlike other countries," she said in a statement on Friday. \~\~ The comments follow Environment Minister Greg Hunt's defence of the government's reputation. \~\~ "There are very few countries that have achieved and beaten their Kyoto 1 targets; there are very few countries that have achieved and will beat their Kyoto 2 targets. \~\~ However, at a United Nations climate change conference in Germany, environment groups believe Australia has embarrassed itself by ducking questions. \~\~ Several countries questioned the scrapping of the carbon tax and whether the federal government's $2.55 billion direct action policy will be enough to meet Australia's emissions reduction target of five per cent by 2020. \</doc>

Politicians are arriving left, right and centre (mostly right) to 'press the flesh' ahead of the July 2 popularity contest otherwise known as the federal election. For anyone who's door knocked for work or charity it is difficult to avoid having the door shut in your face, yet some people are born with the powers of persuasion, able to sell anything to just about anyone. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's first day of the campaign began with a morning ABC radio interview before a flight to Merimbula and back from the nation's capital, before finishing the day with an appearance on commercial television from Adelaide. Malcolm Turnbull's visit, coincidentally of course, coincided with Labor leader Bill Shorten's popularity with voters at a 12-month high and a leaked poll showing the Coalition trailing by six points in Eden-Monaro. If we were American it would be the equivalent of John Kerry and Barack Obama visiting within a fortnight. Mr Turnbull then jetted to Avalon airport near Geelong later that day for more 'flesh pressing'. With all of this travel they are racking up the air miles, so it's no wonder climate science has been left off the catchphrase whiteboard brainstorming sessions this campaign, despite Mr Turnbull's address to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris late last year and the projection 2016 will set a new global temperature record. Despite their differences, there is something each party leader chasing Australia's top job have in common ' it's their first election campaign as leader. Yet they all appear as though they've done it before. Maybe it's the training. \</doc>

\~\~The environment will take centre stage on Wednesday, as two senior coalition and Labor figures go head-to-head in the first specific policy debate of the election campaign. \~\~ Environment Minister Greg Hunt is due to take on Labor counterpart Mark Butler at Canberra's National Press Club in a debate that will likely delve into climate change, the CSIRO and the recently bleached Great Barrier Reef. \~\~ The opposition's policy suite aims for 45 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and 50 per cent clean energy by the same year. \~\~ The opposition has been quick to distance its plan from the former Labor government's carbon tax, which was scrapped after the coalition was returned to power in 2013. \~\~ Its policy is direct action, which uses a $2.55 billion emissions reduction fund to pay polluters not to pollute as the vehicle to achieve a five per cent cut in CO2 by 2020. \~\~ Mr Hunt hails that "outstanding" and proof the policy is working. \~\~ The coalition took a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris last year, where nations agreed to limit global warming to two degrees. \~\~ Mr Turnbull - who once lost the Liberal leadership over his support for an emissions trading scheme - copped some criticism for omitting climate change from his election campaign launch speech. \~\~ The debate comes as scientists warn that half of the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef is dead or will die due to severe coral bleaching. \~\~ The bleaching - which occurs during warmer than usual water temperatures - is widely linked to global warming. \</doc>

The Coppabella hills are one step closer to being covered in turbines now that the Planning Assessment Commission has approved the Coppabella Precinct of Yass Valley Wind Farm. The Yass Valley Wind Farm, located 35km west of Yass, has been under development since 2009 by Australian proponents Epuron. When first conceived, the project included more than 150 wind turbines. The Department of Planning forwarded the revised Assessment Report, on February 1, 2016, to the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for its determination. The Commission gave its approval on March 30. This marks the end of the Epuron project's journey through the planning assessment process. Epuron describes the Coppabella hills as having £n excellent wind resource and nearby grid connection. This wind farm has the potential to be a key contributor to the energy supply of NSW and will assist significantly in the reduction of the State's emissions.' 'Epuron looks forward to the Yass Valley Wind Farm progressing to construction as swiftly as possible to capture the full benefits such projects can bring to regional communities,' the company said in a statement on Thursday. 'We again thank the community, particularly the involved landowners and local business and community leaders, for their ongoing support and patience, which has been rewarded by this approval. 'This approval for the 79 wind turbines of the Coppabella precinct will deliver clean renewable electricity and significant greenhouse gas reductions, although the reduction in number of turbines from 124 reduces the available benefits of the full wind farm by approximately 36 per cent. The greenhouse gas reductions available from the project will help Australia meet its commitments made at the November 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris.' Should the windfarm proceed to construction and production, the local community would benefit via a community fund to the tune of $2,500 per wind turbine, or up to $197,000 per annum if all turbines are built. 'Emissions in NSW from stationary energy will continue to be significant while its electricity generation is over 80 per cent fuelled by coal. It's time to deliver on the NSW Renewable Energy Action Plan.

\~\~ The fourth iteration of the United Nations climate change conference draft agreement was revealed on Thursday night (Friday morning AEDT), having been chopped from 29 pages to 27. \~\~ Ms Bishop said negotiations were at a delicate stage and there were still a number of options that could go either way. \~\~ "I suspect it's going to be a very long night," Ms Bishop told reporters in Paris on Thursday night. \~\~ Australia wants five-yearly reviews, a transparent measuring process and for all countries to contribute to climate action. \~\~ However, the foreign minister said the draft's different requirements for developed and developing countries were confusing. \~\~ There are question marks over the Friday night deadline, which conference president Laurent Fabius admits is extremely close. \~\~ "We have all been aware of the fact that compromise does require us to forget the ideal solution for everybody, so that we can obtain what is desirable for everybody," he said. \~\~ The French will no longer accept statements repeating known positions - which has made up much of the past few days of negotiations. \~\~ Ms Bishop won't point fingers at countries for pushing back against the agreement, saying there remained a lot of goodwill around the table. \~\~ MAIN STICKING POINTS \~\~  Differentiation: whether developed nations should be asked to do a lot more than developing nations. \~\~  Climate finance: How much should be given to poor countries to adapt to and mitigate climate change and which countries should donate the funds. \</doc>

World leaders have applauded Australia's climate targets at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , Environment Minister Greg Hunt says. Speaking to Lateline from the talks in Paris, Mr Hunt described Australia's targets of 26 to 28 per cent reductions in emissions by 2030 as "ambitious". He said compared to some of the great economies of the world, Australia was doing more than its fair share. "In per capita terms, Australia is lifting heavily, we are doing more than our fair share, because we are right at the front of the world in per capita reductions, which is a proxy for effort," he said. Mr Hunt said Australia's efforts had been recognised by other heads of state in Paris. "I've got to say, the response that other nations had given us and the response from the floor of the conference hall has been overwhelming support," he said. "A sense that Australia is really leading through our saving of 90 billion tonnes at a global level. "Our own commitments, the fact that we have made the announcement that we would meet and beat our targets and sign on to the Kyoto Protocol, these are major international achievements acknowledged by the international community." Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, who also visited Paris for the talks, last week announced HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/turnbull-optimistic-about-climate-change-talks-in-paris/6978918 Labor's new climate policy with an emissions reduction target of 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. Mr Hunt admitted that Australia was a higher emitting country per capita, but he said that would change. "We are starting from a higher base. I cannot change history or the fact of the economy as it is," he said. "But what we have done is set a policy that will see us reduce from being the 14th highest emitter in the world, down to the 25th highest emitter by 2030. That is a very significant change." Mr Hunt also backed the Federal Government's plan to commit $1 billion from the foreign aid budget to help Pacific nations tackle climate change. "Julie Bishop is a master in this space of delivery of Australian aid in a way which meets our global objectives, our regional objectives, but their national needs," he said. He said it was another announcement welcomed by world leaders at the conference. "It's something that has been embraced," he said. "It's a sign of Australia's international standing." \</doc>

Australians are being warned to change their attitudes around personal privacy as Attorney-General George Brandis flags "greater impediments" following the Paris attacks. Senator Brandis said Australia was "absolutely" at war with Islamic State and needed to take whatever steps necessary to protect itself. He said Australians will need to recalibrate their attitudes and reconsider where the right balance between protection and personal privacy lies. "ISIL have declared war on us," Senator Brandis told the Nine Network on Wednesday. "They have been completely unambiguous in their intention, they have been completely unambiguous in their purposes, and we would be fools not to take them at their word." Australia could not throw out its free society, rule of law or fundamental values but would "have to accept greater limitations, greater impediments to personal privacy for example, than may have been acceptable a few years ago," Senator Brandis told the Seven Network. Meanwhile, the Grand Mufti of Australia Ibrahim Abu Mohammed on Wednesday attempted to clarify his initial reaction to the Paris attacks after initially suggesting racism and "Islamophobia" were partly to blame. The clarification was welcomed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull but Independent Senator Jacquie Lambie suggested Dr Mohammed be fitted with an electronic device. The council reiterated the Grand Mufti's statement from September 2014 in which he said IS "criminals are committing crimes against humanity and sins against God". "Sadly, in the Paris attacks, people of various faith backgrounds including Islam were brutally murdered." Senator Lambie, while calling for more vetting of Syrian refugees coming to Australia, said the Grand Mufti wasn't helping the situation by not directly condemning the attacks. "Maybe the first person that should have an electronic device put on them is the bloody Grand Mufti," she told ABC radio. Opposition immigration spokesperson Richard Marles welcomed the statement from the Imams Council, saying "it clearly needed to be issued given what he originally said". The "evil violence" was brought against people of all faiths, including Muslims, he told Sky News. Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg, who is in Paris for energy talks, said it would be a small victory for terrorists if the United Nations climate change conference was called off. The summit is scheduled to begin at the end of November. \</doc>

Australia's new chief scientist believes the country should work towards zero emission energy generation and must consider nuclear as part of the mix. But that does not mean the nation will stop exporting coal. While announcing Alan Finkel's appointment, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the era of coal exports was not over. An Australian export moratorium could actually increase global emissions, he said, because Australian coal was cleaner than coal in many other countries. Dr Finkel, who has previously advocated for nuclear power, believes it is "critically" important to reduce emissions and the best way is via zero-emission electricity generation. Nuclear energy should be considered along with solar and wind, he said. "Nuclear energy is a zero-emissions energy," he told reporters. The Prime Minister warned that nuclear energy was expensive and posed environmental challenges. "The way to deal with this is... to say the object is to make sure we have access to all of the energy we need at the cheapest possible price," he said. The energy debate comes after a call from Wallabies backrower David Pocock and 60 other notable Australians to world leaders to heed a Pacific Islands call for a moratorium on new coal mines. The letter - also backed by former RBA governor Bernie Fraser and Nobel Prize winner Peter Doherty - urges leaders to put coal exports on the agenda at the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Paris. It also backs a call by the Pacific Islands for a moratorium on new coal mines and the expansion of existing ones. The group note the "severe negative impacts" of projects like the recently-approved Adani mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin which would export more than two billion tonnes of coal over its lifetime. Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg has previously said there's a "strong moral case" for pushing ahead with the Adani mine. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will lead a team to low-lying Pacific Island nations next week to discuss the risk of rising sea levels, hoping to put climate change front and centre of public debate in the lead up to the UN summit. The Australian Conservation Foundation says Australia should become a zero-emission economy but does not believe nuclear should be part of the mix. "Australia needs an energy mix that is 100 per cent safe," chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy said. \</doc>

CANBERRA, ACT, Aug. 11 -- Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott issued the following media release: Australia will reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they are 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This is a responsible and achievable target. It is comparable to the targets of other developed countries and allows our economy and jobs to grow strongly. The target builds on Australia's excellent record. We met and beat our first Kyoto target and expect to do the same in 2020 through the Government's Direct Action plan. Australia is making a strong and credible contribution to the international effort to tackle climate change. Our emissions intensity and emissions per person will fall further than other developed economies. Australia's emissions per person will decline by at least 50 per cent between 2005 and 2030, while emissions per unit of GDP will fall by 64 per cent. The Government will meet Australia's 2030 target through policies built on the successful Direct Action plan, in particular the Emissions Reduction Fund and its Safeguard Mechanism. The Emissions Reduction Fund is already achieving significant emissions reductions - with 47 million tonnes contracted at less than $14 per tonne in the first auction alone. We are on our way to planting 20 million trees by 2020 and have rolled out more than 350 Green Army projects around the country. There are many additional ways we can reduce emissions, while saving businesses and households money and lifting productivity. We will prioritise a National Energy Productivity Plan, working with State and Territory governments to improve energy productivity by up to 40 per cent by 2030. We will develop a National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy. The Government will review Australia's emissions reduction policies in detail in 2017-18, in close consultation with businesses and the community. We are committed to tackling climate change without a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme that will hike up power bills for families, pensioners and businesses. At 26-28 per cent, Australia's target gets the right balance between our economic and environmental responsibilities. We have a strong and credible target to take to Paris and Australia will work with our international partners to achieve a strong agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.

The United Nations secretary-general is hopeful a "good and ambitious universal agreement" will be reached at the Paris climate talks, which will open under tight security on the heels of France's worst terror attacks. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has joined representatives from 52 other countries at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Malta, where climate change is high on the agenda. Security was tight as the two-day CHOGM meeting began in Valletta attended by UN chief Ban Ki-Moon who flagged his hope that the talks could build momentum ahead of the climate conference early next week. "This is virtually the last political milestone before we meet in Paris," he said. In a press conference overnight, Mr Ban said he was more hopeful than ever that a consensus could be reached. "We are now working and going to present the politically credible trajectory for $100 billion. This is a trust and confidence issue." His comments came hours after tens of HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/people-rally-in-melbourne-for-climate-change/6981136 thousands of people rallied in Melbourne for action to address climate change , A HYPERLINK /news/2015-11-28/thousands-turn-out-in-brisbane-march-for-climate-change-action/6983252 similar rally was being held in Brisbane today . French president Francois Hollande - who arrived at the Valletta conference as a guest after a sombre ceremony in Paris commemorating the 130 people killed by Islamists - also expressed confidence in the global action on climate change. "We are making progress in all of our discussions on the binding element," he said. More than 140 world leaders will begin to gather in Paris over the next two days. With final preparations underway for the climate talks, Paris police prefect Michel Cadot said he was taking every precaution to ensure the safety of delegates and those in Paris. "The first message I want to deliver again today: it's a call for great vigilance from all the inhabitants of our region and a call for not using cars on Monday, because of the traffic restrictions in this area," he said. Tackling extremist violence is also high on the CHOGM agenda, with British prime minister David Cameron warning it poses a lasting threat to Commonwealth nations. "One of the most important things we can do here is talk about the perils of Islamist extremist violence and the problem of extremism more broadly," he said. "I want to put that on the agenda of the Commonwealth, particularly when you consider how many young people there are in the Commonwealth. "This is the struggle of our generation."

With the state in the grips of a jobs crisis, tens of thousands of South Australians are having to tighten their belts. But this appears to have been lost on our big-spending state politicians and bureaucrats TAXPAYERS were billed almost $100,000 to send a delegation of seven senior government officials led by Jay Weatherill on a week-long European sojourn, new figures show. Government documents reveal that earlier this year the Premier, and two advisers, spent more than $5400 for two nights at a luxury London hotel that promises "feather and down duvets with finest Frette linen". The seven-night trip's public cost was $98,067.17, which also included expenses for Environment Minister Ian Hunter, an aide and two department chiefs, to attend a climate change conference. The World Summit for Climate and Territories brought the globetrotting group of South Australians together in Lyon, in France's south east, during the European summer in June and July. The Premier, who was accompanied by chief of staff Daniel Romeo and spin doctor Jarrad Pilkington, made the keynote address. Mr Hunter was joined by chief of staff Tom Mooney, head of the Department of Environment Sandy Pitcher, and Julia Grant, the department's executive director for Water and Climate Change. The World Summit bills itself as "the principal gathering of subnational and local governments and other non-state actors in the lead up to COP 21 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference , scheduled for Paris next month. Jonathan Pickering, from the Centre for Deliberative Democracy & Global Governance at the University of Canberra, said climate change would cost much more if international action stalls "so responsible investment in climate diplomacy is good value for taxpayers". But he also said governments "need to be accountable for what they spend on travel". In a statement to The Advertiser last night, Mr Weatherill's spokesman said "as a leading jurisdiction in climate policy, we sent the necessary officials to best represent our state". But the Premier's office declined to justify why Mr Pilkington, one of Mr Weatherill's two personal press advisers, travelled despite no media activities planned. Prior to the summit, the Premier's group spent two nights in Britain "to meet with key businesses for potential investments in the state", according to documents lodged with the Department of Premier and Cabinet. Credit card statements published under the government's proactive disclosure program, show Mr Weatherill and his two advisers spent $5418.63 at the One Aldwych hotel, which describes itself as "a luxury five-star independent hotel in Covent Garden". The statements also indicate the party dined at The Delauney, a restaurant, which, according to its website, boasts of a "superb" room, "panelled, spacious, with generous gaps between tables and the sense of theatre, energy and professionalism". The trio then spent a night in Paris, where they met with submarine builder DCNS and nuclear energy company Areva. Following the Summit, they visited Italy for two nights "to lead a delegation of South Australia's Italian Community and Industry leaders, and engage with regional government officials". All up the Premier, Mr Romeo and Mr Pilkington spent $46,693.20 on the seven-night trip. Mr Hunter's four-person party visited Belgium before the summit and travelled to Denmark afterwards. Mr Hunter and Mr Mooney accrued almost $26,000 in costs, while Ms Pitcher and Ms Grant had $25,000 in expenses. In the Danish capital, the group attended more climate change meetings with officials from organisations, including Copenhagen Council, Energinet, House of Green, Ramboll and a European Commission Joint Program-ming Initiative. The group also attended a climate change conference hosted by the Bavarian Government. Mr Hunter insisted the meetings would "help inform the development of the state's new climate change strategy". "SA is recognised internation-ally as a leader in attracting renewable energy investment and adapting to climate change," he said. $98,067.17 THE PREMIER, ENVIRONMENT MINISTER AND FIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN EUROPE FROM LATE JUNE TO EARLY JULY EUROPEAN EXTRAVAGANZA WHO \'e2\- \~ Premier Jay Weatherill \'e2\- \~ Mr Weatherill's chief of staff Daniel Romeo \'e2\- \~ Senior media adviser Jarrad Pilkington \'e2\- \~ Environment Minister Ian Hunter \'e2\- \~ Mr Hunter's chief of staff Tom Mooney \'e2\- \~Sandy Pitcher, chief executive, Department of Environment \'e2\- \~Julia Grant, executive director, Water and Climate Change, Department of Environment WHEN PREMIER'S GROUP London: June 28-30 Paris: June 30-July 1 Lyon: July 1-3 Italy: July 3-5 MR HUNTER'S GROUP Belgium: June 29-July 1 Lyon: July 1-3 Copenhagen: July 3-5 WHY \'e2\- \~ All seven visited Lyon, France, to attend the World Summit, Climate and Territories.

THIS weekend the journey toward a global climate change plan will begin for Jacqui Fetchet. The 25-year-old former Nowra resident was granted a National Youth Delegate Scholarship with Global Voices and will prepare to represent Australia's youth in France come November 30 at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. As a graduate from Nowra High School and having lived on the South Coast most of her life Fetchet said her passion for climate change action and policy was a result of her realising the importance of the Shoalhaven's natural environment. 'Being close to the bush, the river and the beach has given me a real connection to it and I recognise the importance of protecting it,' she said. She said Australia's mindset was moving beyond the climate change debate. 'There's no debate. The science is clear, tested and proven and the resistance in Australia is ideological rather than scientific,' she said. 'Yes, it is time to take action across the community, government and business and hopefully that is something I think this conference will catalyse.' Ms Fetchet said her role as a representative in the non-government Civil Society Organisation would be to focus on mitigation. Renewable energy solutions and emissions reduction. 'It will act as a road map of how all countries signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) can reach a long-term goal of ensuring global warming does not increase above two degrees by the end of 2100.' Ms Fetchet said the purpose of the conference was for the 196 participating countries to work out what approach would be taken to achieve the goal. Of those countries, 146 have made climate change commitments. Ms Fetchet said that fact alone meant 85 per cent of the world's emission-producing countries were on board with the conversation to come up with a global solution. 'I think it's fantastic to see all scales of the spectrum of society in Australia and overseas getting excited and getting on board,' she said. 'I think it's a really great opportunity to broaden the types of conversations we're having, move away from these sorts of debates that create division and confuse people and start talking more about action.' 'There has a been a shift. It's all about countries taking responsibility for their own actions.' \</doc>

The leaders of some of the world's smallest nations have called for coal mining - one of Australia's biggest industries - to be shut down, in a bid to save their countries from the effects of climate change. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which includes Pacific Ocean countries like Tuvalu and Palau, said global warming was already harming their people. The AOSIS said it wanted a moratorium on new coal mines, but was realistic about its chances of convincing Australia to give up its lucrative fossil fuel assets. Tuvalu prime minister Enele Sopoaga is the new chair of the group. "We're simply seeking for the rights of small island states to survive," he said. "We feel our security is compromised; survival of the people of the Pacific is compromised." The leaders of nations like Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Palau and Nauru held a closed session for the first time ahead of this week's Pacific Islands Forum, which includes large countries like Australia. Palau president Tommy Remengesau said: "In many cases the issues of the vulnerable states do not necessarily get the necessary focus or attention that should be there." Pacific Islands predicted to be first affected by climate change The low-lying island nations of the Pacific emit a relatively small amount of carbon, but are predicted to be the first affected by sea-level rise and extreme weather events caused by global warming. The Pacific Island leaders want their wishes known before the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in November, where countries will try to reach a legally binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions. "This is the last turn of events before the world decides on an agreement that should ensure the security and survival of the people - protection and survival of the people," Mr Sopoaga said. The leaders want carbon emissions capped at a level that will stop global average temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. They also want to be able to claim compensation for the loss and damage that it is predicted their countries will suffer. But the Pacific Island nations know another climate goal to see developed countries shift to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels will not be easily achieved, especially because powerful countries like Australia would have to agree to stop building new coal mines. "Small island states have been calling for shift to renewable energy, to decarbonise the world economy if you wish, and that's why I think that call by [AOSIS] leaders, again, is not unreasonable," Mr Sopoaga said. \</doc>

Diplomat wheels turn to aid fight on climate By Clare Sibthorpe Professional cyclist Rein Schuurhuis, with son Thomas, 16 months, and from left, Dutch Deputy Head of Mission Arthur den Hartog, Shane Rattenbury, European Union Ambassador Sem Fabrizi, and British High Commissioner Menna Rawlings - on a Windows to the World mission. Photo: JAY CRONAN We're used to seeing diplomats in suits. But on Thursday morning, some dressed down with professional cyclist Rein Schuurhuis in support of the Delegation of the European Union's "climate" theme for Windows to the World. Windows to the World kicks off this weekend. It offers Canberrans a glimpse into the culture of around 50 embassies and high commissions over the weekends of Floriade. With more than 35,000 people attending the 2013 event, which was launched as part of Canberra's Centenary celebrations, it will now run every two years. ACT Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury said the European Union is leading Australia in promoting the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. "The importance of the EU in promoting that in Australia is really valuable," he said. "In 73 days the [climate change] conference will be open and we launch our chronometer today, which will be on show in our delegation," Mr Fabrizi said. Also showing off his bicycle was the Dutch Embassy's deputy head of mission, Arthur den Hartog. "When we open our embassy there'll be groups cycling around a number of embassies, and they'll pay the Dutch embassy a visit," he said. "We have solar panels on the roof that actually produce more energy than we can consume in the building." British High Commissioner Menna Rawlings said Canberra was "a fabulous city for cycling," and she was excited to open her home up to 500 people during her exhibition of Windows to the World. "We're not doing our opening until the 11th of October, we've already sold out our tickets. We're going to have the best of British - the new and the old." At December's climate change conference, leaders will work towards securing a legally binding global climate agreement to curb carbon emissions. But Mr Schuurhuis, who will compete in "Oliver's Real Food Racing" team for The National Capital Tour in Canberra over the weekend, urges everyone to take daily action. \</doc>

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has called for Peter Dutton to be dropped from Cabinet following his joke about climate change in the Pacific, but Tony Abbott has defended his minister. The conversation between the Prime Minister and Mr Dutton was picked up by a microphone before a media event and has sparked anger among Pacific Island leaders. During the exchange HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-11/dutton-overheard-joking-about-sea-levels-in-pacific-islands/6768324 Mr Abbott laughed after Mr Dutton quipped about rising sea levels in the Pacific .

Communities are losing their homes: PNG PM Papua New Guinea's prime minister Peter O'Neill questioned if Mr Dutton would be laughing if it were his own family "about to lose their home because of climate change". "Mr Dutton has admitted that climate change is real and that it is ruining Pacific Island communities," he said. "If he fails to urge his Government to act now it would demonstrate extreme disregard for people at risk. "Many communities are losing their homes to rising sea levels and people are losing their lives to lives to extreme weather brought about by climate change. "Would Mr Dutton be laughing if his family were about to lose their home because of climate change?" Mr O'Neill said he hoped the Australian Government would support the Pacific Island nations' strong stance for action on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year. The president of Kiribati HYPERLINK /news/2015-09-11/kiribati-president-lashes-peter-dutton-for-sea-levels-joke/6770034 lashed out at Mr Dutton on Friday "What kind of a person is he?

POLITICS might be "the art of the possible", but the value of compromise is sometimes overshadowed by a need to make big symbolic statements. In terms of compromise, the proposed T4 coal loader has been inching its way, literally for years, towards a conclusion of the planning process. Proponents and opponents alike have had a number of opportunities, in various forums, to put their cases, and the arguments in all directions have been extremely well ventilated. Given all that has happened so far, it will surprise few if the Planning Assessment Commission comes down in favour of the project. Veteran environmental activist John Sutton described this week's final round of consultation as "window dressing", but it's an opportunity to present a point of view that dozens and dozens of the coal loader's critics have been keen to take advantage of. And that's at least partly because the T4 loader has effectively become much more than just a single industrial project. It's a symbol - and an appropriate one at that - of the reality that is the coal industry in the 21st century: an industry that usually gets its own way, but in a world where more and more people are questioning the cost of fossil fuels. Such questions will only intensify in the months leading up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 30. Australia's pro-coal stance is well-known internationally, and successive federal governments have justified continued support for the coal industry on the grounds of national interest. Under Labor, the continued growth of the coal industry was balanced by at least the semblance of an interest in promoting renewable energy. Various government agencies, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, were mandated to work with the private sector on building Australia's expertise in clean power. Given coal's dominance of the national power grid, most people would describe all forms of renewable energy as "emerging". And given the global tide of opinion forming against coal, it would surely seem in Australia's best interests to ensure it did not have all of its energy eggs in the one unwanted basket. If the Clean Energy Finance Corporation had a long track record of failure, or if its investment portfolio was manifestly unbalanced, then Prime Minister Tony Abbott might win more support for a move that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has aptly described as "strange". By associating this week's move with an earlier failure to win Senate support to abolish the corporation, Mr Abbott has reached for the symbolic big stick. From this viewpoint, it appears to be the wrong weapon, on the wrong target. \</doc>

THE signing in Canberra on Wednesday of a free trade agreement between Australia and China puts the seal on a document that was agreed to in November, after extensive negotiations that began in 2005. As a list prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes clear, the agreement with China is only one of 18 such bilateral or multilateral agreements that Australia has signed, or is in the process of negotiating with other countries. Together, these documents help define Australia's rights and obligations in a world where international trade is increasingly free of the systems of tariffs, quotas and other restrictive barriers that were built up in earlier times. Given what is at stake for any sovereign state signing such important documents, there will always be debate about individual aspects of a particular agreement. When the China deal was struck late last year, the Australian dairy industry described the increased access to Chinese markets as a "game changer". Sugar, wheat, cotton and rice growers, however, were left disappointed. An annexe to the main document shows China will have up to 15 years to phase out some of its import duties, whereas Australia is obliged to phase its out within five years. Still, the agreement should be viewed in its totality - and in relation to other trade deals - before the full picture can be drawn. Even so, it's the fear or perception of disproportionate benefit, as well as a loss of sovereign power, that is at the heart of much public disquiet over these types of international agreements. While Australia is signing its pact with China, the United States is in the midst of a major political debate over a multilateral agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involves 12 nations, as things stand, including the US, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand. Attention is also turning to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December, which has implications for Australian coal. In each of these negotiations, Australian politicians, diplomats and bureaucrats are empowered to broker deals that may have losers as well as winners. Job security, especially in sectors facing competition from imports, is always a concern in trade deals. But Australia was built on international trade, which, by definition, is a two-way street. Negotiated strongly, such agreements help us prosper, and meet our international obligations. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has defended the Government on multiple fronts over the Paris climate change talks amid criticism from the backbench. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told leaders at the meeting Australia would make cuts of between 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030 as part of a global effort to reduce carbon emissions. He also flagged increasing the target when a review is conducted in five years' time. But Liberal MP Dennis Jensen said the Prime Minister should stick with the position of the party room. The backbencher said discussion about increasing the target was "a joke". "I will certainly be very strong on the fact that we should not change those targets and that we stick with what we agreed [in] the partyroom and we don't change," he said. "If there's discussion about it a couple of years' in the future, don't change it again." Ms Bishop said the Government would not be renegotiating its target at the Paris talks, but has kept the option open of reviewing it in 2020. "It was agreed to by our party room, it is the mandate I have in Paris, so we're not looking to renegotiate," she said. "There is no room for renegotiation ... but in five years' time we can review where we're up to. If our past history is anything to go by, we over-achieve, we exceed our targets." Acting Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said it was a sign of fresh divisions within the Federal Government. Ms Plibersek said Mr Turnbull had "well and truly scared the horses". "You see backbenchers out, already repudiating the Prime Minister for even the modest announcement that he's made," she said. "Even the damp squib in Paris is causing all sorts of problems at home, we've had to see the Foreign Minister running around this morning saying, 'nothing to see here, nothing new'." Turnbull pledges $1 billon to fight climate crisis Mr Turnbull pledged $1 billion over the next five years for the Green Climate Fund, including an initial $200 million promised earlier this year. It will be used to help Pacific Island nations deal with the threat of rising sea levels, but there will not be any new money - instead it will be funded out of the existing foreign aid budget. Ms Bishop said it was an appropriate way to pay for the scheme. "This is what the aid budget is designed to do, to assist in natural disaster relief, to build resilience against natural disasters," she said. "Indeed, this is what the small island developing nations of the Pacific are asking for." Ms Plibersek has criticised the plan, stating "this is pretty rich, considering we have actually cut funding to countries like Kiribati that are currently struggling with climate change adaptation and mitigation, in fact we cut $2.5 million from Kiribati." Greens Leader Richard Di Natale was also scathing of the decision, claiming Mr Turnbull's announcement in Paris has been a "huge disappointment". "He has not committed one extra cent to climate financing, in fact he's taken money out of the aid budget," he said. "This is a shameful exercise here. We have Malcolm Turnbull talking a big game, and failing to deliver." Government will not sign communique The Federal Government will not sign up to a communique at the Paris meeting calling for a reduction in fossil fuel subsidies, in a move welcomed by the Nationals. There were fears the communique would jeopardise the multi-billion dollar diesel fuel rebate, which subsidises the off-road use of fuel by farmers and miners. Nationals Deputy leader Barnaby Joyce said it was a "win for common sense", though the move prompted criticism from the Opposition. Ms Plibersek has criticised Mr Turnbull, claiming the Nationals have "yanked the chain" to bring the Prime Minister into line. She confirmed Labor had "no plans" to change the diesel fuel rebate. Ms Bishop said she had worries about the communique when the issue was discussed last week. "There were some paragraphs in the proposal from New Zealand that caused us some concerns and they couldn't be negotiated in time so we didn't sign up for it," she said. \</doc>

\~\~A Labor government would aim to slash carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and offset Australia's CO2 pollution by the middle of the century. \~\~ Labor would aim to cut emissions by 45 per cent on 2005 levels as part of a longer term plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \~\~ "But we should not shy away from ambition," he will tell the Lowy Institute in Sydney on Friday. \~\~ The target, roughly in line with what the independent Climate Change Authority recommends, is significantly higher than the 2030 target the government will be armed with in Paris. \~\~ "Malcolm Turnbull is flying to Paris carrying Tony Abbott's climate-sceptic baggage," Mr Shorten says. \~\~ "We don't need to believe in gravity - we know it exists," he says. \~\~ "So let's not pretend we have an obligation to give equal weight, coverage and credence to the babble of the tinfoil-hat pseudo-science brigade." \~\~ Mr Shorten warns it will require "major technological transitions" in a range of industries but maintains they're achievable and necessary. \~\~ But he uses government modelling released earlier this year as evidence the economic impact of a 45 per cent target would be "minimal". \~\~ Mr Shorten will be in Paris for the United Nations climate change conference next week, where it's hoped 195 countries will sign a deal to curb emissions and restrict global warming to two degrees. \~\~ Labor backs the five year pledge-and-review proposal and would announce a 2025 emissions reduction target within its first year in government.\~\~ \</doc>

Robyn Williams: Way back when the world first tried to negotiate changes to emissions of greenhouse gases, they went to Kyoto. Our representative there was environment Minister Robert Hill. Here, putting aside concerns about terrorists, he reflects on what could happen in Paris. Robyn Williams: One thing that puzzles me, Robert Hill, is how you go to a COP conference, say in Paris coming up, with 40,000 people milling around, how can you do that and make effective policy changes that stick? Robert Hill: Well, it is true that there is now a lot of theatre associated with the COPs, thinking Kyoto '97 we had about 8,000, and then Copenhagen 2009 was probably about 25,000, and by 2015 we were up to 40,000. So of course most of the 40,000 don't ever get into the inner circle, but their presence indicates a broad public interest in the issues. It's a good thing in the sense that people feel that they want to participate, and they get to participate in a lot of the side events which tend to be relating to the sort of programs that need to be implemented to actually bring about change. So some will be focusing on reforestation, some on soil carbon, some on the built environment, and so it goes on. Robyn Williams: So it's not simply a milling around, in other words a gigantic junket, as some newspapers suggest? Robert Hill: Well, most of the 40,000 would have paid for themselves and they are going there because they feel that they are making a contribution and they want to contribute to better outcomes. So no, I don't see it as a junket. Robyn Williams: This time they've done something slightly different with the timing itself so that you've got many of the leaders arriving early rather than at the last minute so that there is a kind of extended drama; will there be a decision or will there not? So do you think that's a good move? Robert Hill: This time it's entirely different because the design is not to lead to an outcome on targets. The targets are now voluntary targets and leaders will come on the first day and confirm the target that they are prepared to accept, and then they'll leave, whereas Copenhagen they came on the last day and couldn't reach agreement and the whole thing fell apart. Well, France wasn't going to fall into the same mistake. So the targets will be known from the beginning, and then the rest of the conference, as far as it is an agreement between nation states, will be looking at issues such as whether it can be enforceable, transfers of technology, and particularly finance for the developing world to adopt green technologies. Robyn Williams: How did you find Kyoto yourself when you turned up as an Environment Minister representing Australia? Robert Hill: Well, Kyoto was much more serious I guess in terms of national interest because there was to be determined for you a target which was going to be legally binding, and you knew that target would have economic consequences. So it only applied to the industrialised countries. There was an overall saving in carbon determined and then it was a question as to what each of the industrialised countries would accept to achieve that target. So you didn't quite know what would be the outcome until the last moment when the targets were read out by the chairman and the gavel was brought down before anyone had a chance to stand up and object. But of course it doesn't quite work like that because we had all pre-negotiated our targets. But still, there was an element of uncertainty and tension in the air and it was quite dramatic. Robyn Williams: Well, legend has it that you, like a poker player, held out until the last moment and did this wonderful deal for Australia. Are you implying that wasn't quite the case? Robert Hill: Well, I've never quite expressed it like that, but what we had determined is what we could afford, taking into account that carbon abatement costs in Australia were very high and we had built our economy on cheap coal and large transport costs and also a strong agricultural bias, so the costs of abatement were comparatively very high. But we had determined a target that we believe we could meet and we stuck with that target, and the COP agreed to our figure. And the best thing about it was that Australia actually achieved its target within the time frame. So we are one of the few countries in the world that has actually achieved a target that has been set for us at a COP. Robyn Williams: Well, it was suggested that we actually got away with quite a lot in the sense that the concessions that you got for clearing of land were terribly generous. Robert Hill: Well, no, not in those terms. What we also negotiated was the language, and we negotiated a clause which came to be known as the Australia Clause which dealt with the issue of land clearing. Land clearing in Australia is different to the rest of the world. The Europeans can't get their head around Australian scrub, and therefore didn't want to agree to stopping clearing of scrub being allowed. But the facts were that land clearing in Australia was contributing significantly to Australia's greenhouse emissions. In many ways our emissions' profile was closer to that of a developing country than a developed country. And when we finally convinced them of that, we got the Australia Clause we needed, we got our target, which was +8 at that point, and so it ended. But people said that +8 was high. Well, on the face of it you'd say it's higher than others, but the concept was that we would all equally share the burden. So that was the challenge, to try and work out what was a fair distribution of the burden among the industrialised countries. Robyn Williams: Given the time that's elapsed since Kyoto and some of the dire predictions from some quarters, some of the scientists about climate change, what do you think must come out of Paris this time? Robert Hill: Well, in an ideal world I would like an outcome whereby the international community...and we have got to the stage now where we are looking for an agreement between all nation states, not just the industrialised world. That has become essential because the big developing countries are now very major emitters. I'd like the aggregate of the bids of the nation states to amount to something that would keep climate change under the two-degree figure. I don't think we are going to achieve that but it's going to be a much better outcome than we've had in the past. And I think attitudes are changing, I think the mindset of the nation states is changing. They are taking the issue more seriously. There's a lot more opportunities now through energy efficiency, new technologies, the development of renewable energy and the like to find alternative ways to produce energy. So it's taking a long time. Kyoto was 1997, Paris COP is 2015, and unfortunately the climate situation continues to worsen. But I think that the outcome of Paris, from my perspective anyway, will be that actually nation states have decided that they do need to address this issue seriously and they do need to get to figures that will lead to that reduction to under the two-degree figure. So I don't think that will all be achieved at Paris but I think we will be on the path to achieving that goal. Robyn Williams: The process itself, is it a friendly one or is it clenched teeth? Robert Hill: No, it's very serious, particularly if you are small developing country that, in the worst instances, actually sees yourself going out of existence through rising sea level, and it's not surprising that there is a lot of passion and that they'll point the finger at those who have created the problem in the first instance and at the same time grown wealthy from it. So there is that tension in this debate and we should understand and respect that. But in the end we are all in it together and we have to find a solution as a global community. And I would like to think we are closer now to finding that solution than we have been in the past. Robyn Williams: Let's hope he is right. Robert Hill was Prime Minister John Howard's Environment Minister, and then our ambassador at the United Nations. \</doc>

\~\~Malcolm Turnbull and his treasurer, whoever that may be, will face some tough economic challenges but are also beneficiaries of some good luck. \~\~ Since the Abbott government was elected in 2013 the unemployment rate has risen from 5.6 per cent to 6.2 per cent. \~\~ For one thing, the exchange rate has finally fallen far enough to be helping, rather than hindering the economy's withdrawal from dependence on the mining investment boom. \~\~ Growth is now focused where the jobs are. \~\~ And they are more likely to be owned by Australians, meaning more of the income stays here. \~\~ The unemployment rate may already have peaked just in time for Mr Turnbull's swearing in. \~\~ After frightening the wits out of voters with tales of unmanageable debt and ballooning deficits, the government has failed to deliver on its promise to whip the budget into shape. \~\~ But the economy's transition - or "rebalancing" as economists optimistically call it - will help. \~\~ And by switching growth to non-mining businesses, which pay a much higher proportion of their gross profits in tax than mining firms, the transition will mean faster growth in company tax revenue. \~\~ That will be tough, especially with a Senate in no mood to grant favours. \~\~ The task will be to come up with a credible policy approach ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, beginning on November 30. \~\~ Even then, Mr Turnbull may have another stroke of luck - if it can be called that - the El Nino climate pattern currently building in the Pacific Ocean. \</doc>

Tony Abbott has admitted Australia\'e2\€  s post-2020 emissions cuts will be a drag on the economy amid criticism from experts they will still fail to limit temperature rises to less than 2C. The Prime Minister announced yesterday Australia would commit to reduce its carbon emissions 26 to 28 per cent on year 2005 levels by 2030. The target, to go to a crucial United Nations climate change conference in Paris this year, puts Australia in the middle of the pack. But it is well short of the recommendation of the Government\'e2\€  s independent adviser, the Climate Change Authority, for a 40 to 60 per cent cut by 2030 on 2000 levels for Australia to do its fair share. Business reaction was mixed. The Australian Industry Group said delivering the target with existing policies would cost up to $250 billion in unadjusted terms. The Minerals Council of Australia said the target was credible and appropriate but would strain the economy. Climate Institute chief executive John Connor said the target was weak and if other countries took the same approach, the world would warm a dangerous 3C to 4C. Mr Abbott said the target led the world because it halved Australia\'e2\€  s per capita emissions. The centrepiece of the Government\'e2\€  s direct action policy, the Emissions Reduction Fund, would be responsible for more than one-third of the target by continuing to pay polluters to cut emissions. \'e2\€  It\'e2\€  s a good, solid economically responsible, environmentally responsible target,\'e2\€ Mr Abbott said. In a marked change, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said letting industry buy cheap overseas carbon credits was an option, though it would be possible to meet the target without them. Though the PM lambasted Labor for its carbon tax as a threat to jobs and the economy, he conceded the Government\'e2\€  s target was not painless. It would reduce gross domestic product 0.2 to 0.3 per cent by 2030 \'e2\€  the equivalent of $3 billion to $4 billion today. Mr Abbott said extending the ERF would cost taxpayers only an extra $200 million a year and the policy did not depend on the coal industry\'e2\€  s demise to get deep reductions. Ms Bishop confirmed she would lead the team in Paris, though Mr Abbott said he would go if a substantial number of world leaders attended. Carbon market analyst RepuTex said Australian emissions were projected to grow 12 per cent over the next decade because of deforestation and growth in coal and gas exports. Strong action would be needed to curb that, let alone reduce emissions, executive directer Hugh Grossman said. \</doc>

The 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) will run from November 30 through to December 11 and the fully-electric car fleet will be used to move more than 20,000 delegates from 195 countries throughout Paris. It will be the first time the UN has used a full zero-emission vehicle fleet for its entire passenger car shuttle service at a COP event. The COP21 The vehicles will be in service on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis to get delegates to key venues throughout the conference as a complement to public transport. As part of its EV strategy, the Renault-Nissan Alliance will work with a number of French companies to set up a network of more than 50 quick and standard charging stations throughout Paris, all powered by 100 per cent renewable energy and able to charge the EVs from zero to 80 per cent capacity in about 30 minutes. The goals of the Paris summit are to have a new global climate-change agreement in place by the end of 2015 and to have the Climate Green Fund, established to help developing countries adapt to climate change and reduce emissions, start allocating funds. \</doc>

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: It's a little like a speed dating version of international diplomacy. One hundred and fifty world leaders have made history by delivering three-minute speeches to the global climate change talks in Paris. There was plenty of soaring rhetoric, but the key details of a possible agreement still need to be worked out. In a moment, we'll have analysis live from Paris, but first here's a sample of the leaders' speeches: CAPTION: Australia: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Emitter ranking: 17 (source: Union of Concerned Scientists). Policy ranking: Inadequate (Source: Climate Action Tracker). MALCOLM TURNBULL, PRIME MINISTER ( Cop21 conference, Paris): We are not daunted by our challenge. It inspires us; it energises us. We do not doubt the implications of the science or the scale of the challenge. But above all, we do not doubt the capacity of humanity to meet it with imagination, innovation. CAPTION: United States: president Barack Obama. Emitter ranking: 2 (source: Union of Concerned Scientists). Policy ranking: Medium (Source: Climate Action Tracker). BARACK OBAMA, US PRESIDENT ( Cop21 conference, Paris): The growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other. And what should give us hope that this is a turning point; that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet; is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realisation that it is within our power to do something about it. CAPTION: United Kingdom: prime minister David Cameron. Emitter ranking: 11 (source: Union of Concerned Scientists). Policy ranking: Medium (Source: Climate Action Tracker). DAVID CAMERON, UK PRIME MINISTER ( Cop21 conference, Paris): Let's just imagine for a moment what we would have to say to our grandchildren if we failed. We'd have to say, "It was all too difficult. And they would reply, "Well, what was so difficult? What was it that was so difficult when the earth was in peril: when the sea levels were rising in 2015, when crops were failing, when deserts were expanding?"

\~\~As a historic global climate change agreement appears within reach, environment and aid groups are questioning Australia's commitment to doing its fair share. \~\~ After 13 days of gruelling negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, French Foreign Minister and conference president Laurent Fabius revealed the final draft agreement on Saturday. \~\~ To lengthy applause and a standing ovation, he said the legally binding agreement represented a balanced version of a document forged by all 196 parties together. \~\~ Climate Institute chief executive John Connor said Australia would have to "urgently" lift its game on pollution targets and climate finance for poorer countries if it wanted to maintain integrity. \~\~ "Without stronger action 2030-country commitments will leave Australia as the highest per capita polluter in the G20 alongside just Saudi Arabia." \~\~ "The Paris agreement can be a major marker in the fight against hunger, poverty and inequality," she said. \~\~ Ben Davison from ACTU said Australians should recognise that the transition to a low carbon economy is "just", and added that low-income households and poor nations shouldn't have to bear the costs. \~\~ Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy urged the government to "unshackle" the country from dirty power and boost investment in renewable energy. \~\~ They include a 26 to 28-per-cent emissions reduction target by 2030, which has been criticised as placing Australia at the back of the developed pack. \~\~ Earlier Mr Fabius thanked negotiators for their hard work, hailing the summit as successful. \~\~ "We are almost at the end of the path and no doubt embarking on another," he told delegates from 196 parties. \~\~ He said he was convinced the draft represented the best possible balance between the demands of nations \~\~ Negotiators were given a few hours to review the text before returning to vote on Saturday afternoon. \</doc>

Malta | Malcolm Turnbull's use of the word "heroic" to describe Bill Shorten's highly-ambitious reduction targets says a lot about the Prime Minister's mindset heading into the massive United Nations climate change conference in Paris. The man who once declared he didn't want to lead a party "not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am" will line up with the likes of US President Barack Obama and China's Xi Jinping, in the French capital, armed with an unaltered version of his predecessor's climate policy. It is a response to global warming Turnbull variously described as "bullshit" (in its early stages) and "a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale" before becoming Prime Minister. Keeping Tony Abbott's policies means Australia will stick with the taxpayer-funded Direct Action carbon abatement scheme, keep carbon reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 and retain a contribution of $1 billion over five years to the UN's Green Climate Fund, set up to help developing countries adapt to climate change. All this ensures it will be difficult for Turnbull to perform an act of environmental heroism in Paris. At a conference where public perception and political momentum will be critical to its success, the political deals Turnbull struck to get the top job may prevent him from making a grand gesture using public money. Turnbull laid out how he intends to respond to this challenge during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta on the weekend. By emphasising "innovation and technology can play a very big part in the discussions", he signalled a key part of the Australian approach will be to mobilise the private sector. For Turnbull, innovative finance does not necessarily mean the government writes out cheques. Instead, he is hoping improvements in technology - improved battery storage regularly mentioned in his press conferences - that makes renewable energy and other green projects more attractive to investors. As environment minister during the dying days of the Howard government, Turnbull was perfectly placed to witness the affect of generous subsidies for rooftop solar panels. The scheme was expensive, but over time the cost has fallen to the point where it is arguably starting to become competitive with the established grid. Certainly, the cost will fall further if better batteries capable of storing the solar energy are produced. This has big implications for Australians but also the 1.3 billion people - mostly living in sub-Saharan African or developing Asian countries - that do not have access to electricity. As a former communications minister, Turnbull knows the effect mobile telephone networks have had in developing countries by providing basic communications for people without the need for governments to build capital intensive, linear infrastructure such as a fixed-line network. He believes the solar panels - combined with improved storage - can have the same affect on electricity networks in developing countries. But progress will only be made if the private sector shoulders much of the burden. \</doc>

The Marshall Islands is calling on Australia to bring forward its carbon emissions reduction target by five years to be in line with the United States. Foreign Minister Tony de Brum also wants Australia to pledge "significant" funds to help developing nations like the Marshall Islands adapt to climate change and repair damage. Mr de Brum believes Australia should be a team player and sit down at December's United Nations climate change conference in Paris on the side of the Pacific Islands. Australia is at the back of the developed nations pack with its pledge to slash emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels and Mr de Brum has been critical of the goal. The US has committed to the same targets by 2025 and Mr de Brum urged Australia to match that aim. "If they move the date from 2030 to 2025 with the same figures, that's a very good beginning," he told AAP on Tuesday. "It's important that our biggest Pacific island be part of our team and not running around saying that coal is the lifesaver of the world." Several government figures, including former prime minister Tony Abbott, have defended coal as "good for humanity" but Pacific nations are calling for a moratorium on new mines. Mr de Brum's call for an accelerated target comes after meetings with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, who is touring the region to focus on climate change and the risks of rising sea levels. Mr Shorten promised Labor would release more ambitious 2030 targets based on the country's fair share to limit global warming to two degrees. "We'll back in the best science," Mr Shorten said, after touring what remains of Anebok island, where nothing but a few rocks poke through the rising waters. The Marshall Islands - a collection of atolls lying close to sea level - is thought to be on the front line of global warming, with residents already feeling the effects of changing weather patterns and inundation. The notion of negotiating in Paris as part of the Pacific Islands team appears unlikely to win over Australia, as the government is firm on the international goal of limiting warming to two degrees. In September, Australia refused to back a push at the Pacific Islands Forum that global warming should be limited to 1.5 degrees. An evaluation of the pledges submitted for the UN negotiations shows the world will warm by 2.7 per cent by the end of the century if nations meet their targets. That is not good enough for the Marshall Islands and Mr de Brum is hoping significant emitters and developed nations such as Australia will shift their positions. "If we were to take that as gospel we wouldn't be going to Paris," he said. "We would go under, there's no debate on that issue any more." \</doc>

Queensland's Environment Minister has said the state is about to get a taste of the impacts of climate change, with one of the worst ever coral bleaching events predicted for this Christmas. Speaking from Paris, where he is attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference , Steven Miles said the crucial meeting "at this stage appears to be going quite to plan", with the world's nations inching closer to an agreement which is expected to keep global warming below 2 degrees. But the world is already halfway there, with scientists warning the global temperature has already increased by 1 degree on pre-industrial levels. Mr Miles said that jump had already had "a very substantial impact" on the world's reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and was in danger of becoming worse. "It looks like we will be getting a sneak peak over Christmas, early next year, unfortunately, of what climate change will do to the Great Barrier Reef," he said. "Scientists are predicting a high likelihood of the worst ever coral bleaching, because basically, El Nino is super-charging ocean temperatures. "It is a real worry, but it is also what we will see more of as temperatures continue to rise - 90 per cent of the extra heat goes into the oceans, and if the species can't adapt, they won't survive." Coral bleaching occurs when the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, a tiny marine algae that lives inside its tissue and gives coral most of its colour, breaks down, revealing the coral's white skeleton. Most coral relies on the algae for food and begins to starve without it. While the coral can recover if conditions return to normal - bringing the zooxanthellae back - the stress usually causes decreased growth and reproduction, and makes the coral more susceptible to disease. Scientists have been HYPERLINK http://www.smh.com.au/environment/more-than-a-third-of-worlds-coral-reef-face-major-bleaching-event-20151008-gk49ns.html warning since October It's only the third of its kind in recorded history and some predictions show more than 12,000 square kilometres of reef worldwide was at risk. The impact to the Great Barrier Reef is expected to become clear by early next year. Mr Miles said his role at the conference had been to "make sure everyone here knows the impact climate change is having and will have on our reef". "The good news is, there is a very high awareness of the Great Barrier Reef here," he said. "People acknowledge that it is one of the things that is at stake, if we don't come to some sort of agreement that will work. The launch of the David Attenborough documentary on the reef was very well attended and it is of a concern at this conference. "So I would say I am hopeful of an agreement, but there is a long way to go in a few days, and we will probably run past the [weekend] deadline. What I have noticed is that there seems to be a lot of surprise at where things are at right now with climate change." The conference is due to come to an agreement by December 11.

\~\~Australia has "serious concerns" over the latest form of a global climate agreement, with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop warning of a challenging few days ahead in Paris. \~\~ A new draft agreement was revealed on Wednesday at the United Nations climate change conference , with no clear landing point on key hurdles of finance, ambition and differentiation. \~\~ Ms Bishop warned the document was a long way from attracting her signature. \~\~ "We are deeply disappointed at the weakening of several provisions," he said on Wednesday night. \~\~ It comes as the United States joined around 100 countries in a new alliance dubbed the high ambition coalition which vows to strengthen Wednesday's draft. \~\~ "We will not accept a minimalist or barebones agreement," he told media on Wednesday night. \~\~ It also wants recognition of an ambition to limit global warming to 1.5C - below the 2C target accepted by most developed countries. \~\~ "I'll have to check on that, we've got so many invitations to so many events and so many groupings," she told reporters in Paris. \~\~ "Clearly, this is the beginning of the end of the negotiations and there's still a lot of work to be done," she said. \~\~ There's still disagreement on who should do what, with an option still in the draft agreement to hold only rich countries to account on action. \~\~ Australia opposes that option, calling for each country to do its part to curb global emissions. \~\~ Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke gave the new draft a pretty disappointing report card, concerned about a lack of agreement over financing action against climate change. \~\~ But Climate Institute deputy chief executive Erwin Jackson said progress on other areas like technology transfer showed real commitment from countries to deliver an outcome. \~\~ Earlier, the foreign minister flagged Australia's intention to sign onto a New Zealand-led initiative to boost transparency and integrity of international carbon markets. \</doc>

An Australian scientist has written a new children's book, just in time for Christmas, that weaves the impacts of climate change into a story about Santa Claus, his reindeers and an evil billionaire. Author Dr Ian Irvine, who has been a scientist for over three decades, first came up with the idea of marrying Christmas and climate change together for his eBook The Last Christmas, The North Pole is melting! two years ago. "I have always been interested in environmental issues and it just sort of seemed to me that a great idea for a Christmas story for young kids would be about what it would actually be like for Santa Claus, the elves and the reindeer if the North Pole is melting," Dr Irvine said. "The ice at the North Pole isn't very thick and over the last 30 years or so it has been getting a lot thinner, it is shrinking. "It used to cover millions of square kilometres but now there is much less than that because of climate change." The story focuses on the littlest reindeer, Vixen, and her challenge to save Santa's village and workshop from billionaire villain Mr Sneer who wants to steal Christmas for himself. In the background of the story, the ice at the North Pole slowly melts away. "It seemed like a great story idea that the ice at the North Pole is cracking up, what is going to happen to Santa and the elves, but more importantly, what is going to happen to the kids at Christmas," Dr Irvine said. "The stories make the problems of climate change real for the kids, they can see the characters in the story are really affected by climate change," Dr Irvine said. "It is intended to be a great story for kids but as part of that story, because the background is the ice melting, it is a really good way for parents to talk to their kids in an easy and understandable way about the consequences of climate change. "Parents can ask their children, 'What can we do about it? What can our family do for climate change?'." Dr Irvine said the book, targeted for five to ten-year-olds, helps break down information on climate change that can sometimes be too difficult for children in primary school to understand. "Most of the information people get about climate change tends to come from scientists and politicians, it is fairly high level information," he said. "I don't think there is really good information out there that aims to talk about these problems in a way that kids in primary school can understand. "In some respects, a story that talks about these issues is better than someone teaching this to kids in class. "That is important, it is the kids in primary school that are going to be affected by climate change." The eBook's release comes as world leaders sit down in Paris to discuss a new international agreement in climate change action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, running until December 11.

\~\~Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used her few moments on the world stage at major climate talks in Paris to spruik the federal government's new innovation package. \~\~ Despite being thousands of kilometres from Australia, Ms Bishop wrapped some domestic politics into her national statement to the United Nations climate change conference on Monday night (AEDT). \~\~ Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday revealed the $1.1 billion innovation package to encourage entrepreneurship and promote science, maths and computing in schools. \~\~ "By supporting and rewarding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship Australia will lead by example in the way we invest in and use technology." \~\~ Ms Bishop also announced $625,000 in funding out to 2017 to promote women from the Pacific region into leadership roles in climate action. \~\~ She used her statement to spruik Australia's renewable energy target - which requires 20 per cent of the nation's energy to come from clean sources by 2020 - and the government's "ambitious" 2030 emission reduction targets. \~\~ Australia's 2030 target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels has been criticised as lacking ambition and placing the country at the back of the developed nation pack in Paris. \~\~ "Weasel words and buzzwords aren't fooling anyone," he said. \~\~ It's hoped 196 parties will forge a historic agreement by the end of the week to curb emissions and limit global warming to at least two degrees, however many major issues remain unsolved with just days to go. \~\~ Australia's foreign minister was left red-faced last week when she accused her domestic counterpart Tanya Plibersek of fabricating a story about an island which lies underwater. \~\~ The whole saga boils down to the wrong island being included in an interview transcript. \~\~ "Let's get some facts on the record because some seem to have a great deal of difficulty dealing with facts," Ms Bishop told reporters in Paris. \</doc>

THE Paris United Nations Climate Change conference will be remembered as the time the past either acknowledged its responsibility to the future or turned its back on it in favour of perceived short-term benefit. Global warming is already causing changes to climate that have serious and costly negative impacts over the next two decades. They will become even worse over time unless warming is restricted. Research recently completed in Townsville via a pilot study funded by the Queensland Government through the Local Government Association of Queensland is meant to better inform councils of the level and cost of the adaptation they already face. Townsville has the prospect of 4200 homes being flooded and a bill for $1.7 billion just to protect its inner city, work that must be done by 2027. Climate change mapping for the Sunshine Coast indicates the extent of our vulnerability and asks the obvious question of why we keep adding to it through poor short-sighted planning decisions. Those who profit from that short-sightedness won't be the ones to pay its costs. That responsibility will fall to the next generation, our kids and grandkids, the ones who some in this community would sacrifice the environment for, to provide them with jobs and to ensure they lived next door. Stupidity and ignorance have never in the history of this planet succeeded over knowledge and science, though they have repeatedly caused both to be ignored, at great cost. More than 140 countries are gathering in Paris seeking consensus on targets to address a shared threat. It will require a global response and certainly one greater than our Government's commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 2030 by between 26% and 28% on 2005 levels. That's a Tony Abbott commitment that belongs with him - in the past. Labor's 45% reduction may be considered "brave" by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, but it also falls well short of the zero emission target already proven possible by research from groups like Beyond Zero Emissions. The world is in transition. Our choice is to profit from being ahead of the curve or to lag behind it. What is certain is a failure to act in any meaningful way will make ludicrous any pretensions the Sunshine Coast may be the healthiest place on Earth by 2030 or a model for sustainability. Both worthy ambitions have no hope while all three levels of government remain transfixed by "growth" and jobs the next real estate development deal will bring. French president Francois Hollande told the opening session of the Paris talks that "what is at stake is the future of the planet, of life". He is right. So too is Mohamed Adow, climate advisor for UK-based Christian Aid, who warns developing countries will suffer significantly even if warming is contained to a 1.5 degree increase. It's more than time to dismiss ignorance and stupidity in favour of a future our children can live in. \</doc>

ADVANCED manufacturing industries are among those that might be attracted to the state by low-carbon nuclear energy, says Royal Commissioner Kevin Scarce. In a Sunday Mail interview, the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commissioner said he was investigating whether nuclear energy's high cost might be offset by the plentiful supply of low-emission electricity luring new industry. Rear Admiral Scarce, pictured, said a team was studying the costs and various technology involved in these reactors, as part of a business case to be compiled into his final report in May. "I think the issue for us is when you look at such huge capital costs it's pretty much out of the scale of private enterprise," he said. "So that really leads you to question whether that might work in South Australia." The state Economic Development Board has held business meetings in Adelaide and Melbourne in a bid to discover the opportunities posed by low-carbon nuclear energy, should SA proceed. "The challenge is to try and put some credible numbers around those opportunities," Rear Admiral Scarce said. "There's a range of views within business. Some believe such a large capital-intensive project is beyond Australia's capabilities. Others believe it's a wonderful opportunity to reinvigorate the business environment because of that potential for clean energy at a reasonable cost." At current rates, Australia will not meet the goal of zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Rear Admiral Scarce said the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 29 might again change the landscape. Australia will be represented at the conference, which runs until December 11, at various stages by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt. Rear Admiral Scarce said he was encouraged by the renewed national debate on nuclear issues, triggered by Mr Turnbull's appointment last month of Dr Alan Finkel as Australia's next chief scientist. Dr Finkel, whose advice Rear Admiral Scarce will seek, has declared nuclear energy should be considered as part of a low-emissions future. "We've said all along that this can't be a South Australian decision," Rear Admiral Scarce said. "It's a debate that's critical to the industry. "Whatever way it goes, South Australia cannot manage this activity by itself. If we did go ahead, that bipartisan environment would be essential, both local and federal." The Royal Commission this week will start public sessions examining low- and high-level nuclear waste dumps. Federal Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg on Friday released a shortlist of six sites earmarked for a National Radioactive Waste Management Facility, three of which were in South Australia.Rear Admiral Scarce said the federal tender process was completely separate from the Commission's work and it was not involved in the process. "The Commission has its terms of reference and is making a fully independent analysis of the entire nuclear fuel cycle as it relates to South Australia, not just the issue of waste management," he said. \</doc>

In a forceful address to the GLACIER conference (August 31) in Anchorage, Alaska, US president Barack Obama declared: "Unless the world acts more aggressively and more quickly, entire nations will find themselves with severe problems including; more droughts, more floods, more rising sea levels, more refugees, more food scarcity and more conflict." He went on: "Any leader willing to take a gamble on a future like that, any leader who refuses to take this issue seriously or treats it like a joke, is not fit to lead." Tony Abbott and his cabinet are a mix of climate-change deniers and sceptics, causing Australians serious concern that the government is underestimating the seriousness of climate change. Interestingly, only one government minister possesses tertiary science qualifications, yet here they are charged with joint responsibility in addressing 'the greatest threat to mankind'. Ian Dunlop, a former chairman of the Australian Coal Association, recently said: 'The Abbott government seems determined to ignore science, disputes emerging solutions, downplays international agreements, stymies renewable energy proposals and refuses to accept our responsibility to lead.' One can only conclude that the forthcoming United Nations climate change conference in Paris will embarrassingly expose the inadequacies of the Abbott government in preparing for the serious consequences of climate change and their capacity to lead on this critical issue. Thanks CJ Coughlan (Letters to the editor, September 1) for your concise precis of last Saturday's anti-Islam protest and counter-protest rallies in Bendigo. I'm glad to note that you did get down to the alternative peaceful gathering at the Chinese Gardens during the day, too. At the 'Fill this space with Respect' community gathering, families and genuine Bendigonians of all ages and walks of life enjoyed a free barbecue, music, colourful children's activities, great conviviality, informed conversation and an enlightened, bravely self-deprecating speaker in 'Go Back To Where You Came From' participant, Andrew Jackson. I was proud to be part of a gathering at which there was no slogan chanting and no one screaming obscenities over a loudspeaker. There was no belligerent hate-based patriotism, no flag-wearing disgraced and no disgraceful City of Greater Bendigo councillor. There were no extremist flag-festooned 'patriots' or mask-wearing 'socialists' from who-knows-where furthering their own dubious agendas at Bendigo's reputational expense. There was no police presence, no flag-burning, no capsicum spray, no violence and, somewhat unsurprisingly, very little media attention. Despite our smaller numbers, I remain convinced that we represent the majority of Bendigo residents who are diverse, inclusive and respectful. I would like to reply to a recent letter by saying that I am very thankful that I had religious education both at school and Sunday school as a child. I am now old (91-years-of-age) and the religious education that I had as a child has given me something very precious to remember both in strength of mind and always doing what is right to myself and other people. I am very much in favour of religious education in schools. I wish it for my great-grandchildren so that they can have the strong background of learning right from wrong and loving God and all people that I had. \</doc>

Same-sex marriage As momentum has grown for reform of the Marriage Act, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has shifted from openness to a debate and free vote in the party room to active resistance. Whatever his stance, Mr Abbott is at the helm of a party divided as the cross-party bill to legalise nears introduction. The powerful conservative wing is leading the charge to prevent a free vote, while moderates are still working - publicly and privately - to make it happen. On the conservative side, standard-bearers Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi have been the most vocal. The leaders of the moderate insurrection are Warren Entsch and Teresa Gambaro, who will co-sponsor this month's bill. Malcolm Turnbull, Josh Frydenberg, Kelly O'Dwyer, Ewen Jones and Wyatt Roy have all publicly declared support for the reform and called for a free vote. In July, the gay marriage lobby estimated that 15 Liberals supported the reform, 25 were undecided or undeclared and 62 opposed it. With any parliamentary vote on the bill set to be close, these numbers will be the difference between success and failure. The speakership The backbench has chosen to flex its muscles when it comes to Bronwyn Bishop's successor in the chair. As soon as Mrs Bishop was out and the candidates were emerging, Liberals were demanding the Prime Minister back off and not subject them to another "captain's pick". Mrs Bishop's elevation to the speakership was itself one of Mr Abbott's earliest captain's picks. Other unilateral decisions that have attracted the ire of both the public and Coalition MPs include the reintroduction of knighthoods and the subsequent decision to bestow one on Prince Philip, the paid parental leave scheme, citizenship changes and banning ministers from appearing on the ABC's Q&A program. On Tuesday, even the Prime Minister mocked this history and said he understood why people would "scoff away" what could be a "kiss of death" for a candidate for Speaker. After the handling of the expenses scandals in the past three weeks, Mr Abbott's authority is weakened. When it comes to the new Speaker, if the Prime Minister is seen to be too interfering, it will anger many inside the party. Carbon emissions The government's post-2020 climate change policy is expected to be presented to cabinet and then the party room this week. Environment Minister Greg Hunt has said these targets will be "serious and credible" and more ambitious than the 2020 target (5 per cent reduction on greenhouse gas emissions). He and the government are under significant public, political and international pressure to deliver on this promise. However, with scepticism rife, there will be party room opposition to tough targets, with some MPs not accepting the scientific consensus on the matter and concerned about economic impacts. The independent Climate Change Authority, a body the government attempted to abolish, has recommended that Australia push for a 30 per cent reduction by 2025 and 40 to 60 per cent by 2030. The United States announced emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 and 80 per cent by 2050. Australia will have to bring its policies to November's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The conference hopes to achieve global consensus on legally binding post-2020 policy. \</doc>

The protected industry: the dinosaur of coal In the same week that the government approves a foreign-owned coal mine on prime agricultural land, it withdraws funding for renewable energy projects (The Age, 13/7). This, in the same year that the budget offered a $5 billion loan scheme to coal companies to fund expansion in the Galilee Basin. The government is funding the technology dinosaur of coal - and risking our health, and our economic and environmental future - through its refusal to act on climate change. The appalling policy direction ill equips us as we head towards a legally binding, universal agreement on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. An election, anyone?Pauline Hopkins, Beaconsfield Listen to the people, Prime Minister Recently I drove 150 kilometres from Munich to Deggendorf. I was staggered by the profusion of solar panels: on the roofs of houses and even on barns in the middle of nowhere, and frequently arranged densely in fields. There were also many wind farms, their blades gracefully turning. I felt ashamed to be an Australian. I am 67 and I cannot remember a previous prime minister so out of step with the thinking of the majority of Australians on so vital an issue. Graeme Brazenor, Richmond An issue that transcends political alliance Tony Abbott, while you hold the title of prime minister, you are obliged to make decisions in the nation's interests, based on scientific, economic, etc research. You are not entitled to govern to suit your personal predilections or vested interests. Your attitudes to renewable and clean energy have left you on the wrong side of history. These issues transcend political alliance. The health of our children, and the environment they will inherit, overrides all other considerations. If you are unable to govern in our nation's interests, please resign. Lloyd Shield, Moonee Ponds We could be a leader in renewable energy While the rest of the world embraces alternative energy, Australia, with its abundance of sun and wind, goes down the old path of coal. Additionally, the decision of approving another coal mine on prime agricultural land is baffling. Either the parties involved are getting some political kickback or they are stupid. Australia could be a leader in renewable and alternative energy, yet we dig up our resources and sell them at rapidly reducing prices. I am not sure the ALP can offer an alternative to the current government. Maybe a Labor/Greens coalition? Dean Virgin, Strathmore Abbott's decision defies comprehension I understand that living in a democracy will mean a swath of conflicting views, and whilst I despair of our government I accept that it was elected. But an attack on wind farms? The world is calling with rare consensus for the development of clean energy. And our prime minister wants to block such development? Utterly incomprehensible. Les Littleford, Clifton Springs The royal commission that we really need Most developed countries are embracing clean energy sources as vital approaches to reducing carbon emissions. Coal is viewed as a sunset industry, However, big coal puts a lot of effort into lobbying governments. A royal commission can be an expensive way to discredit political opponents but voters deserve an investigation of the links, financial and others, between big coal and the government.Rod Anderson, Sandringham \</doc>

This content is produced by The Australian Financial Review in commercial partnership with GE. Australia will head to the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year in Paris as one of the outliers among world governments as the only government to introduce a carbon price and then repeal it. We've also reduced the renewable energy target although we're very close to getting a RET agreement signed into law with a draft bill passed in the lower house last week. GE's general manager of renewable sales in the Asia Pacific, Peter Cowling, says Australia needs to look to Paris before we outline the nation's long-term energy plan. Unlike the Copenhagen conference in 2009 there are stronger hopes for Paris with the French government lobbying participants hard to reach an agreement on ensuring the world doesn't go beyond the two-degree warming level (above pre-industrial levels) already agreed upon. "We need to acknowledge that climate change is real and a response is required," Mr Cowling says. "What the Paris conference will hopefully do is focus people on what a two-degree warming world will look like and what it will take to keep it from breaching that level. And we know it will take pretty substantial decarbonisation across the economy." For Cowling, the danger for Australia is if we don't transition to a decarbonised future we could easily find ourselves facing issues in competitiveness. Yet while the Abbott government might not be taking the lead on global warming, Cowling is quietly confident we are finally on the right track. He says the RET agreement represents a big step for the nation and the energy market. While we've experimented with an emissions trading scheme through a direct carbon price and a few other measures, Cowling says the RET should now lead us towards establishing a proper framework. "There really isn't a downside to the RET. It's an effective measure and all the government now needs to do is set that framework. "That's the fun bit because once it's set, market participants can get on with it. The market will have a clear line of sight to invest in the infrastructure we need to put in place and that's what's needed as it's a sector with a long investment cycle and it needs certainty." Cowling says we've already met some critical milestones on our journey to decarbonisation. "In South Australia we can already see an extraordinary penetration of renewables. We have some of the best wind resources and probably the best solar resource in the world. From a domestic perspective we can certainly re-power ourselves with renewables." Cowling also echoed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent comments on the need for a global carbon price. 'If we don't clearly put a price in place for carbon you're not going to get anywhere. We need a clear signal so we can push down the right technology path. "This will lead to better technology, cheaper technology and better capital structures in the sector, but first we need that framework. It has been the missing piece in the past," Cowling says. "Getting that bipartisan support is a step forward that sets a clear path to the decarbonisation of Australia." MARK EGGLETON \</doc>

Investors must change their behaviour and factor climate change into their risk modelling to protect their returns, a new report says. While the way to deal with the impact of climate change remains a hot debate in Australian politics, Mercer's report, Investing in a Time of Climate Change, said other nations had accelerated policies, and investors needed to mitigate the risks and diversify at the asset, industry sector and portfolio levels. "There were more than 800 climate change policies at the end of 2014, compared with 54 at the time that the Kyoto protocol was struck. They are driving the way in which investors need to think about the impact of climate change [on their portfolios]," Mercer global business leader responsible investment Helen Birgden said. That number of policy responses could dramatically increase towards the end of the year, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference set to negotiate a new climate agreement for the first time in two decades in Paris in December. The report estimated the potential impact of increases of 2, 3 and 4 degrees above pre-industrial global temperatures on returns for portfolios, asset classes and industry sectors between 2015 and 2050. The biggest differentiation was at industry level, and of the biggest losers, it found the average annual returns from the coal sub-sector could fall 18 to 74 per cent during the next 35 years. Conversely, renewables would deliver an increase in returns of 6 to 54 per cent. "At a superficial level, it might seem like a no-brainer but we've done the rigorous work, under the influence of these risk factors, coal, electrical utilities and so on are being impacted," she said. The most pronounced effects on the coal sub-sector would be during the next decade, the report says. "Coal is most impacted by policy. It has a very negative exposure to policy, whereas gas has a lesser exposure to policy change and technology, because it is going to be a transition fuel to the lower-carbon economy," Ms Birgden said investors should heed the warning to "look under the bonnet" and look at the drivers, such as policy and economic conditions, that were changing at the sector level, as Australian portfolios were internationally exposed. "It requires investors to be really engaged with their investment manager, to help them understand and make sure they're on top of these risks, they can get a measure of their exposure to their issues and take a carbon footprint of their portfolios." But it's not all bad news. The report also found that a 2-degree increase scenario did not have negative return implications for long-term diversified investors up to 2050 and even beyond. At 2 degrees higher, return benefits were found for emerging-market equities, infrastructure, real estate, time and agriculture. But these same assets could be negatively affected at a 4-degrees scenario. \</doc>

Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a push from inside the Liberal Party to prevent Australia signing up to any binding emissions reduction targets at the upcoming Paris climate talks. A cabal of regional and rural Liberal members, centred in Western Australia and supported by a number of conservative MPs, will force a vote at Saturday's federal council meeting in Melbourne on whether Parliament should "examine the evidence" around climate change before agreeing to any post-2020 emissions cuts. Liberal sources told Fairfax Media that Environment Minister Greg Hunt is likely to be forced to step in and fight off the motion on Saturday by asserting the Abbott government accepts climate change is real and is willing to work with other nations to combat its effects. The timing of the intervention will be a headache for Mr Hunt who has over recent months moved the government towards accepting tougher emissions targets, as revealed by Fairfax Media on Tuesday. A Liberal moderate who will attend the federal council meeting said the group of elected Liberals and members behind the motion should be given an audience with the Pope so they can be "brought up to speed by a new age person living in this century". The party's regional and rural committee, chaired by WA farmer Brian Mayfield, has submitted the motion, which will call for a House of Representatives committee to "examine the scientific evidence that underpins the man-made global warming theory". It also calls for investigation into "the reasons for the failure of computer models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and prominent individuals to predict, among other things, the pause in global warming this century". "In light of the uncertainty around this issue, Australia does not sign any binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year," it says. Mr Mayfield declined to comment but Liberal Senator Chris Back and West Australian colleague Dennis Jensen both told Fairfax Media that an examination of whether the science supported climate change was worthy of party debate. Mr Jensen said the push was coming out of WA because the state has a "reputation for independent thinking". In 2009, a similar campaign was aimed at then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull who was urged by WA members not to negotiate with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ahead of the Copenhagen summit. "The science is absolutely not settled. This argument that it's all done and dusted is rubbish," he said. Farmers see more climate variability in their working lives than most people and the view that everything is in stasis except for the human influence on the climate was nonsense, he said. A senior Liberal source said the motion would have to be "derailed" by Mr Hunt. "It's something that will appeal to some conservatives but he will have to head it off. There is more and more a view that Hunt has got the government to a point of being ready to act and accept the climate science, so the timing could not be worse." "This sort of talk takes us back to the Neanderthal age. It's flat earth stuff." Mr Hunt's office did not return calls for comment. \</doc>

LAST month Islamic terrorists slaughtered 130 innocent men and women, the youngest aged just 17, in a series of vicious attacks across Paris. More than 40,000 government leaders, negotiators and activists subsequently arrived in Paris to decide what the global temperature will be for people whose grandparents haven't been born yet. If you want to get an idea of exactly where political priorities are in 2015, the above paragraph is a pretty good place to start. While delegates at the United Nations - climate change conference were fussing over future carbon dioxide levels, workers at Paris's Pere Lachaise cemetery met with a psychologist in order to deal with the trauma of rapidly organising dozens of burials. Some of those killed had been attending a show at the Bataclan concert hall, not far from their final resting place. Appropriately enough, the climate change conference kicked off with a speech from murderous Zimbabwean tyrant Robert Mugabe, who isn't exactly unfamiliar with large body counts. That includes his 91st birthday party earlier this year, which featured a feast of buffaloes, impalas and a baby elephant. "Unless current trends are reversed, disaster stalks planet Earth," Mugabe told the conference, before presumably heading for the French capital's Parc Zoologique to see if it had a drive-through. The head of the Australian Conservation Foundation Kelly O'Shanassy got by on slightly less exotic fare. "Working on ACF's political strategy while sipping Moet in Dubai," she wrote on Facebook from the Emirates business class lounge during her trip to Paris. "For dinner last night duck le orange and champagne," O'Shanassy posted once she'd arrived, scoring valuable Turnbull innovation points for her spelling of duck a l'orange. Yet more champagne followed: "Meeting with President Tong of -Kiribati tonight but early. What to do when you arrive early for your meeting in Paris. Go to the nearest bar of"course." Of course. O'Shanassy removed those posts once they attracted negative attention. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Labor leader Bill Shorten dropped in on the City of Light during the conference's early days, where Shorten called for ambitious -climate targets. "Malcolm Turnbull's caught. He's caught in the middle of the road on this," Shorten said. "He's playing in the traffic." It later emerged that Shorten himself had previously been playing in traffic, smashing into two parked cars during an early-morning drive in Melbourne after spilling hot coffee on"his lap. Forget global warming; the Labor leader is suffering groinal warming, and there's nothing the UN can do to stop it. Once-burnt Bill and his pal Mal had left the important job of signing Australia up to a pointless climate agreement to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who delighted con artists and grifters worldwide by committing us to international carbon markets. These markets are so rife with corruption that they make Nigerian email scammers look like the Salvos. In between all the champagne and the end of conference celebrations, a rare moment of reality intruded courtesy of US Secretary of State John Kerry. "If all the industrial nations went down to zero emissions ... it wouldn't be enough, not when more than 65 per cent of the world's carbon pollution comes from the developing world," he said. Considering that the developing world isn't about to stop developing, Kerry has presented the most cogent argument yet for a complete abandonment of climate change legislation. If you actually believe it is possible for human beings to set the earth's thermostat, try turning off just one active volcano.Just one. Maybe the UN can help you find the switch. \</doc>

Paris | US President Barack Obama described the "old arguments" against action on climate as "broken" and the talks in Paris an "act of defiance" against terrorism while his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has declared that the conference should chart a course for green development. Speaking to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, President Obama pressed the case for action on climate change, saying the problems it would cause would create a future not "of strong economies, nor of one where fragile states can find their footing". Mr Obama said any new global climate agreement should have regularly updated targets for countries, take into account differences between nations, and ensure transparency over national actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The presidents of the world's two largest carbon emitters were among just over 150 national leaders who attended the first day of the two-week conference organised by the United Nations in the French capital. Most leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, were given the opportunity to make short speeches. With the US resisting a push from countries such as France for the Paris talks to result in a legally binding treaty - which would have to pass through a hostile Congress - Mr Obama called for "an agreement" that allowed for "regularly updated targets". "As one of America's governors has said, 'We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it'," he said. "I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognises our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it." Mr Obama also described the summit as an opportunity to show solidarity with Paris, where 130 people were killed in the terrorist attacks of November 13, saying "an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children". "We have come to Paris to show our resolve ... to protect our people, and to uphold the values that keep us strong and keep us free. We salute the people of Paris for insisting that this crucial conference will go on." The leader of the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses noted the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" in the negotiations where richer nations, which are responsible for a greater share of historical carbon emissions, are required to shoulder more of the burden of financing new green technologies and compensating poorer nations for the impact of global warming. Mr Xi described Paris as "not a finish line, but a new starting point". He said a Paris agreement should chart a course for green development which put controls on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. He hoped the negotiations would galvanise global efforts to reduce emissions by mobilising NGOs and other stakeholders to take part in international co-operation on climate change. "Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now our on Paris," he said. The UN has been pushing for an agreement to cut emissions to cap temperature rises at 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels - a threshold most scientists regard as safe. However, UN analysis of more than 160 national carbon reduction pledges shows they should keep temperature rises to between 2.7 and 3 degrees. \</doc>

\~\~Tuvalu has issued a stern warning to its Pacific Island neighbours, urging countries not to do deals outside of the like-minded group at major climate talks in Paris. \~\~ The call highlights the tensions emerging between even the most tight-knit collections of countries in Paris after days of lengthy and slow negotiations. \~\~ The prime minister is upset he wasn't invited to a meeting between some Pacific Island nations, including Kiribati, and United States President Barack Obama earlier this week. \~\~ Mr Sopoaga said he'd heard of deals being made outside the negotiations. \~\~ "There are serious efforts to want to drive a wedge to divide us," he told reporters in Paris on Saturday. \~\~ Loss and damage is a major sticking point at the United Nations climate change conference , with vulnerable countries pledging to dig their feet in and demand funding to repair their nations. \~\~ Australia is part of a developed nation commitment to raise climate finance to $100 billion each year by 2030 - from private and public sources. \~\~ Mr Sopoaga said the meeting with Mr Obama did not represent the views of the small island developing states. \~\~ "We need to bring things to the table, so that we have collective undertaking". \~\~ Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna kept the focus on pressures outside his ally block, reminding other countries climate change was not an academic issue for the Pacific. \~\~ Adaptation measures like migration and relocation weren't good enough, he said. \~\~ "How do you leave the island or the country of your birth?" he asked. \~\~ That feeling is echoed by two Pacific Islander women, who have flown to Paris to fight for their future. \~\~ Tinaai Teaua, 23, fears she'll have to leave her home in Kiribati. \~\~ "I'm going to have more ahead of me, I want to have children, I want to stay on my own land," she told AAP. \~\~ "We want people to consider that we are also human beings and we need life," Ms Toafa said. \~\~ As the richest country in the region, Australia has faced calls to go in to bat for its Pacific neighbours. \~\~ Australia's position is still to work towards a target of two degrees. \</doc>

The United Nations climate change conference that concluded in Paris on the weekend marks a welcome contrast from the debacle of the 2009 Copenhagen summit in that the 195 countries involved could agree on a broad framework for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. That is a massive relief, given the need for the world's nations to collectively guard against potentially catastrophic global warming. The Copenhagen failure proved to be a fatal setback for the Rudd government, which did not anticipate the hostile position of the Chinese government six years ago. With China being more co-operative, the Turnbull government has emerged with credit from Paris. Australia successively pushed for regular reviews of voluntary targets, with the final agreement requiring "stocktaking" meetings that would require all countries to report on their progress within a common reporting system. While that amounts to a big first step towards a global effort to limit emissions, it replaces the one-size-fits-all approach that delivered the Copenhagen debacle. In its place, individual countries will be permitted to nominate their own targets, so-called "nationally determined contributions". And only some sections of the final agreement are legally binding. The all-important emissions targets remain voluntary, to avoid the deal being classified as an international treaty which would then have to be ratified by the US Senate. This means that much still depends on the naming and shaming power of the treaty and just how far individual countries are prepared to go, particularly when times are tough. Australia can claim some credit for its target, settled on when Tony Abbott was prime minister: to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. While these have been criticised, Malcolm Turnbull and Environment Minister Greg Hunt can claim that, in per capita terms, this pledge is second in terms of ambition only to Brazil among G20 nations. Whether the many pledges made at the Paris meeting, assuming they are adhered to, are enough to keep the earth warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels (one degree from now) or the more aspirational 1.5 degrees remains to be seen. Although this newspaper has always said that scientific advice should be heeded in this area, if only as a precaution against worst-case scenarios, climate science is not exact enough to precisely link carbon dioxide concentrations with specific atmospheric temperatures. After bungling climate change policy so badly under both the Rudd and Gillard governments, Labor would be wise to pull back from its calls for Australia to commit to even deeper cuts to carbon emissions. Similarly, Mr Turnbull should work on reducing the costs of Australia's haphazard jumble of climate change policies before getting out ahead of the rest of the world again. As we report elsewhere today, the mandated growth of renewable energy, for instance, is injecting considerable volatility and cost into Australia's electricity networks. The lesson of the past decade or more of climate change politics is that Australian governments need to identify that global frameworks struggle to recognise the particular structure of the Australian economy, as an efficient producer and exporter of fossil fuels. Global emissions may actually have fallen slightly this year due to a slowdown in economic growth, in China, which accounts for 28 per cent of global emissions. Yet China also has 100 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity under construction or approved and intends to curtail emissions through a range of measures such as coal-washing plants, retrofitting coal-fired power plants and coal chemical operations and by controlling residential use. With hundreds of millions of people yet to be connected electricity, India inevitably will increase its coal-fired generation, including with Australian coal. Australia should seek to aid such noble economic development while minimising the overall risk to humankind. \</doc>

Paris | Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg will front a new global taskforce backed by Australian regulators aimed at ensuring greater transparency for investors by developing voluntary disclosure rules for companies facing increasing pressure to report the risks they face from climate change. Fund managers, insurers, retail shareholders and banks could be given standardised and detailed information about a company's carbon exposure under plans for an industry-led code announced by the Swiss-based Financial Stability Board - the G20 financial oversight body backed by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Treasury - at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris on Friday. Arguing that there was an "urgent need to reform how business report on climate risk", Mr Bloomberg said, "it's critical that industries and investors understand the risks posed by climate change - but currently there is too little transparency about those risks". The taskforce was launched by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England and FSB chairman, who said the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures would make a series of recommendations for "consistent company disclosures" about climate risks which "are likely to grow with time". Some of Australia's largest companies including BHP Billiton and Commonwealth Bank of Australia have stepped up their reporting of exposure to carbon-intensive activities such as coal mining. In September, BHP became one of the first big resources companies to publish the results of "stress testing" its portfolio of mines and energy projects against the UN's goal of capping global temperature rises at 2 degrees - a target that is likely to result in global cut in greenhouse pollution and a higher carbon price. "Australia has a carbon intensive economy which is exposed to the regulatory, physical and market risks of climate change. Investors who are managing financial risk for the long term, need to be managing for climate change. Regulators need to have good visibility of the system-wide implications," said Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change. "Good carbon risk disclosure is the foundation of good risk management." Investors are putting greater pressure on companies to report their exposure to climate change with fossil-fuel divestment campaigns by green finance activists continuing and moves by some regulators such as the New York State Attorney-General to sue companies for not disclosing all risks related to global warming. Mr Carney has done more than most to make climate change a mainstream issue. In a London speech in September, the Canadian-born regulator warned investors and insurance companies with interests in resources companies could face "potentially huge" losses if tougher government action on carbon emissions meant that reserves of coal, oil and gas became uneconomic or "stranded assets". Mr Bloomberg, who has made a $US40 billion ($54.5 billion) fortune from his financial data and media company, has a long history of advocating for environmental issues. He is the UN's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. The taskforce will consider the physical, liability and transition risks associated with climate change and what constitutes effective financial disclosures in this area. It will seek to develop a set of recommendations for consistent, comparable, reliable, clear and efficient climate-related disclosures. The taskforce plans to complete its work by end of 2016 when it will make a series of recommendations. "Better collaboration between industry and financial policymakers on long term carbon risk management will increase Australia's carbon competitiveness and resilience to the economic impacts of climate change", Ms Herd said. \</doc>

The forecast for Paris this week is as would be expected for the beginning of winter: cloudy, grey, with a maximum temperature struggling to reach 12. But in the French capital, however, three events will make it singularly different. First, Parisians will still be living in the shadow of death caused by the massacres of two weeks ago, second, 40,000 representatives from almost 200 nations - including the heads of 139 of them - will be in the city for climate talks. Among them will be the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Third, this year is the hottest on record, says the World Meteorological Organisation. The United Nations Climate Change Conference The Paris talks have a better chance than other summits in that they have an overarching different framework. The United Nations lives by acronyms and one of the most important for these talks is INDC. It stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Each country is taking one to Paris. Australia's aim is a 26 to 28 per cent cut below 2005 levels by 2030. Environment Minister Greg Hunt has indicated that Australia will use Paris to state that it has reached its 2020 target of a 5 per cent cut below the emission levels of 2000. While Australia is, per capita, the worst polluter in the world, by other measures, we are small fry. This is not to suggest that we should not tackle the threat or consign it to mere symbolic action. It is too important, the most important thing confronting the state of the planet. The domino effect of climate change is profound and, without wanting to appear obvious, global. It does not discriminate, is not selective. Its consequences, of course, manifest themselves according to region. Melting ice caps, disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels, droughts and storms. Some experts believe that the 2 degree limit is not enough, and too late to put a substantial brake on the process. Even if the Paris agreements were met, it still wouldn't be enough. The WMO says average surface temperatures this year probably would reach 1 degree above the pre-industrial period. The past five years has been the hottest five-year period in recorded history, and the 10 hottest have all been after 1998. A report in The Washington Post last week makes this graphic point: "The last time the planet experienced so much melting was at the end of the last Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago, when volcanoes and a changing ocean discharged huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere." It quotes Jeremy Shakun, an ecoscience academic: "We've already raised CO2 by more than it increased at the end of the Ice Age. And we're on track to go up much higher." Indeed, according to a recent report in The Economist, coal supplies 41 per cent of global electricity. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is two-fifths greater than at the start of the Industrial Revolution. How to combat this, indeed how to reverse this, requires more than a patchwork quilt of solutions that changes colour within each country according to the political leaders of the day. More than any time in the past 100 years, it requires radicalism of thought and deed. The system does not need pulling down. It needs rebuilding. It needs to adapt to the changes it itself created. \</doc>

Artist Janet Laurence is taking her views and art on climate change to Paris, writes Andrew Taylor. Surrounded by a boneyard of coral and fish skeletons and shelves of laboratory glassware in her studio, Janet Laurence bears a heavy weight on her shoulders as she prepares her latest artwork. The artist's Deep Breathing (Resuscitation for the Reef) presents one of Australia's greatest natural wonders to an international audience gathered in Paris for the United Nations climate change conference . "I feel quite proud to be able to bring the Barrier Reef to Paris actually and show another way of seeing it, not the glossy tourist idea, she says. "And in fact it is very fragile and very, very threatened." But she adds: "I feel it's important to have a presence there because our government may not have a positive presence there." A Wunderkammer of reef parts, Laurence's artwork includes photos, videos and natural material like bleached corals and shells. "I've also cast a lot of skeletal matter and corals and I've cast coal because you know we can't ignore that factor," she says, alluding to the coal export facilities along the Queensland coast. It will also feature fish and turtle specimens borrowed from the Australian Museum and Paris's Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, where it will be displayed. Laurence hopes to tug on viewers' heartstrings by displaying small corals on beds transfused with colour that suggest babies in a hospital. "I'm really aiming to bring a much more empathetic, emotional side into the work for people to be drawn into it on an intimate level." Other coral specimens in what Laurence calls her "hospital for the reef" will be wrapped in bags that she says resemble morgue bags. Laurence's site-specific work will also be displayed during Paris' International Contemporary Art Fair in October and then at the Australian Museum in 2016. Laurence is one of 30 artists from 23 countries selected to exhibit work in Paris during the climate change talks. Other artists showing work inspired by climate change include Olafur Eliasson, Pedro Reyes and Song Dong. The world's biggest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef has occupied minds at the UN in recent times, with the World Heritage Committee deciding in July not to declare the reef "in danger". However, the committee said it would monitor the state of the reef over the next four years. The Australian Museum's artist-in-residence, Laurence spent six days at the institution's Lizard Island research station on the northern Great Barrier Reef in July, working with scientist Mandy Reid to take underwater photographs and set up what Laurence calls "underwater homeopathic treatments for bleached coral". The main focus of Laurence's artwork is coral bleaching. But she says: "it's also on the acid waters, the crown of thorns starfish, the fact that shells are getting less robust, thinner, you know, the fragility of so much life there due to the polluted and warming waters". Laurence says the reef also bears the scars of recent cyclones, which are thought to be intensifying as a result of climate change. The museum's chief executive Kim McKay says climate change is a "scientific fact". People were entitled to their opinion, but policy should be guided by expert opinion, she says. "In this particular case, world expert opinion and now it seems world political opinion is firmly behind the reduction of carbon emissions because they are a contributor to global warming." \</doc>

Big companies face increasing pressure from superannuation funds to provide detailed modelling of the risks to their business posed by carbon pricing or temperature rises. BHP Billiton is at the forefront of the trend for companies to respond with more sophisticated climate change risk reporting. Now the heat is on for smaller resource companies to follow suit, ahead of the trend spreading to less-exposed sectors. "In the coming years, most companies will have to prove to investors how sustainable their exposure to climate risks are in the long term," Catholic Super chief executive Frank Pegan said. The fund is trying to map the carbon footprint of the more than $7 billion worth of assets held on its behalf via external fund managers. "We have asked all our fund managers to engage with the companies they are invested in on our behalf to make sure they have considered the risks of climate change to their business model and have a plan to deal with it," Mr Pegan said. He said the fund's focus on climate risk had more to do with economics than reacting to recent comments made by leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis. "The Pope's 2015 encyclical on climate change is all about showing respect for the earth and people, which is in line with the approach we have already been taking." Mr Pegan also chairs the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), a collective of Australian and New Zealand super funds, fund managers and insurance companies managing $1 trillion in assets. ANZ Banking Group says it will set strict rules on lending to the coal industry to bring the bank's business into line with the growing momentum across the corporate world of reducing carbon emissions. The changing nature of the climate risk modelling and reporting metrics demanded by institutional investors is a key topic at the 2015 IGCC summit. "At this time of great disruption, whether you divest, invest or engage, it is clear that all investors need a strategy for carbon. Investors are building the tools they need to manage risk and capture new opportunities," IGCC chief executive Emma Herd said. Ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , in Paris from November 30, participating countries have flagged an agreement to commit to limiting the rise in average temperature since the industrial revolution to 2 degrees Celsius (it is already at 0.9 degrees). Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week warned investors that the majority of fossil fuels could become "stranded", meaning resources companies are due for a big fall. Local resource companies are already struggling with the shift. AGL Energy chairman Jerry Maycock used the company's annual general meeting last week to call for a "coherent national plan" to shift the country's electricity generation sector away from fossil fuels. At a briefing for around 40 investors on Friday, BHP Billiton revealed the results of financial stress tests it had modelled for the impact of average temperature rises of 2 degrees, 4 degrees and 6 degrees on the business. BHP Billiton has also modelled the impact of different carbon prices on its balance sheet. \</doc>

Moving to a low-carbon transport system would save the world about $US330 billion ($429 billion) in oil costs by 2030 because of a lower demand for the fuel, including potentially $6.2 billion a year for Australia, says an analysis funded by the European Climate Foundation. The study, by Cambridge Econometrics and to be released globally in London on Wednesday, calculates that the rollout of technologies to mitigate climate change, as agreed at the COP21 climate summit in Paris, would significantly reduce demand for crude oil in any individual country. If emissions reductions commitments are acted on across the world, it would also keep a lid on oil prices, providing further savings. Oil prices would stabilise in that scenario at between $US83 and $US87 a barrel in 2030-2050, about 8.5 per cent lower than they would otherwise be in 2030, rising to 33 per cent lower in 2050, says the analysis. The report comes just days before representatives from 130 countries, including heads of state, are due to sign up to the COP21 Paris Agreement at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Friday. Cambridge Econometrics is funded by the European Climate Foundation, whose own backers include activist shareholder the Children's Investment Fund, a major shareholder in Australian wind power player Infigen Energy. But under COP21 The findings compare with an analysis by the International Energy Agency in its World Energy Outlook late last year, which found that in a scenario where the world acted to limit global warming to 2 degrees, global demand for oil in 2030 would be about 86 million barrels a day rather than 104 million. For Australia, the study calculates that spending on oil due to lower demand would save $6.4 billion a year. If actions were taken on a global scale that pushed down global crude prices as calculated, Australia would save a further $2.9 billion a year. \</doc>

It snuck into the draft climate change agreement earlier this year, and much to everyone's surprise, a 1.5 degrees Celsius target survived the gauntlet of the United Nations climate change negotiations. Negotiators are catching up on sleep after gruelling talks resulted in HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-12/world-adopts-climate-deal-at-paris-talks/7023712 195 nations adopting a an new international agreement to slow global warming. The target of 1.5C dodged multiple rounds of chops, changes and tweaks to the deal text. The agreement now has the aim of "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change". The newfound enthusiasm for 1.5C reflects a growing realisation that 2C is a figure with very little basis in fact. Several scientists have told the ABC the 2C degree target is "arbitrary" or "plucked out of the air". None would go on the record admitting that, however. But a new paper out this week in Nature Geoscience is not so shy. "No scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the two degree target as a safe level of warming," write the authors. Lead author Reto Knutti is a Swiss professor of climate science. "We can quantify the risks of 1.5 degrees or two or three degrees but we can never use science alone to justify any target. It's always a question of what values we have," he said. "We need to decide as a society how much risk we're willing to take. "Ultimately the two degree target is a political consensus that takes into account what policy makers at that time considered to be both realistically achieve and tolerable. It is high time for a scientific assessment. "It's a compromise of the best we can hope for and the worse we can tolerate." The accepted history of the 2C target is that William Nordhaus, a Yale economist, came up with the number in one of the earliest papers on climate change an its economic implications. In 1975 he wrote: "If there were global temperatures more than 2C or 3C above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years." He graphed a rough sketch of historical temperatures and added a label at 2C: "Estimated maximum experienced over last 100,000 years." Climate science has honed those estimates in the past 40 years. We now know that temperatures have dropped dramatically over 100,000 years - as low as -20 - but in that time they have never been as high as they are now. And they certainly have not surpassed two degrees. But before scientists had ironed out such details, the 2C target was already making it into official documents. Europe was largely responsible for its ultimate inclusion in the United Nations agreement that came out of Copenhagen in 2009. Enshrined as an official target, it became a signpost beyond which "dangerous climate change" apparently lay. Degrees of difference There is only half a degree between the two targets. Given that humans live in places that experience temperatures as low as -60C and as high as 50C, it seems ludicrous to spend so much energy haggling over half a degree. However Will Steffan, a member of the Australian Climate Council, said "those temperatures that we scientists use are not to be confused with daily temperature ranges that people experience". Even though they are both measuring temperatures, he said they are better thought of as a measurement for what the whole climate system is doing. "A five degree world doesn't just mean it's going to be five degrees warmer in Canberra or Sydney or Darwin or wherever," he said. "It means is a world that will likely have little or no polar ice. Large areas will be uninhabitable for humans. "The last ice-age was only five degrees cooler in global average temperatures and yet a lot of north American and northern Europe were under a couple of kilometres of ice." As scientists have improved our understanding of climate change, there's been a growing realisation that two degrees is likely to be quite dangerous after all. "At two degrees we'd have several metres of sea level rise," Professor Steffan said. "Several small island states would not exist." He said extreme weather such as heatwaves, bushfires, heavy rainfall, and drought would be more common at 2C. "Coral reefs would almost certainly not be around at 2 degrees. They'd be struggling at 1.5," he said. Most worrying for Professor Steffan is there is a chance the world would pass certain tipping points that would spell planetary disaster, such as masses of greenhouse gases escaping from melting Siberian tundra pushing climate change beyond anything humans can control. The rise of 1.5 Howard Bamsey, a veteran negotiator for Australia at the UN climate conferences, said a 1.5C target has always been on the table. When 2C became official in 2009, there was provision for revisiting 1.5C in 2015. The imprimatur from such a senior climate figure gave the lower target the legs it needed to carry on through several years of lack-lustre negotiations. Meanwhile continuing science repeatedly found that at 2C, climate change would be more dangerous than might be acceptable. Mr Bamsey said 1.5C's rise to prominence this year is a result of a long-term push from the nations most vulnerable to climate change: the island nations. At the beginning at this year's negotiations US president Barak Obama posed for a photo with leaders of some of the least powerful and most vulnerable island nations. The photo was a strong symbol that the US was willing to side with the tiny nations and their long-held dream of a 1.5 target. Australia signed on to the 1.5 target when it cut a deal with St Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, to back the target in exchange for being allowed to carry over its savings from the Kyoto Protocol. With 1.5 now inked as the stretch target, the island nations can walk away from Paris with a sense of victory. "It's been one that island states have been wanting to see reflected in the outcome of the UN process for some years," Mr Bamsey said. "I think it's to some extent a product of the persistence of those most vulnerable countries in flagging their concerns that a world that warmed by two degrees would still leave them in a critical situation that would endanger their existence." \</doc>

VALLETTA - Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is flying to Paris for key climate change talks, stressing the need for regular stocktakes of emissions reduction targets, and raising them if need be. That includes Australia's target of between 26 and 28 per cent reductions by 2030 on 2005 levels. The prime minister has urged fellow Commonwealth leaders meeting in Malta to send a strong climate action signal to Paris, where climate change talks starting on Monday aim to reach a global consensus on emissions reductions. Mr Turnbull flies from Malta to the COP21 talks on Sunday, ready to stress the key roles of technology and innovation in addressing the climate change challenge. He will strongly back proposed five-yearly reviews of countries' emissions reduction targets to ensure they are achieving the current goal of holding the increase in global average temperature below 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The prime minister said on Saturday that Australia's current reduction targets were "very reasonable" and ones the government was satisfied it would achieve. He has dismissed Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's proposed reduction target of 45 per cent as a "heroic offer" and far too costly, saying it was "way out of line with other comparable countries". COP21 has a five-year review policy of countries' reduction targets but the government is gearing up to be flexible, with Mr Turnbull stressing that new technology and innovation will provide solutions going forward. \</doc>

ADELAIDE video content agency RedBikini is drawing on its technical resources to help renowned polar explorer Tim Jarvis send images from mountains around the world to the climate change conference, COP21 in Paris. The team is backing acclaimed filmmaker Ed Wardle as he captures the 25zero project - where Jarvis and his teams are climbing six mountains during the Paris talks to draw attention to the effects of climate change. RedBikini managing director Justin O'Brien said it had been a tough gig getting the right technical capability in place to capture film from mountains as cold as -30C. The company has provided the expedition team with cameras, video streaming equipment and a portable satellite unit to enable transmission to Paris from the summit of each mountain. Managing director Justin O'Brien said the Adelaide-based RedBikini team was working with global creative-innovation agency Global Brain in Colorado, USA, to get the mountain footage packaged for the UN's use. RedBikini would receive raw footage via satellite and edit it into various packages that are sent to team leaders at COP21 for distribution. Adelaide adventurer and scientist Tim Jarvis is climbing three of the mountains in three continents - Carstensz Pyramid in West Papua, Indonesia, Mt Stanley in Uganda and Chimborazo in Ecuador. He warns within 25 years there will be no ice at the equator."Live streaming from a mountain peak directly into the Paris climate change conference is an impactful way of sharing the climate change message with world leaders," Mr O'Brien said. \</doc>

\~\~PARIS Nov 30, AAP - Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised to spend "at least" $1 billion helping vulnerable nations cope with climate change at major climate talks in Paris. \~\~ Like the $200 million pledged for a global climate fund at similar talks in Peru last year, the additional $800 million will be redirected from the existing foreign aid budget. \~\~ Mr Turnbull announced the five-year funding during his national statement alongside around 150 other world leaders on the first day of the United Nations climate change conference . \~\~ The prime minister also formally announced Australia's plan to double clean energy technology investment as part of a multi-country initiative known as Mission Innovation. \~\~ As part of the plan, Australian government investment in clean energy research and development will increase to about $200 million by 2020. \~\~ "I think it's a very important statement," Mr Turnbull told reporters in Paris. \~\~ While ratification sends a signal of Australia's commitment to emissions targets, it will also allow the government to access carry-over or "surplus" emissions from exceeding the first commitments. \~\~ Finance is a hot topic at the UN talks, with some predicting the fate of an agreement could depend on the size of the ask to entice poorer nations to sign on. \~\~ Under the new leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada pledged $2.65 billion over five years, while Japan committed to mobilising $10.6 billion in private and public funds by 2020. While Mr Turnbull is standing firm on Australia's 2030 emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels, he indicated flexibility to increase it over time. \~\~ Part of that dynamism is a push by the Australian delegation for five-yearly reviews, which would force countries to assess their efforts and adjust accordingly. \~\~ Mr Turnbull has no plans to change Australia's direct action policy and Environment Minister Greg Hunt dismissed the report as an "options paper" that didn't draw any conclusions. \~\~ "It's certainly something we'll be looking at with a very open mind," he said. \~\~ "He's keeping the right wing of his party happy," he told reporters on Monday. \~\~ "If the government is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul ... it's not really helping them at all, it's no net change," he said. \~\~ "Ripping money out of foreign aid and repackaging it as climate financing is pretty insulting, especially as the rest of the world has recognised the urgent need to give more," she told AAP. \</doc>

HOT TOPIC CLIMATE CHANGE Renewable power makes sense I WOULD like to congratulate the Greens on their plan to guide Australia to a target of using at least 90 per cent renewable energy by 2030 to power Australia. This is an admirable and economically sensible goal. It will generate a large number of new jobs for those people currently employed in areas that will gradually be reduced or replaced in the transition, as well as providing job opportunities for our young people. While it may sound quite ambitious, a well-planned process can be formulated and successfully implemented. Not only will there be more jobs for Australians, there will be more goods and services to export, and better health for all Australians as we remove so much pollution from our atmosphere. Here in Tasmania, it could particularly be a great boon to Hydro Tasmania which is currently in the doldrums, having suffered as a result of the axing of the carbon levy by the Abbott government, as it would encourage investment in renewable energy. Toni McLean Lymington Unite for children THE 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was universally accepted to be a dismal failure. Next week, the world leaders again gather - this time in Paris - to consider the problems of a changing climate. Drastic decisions need to be made at this UN conference, but whose voice will be heard? The voice of the multinationals or that of the ordinary people. Given the Pope Francis encyclical, Laudate Si, on - care for our common home - and statements forthcoming from the recent World Council of Churches gathering on the same theme, I am amazed and disappointed that little has been heard from the various Tasmanian church leaders in support of their global leadership. In the case of the Catholic Church, there appears to be too much attention to lesser issues and a focus on tradition and dogma rather than reading the signs of the times and being supportive of Francis. How often have we heard from the churches on the right to life issue - isn't this about protecting the life of the unborn! It's time to become vocal! I have grandchildren. What sort of planet will they experience? This weekend rallies will be held in the major cities around the globe voicing the need for the world leadership to accept the realities of human-caused climate change and its consequences and to take realistic measures to reverse the proven trends. The Hobart rally on the Parliament lawns is next Sunday, November 29, at 1pm. Given the statements out of the Vatican and the World Council of Churches, I would expect the Tasmanian church leaders to be there and be well supported by their various flocks, whom they will have encouraged to attend. Not only did they support coal in 1981, but also campaigned against growing trees and using wood. According to latest greenhouse gas figures, sustainable logging in our native forests and growing plantations has removed over 33 per cent of our emissions since the Kyoto base year to address climate change. It is a pity the greens don't do a backflip and rather than be divisive and vilify forest communities, they promote the timber workers and their families as climate heroes. Alan Duggan Cradoc Taxing argument A READER suggests we give incentives to companies to reduce their carbon footprint by granting tax reductions proportionate to the percentage reduction of carbon. So companies pay more tax if they emit more carbon? It sounds an awful lot like a carbon tax to me. John HunterClimate Tasmania \</doc>

WORLD leaders have to choose between fighting poverty or saving Earth from overheating, with new studies showing global warming is happening much faster than previously predicted, a Griffith University researcher says. The new modelling predicts temperatures could rise by a staggering 3C degrees within 14 years. This compares to the Bureau of Meteorology State of the Climate 2014 report which forecast less dramatic rises of 0.6-1.5C by 2030 and 1-5C by 2070, depending on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Griffith University energy economist Dr Liam Wagner and University of Queensland's Professor Ben Hankamer say the huge temperature rises could be expected if the world continued to operate in a 'business-as-usual' mode with pro-growth strategies and plans to alleviate poverty to half of the population living on less than $2.50 a day. With more people using more power, the pair predicted temperatures could increase by 1.5C by 2020, 2C by 2030 and then rapidly warm by 3C soon after 2030. "Nations at the 2015 UN Conference on Climate Change agreed to keep the rise in global average temperature below 2C, preferably limiting it to 1.5C to protect island states," Professor Hankamer said. "Our model shows we may have less time left than expected to prevent world temperature from rising above these thresholds. "World population is forecast to increase to over 9 billion people by 2050, which, together with international 'pro-growth' strategies, will lead to continually increasing energy demand." They said world leaders faced a choice between pulling more people out of poverty and saving the environment. "We have a choice - leave people in poverty and speed towards dangerous global warming through the increased use of fossil fuels - or transition fast to renewables," Dr Wagner said. Prof Hankamer said it was vital to move from CO2-emitting fossil fuels. "The sun is by far the largest renewable energy source," he said.The average Australian temperature has increased by 0.9C since 1910 and many heat-related records have been broken in recent years, according to the CSIRO. \</doc>

\~\~PARIS Nov 30, AAP - Australia will commit an extra $800 million over five years to help poorer countries cope with climate change but will redirect the funds from the existing foreign aid budget. \~\~ Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed the multimillion dollar gift on Tuesday (AEDT) during his national statement at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. \~\~ The money is earmarked to help vulnerable Pacific Island nations both adapt to climate change and curb carbon pollution. \~\~ "The impacts of global warming are already being felt and will continue to be so even after we reach global net zero emissions." \~\~ "We are not daunted by our challenge ... We do not doubt the implications of the science, or the scale of the challenge," he said. \~\~ Australia has also recently secured itself a spot as co-chair of the Green Climate Fund - the global public fund set up to invest in climate action in poorer countries. \~\~ Australia has brought 2030 emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels to Paris, a goal constructed under former prime minister Tony Abbott. \~\~ "Our agreement here in Paris must provide a common platform for action, the dynamism to build ambition and a robust and transparent reporting system," he said. \~\~ Analysis shows current country pledges would limit global warming to about 2.7 degrees Celsius, a level vulnerable Pacific Island nations believe would spell their end. \~\~ The 20 countries, including the United States, China and India, represent 80 per cent of global clean energy research and development budgets. \~\~ Mr Turnbull also confirmed Australia's commitment to a deal in Paris, while announcing the country would ratify the second Kyoto Protocol period of 2012-2020. It means the government can use carry-over accounting measures due to exceeding its first period target. \~\~ "What is at stake is the future of the planet," he said. \~\~ Mr Hollande thanked the international community for all the signs of friendship following the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris just weeks before the conference. \</doc>

One of the questions asked after the atrocious attacks on the people of Paris by Islamic State terrorists was whether the United Nations climate change conference scheduled to begin in Paris on November 30 should or could go ahead. The claim that the western world's geopolitical filter for the Middle East is "all about oil" is a massive oversimplification. However oil is a key element of the region's politics and an influence on the western world's response to them however, and will be until it is no longer needed. It is the dominant source of Middle Eastern export income, and a crucial source of the energy that the rest of the world expends. Control of refineries and the funding capacity they deliver has been one of the strategic aims of IS since it emerged out of the chaos in Syria last year and invaded Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Western air strikes have in turn been directed at IS-controlled refineries and oil facilities. Middle Eastern oil income more generally is one of the key sources of financial support for jihadist activity. Data produced by the International Energy Agency shows that energy consumption patterns have been changing. Oil accounted for 48 per cent cent of global energy consumption and was the source of just under 50 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in 1973. Its share of consumption was down to 40 per cent by 2013, and its share of carbon dioxide emissions was down to 33.6 per cent. Industry has become less oil intensive, cutting its share of oil consumption from 20 per cent to 8.4 per cent. The transport sector's consumption rose from 45 per cent to 64 per cent, as greater use of vehicles more than offset improvements in fuel efficiency. Through it all oil has continued to be the largest single source of energy, however, and the Middle East has continued to be the dominant supplier. Middle Eastern countries meanwhile have seen their dominance of the oil market decline only slightly over decades. Their share of global production only fell from 36.7 per cent in 1973 to 31.6 per cent in 2014. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Emirates accounted for a quarter of the world's production and 37 per cent of oil exports during the year - and Saudi Arabia demonstrated its market power mid-year by rapidly increasing its production and halving the oil price. Of the big oil importing countries only one, the United States, has significantly reduced its dependence on Middle Eastern oil in recent years. It did so by replacing over 5 million barrels a day of imported oil with domestically produced shale oil. The glut that Saudi Arabia engineered last year was a response to that development - the economic and arguably, the geopolitical threat that it raised. The shale oil "fracking" production surge that was unleashed in the US is unlikely to be widely replicated elsewhere in the world, however. Shale is abundant, but not much of it is the right shale, at the right depth. If the rest of the west is to end its addiction to Middle East oil and the geopolitical consequences that flow from it, it is going to have end its addiction to oil. Reducing the West's dependence on oil is not the primary goal of the Paris talks. If the world's leaders meet despite the vicious attacks and craft an agreement to limit the effects of climate change, the policies they implement to honour their agreements will work in that direction, however. Steadily reducing demand for oil would be bad economic news for the Middle East, which has secured meagre economic dividends from its huge oil reserves so far. The connection between oil money and terrorism is toxic and chronic, however: every barrel of oil saved would tighten the funding equation for Islamic State and its supporters. \</doc>

REDLANDS will be well placed to reap the benefits of Malcolm Turnbull's successful tussle for the Liberal Party leadership. The leadership spill, driven by cabinet ministers, followed February's failed backbench-driven call for a vote of no confidence.Vocal Bowman MP Andrew Laming played a leading role in those manoeuvres. Mr Laming told Redland City Bulletin he did not expect a cabinet position despite Mr Turnbull telling him to expect one when he visited Redlands in March. It was likely after Mr Turnbull is sworn in as prime minister that Mr Abbott will sit on the backbench -next to Mr Laming. Mr Laming said Redland would gain from having a prime minister committed to the National Broadband Network rollout, which hit Redland Bay on Friday. The issue was high on the agenda when Mr Turnbull met Mr Laming and Redland mayor Karen Williams at Raby Bay Harbour in March, days after the mooted "vote of no confidence" . At that meeting Cr Williams told Mr Turnbull about the dire need for Capalaba and Cleveland to be connected to high-speed broadband. "The NBN is a big asset for electorates like Redlands which has some of the poorest broadband access," Mr Laming said. The outspoken backbencher said there had been no "measuring of the curtains" and he was not expecting a cabinet position or to be reinstated as a parliamentary secretary, a position he lost when Mr Abbott became party leader in 2009. He also said he was not keen on a portfolio as it would involved a lot of travel outside his electorate which covers the entire city of Redlands. Mr Laming said he had not expected the spill motion and had not been crunching numbers or manning phones for Mr Turnbull, his long-time friend, who visited Redlands in March. "I am very very happy doing what I'm doing so I don't have any designs on a front bench job," he said. "The focus is on moving offices. The PM's office is huge and Malcolm has 48 hours to move office and he only has 15 people at the moment. "He has to be running the nation within 48 hours and he doesn't need to name all those tiny (cabinet or parliamentary secretary) positions." After the ballot, Mr Laming said he congratulated Mr Abbott "for being a great prime minister". The backbencher said he spoke with Mr Turnbull "a number of times" on Monday as the events unfolded in the corridors of Parliament House but was not a main player in the ousting of Mr Abbott. ALP v LNP: "In politics there is only one poll that matters but there are a whole lot of polls in between that represent the Australian people trying to give government a message." ECONOMY: "We will be focussing on the new economy as opposed to the old economy and attracting new foreign capital chasing bit projects in finance and technology." TURNBULL v ABBOTT: "The real difference between Malcolm and Tony is there will be a subtle shift from the old economy to the new economy and Turnbull will be a little more creative around where the new jobs are." SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: "It is really only a matter of timing on the proposed plebiscite and I think we're heading in the right direction. Labor wants to push it through Parliament and we want a plebiscite and if Malcolm is keen on gay marriage he can bring that plebiscite sooner or it can be at the election. But that's all still to be decided." CLIMATE CHANGE: "Malcolm fully supports the policy we are taking to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. The policy is to cut carbon emissions by 26 per cent from 2005 levels by 2040." REPUBLIC:"There won't be too much discussion on the republic until other major issues are addressed and Malcolm sees this as a minor issue at the moment." \</doc>

Malcolm Turnbull's powers of persuasion propelled him into the prime ministership. Despite having been previously dumped as Liberal Party leader, he convinced his colleagues, many of whom still dislike him intensely, to repudiate Tony Abbott only two years after he led them to government in a resounding victory. Mr Turnbull's capacity, it is widely held, is the result of high intelligence buttressed by instinct for parry and thrust. The new Prime Minister ought to bring the full force of his advocacy to adjusting the way our nation seeks to meet its economic, environmental and moral responsibility to properly participate in the international effort to reduce the threat of anthropogenic climate change. On this front, Mr Turnbull's debut has been disappointing; he has backed the inadequate muddle Mr Abbott, a man who once dismissed the science on human-induced climate change as "crap", has been trying to pass off as a credible policy. Paying billions of taxpayers' dollars to the biggest polluters to pollute less, and planting some trees, while failing to create incentives to sufficiently invest in renewable energy technology, is a costly and inefficient melange unlikely to achieve what are, anyway, unduly low emission-reduction targets. The current policy does not even come close to meeting the tenets of good public policy. Mr Turnbull this week has repeatedly referred to the intelligence of the population; indeed it was central to his withering public pitch for the top job. We urge him, then, to start the process of shifting climate change policy from something most people know is sub-standard to the market-based mechanism experts the world over know is the best way to cut carbon emissions. The science is beyond reasonable doubt. Even Mr Abbott finally admitted that. So, the question is how best to limit global warming. The answer is to have a market mechanism to reflect the costs of pollution and benefits of abatement. As well as stating this week that he would explain policies and convince people of the need for change, Mr Turnbull rightly extolled the virtues of markets. The uncharacteristically limp argument he has thus far given for sticking with Mr Abbott's climate policy is that it is the goal that is important, not the means. We hope that once he has settled into his role he will start to skilfully distance himself from this policy by setting out the compelling arguments for change. After all, it is no secret that he believes a cap-and-trade market mechanism is the optimal approach. That was the policy then-prime minister John Howard took to the 2007 election. That was the policy Mr Turnbull himself championed as opposition leader. That is the policy so many business leaders support. And that is the policy Mr Turnbull should take to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris later this year. We would also urge him to argue for bigger reduction targets than those his predecessor was planning for the Australian government to present in Paris. The urgent need to mitigate global warming is mankind's biggest challenge. It is Mr Turnbull's most important challenge; he must make our nation - one of the highest polluters per capita - an exemplar in averting a potentially existential catastrophe. Mr Turnbull's ascension was not merely a function of his ability to argue; all of his colleagues want to hold their parliamentary seats and many were spooked and even panicked by persistently poor results in the opinion polls. They voted for self-interest. For the same reason, if for nothing else, they should join us in urging their new leader to alter the government's current policy on reducing carbon emissions towards the market-based mechanism so many voters have been wanting for so long. With power comes duty. Should Mr Turnbull fail to advocate for a change he knows is right, history will condemn him. \</doc>

ABSTRACT COP21 seems closer to finding an agreement to halt climate change, writes Climate Institute deputy CEO Erwin Jackson . FULL TEXT Demonstrators dressed as world leaders protest outside COP21 Another draft of the final COP21 climate agreement is out. There were a lot of bleary eyes at the conference centre today after negotiators worked through the night. Parties first met as a cohort to give "indaba" responses to the draft released yesterday, and then split up to smaller groups to hash out the areas that will need more work to find consensus. "Indaba" refers to a process where each member at the table gets to speak and be heard. The inclusive process has a Zulu name that\~first appeared in the 2011 Durban meeting. That meeting provided the key breakthrough that recognised that all countries, including China and India, would offer broad climate action commitments. The Kyoto model, where only developed countries make emission reduction commitments, formed the basis pf a major argument used by some against the UN process and climate action more generally. Among the usual lamentations about the exhausting negotiation process, there were also murmurs of agreement that yesterday's text was an improvement. But not everyone saw their priorities in there yet. As Thursday has now drawn to a close with a text that is mostly clear of square brackets (which highlight disagreements or alternative options). It suggests broad agreement on a range of issues but the following remain clearly contested: how to build a common system of transparency for country actions; how to address unmanageable climate change impacts in vulnerable nations; and how to financially support poor nations participate in climate change solutions. This is a strong, carefully balanced text. It includes the formal review and updating of targets every five years starting, in 2019. This would be done against the reference to limiting global warming below 1.5-2oC by the end of the century and achieving net zero emissions or 'emissions neutrality (the science on this suggests all greenhouse gases would need to be at net zero by 2050 to have a chance at 1.5\'b0C and between 2060 and 2070 for 2\'b0C. CO2 emissions from energy and industry, which last longer in the atmosphere, would need to be at zero earlier than other gases). Finance contributions would be scaled up to the poorest and this would be tracked through time. There are a number of challenges in here for Australia, which will need to recognise that its pollution reduction targets are more aligned to 3 to 4 degree warming and would leave us with the petro state of Saudi Arabia as the highest per capital polluters in 2030. However, this text is not the final agreement. With a desire to present a penultimate version in the morning and make history by closing the meeting on time, with a final agreement Friday evening Paris time, the French president of the COP has called for "solutions indabas". The journey to where we are now in Paris has been a long and difficult one; ministers could still tumble at the final hurdle. \</doc>

London: Prince Charles has said putting a price on carbon is a vital part of addressing climate change, setting him on a potential collision course with his hosts during his November visit to Australia. Last year Australia became the first developed nation to repeal a carbon price scheme. The Prince of Wales, for decades a campaigner for conservation and ecological causes, has emerged as a keen mediator on climate change in the lead-up to December's COP21 in Paris - the United Nations summit intended to draw up a new global climate change action plan. On Thursday in London he convened a high-level meeting on deforestation and climate change at Lancaster House, next door to the prince's home and office, Clarence House. He revealed he has accepted an invitation from French President Francois Hollande to deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of COP21 . He previously attended the 2009 COP talks in Copenhagen. "Paris will be an absolutely crucial milestone in the long overdue international effort to keep to a 2 degree world," Prince Charles told the meeting on Thursday, referring to the climate change "speed limit" set by scientists. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that an average temperature rise of 2 degrees by 2100 would come with increased risk of sea level rise and extreme weather events, but beyond 4 degrees the effects quickly become much more dangerous. The prince said a "4 degree" rise would be "impossible, I think, to adapt to". COP21 The UN's climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said earlier this week that a global carbon price would not be set at the Paris summit - but the world would move towards one in the future. Around 60 jurisdictions including the European Union already have a carbon trading scheme or tax, and multinationals including big oil companies have called for a global carbon price to spur investment in low-carbon energy. The prince has previously indicated his support for economic strategies to tackle climate change. In 2012 the Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group released a "Carbon Price Communique", making the case for setting a price on carbon emissions. And at a speech in July this year for the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), he said "we will absolutely need a different kind of economy" to avoid dangerous climate change. The day before he will meet with new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra. However it is not clear whether the prince will take the opportunity to urge Mr Turnbull to make a u-turn on the carbon tax. A Clarence House spokesperson said "we wouldn't go into what might be raised in private meetings". Mr Turnbull has said the government will review its climate change policies in 2017, but has avoided signalling any return to an emissions trading scheme. \</doc>

\~\~Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has encouraged other Commonwealth leaders to send a powerful signal to other nations that strong climate change action is needed. \~\~ On Sunday Mr Turnbull flies to Paris for the key COP21 summit aimed at achieving a global accord on tackling climate change and reducing carbon emissions. \~\~ "Ahead of COP21 it is a powerful signal to other countries of the world to show a similar level of ambition and commitment to working together for a strong result in Paris," he said. \~\~ The hub will help least-developed countries and small island developing states including those in the Pacific to access funds for environmental projects in response to climate change. \~\~ Hollande told reporters after the climate change session that what he sought in Paris was "a binding agreement, a universal agreement, one that is ambitious". \~\~ "But we can say the same when it comes to climate. Human beings are destroying nature, damaging the environment. \~\~ UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was encouraged by the "strong commitment" shown by Commonwealth leaders to tackle climate change. \</doc>

Back Roads ABC, 8pm As she did with her series on the Nationals, ABC journo Heather Ewart returns to her roots in regional and outback Australia in this fond new series. There's no great motivator here except to reintroduce the majority of Australians (who, statistically, rarely venture outside our urban centres) to the people and places a lot of people love to eulogise as the "real" Australia but in practice remains a foreign country. Tonight she starts in Ceduna, on the border between South Australia and WA: a real frontier town. The gorgeous cinematography certainly does justice to the desert-meets-coast landscape and while this ain't hard-hitting by any stretch, Ewart does unearth a genuinely interesting range of characters. Spice of Life Food Network, 8pm If one of the Kardashians could cook - and was a decent sort of human being - the result might be a little like this. Bal Arneson is an extremely attractive Indian-born American who's written a number of books about Indian cooking and cooking with spices. In this series we hang out in her home with her two also extremely attractive children while they engage in a range of contrived antics. Today that's installing a vegie patch in the backyard. In between, Arneson divides her time between cooking and sitting on her sofa explaining what just happened, or what's about to happen. It makes for a pretty mild sort of entertainment but it's all good-natured and harmless. Foreign Correspondent: How to Save the World ABC, 8.30pm Did you know that in California's Bay Area, solar technology employs more people than Apple, Google and Twitter combined? Me neither. And that's just one of the inspiring insights in this excellent documentary hosted by Eric Campbell and made to coincide with the UN conference on climate change this week. Indeed, it should be compulsory viewing for anyone bleating about how shifting to renewable energy is going to destroy the economy. On the evidence presented here, the reverse is true. Wherever governments and communities have embraced solar, wind and other alternative energy sources the local economy is thriving. And what's really interesting is that in some places - for example, California - measures to get things started have been cost-neutral. \</doc>

HYPERLINK /world/paris-attacks Paris attacks: Full coverage One of the questions asked after the HYPERLINK /world/paris-attacks atrocious attacks on the people of Paris by Islamic State terrorists United Nations climate change conference The attacks in fact make the climate conference even more essential. That's because an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius would, if honoured, set in train a process that undermined the economics of Jihadi terrorism. The claim that the western world's geopolitical filter for the Middle East is "all about oil" is a massive oversimplification. Oil is a key element of the region's politics and an influence on the western world's response to them however, and will be until it is no longer needed. It is the dominant source of Middle Eastern export income, and a crucial source of the energy that the rest of the world expends. Control of refineries and the funding capacity they deliver has been one of the strategic aims of IS since it emerged out of the chaos in Syria last year and invaded Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Western air strikes have in turn been directed at IS-controlled refineries and oil facilities. Middle Eastern oil income more generally is one of the key sources of financial support for jihadist activity. Falling share Data produced by the International Energy Agency shows that energy consumption patterns have been changing. Oil accounted for 48 per cent cent of global energy consumption and was the source of just under 50 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in 1973. Its share of consumption was down to 40 per cent by 2013, and its share of carbon dioxide emissions was down to 33.6 per cent. Industry has become less oil intensive, cutting its share of oil consumption from 20 per cent to 8.4 per cent. The transport sector's consumption rose from 45 per cent to 64 per cent, as greater use of vehicles more than offset improvements in fuel efficiency. Through it all oil has continued to be the largest single source of energy, however, and the Middle East has continued to be the dominant supplier. Oil's 40 per cent share of consumption in 2013 compares with 15.1 per cent for natural gas, 11.5 per cent for coal, and 18 per cent for electricity. Coal has a largest share of carbon dioxide emissions, 46 per cent, but oil's 33.6 per cent share is not far behind. Middle Eastern countries meanwhile have seen their dominance of the oil market decline only slightly over decades. Their share of global production only fell from 36.7 per cent in 1973 to 31.6 per cent in 2014. Of the big oil importing countries only one, the United States, has significantly reduced its dependence on Middle Eastern oil in recent years. It did so by replacing over 5 million barrels a day of imported oil with domestically produced shale oil. The glut that Saudi Arabia engineered last year was a response to that development - the economic and arguably, the geopolitical threat that it raised. The oil shale "fracking" production surge that was unleashed in the US is unlikely to be widely replicated elsewhere in the world, however. Shale is abundant, but not much of it is the right shale, at the right depth. If the rest of the west is to end its addiction to Middle East oil and the geopolitical consequences that flow from it, it is going to have end its addiction to oil. Climate talks Reducing the West's dependence on oil is not the primary goal of the Paris talks. If the world's leaders meet despite the vicious attacks and craft an agreement to limit the effects of climate change, the policies they implement to honour their agreements will work in that direction, however. Steadily reducing demand for oil would be bad economic news for the Middle East, which has secured meagre economic dividends from its huge oil reserves so far. The connection between oil money and terrorism is toxic and chronic, however: every barrel of oil saved would tighten the funding equation for Islamic State and its supporters.

Market doldrums boost New Hope's asset quest. In a perverse kind of way, Robert Millner, chairman of cashed-up coal miner New Hope, has a lot to thank the anti-coal lobby for. The relentless push by green groups and divestment campaigners against coal has worked in concert with an ugly oversupply in the global coal market to push down the price of coal and coal mines. And that's giving Millner a rare chance to expand on the cheap. Millner, who is also chairman of listed conglomerate Washington Soul Pattinson, won't be drawn on what he believed to be the merits or otherwise of the anti-coal argument, other than to comment that "even anti-coal lobbyists probably turn their lights on at the end of the day." But there's little doubt the denouncement of coal has become the new black for pension plans and superannuation plans in Australia and globally. Norway set a new benchmark when its parliament agreed to sell many of the investments relating to coal from its $US890 billion government pension fund in June. Closer to home, last October Local Government Super and Australian National University announced they would stop investing in coal companies and planned to dump some coal investments. Billions of dollars of investor capital has found its way into other segments of the sharemarket as climate-change activist campaigns have kicked into overdrive - connected and supercharged by digital networks such at 350.org - in the lead up to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference summit to be held in Paris in December. At the same time, has coal has battled against a price decline of more than 200 per cent since its 2011 highs, largely due to global oversupply. . But Millner, who will have his 20-year anniversary as the chairman of New Hope in December this year, has plenty of historical perspective; when he became chairman the price of coal was more than $US10 a tonne lower than it is today. The resource sectors retained out-of-favour status through the late 1990s and into the early 2000s before the mother of all mining cycles lifted the segment and New Hope's fortunes . But with coal's cyclical decline , Millner has been hunting for assets to buy at relatively depressed prices. That search led New Hope to agree to pay $867 million for a 40 per cent stake in Bengalla, one of Rio Tinto's three thermal coal mines in NSW's Hunter Valley. The deal isn't expected to close until next early year. The pressure the successful anti-coal lobby has put on valuations of coal assets during the past couple of years has not been lost on Millner. "It's definitively made further investment in coal assets perhaps a bit unfashionable and pushed down prices. Maybe that's one of the reasons why we took advantage of the transaction," Mr Millner says of the Bengalla deal. Perhaps unsurprising is the fact Millner doesn't believe the anti-coal investment case that global emissions targets will lead to a swift decline in production and revenues for coal companies. He points to Wood Mackenzie research to support his case that coal would continue to play a consistent role in supplying global power demand over the next 30 years alongside the gradual adoption of renewable and hydro-generated power. While cheap gas prices in North America have pushed the thermal coal industry in the United States into structural decline, the Bengalla acquisition is a bet on the demand for the commodity in Asia, starting with Japan, where about 40 per cent of the company's coal ends up, Millner says. Companies which have put their coal production on hold or have closed mines as they've struggled to meet costs and debt repayments affected supply, he says. A master of looking through investment cycles given the diverse strategic portfolio of Soul Patts, Millner says he has made the most of the negativity . "A lot of those things have conspired to make this perfect buying environment." \</doc>

The artist's Deep Breathing (Resuscitation for the Reef) presents one of Australia's greatest natural wonders to an international audience gathered in Paris for the United Nations climate change conference . "I feel quite proud to be able to bring the Barrier Reef to Paris actually and show another way of seeing it, not the glossy tourist idea, she says. "And in fact it is very fragile and very, very threatened." But she adds: "I feel it's important to have a presence there because our government may not have a positive presence there," she says. A Wunderkammer of reef parts, Laurence's artwork includes photos, videos and natural material like bleached corals and shells. "I've also cast a lot of skeletal matter and corals and I've cast coal because you know we can't ignore that factor," she says, alluding to the coal export facilities along the Queensland coast. It will also feature fish and turtle specimens borrowed from the Australian Museum and Paris's Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, where it will be displayed. Laurence hopes to tug on viewer's heartstrings by displaying small corals on beds transfused with colour that suggest babies in a hospital. "I'm really aiming to bring a much more empathetic, emotional side into the work for people to be drawn into it on an intimate level," she says. Other coral specimens in what Laurence calls her "hospital for the reef" will be wrapped in bags that she says resemble morgue bags. "I'm creating a kind of resuscitation space for the Barrier Reef," she says. Deep Breathing (Resuscitation for the Reef) will also include "intimate views" of aquatic life. "I think people are realising this incredible sentience of marine life," she says. "That was for me a very profound experience of being on Lizard Island." Laurence's site-specific work will also be displayed during Paris' International Contemporary Art Fair in October. It will then be displayed at the Australian Museum in 2016. Laurence is one of 30 artists from 23 countries selected to HYPERLINK http://www.artists4parisclimate2015.com/en/ exhibit work in Paris during the climate change talks. Other artists showing work inspired by climate change include Olafur Eliasson, Pedro Reyes and Song Dong. The world's biggest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef has occupied minds at the UN in recent times, with the World Heritage Committee has deciding in July not to declare the Great Barrier Reef "in danger". However, the committee said it would monitor the state of the reef over the next four years. The Australian Museum's artist-in-residence, Laurence spent six days at the institution's Lizard Island research station on the northern Great Barrier Reef in July, working with scientist Mandy Reid to take underwater photographs and set up what Laurence calls "underwater homeopathic treatments for bleached coral". The main focus of Laurence's artwork is coral bleaching. But she says: "it's also on the acid waters, the crown of thorns starfish, the fact that shells are getting less robust, thinner, you know, the fragility of so much life there due to the polluted and warming waters". Laurence says the reef also bears the scars of recent cyclones, which are thought to be intensifying as a result of climate change: "It's the direct effect of man and then of course the climate change over a longer period of time." The museum's chief executive Kim McKay agrees that the reef had been affected by climate change. "Climate change is happening," she says. "It is scientific fact. If you want to deny scientific fact, you would be a denier of many other things." People were entitled to their opinion, but policy should be guided by expert opinion, she says. "In this particular case, world expert opinion and now it seems world political opinion is firmly behind the reduction of carbon emissions because they are a contributor to global warming."

\~\~Australia is at risk of falling to the back of the pack in the global effort to slash carbon emissions while remaining the biggest polluter per person in the developed world. \~\~ Some lobby groups are hoping the 25 per cent might be applied to 2025 which would increase the ambition significantly. \~\~ The post-2020 target, which will be taken to the United Nations climate change conference later this year, is expected to be revealed on Tuesday after consideration by cabinet and the coalition party room. \~\~ It would change the base year from 2000 to 2005, when emissions were among the highest in Australia's history. \~\~ It would also position Australia behind most comparable developed nations, including the United States, in terms of ambition. \~\~ Climate Institute chief executive John Connor said the reported target range, when compared to like-economies, showed Australia wasn't doing its fair share. \~\~ "Yes it's challenging, but good policy design can cover those challenges." \~\~ Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the weekend warned his government would not sacrifice jobs or prosperity to tackle climate change but promised to make a "strong and responsible" contribution. \~\~ Environment Minister Greg Hunt maintains Australia will "meet or beat" its 2020 emissions reduction target of five per cent on 2000 levels. \~\~ Should the coalition choose a 25 per cent target on 2005 levels by 2030, Australia would still lag far behind the United States, the European Union and Switzerland. \~\~ The government-funded Climate Change Authority has recommended a 40 to 60 per cent cut on 2000 levels by 2030 while the Australian Greens want 60 to 80 per cent by the same year. \~\~ "Australians understand that the coal industry is dying and today's jobs and future jobs are in renewables," she said. \~\~ Countries like Australia where fossil fuels were the economic backbone would have to make a huge effort to slash emissions, she said. \~\~ But the Galaxy poll for the Climate Institute also showed 51 per cent believe post-2020 targets should be based on science and not what other nations are committing. \~\~ "Many low carbon technologies have become better and cheaper faster than expected, and economic change is not as painful as feared," he said. \~\~ Labor has pledged to introduce an emissions trading scheme in government, saying voters want strong action on climate change. \</doc>

ELEANOR HALL: The president of the United States has issued a warning to other world leaders about the need to act urgently to reduce carbon emissions. Barack Obama says climate change is happening faster than efforts to fix it and that any world leader unwilling to take the problem seriously is "not fit to lead". The US president says, while there should be debate on the best way to address climate change, the science on global warming is settled and the time to act is now. Will Ockenden reports. WILL OCKENDEN: President Barack Obama says the world has reached a fork in the road on climate change. One route is to continue on, without doing anything. BARACK OBAMA: There's not going to be a nation on this Earth that's not impacted negatively. People will suffer. Economies will suffer. Entire nations will find themselves under severe, severe problems; more drought, more floods, rising sea levels, greater migration, more refugees, more scarcity, more conflict. WILL OCKENDEN: The other, a global agreement to cut emissions. BARACK OBAMA: The other path is to embrace the human ingenuity that can do something about it. The time to heed the critics and the cynics and the deniers is past. The time to plead ignorance is surely past. Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone; they're on their own shrinking island. WILL OCKENDEN: President Obama's comments were addressed at the opening of the GLACIER conference in Anchorage, Alaska. GLACIER stands for Global Leadership in the Arctic: Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement and Resilience. The comments come ahead of a key meeting, the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which is scheduled to be held in Paris in December His speech is being seen as a way of building international support, so countries can reach an agreement to cap emissions and therefore a maximum global temperature rise of two degrees Celsius. Barack Obama says 2015 must be the year an agreement is reached, and attacked politicians who deny the science of climate change. BARACK OBAMA: Any so-called leader who does not take this issue seriously or treats it like a joke is not fit to lead. On this issue of all issues there's such a thing as being too late. WILL OCKENDEN: As the world's largest economy, and its second biggest emitter, the United States is key to any world agreement and any meaningly action to cut global emissions. President Barack Obama has recently annoyed his political opponents in Congress by introducing standards to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. He admits that the US is a big part of the problem, but says he believes the country can solve it. BARACK OBAMA: America will reach the emission target that I set six years ago. We're going to reduce our carbon emissions in the range of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. And that's why last year I set a new target, America's gonna reduce our emissions 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 10 years from now. And, that was part of a historical joint announcement we made last year in Beijing. The United States will double the pace at which we cut our emissions and China committed for the first time to limiting its emissions. WILL OCKENDEN: President Barack Obama has 16 months left in office, and hopes that any international climate deal reached at the UN Paris summit would help cement his legacy on climate change. He's also in Alaska to build support among American voters for taking action against global warming, and to draw attention to many of the threats it poses. His three-day journey to Alaska will include visits to glaciers and coastlines facing erosion from the effects of climate change. Summing up his speech, president Barack Obama says he has no time for climate deniers, saying the time to debate the science has passed. BARACK OBAMA: We know that human activity is changing the climate. That is beyond dispute. Everything else is politics if people are denying the facts of climate change. We can have a legitimate debate about how we are going to address this problem; we cannot deny the science. We also know the devastating consequences if the current trend lines continue, that is not deniable. ELEANOR HALL: That's the US president Barack Obama speaking in Alaska.

Climate change poses such a threat to public health it risks undoing the gains of the past 50 years, a major study has found. The Lancet Commission on climate change and health found the threat had been underestimated, but that tackling it could be a huge opportunity to improve global health. "The effects of climate change are being felt today, and future projections represent an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health," said the report published in British medical journal The Lancet. "The direct effects of climate change include increased heat stress, floods, drought, and increased frequency of intense storms, with the indirect threatening population health through adverse changes in air pollution, the spread of disease, food insecurity and under-nutrition, displacement, and mental ill health." Last year, the HYPERLINK http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/ World Health Organisation predicted that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. More than 40 researchers from across Europe and China have spent more than a year compiling the Lancet Commission report, which builds on work done in 2009. The 2015 edition has identified several significant opportunities to improve human health by tackling climate change. "Given the potential of climate change to reverse the health gains from economic development... tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of this century," the report said. "Many mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are 'no-regret' options, which lead to direct reductions in the burden of ill-health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, and address global inequity. "Health professionals have worked to protect against health threats, such as tobacco, HIV/AIDS, and polio, and have often confronted powerful entrenched interests in doing so. "Likewise, they must be leaders in responding to the health threat of climate change." The report also said: "Many of the 2,200 coal-fired plants currently proposed for construction globally will damage health unless replaced with cleaner energy alternatives. As part of the transition to renewable energy, there will be a cautious transitional role for natural gas." Deliberately timed for this year, it is hoped the report will directly influence decision makers ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December. The Lancet report followed a major call for action from HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-19/pope-urges-world-to-act-before-climate-change-destroys-planet/6557540 Pope Francis, who warned last week the Earth was starting to resemble an "immense pile of filth". It has made 10 recommendations for governments, including the "rapid phase out of coal" to "protect cardiovascular and respiratory health". 'They come at the report like doctors' Nobel laureate Professor Peter Doherty said the report assessed the situation from the perspective of health professionals. "Anything that has an environmental effect will also have a human effect and that's what they emphasise very much in this report," Professor Doherty said. "They come at the report like doctors, they say well these are the symptoms, we understand the cause and we have to treat the underlying cause." The report recommended governments "invest in climate change and public health research, monitoring, and surveillance". "[This would] ensure a better understanding of the adaptation needs and the potential health co-benefits of climate mitigation at the local and national level," the report said. But it is the health impacts of wind farms that has caught the eye of Australia's premier public health research body. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has allocated $2.5 million to assess the health impacts of wind turbines. The NHMRC's comprehensive review of wind farms released earlier this year found no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects in humans but "given the poor quality of current direct evidence ... high quality research into possible health effects of wind farms ... is warranted". Professor Doherty said it was a waste of time and money. "One of the basic principles of medical research is you don't do research that will have no useful outcome," he said. "If it goes ahead and like every study that's been done it finds there are no ill health effects - that will convince none of these people so it's a complete waste of money. "There are wind farms everywhere in Scandinavia... maybe the fact that the ABC and SBS have so many Scandinavian murder programs reflects the bad psychological impact of wind farms, but I don't think anyone's tried to establish that link." \</doc>

HUNDREDS of people rallied at The Strand on Saturday, marching in solidarity with protesters across the world to call on global leaders to commit to climate change action. The protests precede the COP21 UN climate change summit in Paris this week. North Queensland Conservation Council co-ordinator Wendy Tubman said more than 500 people marched from the Strand Rockpool to the Burke St headland. "It's becoming more and more obvious that we are experiencing climate change but there is a lack of political action," she said. "We want to keep putting pressure on our politicians to make the right decision. "This was one of more than 2300 marches held worldwide in about 130 countries. "It's a global indication people want strong action on climate change and want it now." The group held placards calling for action and listened to speeches and sang songs to make their point. Ms Tubman said no politicians showed up to the Townsville rally, despite invitations. She said it was disappointing politicians had backtracked on the issue. "They are dragging the chain," she said. "The people are way ahead of them and they are getting very angry that more action isn't being taken. "We want a swift and just transition to renewable energy, banning of new coal mines, removal of all subsidies for fossil fuel and effective action." Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection Dr Steven Miles, who will be attending the COP21 summit, said climate change had particularly devastating effects for Queensland. "We're already seeing more extreme weather events, we're feeling hotter days in the summer and summers are longer than we're used to," he said. "Hotter temperatures really have the ability to change our way of life. "We are also vulnerable because of our volatile and extreme weather conditions, such as floods, heatwaves and bushfires." Dr Miles said climate change was a problem needing worldwide co-operation. "We need the Federal Government to do their bit and commit to more appropriate emissions targets," he said. "And we need a positive outcome from the UN climate summit in Paris."Capping the rise in Earth's temperatures to two degrees above pre-industrial levels must be the core goal." \</doc>

Gas industry leaders have declared the fuel is essential to meeting emissions reductions targets and improving security of supply as they seek to turn around slowing demand growth, which is contributing to some of the weakest prices for years in the global LNG export market. Origin Energy chief executive Grant King said gas was "absolutely critical and central to the decarbonisation of the world in the next 50 years", and said those turning their back entirely on fossil fuels were putting supply security at risk. Gas stepped into the breach after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan and is now saving Tasmania from energy shortages after the breakdown of the Basslink power cable, Mr King said before the LNG18 conference in Perth. Those pressing the case for gas over coal included David Carroll, president of the International Gas Union, who pointed out that gas was "cleaner than some of the solid fuels alternatives that are out there". The comments in part reprise the "gas versus coal" debate prevalent in the months leading up to the COP21 climate talks in Paris late last year. While the declarations made at COP21 made no mention of gas, Mr King said the emissions targets set then were premised on the fuel playing an important role. West Australian premier Colin Barnett is set to add to the debate in his speech to LNG18 on Tuesday by pointing out that the easiest and least costly way to cut greenhouse emissions was to require most new and replacement power generation be based on gas. "But that first requires a national energy policy," Mr Barnett will say. Federal Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg said the investment in LNG "has been good for Australia in terms of job creation", and pointed to the innovation seen in the industry such as Chevron's underground carbon disposal project at Gorgon and Shell's Prelude floating LNG project. Mr Turnbull and Mr Frydenberg toured Chevron's Gorgon plant site on Barrow Island on Monday \</doc>

Kate Charlesworth, a public health doctor from Mosman, does not want to let her children down over climate change. The most vulnerable people would be affected first and hardest, she said. "Children bear the least responsibility for climate change but they will bear the brunt of the health impacts," Dr Charlesworth said. On Sunday, Sydney will host what is expected to be its biggest day of climate action protest as world leaders gather for the United Nations climate summit, COP21 , in Paris. Dr Charlesworth will march for the Royal Australasian College of Physicians under the banner "Doctors for Climate Action". "As a doctor and as a mother there's nothing more important that I can be doing at the moment than picking up on climate change," she said. "Doctors, paediatricians and public health physicians have a responsibility to speak out on issues that impact on health. "In 10 years' time our children are going to say, 'Mum, did you know about this? What was everyone doing?' "I need to be able to look my children in the eye and say that I did everything that I could both professionally and personally." Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to turn out in eight capital cities around Australia to march at the weekend. The People's Climate March starts in The Domain at 1pm and will proceed down Macquarie Street to the Opera House, with marchers calling on the Australian government at the summit to demand an end to the use of fossil fuels and a much more rapid shift to renewable energy. Among those addressing the crowd will be lord mayor Clover Moore and climate activist Professor Tim Flannery. The march will be attended by a range of Australians including firefighters, faith communities, unions, farmers, health professionals, businesses, artists and musicians. Cr Moore was to tell the conference that COP21 was the most important gathering of national leaders in our lifetime and the future of the planet depended on it. She was to say: "Global warming must be kept below two degrees - if not we create an environment far outside the range ever experienced by humanity with huge areas of the planet becoming uninhabitable because of flooding, drought and heat." \</doc>

Climate talks have begun in Paris this week in a bid to limit the worst effects of climate change, and most world leaders have stated a position. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21 ), HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-16/world-leaders-vow-to-seek-2c-degree-climate-deal-in-paris/6945848 which will bring together more than 115 leaders from around the globe, has been described as the world's last chance to act. The aim of the meeting is to strike a deal to limit average global warming to 2C or less over pre-Industrial Revolution levels by cutting fossil fuel emissions. Most nations have set national targets to try to cap global warming levels, but the commitments are still voluntary and the HYPERLINK UN has already warned that planned cuts to pollution may still not be enough . Here is what leaders from around the world have had to say in the lead-up. France's president Francois Hollande As president of the host nation, Francois Hollande has taken a leading role in global discussions on climate change. HYPERLINK /news/2015-09-29/too-late-for-world-if-no-climate-deal-made-in-paris-france-says/6812138 He warned world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York City in September that reaching a successful climate deal in Paris was the last chance to save the planet. But France faced a more immediate threat with a series of coordinated terrorist attack in Paris on November 13, which left 130 people dead. The country vowed the conference would go ahead, but security has been heightened and protests banned. Man is the worst enemy of man. We can see it with terrorism. But we can say the same when it comes to climate. Human beings are destroying nature, damaging the environment. - Francois Hollande US president Barack Obama In the wake of the Paris attacks, US president Barack Obama urged other leaders to join him in attending the talks to show that "a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business". The second largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, the US has committed to a reduction of 26-28 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, compared to 2005. But the US has consistently said it will not inscribe its emissions reduction targets in a legally-binding international treaty. At a global leadership conference in Anchorage in September, Mr Obama warned climate change was no longer a problem of the future and would define the next century. He said the threat was HYPERLINK /news/2015-09-01/obama-to-combat-climate-change,-take-on-alaskan-adventure/6739234 "urgent and growing" and was not being addressed quick enough . Any so-called leader who doesn't take this issue seriously or treats it like a joke is not fit to lead. The science is stark, it is sharpening, and it proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present. - Barack Obama China's president Xi Jinping China is the world's largest carbon emitter, but its status as a developing country has meant it is under no obligation to promise carbon cuts, a situation that has upset other industrialised nations. HYPERLINK /news/2015-09-26/obama-xi-lay-out-joint-vision-for-global-climate-agreement/6806746 In September, China and the US said it had agreed on steps to move towards greenhouse gas emissions pledges made in 2014 when China's president Xi Jinping met with Mr Obama at the White House. Mr Xi announced China would launch a national carbon cap-and-trade system in 2017 to help contain the country's emissions. But the country's top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, HYPERLINK /news/2015-11-29/china-stakes-leadership-claim-to-combat-climate-change/6983650 has said that China's economy is a big part of the equation . We are taking all the right steps to solve this problem [climate change]. But right now, in accordance with our current stage of development, China's current situation must consider the stability of the economy, the employment of workers. - China's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua India's president Narendra Modi A key player in the Paris talks, HYPERLINK /news/2015-10-02/india-unveils-climate-target-pledges-to-cut-emissions-intensity/6823296 India has promised to cut its emissions 'intensity' , or the ratio of the country's carbon emissions to its economic output, which climate experts say does not go far enough. In a statement to the UN, New Delhi has said it aims to source 40 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, though it would require financial support to do so. Earlier this year, India's power minister Piyush Goyal said in an interview the West had "[polluted] the world for the last 150 years with cheap energy", but now expected India to curtail its development. India's prime minister Narendra Modi has called for a climate change agenda that helps developing countries with access to finance and technology. In addressing climate change, it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals. - Russia's president Vladimir Putin Russia has pledged to keep its emission at 25-30 per cent below levels it generated in 1990, which is a year before the Soviet Union collapsed. Environmentalists have been critical of the target, saying the pledge lets Russia off the hook too easily, given 1990 was a time the Soviet industry was at its worst. In his speech to the UN General Assembly in September, Russia's president Vladimir Putin called on leaders to take a different approach to climate change. We should take a wider view on this issue. Yes, we might defuse the problem for a while, by setting quotas on harmful emissions or by taking other measures that are nothing but tactical. But we will not solve it that way. - Vladimir Putin Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel At talks in Bonn, chancellor Angela Merkel said carbon pricing was important to push investment in renewable energy. Ms Merkel, Philippines president Benigno Aquino III and Mr Hollande were among world leaders who issued a joint statement through the World Bank urging governments and business to set up carbon markets and tax carbon emissions. We should advance our effort along this path further so that we can actually reach our goal. - Britain's prime minister David Cameron David Cameron has said the UK will "play its part" and in 2014 said climate change was one of the most serious threats facing the world. However he has been criticised by some environmental groups for not taking a more prominent role on the world stage on the issue. He recently pledged $12.5 billion in global aid to fight climate change. The UK is determined to play its part, not just by cutting our emissions at home but by providing support overseas to those who need it, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. - David Cameron Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff Brazil, the world's seventh biggest polluter, has pledged ambitious targets to slash its carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. At the UN General Assembly, president Dilma Rousseff said Brazil's targets exceeded other more developed nations. But some have questioned how effective it will prove. Brazil is one of a few developing countries to commit to an absolute emissions reduction target. - Dilma Rousseff Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau The recently-elected Canadian leader Justin Trudeau HYPERLINK /news/2015-10-21/canadian-leader-justin-trudeau-faces-climate-change-challenges/6872344 has pledged to improve his country's environmental image , promising a new strategy for global climate negotiations. He has pledged a break from the policies of defeated prime minister Stephen Harper who pulled Canada out of the Kyoto treaty and fought to shield the energy industry from global commitments to cut carbon emissions. Canada is the world's eighth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. In 2015, pretending that we have to choose between the economy and the environment is as harmful as it is wrong. - Justin Trudeau Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull Malcolm Turnbull will attend the Paris talks with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt. The Federal Government has announced plans to cut carbon emissions by at least 26 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030. HYPERLINK Thousands of Australians have joined a worldwide wave of marches calling for stronger measures to combat global warming. I am optimistic ... and I notice that the French president is very optimistic. - Malcolm Turnbull Kiribati's president Anote Tong The president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, has called on Pacific nations to form a united position and urged Australia and New Zealand to use their relative regional power to advocate for smaller countries. HYPERLINK /news/2015-11-19/kiribati-president-urges-world-leaders-moratorium-coal-mines/6953930 Mr Tong has called for a moratorium to be placed on building new coal mines to help stop the effects of climate change in the Pacific. He has warned Australia that it will have to deal with a wave of Pacific refugees from low-lying countries like Kiribati if sea levels continue to rise. What we are talking about is survival, it's not about economic development... it's not politics, it's survival. - Anote Tong Tuvalu's prime minister Enele Sopoaga HYPERLINK /news/2015-08-23/pacific-leaders-repeat-climate-warnings/6717878 Tuvalu says a failure at climate talks in Paris is not an option as rising sea levels threaten their very existence. Failure is not a fallback position, it is not an option, we must get success. - Enele Sopoaga Marshall Islands' foreign minister Tony de Brum HYPERLINK /news/2015-08-11/marshall-islands-slams-australia's-carbon-emissions-targets/6688974 In August, the Marshall Islands strongly criticised Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target , saying if the rest world followed Australia's lead, vulnerable nations would disappear. He said that Pacific countries were looking up to their "big brother" Australia to take on a leading role, but were disappointed to hear an announcement that signalled "business as usual" which "confirmed our worst fears". Anything over a two degrees [increase in global temperatures] is the end of our country, we go underwater when that happens. - Tony de Brum Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama Speaking at the Pacific Islands Forum, Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama said Australia was at odds with what he called "the biggest threat to our security" - rising sea levels caused by climate change. Australia is siding with the coalition of the selfish putting carbon-polluting industries before our welfare and survival. - Frank Bainimarama ABC/wires \</doc>

The UN climate summit this week in Paris, known as COP21 , is set to develop the next agreement for limiting the impact of global warming and reducing pollution, but what exactly does that mean and how will it work? The overall global aim is to prevent the earth from warming more than 2\'c2\'b0C above levels since the industrial revolution, seen as the benchmark before we see catastrophic impacts on the planet. Already the world is seeing changes, with the World Meteorological Organisation saying temperatures have now risen 1 degree Celsius since the industrial revolution, and 2015 is set to be the hottest on record. Paris will not be about trying to impose a "top-down" legally binding target on all countries to force them to reduce greenhouse emissions, as was attempted in Copenhagen, widely seen as chaotic. The conference will instead determine a process for regularly reviewing the carbon reduction targets each country has already nominated for the years after 2020. In 2013, nations agreed to submit their voluntary 2030 targets, and so far most, including the major emitters, have submitted theirs - covering about 94 per cent of global emissions. The countries will then look at determining a way of assessing progress towards meeting these pledges. There are also expectations of a statement about decarbonising the economy, and agreement on the amount of "climate finance", or loss and damage costs, to poor countries who suffer the most from global warming. COP21 , short for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The conference will run from 30 November to the December 11. \</doc>

Paris | A dispute over whether a global agreement on climate change will be a legally binding treaty and subject to review later has emerged as one of the main splits over talks in Paris, where leaders from more than 140 countries will meet on Monday to initiate two weeks of negotiations. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is chairing the United Nations COP21 conference, appeared over the weekend to give ground to US demands for a so-called hybrid agreement in which some of the carbon reduction goals outlined would be legally binding and others would not. Such a concession from the French may be more acceptable to India and other emerging economies, which want richer nations to do more to tackle the climate change problem. But other European countries say such a proposal is not strict enough. "The accord needs to be legally binding. It's not just literature," Mr Fabius told the Financial Times. "But it will probably have a dual nature. Some of the clauses will be legally binding." The conference is being held under a state of emergency, with thousands of police and soldiers on the streets of Paris, coming just weeks after the November 13 terrorist attacks on the French capital. Leaders including US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping will address the conference at the start of this week, after which officials will attempt to thrash out an agreement over two weeks of negotiations. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has expressed support for five-year reviews of national carbon reduction targets that would require countries to track and report how they are pursuing their targets. Such an audit mechanism has been another area of dispute among the 183 nations that have submitted emission control plans in the lead-up to this week's UN conference. Mr Turnbull signalled he will put innovation in environmentally-friendly technologies at the heart of his pitch to world leaders on Monday, describing Labor's plan to substantially increase Australia's carbon emission reduction targets as "a heroic offer" that would be prohibitively expensive. Speaking on the eve of the UN climate talks, Mr Turnbull indicated that any credible attempt to curb global warming would require a unified commitment from national governments to cut greenhouse emissions but also the mobilisation of the private sector to develop green technologies. Mr Turnbull, who was speaking at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta on Saturday, said he hoped COP21 would result in a "a strong durable agreement" that "puts all countries on a common platform and allows them to periodically update their targets that sets us on the right path". However, the Coalition leader also linked the arguments Australia will be making in Paris over the two-week conference to his innovation agenda. "I am optimistic that innovation and technology can play a very big part in the discussions in Paris," he said. "The solutions to the climate change challenge lie very much in the field of technology and innovations, which is a very key part of my government's priorities. It is absolutely critical we continue to unleash that innovative spirit as we find better technologies - you just have to look at the way so many renewable technologies have improved rapidly in recent years." He will spend Monday at COP21 with other world leaders before flying back to Australia. The leaders hope to set a positive tone for the rest of the conference whose main goal is to cap global temperature rises at 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels - a level many scientists argue will prevent climate change from having dire consequences. Last week, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten made climate change a key battle ground for the next election by promising steeper emission cuts of 45 per cent reduction over the next 15 years, notwithstanding forecasts of significant economic and population growth over that time. He plans to go to Paris too. UN analysis of more than 160 national carbon reduction pledges covering more than 90 per cent of global emissions will not be enough to meet the goal of capping global warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels but should instead keep temperature rises to 2.7C-3C. \</doc>

Governments need to get behind carbon capture and storage technology to ensure it is rolled out widely because there is no hope of tackling the climate challenge at the current rate of deployment, according to the head of the Global CCS Institute, Brad Page. The institute's annual progress report on CCS projects shows only slow progress from a year ago, with up to 28 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to be captured at 15 operating projects this year. Another seven projects are due to start in the next 18 months to take captured CO2 volumes to 40 million tonnes. But that compares with the 4 billion tonnes that the International Energy Agency calculates is needed by 2040, rising to 6 billion tonnes in 2050. The technology, which involves extracting carbon from power generation and industrial processing plants and burying it in secure sites underground, offers a lifeline for the coal mining industry as well as the gas sector if it can be used on a wide scale. Mr Page calls for decision-makers to provide incentives to identify suitable sites for carbon capture and to support the development of projects as well as putting in place "predictable and enduring" regulations. COP21 United Nations conference on climate change. "Ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris, there remains a substantial gap between total country commitments to CO2 emission reductions and what science tells us we need to do." High costs and funding issues mean that project numbers are falling well short of what is required to ensure CCS plays its full part in helping limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The 22 large-scale CCS projects set to be in operation by 2017 are three times as many as at the start of the decade but is "dwarfed by the thousands required by the middle of this century to meet international climate targets," he said. The carbon capture project at Chevron's $US54 billion Gorgon LNG venture in Western Australia is the only Australian project in the Global CCS institute's report, with start-up scheduled for 2016-17. \</doc>

Turnbull faces a turnaround ON the last day of parliamentary sittings for the year, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull put boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria back on the table along with everything else, no matter what the issue After saying he had no intention of committing Australian troops to the conflict, Mr Turnbull says "if there is a call on us to provide further resources in a different way, we will consider that constructively". This appeared to be a faint echo of the change in American policy whereby US special forces in limited numbers will do what special forces do, such as conduct raids, free hostages, capture Islamic State leaders and identify more targets for attack. That will include targets in Syria, where British aircraft will bomb terrorists and their training camps following a vote in Parliament after an impassioned speech by Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron lost a previous vote, but turned around opinion on strikes in Syria by asking MPs if they wanted to take on Islamic State in its Syrian heartlands or "do we wait for them to attack us?". MPs decided they wouldn't wait and nor did Mr Turnbull's predecessor Mr Abbott when he joined with America in sending in Australian aircraft to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria. Another opinion on bombing targets in Syria was offered yesterday by former chief of the Australian Army and now director of the National Security Institute at the University of Canberra, Peter Leahy. The former general says air strikes will help win the battle but "the heart of this problem is an ideology and you can't bomb an ideology out of existence". That is why it is important to increase pressure on terrorists following the attacks in Paris and in other countries, including Australia. Mr Turnbull may soon find himself saying that he has received a call from the White House and he has changed his mind. Putting combat troops on the ground in some capacity in Iraq and Syria would seem inevitable. There is an accompanying terrorist danger on home soil that needs the help of the Muslim community if it is to be defeated. Eighteen-year-old Abdul Numan Haider was shot and killed after stabbing two police officers in Melbourne and 15-year-old Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar was shot dead after killing a police accountant in Parramatta in NSW. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of young men coming to the attention of Victoria Police, many of them teenagers. Mr Turnbull has returned from the United Nations climate change conference in Paris to find a number of government MPs are calling on the Muslim community to do more to prevent attacks at home. Liberal MPs are concerned that Islamic extremism is spreading and that the Muslim community has a responsibility to prevent radicalisation among Muslim youth. Reclaiming their religion from extremists who promote a corrupted concept of Islam is pivotal in preventing growing numbers of Muslim youths from being recruited to terrorism. The broad majority of the Muslim community deplore terrorism and are best placed to win the trust of vulnerable members of their community who may be attracted to it. All Australians must confront terrorism and its supporters, which makes a failure to take appropriate action against an Islamic extremist in the New South Wales courts all the more farcical. Milad bin Ahmad-Shah al-Ahmadzai has repeatedly refused to stand in the dock when the judge enters the court during his trial for attempted murder. Al-Ahmadzai, who is already in jail for having threatened to cut the throat of an ASIO officer, says he is "not at the behest of any authority other than Islam". In his most recent appearance, al-Ahmadzai was brought into court after Judge Gregory Farmer, SC, was seated, supposedly to avoid any question of contempt. That would be contemptible. There is only one law in Australia and that is Australian law. Stop the violence THE Herald Sun in its Take a Stand campaign against domestic violence has questioned the effectiveness of intervention orders that do little to protect families. A Sentencing Advisory Council report now supports our view that in many cases violence intervention orders are not backed up by the courts. The report reveals that more than one in three offenders who breach an order by menacing a victim get off with a fine. This is in spite of the Sentencing Advisory Council warning that imposing fines for breaches often failed to protect the victim or help to rehabilitate the offender.The number of family violence intervention orders issued by the courts increased by nearly 55 per cent, from 17,777 to 27,478 from July 2009 to June this year. Courts need to get tougher. Abusive men regard a fine as a slap on the wrist. \</doc>

\~\~Six years ago, Malcolm Turnbull's push for climate change action through an emissions trading scheme cost him his Liberal Party leadership. \~\~ It's been just over a week since the now prime minister toppled the rival that ousted him in 2009, Tony Abbott, and while the official line is existing climate policies will stay, the public are hearing other words along with it. \~\~ The main target of those words is Australia's renewable energy mix, which includes the same wind turbines that were heavily mocked by key Abbott government members. \~\~ "The opportunity for flexibility and innovation and for support and growth in the renewable sector ... is real and tangible right now," he told Sky News this week. \~\~ It's a significant transformation in rhetoric from the "utterly offensive" comments on wind turbines by then-treasurer Joe Hockey and the "visually awful" declaration from Mr Abbott. \~\~ "I frankly would have liked to have reduced the number (of turbines) a lot more," Mr Abbott said in June as the government firmed up a deal to cut the RET from 41,000 gigawatt hours to 33,000. \~\~ Significantly, just days into Mr Turnbull's reign, two renewable agencies slated for axing under the Abbott government were transferred to Mr Hunt's control. \~\~ The abolition of one of those, the profitable $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, plagued the Abbott government as a double-dissolution trigger after it was knocked back by the Senate twice. \~\~ It's not yet clear if that will be reversed but Mr Hunt met this week with both the CEFC and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency - which is still listed for abolition on official parliament papers. \~\~ The change in rhetoric is viewed by the industry's peak body, the Clean Energy Council, as "the first green shoots after a long winter." \~\~ The sector's main concern was that the Abbott government could continue to review the RET or renege on its bipartisanship, something Mr Hunt now appears have ruled out with terms like "iron-clad". \~\~ "Now we've had change of leadership and change of rhetoric the industry can stand behind the policy and get on with its job of implementing it." \~\~ "It feels like Minister Hunt has his back covered now," Mr Twidell said. \~\~ Australia will still take its 26-28 per cent 2030 emissions reduction target on 2005 levels to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris later this year and direct action is here to stay. \~\~ But the environment minister, under the leadership of Mr Turnbull, has ruled out an emissions trading scheme under the coalition despite some of the world's biggest polluters opting for the market mechanism. \~\~ Opposition Leader Bill Shorten hailed China's announcement as proof his party was in step with the rest of the world. \~\~ "The good news for Australia is I still have the same position." \</doc>

ELEANOR HALL: The Federal Government has now set a target for Australia to cut carbon emissions by at least 26 per cent by the year 2030. The Government has been under pressure from other world leaders to name the target it will take to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in November. At the conference, world leaders will attempt to forge a new international agreement to containe global warming in order to avoid sharp increases in the severity of storms, floods and droughts. In Canberra, Brendan Trembath reports. BRENDAN TREMBATH: At a meeting last night, senior Abbott Government ministers discussed Australia's long term plan to reduce pollution from sources such as coal-fired power plants and cars, trucks and buses. The Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says Australia is on track to meet and exceed pollution reduction targets agreed to an international meeting in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997. MATHIAS CORMANN: Australia's effort so far on a per capita basis when it comes to emissions reductions is one of the best in the world, and you know, we would expect that moving forward, Australia's emissions reductions effort on a per capita basis will continue to be leading the world. BRENDAN TREMBATH: He says it's important to reduce carbon pollution without harming the economy. MATHIAS CORMANN: The Coalition has a very strong track record in achieving responsible emissions reductions here in Australia in a way that does not detract from economic growth. BRENDAN TREMBATH: Some Coalition MPs worry about the impact on their electorates. The West Australian Liberal MP Dennis Jensen warns that steeper emission cuts will mean more expensive electricity. DENNIS JENSEN: Personally, I think it would be damaging. I think that what you are doing is you're going to be forcing electricity prices up, obviously because you will be forcing more renewables onto the market, because we don't, for instance, have nuclear power as an option to reduce those electricity-generated emissions. BRENDAN TREMBATH: Dr Jensen was disappointed that the Government's target was given to reporters before the backbench. But another Coalition MP Andrew Laming was more positive about the Government's plan. In an interview with ABC News 24, he called the cuts "responsible". ANDREW LAMING: You know, they trim two thirds of a billion dollars off your economy each year at 2030 results in slightly slower economic growth, but I think we all have to chip a little bit of that together. And then remember, when you get there to Paris, we all negotiate anyway, so this is simply what you're taking to the table. BRENDAN TREMBATH: The ABC understands the Cabinet agreed on a cut of between 26 per cent and 28 per cent depending on the economic impact. The base date is 2005. The Opposition climate change spokesman Mark Butler told Radio National that a 26 per cent target would put Australia at the back of the pack. MARK BUTLER: Countries to which we often compare ourselves, like the US and the United Kingdom, Germany - countries like that - all have targets in an equivalent time-frame into the 40 per cent range; so 41 per cent for America, 48 per cent for the UK. BRENDAN TREMBATH: The Australian Greens party accuses the Federal Government of manipulating the numbers, by picking a base year of 2005 when emissions were higher. Greens MP Adam Bandt: The Government must not fudge the numbers; the Government must use the same baselines that the European Union is using and the international negotiators are using, so that we can be sure that we're comparing apples with apples. BRENDAN TREMBATH: The independent Senator for South Australia Nick Xenophon urges the Australian Government to aim for deeper emission cuts. He says other developed nations have done it. I note that the UK, again a conservative government, they're looking at much more ambitious emissions reductions targets. BRENDAN TREMBATH: While there might be high hopes that developed and developing nations meeting in Paris will agree to a new global deal, the last attempt was a failure. In Copenhagen in 2009, national leaders failed to agree on a meaningful global agreement. ELEANOR HALL: Brendan Trembath. \</doc>

The BHP Billiton executive in charge of climate change has cut short her stay at the United Nations climate talks in Paris after her face appeared on "wanted" posters plastered by environmental activists outside upmarket hotels in the French capital. Fiona Wild, who is BHP's vice president of environment and climate change, was one of seven people to appear in a campaign organised by green activist group HYPERLINK Avaaz on Sunday night. Their photos appeared on more than 1000 wanted posters that described them as "climate criminals". Avaaz volunteers also handed out leaflets featuring the head shots to commuters at metro train stations near the conference. "These lobbyists have come to Paris to sabotage a global deal for ambitious climate action, despite over 3.6 million citizens around the world calling for 100 per cent clean energy," Avaaz's acting executive director, Emma Ruby-Sachs, said in a statement. "Ministers must listen to their people, not polluters, and refuse meetings with climate criminals who want to derail a deal the whole world wants."

Ms Wild had hoped to stay for the full two weeks of the conference. A BHP Billiton source denied speculation Ms Wild had cut short her stay because of security concerns. "She did return to Australia following a very concerning campaign by French activists, Avaaz, incorrectly claiming BHP Billiton and Dr Wild were climate change deniers," a BHP Billiton spokesperson said. "Nothing could be further from the truth. "The claims were entirely false, highly personalised and unfair. "Dr Wild is highly regarded for her integrity and credentials as a scientist supporting action on climate change. "Misleading and disruptive action such as this only detracts from the intelligent and necessary debates we need to have on climate change.

BHP Billiton has extensive coal, oil and gas operations that are significant contributors to greenhouse gas pollution. However, the Melbourne-based company has endorsed the UN's goal of capping global temperature rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels, a threshold most scientists regard as safe.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will put innovation in environmentally-friendly technologies at the heart of his pitch to world leaders gathered in Paris on Monday, describing Labor's plan to substantially increase Australia's carbon emission reduction targets as "a heroic offer" that would be prohibitively expensive. Speaking on the eve of the United Nations " COP21 " climate talks which will see more than 150 world leaders converge on the French capital, Mr Turnbull indicated that any credible attempt to curb global warming would require a unified commitment from national governments to cut greenhouse emissions but also the mobilisation of the private sector to develop green technologies. Mr Turnbull, who was speaking at the HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/world/turnbull-meets-the-queen-as-commonwealth-chooses-first-woman-secretary-general-20151127-gla9nx Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta on Saturday, said he hoped COP21 would result in a "a strong durable agreement" that "puts all countries on a common platform and allows them to periodically update their targets that sets us on the right path". However, the Coalition leader also linked the arguments Australia will be making in Paris over the two-week conference to the innovation agenda he unveiled while rolling Tony Abbott for the prime ministership in September. "I am optimistic that innovation and technology can play a very big part in the discussions in Paris," he said. "The solutions to the climate change challenge lie very much in the field of technology and innovations, which is a very key part of my government's priorities." Mr Turnbull had been critical of his party's climate change strategy under Mr Abbott but has not changed policies, including the taxpayer-funded Direct Action carbon abatement scheme, carbon reduction targets of 26-28 per cent by 2030 and a contribution of $1 billion over five years to the UN's Green Climate Fund set up to help developing countries adapt to climate change. Innovative spirit £bsolutely critical' With little room to move on these commitments, Mr Turnbull, who listed recent improvements in photovoltaic solar cells and battery storage as critical advances for the environment, is likely to announce measures at Paris to encourage innovation in green technologies. "It is absolutely critical we continue to unleash that innovative spirit as we find better technologies - you just have to look at the way so many renewable technologies have improved rapidly in recent years," he said. COP21 with other world leaders, including US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, before flying back to Australia. The leaders hope to set a positive tone for the rest of the conference whose main goal is to cap global temperature rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels - a level many scientists argue will prevent climate change from having dire consequences. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten last week HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/world/chogm-puts-climate-change-on-agenda-20151126-gl8p5g made climate change a key battle ground for the next election by promising a steeper emission cuts of 45 per cent reduction over the next 15 years, notwithstanding forecasts of significant economic and population growth over that time. "We need to get on with diversifying and de-coupling our economy, separating emissions growth from economic growth," Mr Shorten said on Friday. Industry and business groups have HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/politics/mining-industry-doubts-labors-climate-plan-20151127-gl9rbh#ixzz3sojXrE21 cast doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Shorten's plans, arguing they did not take into account its impact on growth, living standards and energy costs. Mr Turnbull described the Labor policy as "political rather than an environmental statement". "The opposition leader, being an opposition leader, as I have experienced, has certain luxuries and one of them is you don't have to provide quite so much analysis and justification as a government does," he said. "So all I would say about Mr Shorten's target is what everyone else has said about it, from leading economists to industry associations to commentators, that he has set some high targets but he has given no indication about how they could be affordably met. "Such analysis as it exists would suggest that the cost of meeting such very high cuts in emissions - which are way out of line with other comparable countries, so it's a heroic offer that he's made - the costs would be very, very considerable." Mr Turnbull also voiced his support for five-year reviews of national carbon reduction targets set in the lead up to COP21 . Some developing nations such as India have opposed "review mechanisms" as part of a push to get richer nations to shoulder more of the burden for climate change. Australia's climate ambassador Peter Woolcott HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/energy/ten-days-to-save-the-world-20151126-gl9agp this month argued : "We need this in order to judge how we are tracking collectively against the below-two degree goal, and to see whether our neighbours, trade partners and competitors are doing what they say". Sources said Indian opposition had "held up" the release of CHOGM's statement on climate action on Saturday. The statement called for ???a "legally binding agreement" that put the "global community on track to towards low-emission and climate-resilient societies and economies". Poorer countries argue they should not be held financial responsible for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem in the first place. "It is very important we reach agreement on the five-year reviews," Mr Turnbull said. "Paris is not the end of the journey, it is a step along the way to achieving a net zero emissions world. It is going to take a long time. That is what we need to do to arrest global warming. UN analysis of more than 160 national carbon reduction pledges covering more than 90 per cent of global emissions will not be enough to meet the goal of capping global warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels but should instead keep temperature rises to 2.7C-3C. Commonwealth funding Mr Turnbull also said Australia would fund four Commonwealth programs: $2.5 million over five years for a new counter-terrorism unit in the Commonwealth Secretariat. The UK provided &pound;5 million over the same period. $1 million for a new climate finance hub based Mauritius. $1 million for an initiative to train election officials in Commonwealth countries. $1 million for education projects. Mr Turnbull defended Australia's targets as "reasonable" and "achievable". "On a per capita basis the cut in emissions we are committing to by 2030 is the second highest in the OECD [behind Brazil]," he said. "The Australian targets are very reasonable one, they are ones we are satisfied we can achieve. "We will be reviewing our progress of emissions reduction strategies and environment policies in 2017, which is not very far away. I can assure you that the Environment Minister and myself are both very committed that we meet the targets that we meet the targets that we commit to in Paris and/or such other targets that may be agreed in the future." \</doc>

Planned international meetings in Paris such as the COP21 climate summit "must" go ahead as planned or the terrorists will have won, Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said during an emotional visit to one site of Paris' latest terror attack. Mr Frydenberg laid a green and gold bunch of flowers on the pavement outside the Bataclan Theatre in Paris, where three days earlier Australian Emma Parkinson, 19, was shot fleeing terrorists as almost 90 people were killed around her. On Monday night, Ms Parkinson was reunited with her mother, Lisa, who had flown from Australia. The teenager is recovering well from surgery on her hip where a bullet went through her, and will be released from hospital very soon, ambassador Stephen Brady said. After laying the flowers, Mr Frydenberg and Mr Brady inspected the rows of candles, the piles of roses and the poignant messages that have been left in a makeshift memorial outside the Bataclan. Behind them, street cleaners started shovelling old candles into a truck - a sign that the city wishes this normally busy street to soon return to business as usual. Cleaners in head-to-toe white protective gear walked around the Bataclan behind a police cordon, conducting the grisly work of decontaminating the blood-soaked scene. Mr Frydenberg said Australia "grieves with France following the horrendous events that occurred here last Friday". "Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of the many victims and the hundreds that are injured. Terrorism has no place in civilised society and we cannot accept it as the new norm. "Australia stands with France and its people at this most difficult time." As he laid the flowers Mr Frydenberg said he was thinking about the families of the victims and the victims themselves. "One cannot help but be moved when walking throughout this city, seeing the memorials on every corner, flowers and personal notes from people just like you and I who were so shocked and horrified by these events." He was in Paris for the two-day ministerial meeting of the International Energy Authority, a forum for international co-operation on energy policy. If such international meetings in Paris didn't go ahead then "terrorists will have had a small victory", Mr Frydenberg said - also citing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's coming visit to Paris for the COP21 climate summit as an example. "It's so important for us to come. We must show solidarity with the French people." Mr Frydenberg said he was due for a dinner with other international energy ministers hosted by French Energy Minister Segolene Royal on Monday night, where the attack on Paris would likely be the first topic of conversation. \</doc>

More than 100 world leaders have arrived in Paris in order to address the risk we face as humanity against the dire consequences of climate change. The summit runs from November 30 to December 11, but after all the speeches, photos and carbon-neutral canapes - What does COP21 actually mean for the Central West? COP21 is 21st annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change is a serious issue facing rural regions of Australia, it involves more than the melting ice caps, receding glaciers or the homeless polar bear. It involves all of us. Drought, flash-flooding, stronger storms, poor water quality and intense heat waves are all events that can have devastating effects locally, and are direct outcomes of climate change. Throughout the series of negotiations at the summit - Australia maintains a 2030 emissions reductions target of 28 per cent. This is comparable to many other developed countries, but in any case, targets are one thing - a roadmap to get there is another entirely. Without doubt however, one of the key policy instruments to help achieve this target is the federal government's Renewable Energy Target (RET), which has a target of 33,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy output by 2020. The share of renewable energy in NSW's electricity mix has almost doubled over the past 5 years, supporting over 13,000 jobs. However, more work is needed towards mitigating the 115 million tonnes of CO2 pollution emitted by NSW annually (Australian Bureau of Statistics 5220.0). A key issue has been who should adopt responsibility for taking action? Obviously mitigating climate change is a benefit accrued to everyone. NSW's inland cities have always been the backbone of the state through farming, crops, vineyards and a diverse range of agriculture, and now as a society we look towards the people and resources of the Central West as the cornerstone of a cleaner, more sustainable future. The Central West has an abundant and diverse renewable energy resource including solar PV in Manildra, wind in Bodangora, and Hydro at the Burrendong Dam. These projects offer a simple solution for reducing our reliance on fossil fuel and high pollutant electricity generation, and at the same time offer employment opportunities, tourism and better infrastructure. The agreements that will come out of the Paris Climate Summit mean that in order to reach our emissions target the Central West will play an integral role. This enables an incredible opportunity for Central NSW to maintain its lead in embracing renewable energy, and benefit from the increased jobs and investment in the region.

Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat says a climate change agreement signed by the Commonwealth's 53 countries made clinching a deal at the upcoming Paris COP21 talks more likely. "The fact that we have achieved convergence and near unanimity on a very focused statement on climate change puts the possibility of a success at COP21 in better shape," he said on Sunday at the close of a three-day summit on the Mediterranean island. Leaders from the Commonwealth family, which represents around a third of the world's population, on Saturday pledged to demand an "ambitious", legally binding outcome from the world climate change summit in Paris, which starts officially on Monday. The Commonwealth said it was "deeply concerned" about the disproportionate threat from an ever-hotter planet to its most vulnerable members - many of whom said reaching a deal was "a matter of life and death". Freundel Stuart, the prime minister of Barbados, called on Paris attendees to wake up, saying world leaders no longer have the luxury of arguing over whether global warming is a threat. "When the planet speaks we have no choice but to listen, and it has been speaking to us with a daunting eloquence over the last few years. If we don't reach a sensible agreement in Paris we can all prepare for disaster," he said. Because its membership includes industrialised G7 powers like Britain and Canada, emerging giants like India and tiny island microstates such as the Maldives, agreement in the Commonwealth has historically boded well for deals being struck beyond its bounds. Among the few things concluded at the flop 2009 Copenhagen global climate change summit were items that had been agreed beforehand by the Commonwealth. The organisation said it was confident its agreement "joined and implemented by all parties, should put the global community on track towards low-emission and climate-resilient societies and economies." Some 150 leaders will kick off the UN conference, tasked with reaching the first truly universal climate pact, in Paris on Monday. The goal is to limit average global warming to two degrees Celsius over pre-Industrial Revolution levels by curbing fossil fuel emissions blamed for climate change. Small island members of the Commonwealth have insisted the two degree limit does not go far enough, and called repeatedly this weekend for a 1.5 degree cap to be adopted. \</doc>

THE Renault-Nissan Alliance will provide 200 electric vehicles for this year's United Nations COP21 climate conference in Paris from November 30 to December 11. Recognised as the world's largest-ever EV fleet for an international conference, the cars will carry about 20,000 delegates from 195 countries and the prediction is they will cover 400,000 combined kilometres over the 12 days. Speaking about the role of the electric cars at the conference, Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, said it was a practical and affordable mode of transportation. "At the same time they offer a solution for drastically reducing tailpipe carbon-dioxide emissions. "They also reduce regulated exhaust pollutants, helping us to improve the air quality in our cities. Together, the public and private sectors can accelerate the transition to a zero-emission society," Mr Ghosn said. COP21 car fleet will include the Renault Zoe sub-compact, Nissan's Leaf compact and seven-seat e-NV200 van. This year's conference marks the first time the UN has used a full zero-emission fleet for its entire passenger-car shuttle at a climate summit. PSA Peugeot Citroen said its cars will not only comply with necessary emissions standards in all its markets but it will also publish real-world fuel consumption figures in partnership with an independent body. The French car maker's promises come in the wake of Volkswagen's "dirty diesel" scandal which, said PSA Peugeot Citroen, affects the entire automotive industry. The company said it wants to give better information to its customers, investors and other stakeholders. It also said its cars have never been fitted with any software or device that detects emissions testing and triggers a pollution treatment system, which then deactivates for normal driving conditions. Thor joins the Audi family AUDI Australia has appointed Australian actor Chris Hemsworth to its ambassador line up. Announcing the signing, company managing director Andrew Doyle said the partnership with Chris Hemsworth exemplifies the brand's love of film and commitment to Australian artists. "Not only is Chris one of our most successful and talented acting exports, he's a laidback Australian family man who epitomises the true essence of Audi style and sophistication," he said.

\~\~ VALLETTA, Nov 29 AFP - A climate change agreement signed by the Commonwealth has made clinching a deal at the upcoming Paris COP21 talks more likely, according to the Commonwealth summit host. \~\~ "The fact that we have achieved convergence and near unanimity on a very focused statement on climate change puts the possibility of a success at COP21 in better shape," Commonwealth summit host Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said at the close of a three-day gathering on the Mediterranean island on Sunday. \~\~ Heads of government from the Commonwealth family, which represents around a third of the world's population, on Saturday pledged to demand an "ambitious" and legally binding outcome from the world climate change summit in Paris, which starts officially on Monday. \~\~ It launched a Climate Finance Access Hub aimed at smaller island states that want to get access to funds to mitigate against the effects of climate change, with Australia, Britain, Canada and India pledging billions of dollars. \~\~ Freundel Stuart, the prime minister of Barbados, called on Paris attendees to wake up, saying leaders no longer had the luxury of arguing over whether global warming was a threat. \~\~ Some 150 leaders will kick off the UN conference in Paris, tasked with reaching the first truly universal climate pact. \~\~ Small island members of the Commonwealth have insisted the two degree limit does not go far enough, and have called repeatedly this weekend for a 1.5 degree cap to be adopted. \</doc>

Kiribati has turned to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to help build artificial islands in an effort to save the low-lying Pacific nation from rising sea levels. The country's outgoing President Anote Tong has told the ABC's HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/pacific-beat/ Pacific Beat program that despite global commitments on reducing carbon emissions, "the science continues to indicate that we will continue to go under water within the century". "So we really have to look at adaptation strategies beyond mitigation, and we will have to build islands," he said. The UAE is home to the world's biggest man-made island, called Palm Jumeirah, and has at least two more currently being built. "We recently received a technical team from UAE headed by Dutch engineers with the sole objective of providing Kiribati with technical and credible solutions to our predicament," Mr Tong told the Pacific Climate Change Conference in Wellington. "Indeed there is a light at the end of the tunnel. What might have been viewed as something unachievable and impossible may now become the solution not only for Kiribati but all other low-lying atoll islands." "However, if we are really serious about ensuring a secure and safe future for our people, giving up has never been an option," he said. New Zealand businessman and speaker at the Wellington conference Rod Oram said building the islands would "need a very concerted international support, because it would be a phenomenally expensive thing to do". The majority of Kiribati's 33 coral atolls are less than six metres above sea level. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology's National Tidal Centre has reported an average sea level rise of 7.3 millimetres a year for Kiribati since 1992, and the Kiribati government has said the rise has already forced some villagers to abandon their homes. 'A message that needs to be repeated' Mr Tong, who has held office since 2003, will be replaced in presidential elections in March. His three terms have been defined by his climate change advocacy and he was HYPERLINK /news/2015-12-15/kiribatis-president-appreciative-of-australia-at-climate-talks/7028100 an active voice in the HYPERLINK COP21 climate talks . "I was extremely thrilled by what happened in Paris, it's a long way from what happened in Copenhagen, but at the same time the job is not yet done," he said. "So we must continue to maintain that pressure." Fiji recently became the first nation in the world to ratify the COP21 agreement, a document that Mr Tong said would soon be ratified by Kiribati. Mr Tong added he would continue to advocate for climate action after his presidency. "It's a message that needs to be repeated, because not everybody is listening," he said. "I suspect I will continue to be involved." \</doc>

As ministers from around the world gather at COP21 in Paris in a bid to come to an agreement on a new global climate compact, an environmental scientist from Xi£n Jiaotong-Liverpool University has warned that the controversial method of fracking, which is being investigated by many countries as an alternative fuel source, is inconsistent with climate change mitigation policies. Dr Philip Staddon, from the Department of Environmental Science at XJTLU, warns that fracking contributes both directly and indirectly to greenhouse gas emissions and, despite being "dubiously" portrayed as environmentally friendly, delays the transition to a low carbon future. Hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, or fracking, is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. The desire for short-term (next 30 years) energy security has re-invigorated investment in fossil fuel technologies and led to a North American boom in fracking, as well as protests by environmental campiagners against the technique. In an academic opinion piece for Environmental Science & Technology, co-authored with Professor Michael Depledge from the European Centre for Environment and Human Health, Dr Staddon states that addressing climate change and meeting the world's energy needs are two of the greatest challenges that societies face, and that the search for inexpensive and plentiful energy supplies appears to be at odds with climate change mitigation commitments. Evidence suggests that recent climate change arises primarily from human activities that release greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, and methane, into the atmosphere. "Lowering greenhouse emissions requires reduced dependence on fossil fuels, rendering...the search for new sources of oil and gas particularly perverse," writes Dr Staddon in the piece. "Expanding fossil fuel extraction capabilities sends the message that rapid climate change mitigation is neither urgent nor essential." The opinion piece highlights that the carbon footprint of shale gas carbon is very similar to that of coal when compared over 100 years and that evidence contradicts the view that shale gas is a "clean" or "environmentally friendly" energy source. "The dangers posed by "greenwashing" shale gas as a route to climate change mitigation, are well documented. It is unimaginable that oil and coal reserves will be left in the ground, therefore shale gas represents an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions," writes Dr Staddon. Dr Staddon, whose research looks at the response of ecosystems to environmental change, especially climate change, added: "Government ministers are meeting at COP21 to discuss worldwide limits to greenhouse emissions, yet fracking for shale gas will extend the fossil fuel age, increase the costs of mitigation and drive up the cost of adaptation required to support human societies in a less hospitable climate. The negative financial impacts on economies and to human health will be externalised and borne by those often poorer societies most affected by climate change."

London | JPMorgan Chase, one of the world's biggest banks, is to stop direct financing of all new coal mines and coal power plants in rich countries in the wake of the global climate accord agreed in Paris in December. The US bank has included coal projects alongside child labour on a list of "prohibited transactions" in the new version of its environmental and social policy published on its website. "We believe the financial services sector has an important role to play as governments implement policies to combat climate change," the policy says. JPMorgan is one of the top 10 backers of coal-fired power plants and its previous limits on coal financing were confined to contentious operations such as mountain top mining, where large parts of a mountain or ridge were removed to extract coal. The bank will maintain corporate lending relationships with big mining groups that produce a range of commodities including coal, but will not provide specific project financing to develop new coal mines. It will also avoid financing new coal-fired power plants in more than 30 high-income OECD countries. The decision comes as the coal industry confronts a gloomy landscape of tumbling commodity prices, falling share values for producers and the bankruptcy of some well-known US miners, including Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources. Several large US and European banks decided to limit coal-related lending in the lead-up to the COP21 But environmental groups said JPMorgan's decision was still a significant step. "This is the first major policy change we've seen following the Paris agreement," said Ben Collins, a climate campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network advocacy group in San Francisco. "It's a step away from financing coal, which we see as the dirtiest and most carbon-intensive fuel," he said, adding it would be better if banks immediately halted all support for coal mines and power plants. Shareholders want companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron to stress test their business plans against the Paris accord's goal to reduce carbon pollution and limit global temperature rises. Other companies such as Marathon Oil and Anadarko are being asked to disclose "stranded asset risks", or the potential that fossil fuel reserves will become unusable. "These resolutions are a powerful signal that the world is shifting to a clean energy, low-carbon global economy, and that fossil fuel companies need to be ready," said Mindy Lubber, president of the non-profit group Ceres, which helped co-ordinate the filings. But it is not clear any of them will get approval from a majority of shareholders. \</doc>

Mr Frydenberg laid a simple green and gold bunch of flowers on the pavement outside the Bataclan Theatre in Paris, where three days earlier 19-year-old Australian Emma Parkinson was shot fleeing terrorists as almost 90 people were killed around her. On Monday night, even as Mr Frydenberg placed the flowers, Ms Parkinson was reunited with her mother Lisa, who had flown from Australia to be at her hospital bedside as she recovered. The teenager is recovering well from surgery on her hip where a bullet went through her, and will be released from hospital very soon, ambassador Stephen Brady said. She was "super-excited" to see her mother. After laying the flowers, Mr Frydenberg and Mr Brady inspected the rows of candles, the piles of roses and the poignant messages that locals have been leaving in a makeshift memorial outside the Bataclan. Behind them, street cleaners started shovelling old candles into a truck - a sign that the city wishes this normally-busy street to soon return to business as usual. Cleaners in head-to-toe white protective gear walked around the Bataclan behind a police cordon, still conducting the grisly work of decontaminating the blood-soaked scene. Mr Frydenberg, the minister for Resources, Energy and Northern Australia, said Australia "grieves with France following the horrendous events that occurred here last Friday". "Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of the many victims and the hundreds that are injured. Terrorism has no place in civilised society and we cannot accept it as the new norm. "Australia stands with France and its people at this most difficult time." As he laid the flowers Mr Frydenberg said he was thinking about the families of the victims and the victims themselves - "young and old, so innocent". "One cannot help but be moved when walking throughout this city, seeing the memorials on every corner, flowers and personal notes from people just like you and I who were so shocked and horrified by these events. Mr Frydenberg, in Paris for the two-day ministerial meeting of the International Energy Authority, a forum for international co-operation on energy policy. If such international meetings in Paris didn't go ahead as a result of the terror attack then "terrorists will have had a small victory", Mr Frydenberg said - also citing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's upcoming visit to Paris for the COP21 climate summit as another example. "We don't want (terrorists) to have any victory whatsoever, that's why it's so important for us to come. We must show solidarity with the French people." Mr Frydenberg said he was due for a dinner with other international energy ministers hosted by French Energy Minister Segolene Royal on Monday night, where the attack on Paris would likely be the first topic of conversation. \</doc>

The Queensland Government is silently preparing Queensland for an 80cm sea rise, which would impact tens of thousands of homes by the end of the century, with pilot projects beginning along the Queensland coast. The first test pilot in Townsville was completed in July 2015 and shows almost 4400 properties would be flooded. The step comes as Queensland's climate change strategists meet on Wednesday and as Australia prepares for the United Nations climate change conference in Paris on November 30. The Townsville pilot shows very high costs are involved. The cost of one project - preserving Townsville's inner-city as it is - would cost $1.73 billion alone and work must be "implemented' by 2027. Recent HYPERLINK http://www.ozcoasts.gov.au/climate/Map_images/SthEastQld/OCGC_South/2.0/jpeg/150dpi/Brisbane_20_150_Map_37.jpg Gold Coast flood mapping also shows a seal level rise of 0.8m would have a significant impact around Carrara and behind Surfers Paradise among other areas. However the Council declined to identify how many properties may be impacted. The Townsville report shows 2830 properties would be HYPERLINK http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/council/projects/Documents/Coastal%20Hazard%20Adaptation%20Strategy/Coastal_Hazard_Adaptation_Strategy.pdf flooded in Townsville's inner suburbs, 331 properties at Balgal Beach, 291 properties at Bushland Beach and 254 in Townsville North. To protect inner-suburbs of Townsville: "a combination of sea levees, storm tide gates, seawalls and beach nourishment may optimally defend against the 100-year storm tide event and sea level rise by 2100" the study says. This pilot study includes a one-metre storm tide common during cyclones, which climatologists warn will become more prevalent and more common further south. It breaks down Townsville into areas to "Defend", to "Accommodate" or to "Retreat". In very broad terms "defend" includes building sea levees; "retreat" means resuming land and homes and "accommodate" means raising roads and lifting habitable floor levels. In Townsville - in four of the 18 locations - the strategies which have been proposed would have little or no impact and are not "economically viable". "In 14 of these 18 Localities the assessment indicates there is potential to reduce the damage or loss associated with the Maintain Status Quo approach by funding Defend, Accommodate or Retreat adaptation options in these areas," the report says. "However, in the remaining four (4) study areas invested in the BCA, none of the adaptation options considered produced an outcome that was greater than the Maintain Status Quo result." It summarises the impact on inner-city Townsville as ; "Projected sea level rise poses a significant threat to the Townsville Inner Suburbs with up to 2764 properties affected by 2100"; "The 1% AEP storm tide event under projected sea level rise and climate change poses significant threat to the Townsville Inner Suburbs with 3372 properties affected by 2100"; "There are significant infrastructure assets at risk due to projected sea level rise and climate change impacts." The HYPERLINK http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/council/projects/Documents/Coastal%20Hazard%20Adaptation%20Strategy/Coastal_Hazard_Adaptation_Strategy.pdf Townsville study - completed by consultants GHD with the support of the LGAQ - shows some projects need to be implemented by 2027 in order to be effective. Fairfax Media understands the aim of the HYPERLINK little-known, rarely-discussed Queensland Government Climate Change Adaptive Strategy is to replicate this Townsville pilot study in other cities. In the 2015-16 Queensland Budget, $15 million was allocated for planning over the next three years. "Coastal councils will be able to apply for a share of $12 million to assist with developing local plans and options to deal with their escalating climate risks," Environment Minister Steven Miles said. James Cook University - with campuses in Townsville and Cairns - is studying the effects of climate change on Queensland's biodiversity making recommendations into protected area planning. Gold Coast City Council - long-considered vulnerable to climate change and coastal erosion - is updating its flood mapping based on the new Queensland Government sea-level rise research. "The City is reviewing the mapping provided by the State and will consider it in the context of the approximately $48 million a year we spend on coastal and flood management and on the detailed modelling undertaken internally," a spokeswoman for Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate said. Gold Coast City Council's new City Plan was sent to Deputy Premier, Local Government and Planning minister Jackie Trad's office in April 2015, before the Townsville pilot study was completed in July 2015. "Since that time, the State's coastal hazards policy has changed, and therefore, the Council will progress any consequential changes to our mapping in a future amendment to the scheme," a spokeswoman for Gold Coast City Council said. The Gold Coast will spend $26 million to counter flooding and drainage in 2015/16 and a further $22 million on local drainage. Conservationists ask for change to get faster action "So this isn't the first time that (governments) have looked at adaptation," Ms Macey said. "It would be remiss of this government to just start from scratch all over again," she said. The 0.8 metre sea level rise has been chosen because it is in line at "the upper end of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 4th Assessment Report projections". "It is great that the government has re-implemented the 0.8 metre sea level rise," Ms Macey said. "But they need a way to be able to act faster with the latest science."

Over time, David Pocock hopes to change the world. For the moment, however, he is focusing on changing the rugby dimension of it. Certainly the game will never be played quite the same way after his performance at the World Cup. Nathan Sharpe, the former Australia captain, believes that No 8 play has been forever revolutionised after Pocock was moved into that position. Traditionally, it has been reserved for the biggest, most destructive player in the pack but Pocock has exposed a previously unglimpsed range of new possibilities. Previously, as an openside flanker, he would attempt to make the tackle then immediately jump to his feet and work towards gaining a turnover. Now, he leaves the tackling to Michael Hooper or Scott Fardy or others. His role is to go for the kill, to rip the ball from the enemy or at least force him to hang on so desperately he concedes a penalty. In this he has been so successful, he has moulded the World Cup to his will and been the player most responsible for the Wallabies advancing to the final. Now comes the ultimate test, the All Blacks, who have already lost one Test in large part because of him, in Sydney in August, and are intent on stopping him from taking another. When the All Blacks run out at Twickenham tomorrow morning for the Rugby World Cup final, Pocock is the man they will fear most. He gave advance notice of his impending greatness in 2011 when he virtually single-handedly beat the Springboks in the quarter-finals of the last World Cup, defying their massive behemoths with more turnovers than a French pastry chef. But then it all was put on hold as two knee reconstructions each cost him a season. Only this year he returned to football and it would have to be said it is quickly catching up with him. He is bruised and battered already, with two panda-like shiners, a gashed eye and a broken nose but no doubt by kick-off, he will look back on that as the good old days, when he still had his looks. More than any other Australian, he is the man who stands between the All Blacks and victory and they are coming for him. Good thing he has a few distractions. Pocock admits he would be trying to save the planet even if he wasn't a rugby player. The fact that he is, the fact that he may have become the best rugby player in the world, opens up a whole new level of political activism. Fame has its price and restrictions, but one of the benefits is that now when he speaks, people listen. "It's something I'd be doing if I wasn't a rugby player," he says of his activism. "I feel that climate change is an issue that needs to be taken seriously in Australia and historically, it hasn't been. It's been a political football. There hasn't been bipartisan support for a way to actually lead on it. As a citizen, that's really frustrating." He was given a stern talking to by the Australian Rugby Union when he chained himself to mining equipment in NSW as part of a protest against new coalmines but, while he apologised, at no point did he pledge not to take a political stand again. He made a stand on gay bullying, though, to be fair, when he approached the referee about a Waratahs player calling one of the Brumbies "a faggot", he has no idea he was going live into every living room courtesy of ref cam. Still, it pulled the player up and he subsequently apologised and even trained with the gay rugby team. Yes, he also paid a $20,000 fine but you sensed the whole incident was one of poor habit rather than in-built sexual discrimination. Pocock and his partner Emma have vowed not to get married until gay marriage is legalised in Australia but you wonder whether, with all the battering he is taking, that will hold good if he suddenly starts snoring. No, only kidding. They're good. Even at the World Cup, he has been busy, signing an open letter urging world leaders to agree on a moratorium on coalmining at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December. Yet he also does a lot of his speaking one-on-one. And with Wallabies coach Michael Cheika admitting the Wallabies cover the political spectrum from extreme left - which you assume means Pocock - to centre right, there would seem to be fertile ground there for him to plough. "Yes, we definitely talk," he said. "You get 30 guys together and we definitely talk. And guys are pretty open to talking about current affairs." Nor does he feel he has a monopoly on the truth. "You've always got to be open to learning. If someone has a better opinion \'e2\€ \£6 but there's no one running around with an agenda trying to get -people to change their minds and it's just casual conversation." He would like nothing more than to see his hero, wildlife documentary maker and activist David Attenborough at the World Cup final. Even a rugby champion has people he looks up to. You suspect, however, that he is going to be disappointed. Instead, it will be Richie McCaw, Kieran Read and Jerome Kaino bearing down on him like he's all that stands between them and the World Cup.Which in many ways he is.Mark Ella P44 \</doc>

The French, grateful for our former prime minister's contribution this week of ideas on how to solve Europe's migration problems, have leapt to thank us by drawing our attention to a bright idea of their own. A French invention the Wind Tree, a three-metre tall, tree-looking wind turbine (pictured), is imagined by its inventors New Wind as a relatively petite, pretty, softly spoken wind-power generator for urban places. New Wind noticed some French hostility to the giant wind turbines of wind farms, but says that people who have despised the giant turbines and never thought they'd warm to wind power are charmed by the wind trees. They have gone into production and, for the moment, they are really rather expensive. A prototype is erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to beguile those potentates and boffins who will be in Paris for the looming (November 30 to December 11) United Nations Climate Change Conference . This futuristic column pricked up its ears at discussion (on the BBC's World Business Report on ABC Radio National at dawn on Wednesday) of the wind trees. We have been much engaged in the debate about the big wind turbines (like the ones at Lake George), taking issue with the philistines (like Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey) who see no beauty in them and in the way in which they sometimes enhance a landscape. But up to a point the French trees seem to be a response to French versions of Abbotts and Hockeys, to complaints about conventional wind turbines' size, noise and landscape-transforming looks. With enough of the little trees in neighbourhoods there may in time be no need for giant wind farms as we have known them, their massive forms arranged all along windswept hills. New Wind was started by Jerome Michaud-Lariviere. He was taking a walk, the breeze perhaps ruffling his hair, when he noticed that same breeze rustling leaves on trees and imagined the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity. Online we read that the tree "has 72 artificial leaves [called aeroleaves] serving as micro-turbines spinning on a vertical axis". We read that the Wind Tree is designed to harness even gentle winds and breezes. This means the trees will be able to do useful work on most days of the year. "The steel tree stands 11m tall," one online source testifies, "and is said to be completely silent, with all cables and generators integrated into the leaves and branches." New Wind imagines that a single tree will be used to provide oomph for, say, a nearby home or to pep up the battery of an electric car. ??? You can read lots about the Wind Trees online - for example HYPERLINK http://www.gizmag.com/wind-tree-fig-leaf-unsightly-turbines/35040/ http://www.gizmag.com/wind-tree-fig-leaf-unsightly-turbines/35040/ - and with a little ingenuity you can find and listen to a podcast of the breezy BBC World Business Report story. Meanwhile it is stimulating to think of what a special resonance the French idea is bound to have here in energy-progressive and tree-crazed Canberra. Here almost anything shaped like a tree, whatever it is and whatever it does, is bound to have appeal. Australian, Canberran adaptations of the turbines might make sure that the turbines "leaves" have an especially eucalyptsy look (to our eyes the French "leaves" already do, a bit) so as to enable them to blend fittingly into our dinky-di places. Rich Canberrans living in their ostentatious McMansions (like the especially obscene ones in O'Malley) will be well able to afford them. In Europe they are presently about ???29,500 ($45,000) each. What's more (for few owners of McMansions cultivate real gardens) McMansioners are likely to prefer non-deciduous steel trees with "aeroleaves" to real trees that make a mess. We even, our imagination beginning to run away with this, begin to imagine the Northbourne Avenue route of the light rail lined not with the real Australian widow-maker trees but with these artificial wind trees that will not only generate power but also never drop a branch on anyone. Meanwhile, our oblique reference above to Tony Abbott brings a pang of regret. It is that his awful prime ministership was never marked, as some prime ministerships have been, by the creation of witty products that poked fun at him. If only a fun-loving manufacturer had created rolls of Tony Abbott lavatory paper! This columnist would have bought them in bulk so as to use them on every day of his nasty, brutish and (thank God!) short prime ministership. Reader Neal Gowen has long owned and treasured rolls of Malcolm Fraser and John Howard lavatory paper. The John Howard paper (this columnist has and treasures a roll of it) has each tissue embossed with Howard's despised likeness and the wrapper urged the purchaser to "wipe the smile off his face". I would never part with my Howard roll (for I am an only child and never give up my toys) but Gowen has parted with both his rolls. "I thought you might like to know," he tells me, knowing that we have collectibles camaraderie in this, "I have passed mine on so that future generations will see them, and gasp in awe at the antiquities." His Fraser roll (an antiquity 40 years old) was eagerly accepted by the National Library of Australia and his Howard roll was pounced upon with equal eagerness by the Museum of Australian Democracy, Old Parliament House. "I took some farewell photos of the rolls before they left for their new homes," Gowen reports, thus supplying us with the evocative picture we use today. \</doc>

"Everyone is committed to achieving a good outcome in Paris. I am optimistic." - Malcolm Turnbull, 7:30 Report, Thursday If there is one reason why the prime minister might be proved right about the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, it is that the massive gathering is being organised along completely different lines to the disastrous 2009 Copenhagen summit. In Copenhagen world leaders turned up at the last minute to find their negotiating teams in disarray and no clear agreement for them to sign. Developing countries led by China had spent much of the two weeks in December blocking discussions in open sessions and then used the frantic, last-minute negotiations behind closed doors to remove enough critical details to ensure there was no binding treaty. Western leaders such as US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel flew home for Christmas embarrassed and angry. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd would famously HYPERLINK https://www.quarterlyessay.com/essay/2010/06/power-trip/extract accuse the Chinese of ratf$%king There is no chance of this happening in Paris. Or at least not in the same order. This time the likes of Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India and Malcolm Turnbull will at the opening day on Monday attempt to set a positive tone for the rest of the fortnight, and then let their negotiating teams get on the with the job of nutting out an agreement. Another key difference is the way the UN has gone about building consensus. At Copenhagen and the Kyoto conference in 1997, the UN attempted to impose carbon reduction targets from the top down. This time the countries themselves have come with their own goals. In the lead up to the French summit, at least 160 countries representing more than 90 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions made pledges, known in the UN jargon as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, to cut carbon emissions. UN analysis has found these INDCs will not be enough to meet the summit's main goal of capping temperature rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels - a threshold many scientists argue will prevent climate change from having dire consequences - but should instead keep warming to 2.7C-3C. However, the Chinese are supportive this time having signed a joint statement with the US in November last year in which the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters agreed to a "common vision". China vowed its spiralling emissions would stop growing by "around 2030" while the US promised to cut its own CO2 (from 2005 levels) emissions by 26-28 percent over the next decade. For its part, Australia has vowed to cut 2005-level carbon emissions by the same 26-28 per cent range as the US but over the next 15 years. It is an INDC research group Climate Action Tracker ranks as "inadequate" - and sits well below the European Union's 40 per cent goal - yet is relatively ambitious when measured on a per capita basis. Opposition leaders Bill Shorten used a speech on Friday to say Labor will adopt a far tougher target - a 45 per cent cut in carbon emissions by 2030 - and accuse Turnbull of "flying to Paris carrying Tony Abbott's climate-sceptic baggage". "I think last time there were these big talks there was too much pressure for very specific agreed actions and as a result it was set up not to succeed. Some countries participated and some didn't," says Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Group Executive for Institutional Banking and Markets. "This is a global issue and having that global commitment that allows the countries to put in place policies that will make a difference." Anthony Hobley, who is the chief executive of the London-based independent research house Carbon Tracker, describes Copenhagen as "climate Dunkirk", which is a reference to the French harbour where hundreds of thousands of Allied troops were surrounded but were evacuated by sea during the Nazi conequest off France. "Paris, I think, shows every sign of being climate D-Day," he says. "Of course, as we know, D-Day was the beginning of a long and difficult campaign but it was critical to securing a beachhead". So as more than 40,000 thousand world leaders, diplomats, activists and journalists prepare to converge on Paris - and 120,000 police, gendarmes and soldiers are deployed across France in a bid to prevent further terrorist attacks - is it right to assume the stars are aligning for meaningful action on climate change? "My deepest hope and belief is that the world will achieve an agreement on climate change in Paris" HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/NPC?src=hash #NPC \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/YoMol1HKta pic.twitter.com/YoMol1HKta ??? Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/GregHuntMP/status/669331638396936192 November 25, 2015 The answer to this questions is not straight forward. Expectations have been managed well ahead of COP21 - which is UN-speak for the 21st Conference of the Parties - so that most observers describe the conference as simply part of the transition to a lower carbon world. "One step along a very, very long path," according to Fiona Wild, Vice President Environment and Climate Change at BHP Billiton. Making countries spell out there commitments ahead of time means there is unlikely to be an outcry when the final national pledges are tallied and it is confirmed the 2C target had not been met. But there is still plenty for the various parties to argue about. And once again it is divisions between developed and developing countries - which were the cause of the friction in Copenhagen - that could limit the effectiveness of any agreement struck in the City of Light. Keeping their word HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/nov/19/australias-lead-public-servant-for-global-climate-talks-reveals-hopes-and-fears-for-paris A speech given by Australia's low-profile but highly-regarded ambassador to the environment, Peter Woolcott, to the Global Change Institute in Brisbane last week provides a useful guide to what Australia would regard as success in Paris. "So how will Paris work out? It is hard to predict, but my sense is that the real danger is not that there will be no agreement but that it will be a minimalist agreement - that Paris will tie a neat bow around the INDCs and that much of what we want in terms of transparency, accountability, durability and review may be lost," said Woolcott. Australia will use its position as chair of HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6343.php the Umbrella Group , which is a loose coalition of non-European Union developed countries formed after Kyoto, to push for five-year reviews of national carbon reduction commitments as well as firm rules around transparency and accountability governing the INDCs. "We need this in order to judge how we are tracking collectively against the below-two degree goal, and to see whether our neighbours, trade partners and competitors are doing what they say," Woolcott said. However, aspects of these goals have made some developing nations nervous. For example, India opposed a reference to a "review mechanism" in a G20 climate change accord announced during a meeting in Turkey earlier this month. While China agreed there should be a five-year review mechanism of national climate pledges, India said it did not want the G20 to interfere with the Paris conference and even rejected a general commitment to "periodic monitoring". India has a long history of resisting what the Finance Ministry's chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/07/27/can-china-stand-on-its-own/chinas-strength-is-obvious-its-future-role-is-not regularly \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0805bac2-937d-11e5-bd82-c1fb87bef7af.html?ftcamp=crm/email/_2015___11___20151126__/emailalerts/Keyword_alert/product#axzz3sbokqiPk describes as "carbon imperialism" imposed by the West. New Dehli almost derailed the Durban talks in 2011 by opposing a series of proposals and - as the world's fourth-largest greenhouse emitter - has the capacity to seriously upset negotiations in Paris. While Obama has claimed credit for helping pave the way for China's engagement with the Paris talks, it would appear his attempts to woo India by hosting Modi in Washington and then travelling to India have been less successful. New Delhi's opposition goes to the heart of the split between developed and developing nations. Poorer countries argue they should not have to shoulder most of the burden for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem in the first place. They are particularly opposed to calls from groups such as the G7 to step up efforts to phase out fossil fuels. With billions of people living in energy poverty - about a quarter of India's population of 1.2 billion struggle to get access to basic electricity - ignoring cheap thermal coal as a source of power is not an option. "Balancing the need for climate transition with alleviating global energy poverty is difficult," says CBA's Bayer Rosmarin. "It's very easy to sit in the western developed world, where we take for granted that we turn on a switch and the power is on, to say we should stop exporting coal to China, India or Indonesia - even though our coal is actually cleaner than the coal they can dig up there. But if you are interested in the financial well being of those countries and communities then that would be too much of a black and white position." Australia's three main representatives at the Paris conference - Turnbull, Environment Minister Greg Hunt and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - are familiar with grey areas. On the one hand they are keen to reestablish the country's green credentials after the Abbott era yet on the other hand they will not back measure that damage Australia's economically-important coal industry. In an opinion piece written for HYPERLINK http://theconversation.com/india-is-focused-on-energy-and-poverty-but-it-can-still-sign-a-global-climate-deal-47868 The Conversation this HYPERLINK http://theconversation.com/india-is-focused-on-energy-and-poverty-but-it-can-still-sign-a-global-climate-deal-47868 week , University of Melbourne research fellows Ben Parr and Don Henry ask: "Why would a country with a third of its population living in poverty support a global agreement at the Paris climate talks? With per capita greenhouse emissions of about a tenth of many developing countries, why wouldn't India just argue that it should be exempt from climate deals while it focuses on bringing electricity, food and jobs to its hundreds of millions of poor?" Parr and Henry argue the answer to these questions lie in adverse environmental factors such as pollution and extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods. Modi, who has tried to make India a world leader in solar power, may want wealthier countries take greater responsibility for cutting greenhouse emissions but he must also satisfy his voters that he is tackling climate change at home. Mobilising billions A key indicator of how Paris is progressing will be how developed nations handle a promise made in Copenhagen to "mobilise" $100 billion every year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change. The sensitivity of this pledge was underlined last month when countries such as South Africa condemned an HYPERLINK http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/oecd-cpi-climate-finance-report.htm OECD report that calculated wealthy countries had already made "significant progress" toward meeting the $100 billion goal. India has also been vocal in insisting developed nations provide more financial aid and technology for renewable energy. The role of developing countries will be critical to the success of Paris. As Woolcott points out, there were only three developing countries on the list of the world's 12 biggest greenhouse gas emitters in 1992. There are now seven. The language of Kyoto that divided the world into rich and poor countries - and did not require much action from the developing nations - does not work anymore. "Twenty years ago the US and Europe could often dictate the terms of the debate. If they wanted to push something through strongly enough, they could do so," he said. "Now it's different and the game has changed. There are now no longer one or two hegemonic powers and power is shifting to coalitions." \</doc>

Abbott faces Libs' heat over emissions By Heath Aston Continued Page 4 Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a push from inside the Liberal Party to prevent Australia signing up to any binding emissions reduction targets at the upcoming Paris climate talks. A cabal of regional and rural Liberal members, centred in Western Australia and supported by a number of conservative MPs, will force a vote at Saturday's federal council meeting in Melbourne on whether Parliament should "examine the evidence" around climate change before agreeing to any post-2020 emissions cuts. Liberal sources told Fairfax Media that Environment Minister Greg Hunt is likely to be forced to step in and fight off the motion on Saturday by asserting the Abbott government accepts climate change is real and is willing to work with other nations to combat its effects. The timing of the intervention will be a headache for Mr Hunt, who has over recent months moved the government towards accepting tougher emissions targets, as revealed by Fairfax Media on Tuesday. A Liberal moderate who will attend the federal council meeting said the group of elected Liberals and members behind the motion should be given an audience with the Pope so they can be "brought up to speed by a new age person living in this century". The party's regional and rural committee, chaired by WA farmer Brian Mayfield, has submitted the motion, which will call for a House of Representatives committee to "examine the scientific evidence that underpins the man-made global warming theory". It also calls for investigation into "the reasons for the failure of computer models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and prominent individuals to predict, among other things, the pause in global warming this century". "In light of the uncertainty around this issue, Australia does not sign any binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year," it says. Mr Mayfield declined to comment, but Liberal Senator Chris Back and Western Australian colleague Dennis Jensen both told Fairfax Media that an examination of whether the science supported climate change was worthy of party debate. Mr Jensen said the push was coming out of WA because the state has a "reputation for independent thinking". In 2009, a similar campaign was Abbott faces heat from Liberals over emissions accord From Page 1 aimed at then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, who was urged by WA members not to negotiate with then prime minister Kevin Rudd ahead of the Copenhagen summit. "The science is absolutely not settled. This argument that it's all done and dusted is rubbish," he said. Farmers see more climate variability in their working lives than most people do, and the view that everything is in stasis except for the human influence on the climate was nonsense, he said. A senior Liberal source said the motion would have to be "derailed" by Mr Hunt. "It's something that will appeal to some conservatives but he will have to head it off. There is more and more a view that Hunt has got the government to a point of being ready to act and accept the climate science, so the timing could not be worse. This sort of talk takes us back to the Neanderthal age - it's flat earth stuff." But Senator Back said: "I think it is certainly worthy of debate but the question is can you get all the information between now and Paris [in December]." Climate sceptic Tasmanian Liberal Senator Richard Colbeck said he expected the motion would "dead- batted" on Saturday. "It's not a can of worms I would want to open up," he said.

ABSTRACT Australia is the worst performer on climate action in the industrialised world. HYPERLINK http://www.crikey.com.au/https://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/drought.jpg https://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/drought.jpg Everything's on track to reduce global CO2 emissions in an orderly fashion, says the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), except for the fact that the world is likely to suffer close to a 3-degrees rise in temperature by 2100, and possibly greater. Meanwhile Australia's contribution has been judged one of the most inadequate, putting it well behind numerous developing countries, facing a raft of social and economic challenges, with the "Direct Action" policy making us the worst performer in the industrialised world. That's the takeaway from the just-released HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/07.pdf "synthesis report" of the UNFCCC, produced ahead of the Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ) conference in Paris, beginning at the end of the month. The "synthesis report" brings together individual country reports on their emissions policy, the so-called "intended nationally determined contributions" (INDC) provided by 155 countries covering 88% of the world population. The UNFCCC is presenting the final figures in a straight fashion, but wrapping them in something of a bow, with UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres calling them a "determined down-payment on a new era of climate ambition", which appears to be a double-distancing from a statement of actual achievement. In fact, the synthesis report projects, on the INDC figures, a rise in temperature of 2.7 degrees by 2100, way above the 2-degrees limit that has been set as the de facto boundary between major damage, and the start on the road to catastrophe. Yet even the 2.7 degrees figure has been disputed, with India's Centre for Science and Environment arguing that the INDC projections, when recalculated, yield a climate rise of more than 3 degrees by 2100. The temperature rise between 2 and 3 degrees produces a series of effects far beyond the impact of a below-2-degrees rise, including the creation of "super El Ninos" and the fiery destruction of the Amazon rainforests. Above 3 degrees, according to a HYPERLINK http://www.climatecodered.org/2010/09/what-would-3-degrees-mean.html collation of the evidence The synthesis report anticipates that, even with the application of measures outlined in the INDCs, global aggregate emissions will be around 40% greater in 2030 than they were in 1990, but that the growth rate of such will slow - down to around 15% in the 2010-2030 period - compared to 24% in the 1990-2010 period. Emissions per capita will actually decline by around 8% compared to 1990. The world is getting greener, but more people are getting the chance to use brown power. To keep the temperature rise below 2 degrees by 2100, and on the "least-cost" pathway as envisaged by the INDCs, emissions would have to come down by about 3% a year, every year from 2030 onwards. Starting earlier, as this graph shows, would require only a 1.6% average reduction from now. However, as the graph notes, the turquoise 2030+ pathway is the most likely situation we will find ourselves in - and as unlikely to be followed as any of the other ones. HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/07.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/ HYPERLINK cop21 /eng/07.pdf The sharp pitch of the graph should make it clear that it is not likely that we will keep the temperature rise under 3 degrees. Australia's INDC has come in for particular criticism, being judged "inadequate" by HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/indcs.html Climate Action Tracker policy rather than targets: "Australia's Direct Action Plan does not put Australia anywhere close to a track that meets its INDC 2030 target. The additional funding announced in August 2015 by the government for post-2020, should it be re-elected in 2016, would reduce this projected increase by only 2%, to around 25% above 2005 levels (equivalent to 57% above 1990)." Some countries that had been with us in the arseholes club, such as the US, have now left it, according to CAT, thanks to recent changes in policy. And other countries such as Mexico, committing to a 22% reduction of emissions below the 1990 baseline, put us to shame. With these dismal assessments coming at the same time as the government voices its support for new coal mines and coal, in the words of the Prime Minister "being a major fuel source for many years to come", the backwards-looking commitments at COP21 - ours especially - are starting to look less like a down payment, and more like that Australian standby, negatively geared with zero deposit and no obligation. \</doc>

\~\~ WORLD FIGURES RESPOND TO PARIS CLIMATE DEAL \~\~ \~\~ US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA \~\~ No agreement is perfect, including this one. Even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, we'll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere. \~\~ \~\~ While we didn't get all that we envisaged, we are certainly pleased with this agreement. \~\~ Of course if we're being ambitious over time we will need to work even harder (than the current targets). \~\~ \~\~ EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER \~\~ Today the world is united in the fight against climate change. Today the world gets a lifeline, a last chance to hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies. This robust agreement will steer the world towards a global clean energy transition. \~\~ US SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY \~\~ This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizen, not for any one country, or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring this across the finish line. It is a victory for all of the planet and for future generations. \~\~ \~\~ HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE \~\~ BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT \~\~ The talks at the COP21 conference in Paris have culminated in a global deal, with the whole world now signed up to play its part in halting climate change. In other words, this generation has taken vital steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren will see that we did our duty in securing the future of our planet. What is so special about this deal is that it puts the onus on every country to play its part. \~\~ INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND CHIEF CHRISTINE LAGARDE \~\~ WORLD BANK GROUP PRESIDENT JIM YONG KIM \~\~ We welcome the historic agreement that has just been reached in Paris. The world has come together to forge a deal that finally reflects the aspiration, and the seriousness, to preserve our planet for future generations \~\~ \~\~ The IEA congratulates all Parties, under the leadership of the French Presidency, for the successful conclusion of the landmark Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is nothing less than a historic milestone for the global energy sector. It will speed up the transformation of the energy sector by accelerating investments in cleaner technologies and energy efficiency. \~\~ PRAKASH JAVADEKAR, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER \~\~ We have opened a new chapter of hope in the lives of 7 billion people on the planet. We have (the planet) on loan from future generations. We have today reassured these future generations that we will all together give them a better earth. \~\~ GERMAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER BARBARA HENDRICKS \~\~ "For the first time all the countries of the world are together on the path to save the planet ... we fought for a long time and today we've reached a solid agreement. It is a historic turning point." \~\~ JACK GERARD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE \~\~ America's private sector has already taken the lead on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even as we increase economic activity and domestic energy production to keep energy reliable and affordable for consumers. Our success is driven, not by government mandate or legislative fiat, but through innovation, investment and entrepreneurial spirit. \~\~ We will closely scrutinise the COP 21 agreement to see how it references the U.S. model of reducing emissions through technological innovation and increased use of natural gas. \~\~ JEFFREY SACHS, DIRECTOR OF THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY \~\~ GE SPOKESPERSON \~\~ We applaud governments on this important milestone and look forward to reviewing details of agreement. GE will continue to lead business in combating climate change by working across sectors to drive innovation, invest in new technologies and scale new business models. \~\~ Reuters maur \</doc>

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's defence of the coal industry on Tuesday against a push for a moratorium on new coal mines had some points that made sense at a very high conceptual level. We should let our energy choices be governed by the ultimate end outcomes we desire rather than a simplistic, knee-jerk moralistic judgement that a particular fuel source is evil or good. Yet from a pragmatic perspective, having countries sign onto such a moratorium would act as a very useful buttress to what countries are already promising they will do. Turnbull observed: "Coal is a very important part, a very large part, the\~largest single part in fact,\~of the global energy mix and likely to remain that way for a very long time, so that's not my forecast but the International Energy Agency's forecasts." He also noted that there are a lot of other countries with lots of coal, so if Australia were to completely stop its exports of coal then there are other potential sources of supply. These points were reasonably accurate but kind of missed the point of what those pushing a moratorium on coal were specifically putting forward. While it is indeed true that coal currently makes up a very large proportion of the global energy mix, findings from an International Energy Agency analysis of every nations' Paris conference emission reduction pledges suggests the world's leaders have effectively promised that they won't require the coal from new coal mines (except for India). The IEA's chart below illustrates that while they expect electricity demand to continue to grow substantially to 2030, emissions will flat line. You can't achieve such a feat unless countries were to dramatically reduce the consumption of coal for power generation below current levels. Growth in world electricity demand and related CO2 emissions since 1990 based on Paris pledges HYPERLINK Source: International Energy Agency (2015) Energy and Climate Change \- World Energy Outlook Special Briefing for HYPERLINK http://www.iea.org/media/news/WEO_INDC_Paper_Final_WEB.PDF COP 21 The IEA estimate that if the globe were to follow through with its pledges, then average CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity produced would decline from the 518 kilograms they were in 2014 down to 382 kilograms by 2030. To put this into context, a new state-of-the-art, ultra-efficient coal-fired power plant using the best quality coal possible might get its emissions down to about 750 kilograms, as HYPERLINK http://www.minerals.org.au/resources/coal/climate_change_technology outlined by the Minerals Council themselves . You don't need to be a mathematical genius to work out you can't lower emissions intensity from 518 kilograms to 382 kilograms by expanding the fleet of power stations emitting 750 kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced, especially when they are typically intended to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Now these emission reduction pledges are all great stuff, but let's face it, politicians aren't very good at delivering on their promises at the best of times. And when it comes to the emission reduction promises being made for the forthcoming UN climate agreement we are really pushing the envelope of what a politician can be trusted to deliver. These are promises for what their countries will do in 10 to 15 years' time. Most politicians making these promises know they'll be long gone before anyone can hold them accountable. Don't get me wrong, emission reductions are what we're ultimately after, just as Turnbull suggested. But it would be good if we could put some spine into these promises by adding some concrete and very easily observable interim actions that politicians have to abide by in the short term that would allow us to keep them honest. The commencement of new coal mines stand out as an obvious indicator of whether or not countries are really genuine about delivering on their emission reduction pledges. If you are starting these up -- and typically they have lives of about 10 to 20 years or even longer -- when we've already got a bucket load of existing coal mines, then it's a pretty obvious sign that you aren't endeavouring to honour the pledge made for 2025 or 2030. Now it's very important to note that Turnbull actually misinterpreted what those behind a moratorium on new coal mines were asking for in their open letter. They aren't asking that Australia undertake its own unilateral action to stop exporting coal completely. Rather their proposal is far more modest. The letter read: "We the undersigned, urge you to put coal exports on the agenda at the 2015 Paris COP21 If the Australian Government really wanted countries to honour their emission reduction pledges then why would it object to having countries consider and sign-up to a proposition at the Paris climate summit for a moratorium on new coal mines? Indeed, as explained by Richard Dennis, chief economist at the Australian Institute, a global moratorium on new coal mines could actually work in Australia's economic favour by increasing the price we receive for our already substantial coal exports ( HYPERLINK http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2015/10/21/policy-politics/why-selfishness-could-help-ban-new-coal-mines Why selfishness could help ban new coal mines , October 21). \</doc>

I represent the youth who face a climate-changed future. I haven't lived a year of my life that hasn't been above average temperatures in Australia. I have also grown up in a 25-year trend of economic growth; Australia was until recently number one on the human development index, top of the global living standards. These phenomena seem like dichotomies - but in fact they are directly connected. Next week, Australia will sign on to a new global climate agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 21st conference of the parties ( COP21 ) in Paris. After two years of policy uncertainty choking a growing renewables market, now is the moment for Australia to ignite an economy-wide vision of a renewable powered Australia. There is a momentous shift taking place in Paris towards global co-operation - 85 per cent of the global economy has put forward commitments to cut carbon emissions. China and the US agreed to curb emissions and work together to do so. India launched an International Solar Alliance with more than 120 countries. European states have drastically increased their climate finance contributions. The real question is whether these actions are sufficient to achieve the 2 degree global warming limit by 2100 crucially needed to minimise climate impacts. The Australian government has an obligation and a responsibility to abandon its climate stagnancy, set a political vision and build enduring policies that create a cleaner, brighter future for us all - human, plant and animal systems. This begins with committing to a meaningful emissions reduction target at home and supporting a robust framework to drive increasing ambition and accountability in a new international agreement at Paris. At the Paris meeting, developing nations will fight for resources and finance to roll out renewables but Australia and economic superpowers should lead by example. The target of 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 is weak and continuation of business as usual, putting the planet on track to 3-4 degree warming by the end of the century. Despite our renewable capacity, this puts us on par with Saudi Arabia as the worst polluters in the G20. Australia's climate finance pledge of $1 billion is insufficient to meet the needs of the most vulnerable countries; many are our nearest Pacific neighbours and have come to Paris to shed light on the devastating climate impacts they face. This money is not new and will be redirected from the existing, already depleted, foreign aid budget. Though an increase from a woeful $200 million, it is not our fair share as the wealthiest country in our region. As Australia attempts to look forward with the National Adaptation and Resilience Strategy announced this week, we remain bound to fossil fuels and the taxpayer subsidies that keep the industry afloat. Wind and solar are now cost competitive to deploy and iron ore prices have dropped below $US40/tonne. The refusal by Australia to sign the communique to phase out fossil fuel subsidies suggests the government is more committed to vested fossil fuel interests than the future of our young people and the planet. So Paris becomes an opportunity. We must encourage governments to seize this leadership role, not stay hiding, clutching to a fossil fuel past. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls for collective action. The hundreds of thousands around the world who took to the streets for the People's Climate March last weekend demonstrated that each government and citizen is a part of that collective - we have responsibility for our actions and a responsibility to act; for youth and future generations.

The "increasingly unmanageable" threat of climate change on children's health has prompted an open letter from doctors around Australia to the government, calling for federal Health Minister Sussan Ley to attend the United Nations Paris climate summit in December. In the letter, from independent organisation Doctors for the Environment Australia, doctors warn of the "health emergency" climate change presents for children. "More bushfires, floods and storms have already had severe and ongoing psychological effects on Australian children," said the letter, which was released on Monday. "Higher temperatures ... have been linked to increases in premature births and hospital attendances for infectious diarrhoea, fever, asthma, dehydration and heat exhaustion." It pointed to governments around the world that have already acknowledged the need to reduce air pollution through the design of "low-carbon cities". "If we do nothing, our children will more likely suffer from infectious diseases, the effects of air pollution and respiratory allergies ..." Professor Fiona Stanley, a former Australian of the year and a signatory to the letter, said she strongly supported the call for Ms Ley to go to Paris, because Australia desperately needed a national strategic plan for handling the health effects of climate change. The 2015 Paris COP21 climate summit runs from November 30 to December 11. \</doc>

In Paris for the recent climate talks, Alice McGushin is full of hope for future The international agreement on climate change does more than improving the world's health - it helps ours. Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The direct health impacts from global warming include disease, injury and death from weather events such as heatwaves, floods, storms and bushfires. Changes to our environment brought on by increasing greenhouse gas emissions will multiply the risk of infectious diseases, like malaria and dengue fever, and impact agricultural yields and water resources, which lead to food and water insecurity, undernutrition and even the loss of livelihoods. Displacement and migration resulting from extreme weather events, rising sea levels and movement to areas with adequate food, water and work bring about their own health risks. Such changes place a strain and increased tension on society, especially those areas of the world already most vulnerable. The World Health Organisation conservatively estimates that between 2030-2050, climate change will cause 250,000 additional deaths a year. It's dispiriting. But on the flip side, this means action on climate change presents a huge opportunity to improve health. WHO director general Margaret Chan described the Paris agreement as one of the most important public health agreements of this century. Policies that support the Paris Agreement will have huge immediate benefits for human health. Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy, transport, buildings and agriculture will see significant reductions in the seven million premature deaths a year from air pollution. Importantly, the world's leaders know it. The atmosphere in the La Seine Plenary Hall was electric as COP21 President Laurent Fabius brought down the leaf-shaped hammer on the Paris Agreement. I was there. I spent two weeks at COP21 with little sleep and irregular meals as one of six medical students from worldwide, representing the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations. We spent our time following the negotiations, lobbying countries, attending meetings and events and giving press conferences to ensure that the health effects of climate change are adequately addressed in this agreement. It was a very intense two weeks, but it was worth it for the experiences I had, the people I met and the final agreement at the end. Growing up in Queenstown - where the landscape warns visitors of how environmental neglect takes decades to rectify - it is hard to understand how it's taken more than 20 years to achieve an agreement such as the one adopted in Paris. Australia played a constructive role finalising this agreement (pushing for the 1.5C target and five-yearly reviews) yet there remains a disconnect between the Federal Government's actions in Paris and their actions back home. Its climate change policies won't help the country pull it's weight when it comes to limiting global warming and by extension, our health. There's no denying the community wants it. In the lead up to the Paris talks, we saw almost a million people around the world mobilising in people's climate marches, including 150,000 Australians. People from all areas of society have joined like never before to commit to meaningful action on climate change, including students, academic staff and the wider community calling on the University of Tasmania to remove fossil-fuel investment. We require real action from our governments, industries and all sectors of society for the good of our health. Alice McGushin is a University of Tasmania student. Since starting medical school in 2010, Alice has been advocating for action on the health impacts of climate change at a local, national and global level with the Australian Medical Students' Association, the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations and Doctors for the Environment Australia. \</doc>

TIM PALMER: While the Paris climate deal has prompted a measure of vitriol from some critics in Australia, officials and residents of low-lying Pacific Island states most vulnerable to the effects of climate change are celebrating. Over the weekend, nearly 200 countries signed up to an accord to limit global warming to "well below" two degrees Celsius and to aim for an even more ambitious 1.5 degree target if possible. Pacific delegates returning from the summit say that even though the agreement still needs to be turned into policy reality by participating nations, they're confident there is now an unstoppable momentum to address their plight. Joanna Lester reports. TONY DE BRUM: We got it - 1.5, we got the five year reviews, we got the ambition, we've got the free and clean air, we've got (inaudible) damage, we've got everything. And a promise to revisit to improve everybody's mission over the years. JOANNA LESTER: Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum speaking in Paris after 196 nations reached agreement at the COP21 climate change conference. Mr De Brum, who is also the chair of the Small Islands Group, has been a key voice for low-lying Pacific states at the Paris summit. The two week conference has created a nervous wait for the leaders and citizens of many Pacific nations threatened by rising sea levels. Maina Talia, secretary of the Tuvalu Climate Action Network, has just returned from Paris. He says the Tuvalu delegation is delighted with the outcome. MAINA TALIA: It's a historic event, and I may say that it's also a very emotional, moving, event for us Tuvaluans. And especially all other low-lying atolls, you know. The agreement came out, we are satisfied, mostly because some of our key elements and priorities for the government of Tuvalu and the people of Tuvalu were there in the agreement. So we are kind of very happy and satisfied. JOANNA LESTER: Despite the relief among Tuvalu delegates, Mr Talia acknowledges that the deal means nothing without action. MAINA TALIA: We're so happy with the agreement, knowing that our future is safe. It's something that our people have been waiting far too long, and now it has come to a point that the world has agreed. So at least something has been agreed. What's next? Is it the implementation or the commitment? So for us it's all about commitment of how these nations will commit to put this into practice. JOANNA LESTER: Jill Finnane is the coordinator of the Sydney-based Pacific Calling Partnership, which works to give a voice to people from low-lying Pacific Island nations. She travelled to COP21 with delegates from Kiribati and Tuvalu, and says there's a feeling that the plight of those nations can no longer be ignored. JILL FINNANE: There's a sense of determination that countries like Australia need to step up far more than what we have, and I think with this kind of agreement in place, countries like Australia will have almost no choice because they'll need to join the movement. Because there is this global movement now that I think - the feeling that I got from the people in the Pacific that we were working with is that they are convinced that this global movement now is kind of unstoppable and it is moving forward. So there is a feeling of hope, but also a feeling of determination to keep pushing things further because they do need to go a lot further.

It crossed my mind that to move from the sublime to the ridiculous only takes a step. I was sitting onstage at the closing plenary of the Global Landscapes Forum, the main NGO event at the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Just the previous day I was amazed to listen to the chief executive of BP Bob Dudley speak with ambition about the oil industry's engagement with the environment at a business roundtable with United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and United States secretary of state John Kerry. More about that later. I was next at the podium and had to follow a remarkable 25-year-old Eritrean youth leader, Salina Abrahams, who had clearly just stolen the show. When she wasn't getting the under 30s to stand on their feet (and how telling was it that it seemed the only people not standing were on the podium?) Abrahams spoke of priority and urgency, and this mirrored the pervading mood in the corridors and meeting rooms of COP21 . Only 61,000 orangutans are left. They share 97 per cent of our DNA. More than 2 million acres of tropical rainforest was lost in Indonesia in 2012 alone. By 2030, at the current rate of conversion, 99 per cent of their habitat will be impacted. But my friends from Indonesia described more than an environmental problem. We know it is severe that carbon emissions from Indonesian land ravaged by fires over the past few months have exceeded those of industrial Germany. But the problems run deeper. According to the government of Indonesia, the fires have caused more than $US34 billion ($46 billion) worth of damage since the middle of this year - not including costs borne by neighbouring countries. This is more than the total value of palm oil produced in 2014 in Indonesia. Not only is this one of the world's worst climate events but it is also a health and economic calamity. Cry for help As the country confronts this crisis, President Widodo in Paris last week made an unprecedented appeal for assistance to the global community. Part of the tragedy is that these fires are and were predictable and preventable. While the immediate focus is and must be on remedial actions and firefighting, permanent solutions can only be found through policy-led changes on the ground. These must be informed by solid science and supported by an extensive outreach, education and capacity-building program. There are some fantastic organisations working at the coalface seeking solutions to these complex problems, and the Australian government and global business are starting to play a major role. Leading NGOs describe their work with the oil palm industry in East Kalimantan, where they work with smallholders, logging companies and the district government to find solutions and alternatives. They are helping local communities have a say in forest management, connecting them to financial and other incentives to encourage land swaps, and helping to solve long-standing land tenure issues. At the other extreme, major users of palm oil led by Paul Polman, the CEO of Unilever, are not just committing to stopping forestation but also to a program of reforesting degraded land. This is a great opportunity for Australia to rebuild relations with its neighbours. Leading research institutions such as the Centre for International Forestry Research are already working on long-term solutions, with the help from the Australian government and others, and believe they are within reach in three years. Everyone agrees the private and corporate sector must be front and centre on climate and the environment. This is a great opportunity for Canberra and Jakarta to open the phone lines again and work on solutions to ensure the carrots are appetising and the sticks are more than twigs. All this will obviously cost money, and as the former Nigerian minister of finance, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, "Should the money for restoration come from rich donor countries? Yes. But will it? No. So what we should do is look for where the money is coming from now, and enhance that." This will require some very clever and different thinking. If we continue to do what we've always done, we'll continue to get what we always got. Business is on board Things that really struck me about Paris emanated from the centrepiece for business at COP21 : the high-level business roundtable. The leading facilitators, Ban Ki-moon, John Kerry, the French minister for ecology S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royale and the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres, were addressed by 50-plus CEOs who were truly representative of global business. Make no mistake, business - and this includes speakers as diverse as the CEO of the leading energy company in China - is well and truly on board. In my mind, the big changer post-Paris is that business will now be the facilitators for change but also the accelerators for technical innovation and pressure on governments to maintain progress. That will of course feed through to the elephants in the room here in Paris, namely the universal price on carbon and redirecting the $2 trillion of subsidies on fossil fuels. Speaking of China, the big news is that China has put green finance on the G20 agenda for 2016. The mood here is that it is time to tweak the business and financial system to capitalise the change that is needed because, as Victor Hugo said, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."

'Leafy' turbines lovely as a tree French invention the Wind Tree, a tree-shaped turbine. Rare, highly-collectible Howard-era lavatory paper. Photo by Neal Gowen T he French, grateful for our former prime minister's contribution this week of ideas on how to solve Europe's migration problems, have leapt to thank us by drawing our attention to a bright idea of their own. A French invention the Wind Tree, a three-metre tall, tree- looking wind turbine (pictured), is imagined by its inventors New Wind as a relatively petite, pretty, softly spoken wind-power generator for urban places. New Wind noticed some French hostility to the giant wind turbines of wind farms, but says that people who have despised the giant turbines and never thought they'd warm to wind power are charmed by the wind trees. They have gone into production and, for the moment, they are really rather expensive. A prototype is erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to beguile those potentates and boffins who will be in Paris for the looming (November 30 to December 11) United Nations Climate Change Conference . This futuristic column pricked up its ears at discussion (on the BBC's World Business Report on ABC Radio National at dawn on Wednesday) of the wind trees. We have been much engaged in the debate about the big wind turbines (like the ones at Lake George), taking issue with the philistines (like Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey) who see no beauty in them and in the way in which they sometimes enhance a landscape. But up to a point the French trees seem to be a response to French versions of Abbotts and Hockeys, to complaints about conventional wind turbines' size, noise and landscape- transforming looks. With enough of the little trees in neighbourhoods there may in time be no need for giant wind farms as we have known them, their massive forms arranged all along windswept hills. New Wind was started by Jerome Michaud-Lariviere. He was taking a walk, the breeze perhaps ruffling his hair, when he noticed that same breeze rustling leaves on trees and imagined the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity. Online we read that the tree "has 72 artificial leaves [called aeroleaves] serving as micro- turbines spinning on a vertical axis". We read that the Wind Tree is designed to harness even gentle winds and breezes. This means the trees will be able to do useful work on most days of the year. "The steel tree stands 11m tall," one online source testifies, "and is said to be completely silent, with all cables and generators integrated into the leaves and branches." New Wind imagines that a single tree will be used to provide oomph for, say, a nearby home or to pep up the battery of an electric car. You can read lots about the Wind Trees online - for example HYPERLINK http://www.gizmag.com/wind- http://www.gizmag.com/wind- Meanwhile it is stimulating to think of what a special resonance the French idea is bound to have here in energy-progressive and tree-crazed Canberra. Here almost anything shaped like a tree, whatever it is and whatever it does, is bound to have appeal. Australian, Canberran adaptations of the turbines might make sure that the turbines "leaves" have an especially eucalyptsy look (to our eyes the French "leaves" already do, a bit) so as to enable them to blend fittingly into our dinky-di places. Rich Canberrans living in their ostentatious McMansions (like the especially obscene ones in O'Malley) will be well able to afford them. In Europe they are presently about \€ 29,500 ($45,000) each. What's more (for few owners of McMansions cultivate real gardens) McMansioners are likely to prefer non-deciduous steel trees with "aeroleaves" to real trees that make a mess. We even, our imagination beginning to run away with this, begin to imagine the Northbourne Avenue route of the light rail lined not with the real Australian widow-maker trees but with these artificial wind trees that will not only generate power but also never drop a branch on anyone. Meanwhile, our oblique reference above to Tony Abbott brings a pang of regret. It is that his awful prime ministership was never marked, as some prime ministerships have been, by the creation of witty products that poked fun at him. If only a fun- loving manufacturer had created rolls of Tony Abbott lavatory paper! This columnist would have bought them in bulk so as to use them on every day of his nasty, brutish and (thank God!) short prime ministership. Reader Neal Gowen has long owned and treasured rolls of Malcolm Fraser and John Howard lavatory paper. The John Howard paper (this columnist has and treasures a roll of it) has each tissue embossed with Howard's despised likeness and the wrapper urged the purchaser to "wipe the smile off his face". I would never part with my Howard roll (for I am an only child and never give up my toys) but Gowen has parted with both his rolls. "I thought you might like to know," he tells me, knowing that we have collectables camaraderie in this, "I have passed mine on so that future generations will see them, and gasp in awe at the antiquities." His Fraser roll (an antiquity 40 years old) was eagerly accepted by the National Library of Australia and his Howard roll was pounced upon with equal eagerness by the Museum of Australian Democracy, Old Parliament House. "I took some farewell photos of the rolls before they left for their new homes," Gowen reports, thus supplying us with the evocative picture we use today. \</doc>

Australia's largest carbon emitter, AGL Energy, will announce new commitments to climate policy and carbon pricing on the ASX on Friday, marking another "green" step for the energy giant in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks in December this year. A commitment to report climate change information as a fiduciary duty, an agreement to ensure responsible corporate engagement in climate policy and a commitment to put a price on carbon are the latest climate policy endorsements by AGL. While AGL's decision to put a price on carbon was first made in their revised Greenhouse Gas Policy in April, Friday's commitment places requirements on AGL to publicly report on how the internal price on carbon has impacted decision-making on investments and expenditure. The commitments make up three of seven climate leadership commitments devised by non-government organisation and environmental reporting platform CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the We Mean Business Coalition. AGL's announcement comes before the Australian Climate Leadership Summit on November 5, a CDP initiative that will bring together major Australian businesses and investors with selected representatives from government and non-government organisations to announce significant climate commitments. The summit is the only event in Australia that has been labelled as an official lead-in event to COP21 \</doc>

Australia, Nov. 30 -- Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Steven Ciobo, issued the following speech: It's a pleasure to be here tonight, on the eve of what we all hope will be very productive COP21 negotiations in Paris. I was moved by the strong messages, from around the world, of solidarity with France following the terrible attacks in Paris earlier this month. I was humbled to see messages of support and tributes in person when I laid a wreath at the Place de la Republique last week. And on behalf of all Australians, I add our condolences, and express our solidarity with France again tonight. But what struck me, in the aftermath of those awful events, was how a tragedy can make us realise how much we have in common. And in these many areas of common interest, we must stand together to face common challenges. And not just on immediate issues of national security or terrorism, but also in response to long-term issues which have a global impact, requiring global change. Solidarity is what is needed in response to those terrible attacks; and solidarity is what is needed if we are to address climate change.

WIND and solar farms should be established to cope with surging summer power demands, Mornington Peninsula mayor Graham Pittock says. Speaking with the Leader following his controversial trip to the Paris COP 21 -climate conference, Cr Pittock said he would lobby the State Government to relax planning laws. "The State Government has prohibited wind farms on the peninsula," he said. "I'm against that policy. "If I can get the councillors to agree with me to overturn that, that pressure and the COP 21 pressure could change that policy." Cr Pittock said 400ha properties on the peninsula could accommodate wind farms. "I'm sure those people could put 50 or 100 turbines on those farms and make a lot of money - there is space available," he said. Cr Pittock and Cr Hugh Fraser both faced the public last week at a seminar over the controversial $19,000 ratepayer-funded Paris trip. Both councillors funded the visit through their personal development allowance while a senior council officer also attended. About 30 people attended the forum which was manned by two security guards with most expressing support for the trip. Cr Pittock said the world's largest solar energy operator, SkyPower, expressed interest in establishing itself on the peninsula during discussions in Paris. In a statement released by Rebecca Thistleton on behalf of Planning Minister Richard Wynne, it indicated the government was open to wind farm development in suitable areas. "The Mornington Peninsula is environmentally sensitive green wedge land with strict controls in place," the statement reads."The council would need to work closely with the planning and environment department to determine if and where wind farms may be suitable." \</doc>

PRINCE Charles has warned that if international leaders fail to clinch a deal on climate change at talks in Paris next week, it will leave mankind facing a "perfect storm". "This meeting falls at a very important, indeed critical moment for the future of mankind and our planet," he said in a speech at the Commonwealth summit in Malta on Thursday. "Countless concerned people around the world are banking on global leaders to come up with an ambitious long-term goal for the rapid reduction of carbon emissions," he said, as Commonwealth leaders began to arrive on the rain-lashed Mediterranean island. "We face an unprecedented set of interlocking challenges, all of which are creeping up on us in the shape of a perfect storm," Prince Charles added, listing unsustainable population growth, migration, rapid globalisation, and social economic and energy insecurity. The Commonwealth family of 53 nations is gathering in Malta for three days of talks from Friday with a focus on reaching agreements that will open doors for wider deals at the COP21 climate talks in Paris, which begin on Monday. Queen Elizabeth II, the head of the Commonwealth, is making a state visit to Malta to coincide with the summit, supported by her husband Prince Philip, their eldest son Charles and his wife Camilla. \</doc>

More than $180,000 of taxpayers' money was "wasted" by South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill when he took a film crew with him on two overseas trips last year, the Opposition says.

They accompanied Mr Weatherill as he participated in negotiations and touted HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-09/sa-opposition-leader-calls-on-premier-to-take-a-selfie-stick/7014578 the Government's commitment to carbon neutrality at the Paris HYPERLINK COP21 talks .

"There were examples of vision of him at a football field talking about climate change in the United Kingdom," Mr Lucas said. "There was also vision of him placing a memorial for the victims of the terrorist bombing in Europe. "Significant parts of the vision being promoted having nothing to do with investment and trade. They are more about the promotion of a politician." A Government spokesperson said the "high-quality materials" produced by 57 Films were being used to promote SA as a place to "invest, visit and study".

Crunch time in the Paris climate change talks came in the early hours of Friday when US Secretary of State John Kerry crashed an all-night sitting of negotiators and forcefully set out the developed world's bottom line. Kerry's agitated state was -referred to in background briefings by senior Australian officials but spelled out in explicit detail in the Indian media. "You can take the US out of this," Kerry told negotiators, "Take the developed world out of this. Remember, the Earth has a problem. What will you do with the problem on your own?" Behind the scenes, US President Barack Obama had spent the week dealing directly with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, by phone. Negotiations had become a delicate balance of building an inclusive international agreement using the leverage of a $US100 billion-a-year fund ($139bn) that would help developing nations -respond to the threat of climate change. The challenge for developed nations, including the US, EU member states, Japan, Australia and Canada, has always been to break the bedrock of "bifurcation" - the dual-track system of developed and developing nations on which 20 years of climate change negotiations has been built. Bifurcation has been the basis on which historic climate change agreements have been struck and divides the world into two camps, leaving responsibility for action with the developed world. For negotiators in Paris, it was always the biggest issue to solve. In the end, the Paris agreement was hailed as ambitious and global but, on the main points of finance and differentiation, it was weak. Analysis by Bloomberg in London says the agreement contains no concrete increase in the level of ambition and simply urges countries to do more over time. Australia achieved its main -objectives of a five-yearly review cycle for country targets and stronger transparency requirements on all countries. But Bloomberg argues even these elements are accompanied by language that could allow countries to maintain the status quo for years to come. In the end, despite the Kerry outburst, developing countries won the differentiation debate with no obligation to commit to firm emission limits indefinitely. The wording of the agreement is that "developed country parties shall continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide -absolute emission reduction targets". "Developing country parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time toward economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances," it says. Global Warming Policy Foundation director Benny Peiser made the same criticism as Bloomberg. He said the Paris agreement was "another acknowledgment of international reality". "The deal is further proof, if any was needed, that the developing world will not agree to any legally binding caps, never mind reductions of their CO2 emissions," -Peiser said. "As seasoned observers predicted, the Paris deal is based on a voluntary basis which allows -nations to set their own voluntary CO2 targets and policies without any legally binding caps or international oversight. In contrast to the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris deal removes all legal obligations for governments to cap or reduce CO2 emissions." As a result, the Paris agreement, delivered with rhetorical flourish, has produced a set of -expectations about what could be achieved in stark contrast to the reality. The Paris agreement has certainly slayed the dragon of Copenhagen and made it much more difficult for governments and business to ignore a vocal global push for transformational change. For triumphant symbolism, the Paris declaration excelled with the inclusion of an aspirational 1.5C warming target knowing full well that 2C is in all likelihood out of reach. But perhaps France's biggest achievement has been to safeguard the UN climate change conference process and ensure its survival for decades to come. The adoption of five-yearly -reviews of self-generated, non--legally binding individual country ambitions give a clear indication of where things go from here. Saving the world is certainly not guaranteed. Just as the "trillions" of dollars attendees expect to be unlocked to sponsor the new global low-carbon revolution might not be wisely spent. But climate conferences are designed to set ambitions and generate words, not actual outcomes. As Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said: "The hard work of implementation must now begin." In reality, the world is no closer to practically meeting the 2C, let alone 1.5C, target than before COP21 was convened. The heavy lifting is now required by governments and business to deliver the socio-industrial revolution that has been promised. To be sure, green groups are -already lining up to use the new agreement and its 1.5C aspiration to up the ante against fossil fuels such as coal. The big, popular take-out from Paris is that fossil fuels are doomed. Tim Flannery says the agreement "signals the end of the fossil fuel era as the world rapidly replaces coal, oil and gas with clean energy sources". And while the US and others are looking for market solutions to solve the problem of greenhouse gases, the remedies from the hard Left are likely to become ever more proscriptive. Internationally, Greenpeace has dropped its support for carbon trading and now favours direct -intervention. "The belief that one day we will have a global carbon market where the industry can buy off its obligation to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions is not something we believe in," Greenpeace head of climate change policy Martin Kaiser said. "It must not be the carbon market." Such details were never going to rain on the COP 21 parade, however. Conference president Laurent Fabius offered modest self-reflection. The agreement, he said, would safeguard the world's faith in multiculturalism. It would unshackle financial powers of unimagined proportions, help small island states survive, empower -Africa, ensure South America saves its forests and assist fossil fuel economies such as Saudi Arabia diversify their economic bases. More than that, the Paris agreement would serve many non-climate causes, from food -security, public health, combating poverty, essential human rights and health. Not a bad achievement, all told.And certainly better than the nightmare of Copenhagen in 2009. \</doc>

INDIA'S Minister of State for Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal has thanked Federal Member for Dawson George Christensen for his support of Adani's Carmichael Mine, Rail and Port Project during a chance meeting in the halls of parliament Wednesday morning. "I had a brief chat with Minister Piyush Goyal and he stated in no uncertain terms that India was very keen to see the Carmichael Coal Project up and running," Mr Christensen said. "I assured him of my absolute commitment to seeing that happen too, and he thanked me for my support on this front. "The Carmichael Coal Project promises jobs for Central and North Queensland, as well as prosperity for Indians being lifted out of energy poverty. "Minister Goyal's comments to me fly in the face of the claims by the extreme green movement that Minister Piyush Goyal wants to end coal imports to India." Mr Christensen said Minister Goyal had made India's position clear at the opening of the UN COP21 climate talks in Paris in November. "Minister Goyal stated at that time that fossil fuel was imperative to meet India's development needs," Mr Christensen said. "He said that other countries needed to accept the fact that India would burn coal to bring electricity to millions. "The extreme greens like to talk up India's desire to develop solar, but Minister Goyal said that solar energy alone would not meet India's development needs."The Minister stated that his country needed a base load for its ambitious power plans, and he said that if they didn't have that base load, they wouldn't have any renewable energy." \</doc>

COP 21 Australia's official line is that it supports a global climate target of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, but as Giles Parkinson,\~ HYPERLINK http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/australia-open-to-1-5-c-climate-target-carbon-neutral-in-2050 writes over at\~Renew Economy Under Turnbull, Australia remains open to this more ambitious target. The change in attitude is such that Australia is now being seen as a facilitator rather than an obstacle in the talks - as it had been under Abbott. If there is a strong agreement in Paris, this will give Turnbull the justification to move hard on climate policy here in Australia. And that will be the real test of Turnbull's cojones on climate. So far, apart from the lack of "wind turbines are ugly" rhetoric, Turnbull has changed nothing on the policy front since taking over from the former PM, who famously declared the science behind climate change was absolute crap. The world will be watching. \</doc>

HE HAS done it. Local man Steve Posselt has dragged and paddled his ocean-going kayak thousands of kilometres and has made it to Paris in time for the world climate summit, the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ), in early December. Steve left the Northern Rivers on January 13. His whole trip has been, he said, to raise awareness of the "chaotic climate events that have occurred in these places". Steve will drag his kayak to the summit to make a point. "If I can paddle halfway around the world then surely we can find the political will to fix global warming," he said. He said the struggle for climate "justice" was like his journey and would be "won by ordinary people doing extraordinary things". "They will not receive accolades, kudos or even recognition. Sometimes they will be denigrated and sometimes they will feel despair," he said. "The only reward is to know that you are doing good. "We are not trying to save the planet, we are trying save us from ourselves. "If only most people knew a fraction of how bad this really is for our children, we would fix it. Steve was supported in the USA by Ballina local, Klass Neirop and his friend Lynne Phillips. Klass is 83 and Steve is about to turn 63.

Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff blamed its worst ever environmental disaster on the "irresponsible action of a company" in a speech to the COP21 climate change summit in Paris. Brazil has filed a lawsuit against BHP Billiton and its own Vale SA for 20 billion Brazilian reais ($7.18 billion) to clean up what it says is its worst environmental disaster, caused by the collapse of a tailings dam. President Dilma Rousseff told the climate change summit: "We are severely punishing those responsible." Brazil is seeking a settlement similar to the $US20.8 billion struck by the US with BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. However, in a civil lawsuit brought by business owners and others, a judge in 2014 ruled that BP had to pay up to $US18 billion on top of the previous payments. The collapse of the dam in Minas Gerais unleashed 60 million cubic metres of mud and mine waste that demolished a nearby village, killed at least 13 people and polluted a major river valley, killing fish and reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The lawsuit required Samarco to take immediate action to contain and reduce the environmental impact of the disaster. It seeks at least $7 billion, to be administered by a private fund over 10 years to pay for the recovery from the disaster and its social impact on communities near the mine and along the river basin. BHP shares have fallen 20 per cent since the dam burst. Vale and BHP had already announced a recovery fund. Reuters DIRTY FALLOUT P6 \</doc>

MURWILLUMBAH residents will gather today in a push for more action on climate change. The climate action rally, organised by Tweed Climate Action Now (CAN), is one of more than 40 events in Australia this weekend. Tweed CAN president Greg Reid said communities couldn't wait for the outcome of the COP21 Paris climate conference, due to begin next week. "We're going to be encouraging people to get active in their community," he said. "It's going to be insufficient. We need to start here." Mr Reid said governments had not been doing enough to tackle climate change. "Promises are cheap and I think politicians are delusional to think they can compete with the laws of physics," he said. "We're not fooled by the spin and promises and we want to see a lot more action on this really serious problem." Scott Sledge from Northern Rivers Guardians will speak at the event. Mr Sledge hoped world leaders would come to a decision about a legally binding emissions reduction target. "We need to have a commitment," Mr Sledge said. "I believe there's a bit of despondence that people have sort of convinced themselves there's not much they can do, and the politicians aren't going to listen anyway. This week, the Australian Power Generation Technology Report indicated there would be no single "winner" in future energy technology for Australia's future. The report said energy sources would need to be diverse, as no one energy source would be sufficient to reliably, cleanly supply all of the nation's electricity needs. \</doc>

IN TOWNSVILLE we are lucky to have a local ABC which is consistently outstanding, particularly in emergency -situations where local commentators know the area, can pronounce place names correctly and provide us with -reliable information on local events and news. Regional talkback programs, such as Paula Tapiolas's, are particularly -enjoyed. Local experiences and stories we can all relate to are shared in a good-humoured, neutral, relaxed manner which is a model of civilised, intelligent -conversation. We all like to hear of the trials and triumphs of our near neighbours. By contrast, national ABC and TV programs tend to be of limited local -interest, being focused on minutiae of Canberra politics, traffic conditions in Australia's capitals, or increasingly silly, unqualified "alarmist" items on climate change. The latter is no doubt to condition us for the imminent COP21 /CMP11 UN Climate Change Conference, to be held under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. New "climate alarmist" stories must be getting hard to find! In disbelief I recently listened to an ABC news item which reported an Australian academic (who should, deservedly, remain nameless) who concluded from his research that killing sharks would contribute to climate change by allowing bottom feeders to increase in number and release more "carbon" by disturbing sea-floor sediments. The solution to this particular "problem" is obvious: we should all eat more crabs and turtles! The national ABC could trim its budget better by cutting programs which unnecessarily, and sometimes harmfully, fan controversies such as Q&A, Insiders and the increasingly smug and pedantic Media Watch. Do not let the political wing of the ABC kill off our regional programs. We appreciate and need them. ROBIN EVANS,Kelso. \</doc>

Kevin Rudd's ever-busy presence on the floor of the vast Le Bourget conference centre in Paris for the critical climate talks has resulted in another round of HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/brand/rear-window/rudd-20151201-gld54u speculation the former prime minister is positioning himself for the job of United Nations secretary-general. Mr Rudd attended the opening of the UN's " COP21 " climate summit on Monday - known as "leaders day" due to the presence of Xi Jinping, Barack Obama, Malcolm Turnbull and more than 130 other presidents and prime ministers - prompting one Australian official to observe it was "a pretty decent networking opportunity". The former Labor leader has a long standing interest in HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/un-climate-conference-2015-rudd-says-plenty-of-opportunity-for-everyone-to-screw-up-20151201-glcyrl environmental issues One point in Rudd's favour that is often raised in diplomatic circles is his close relationship with the United States. Mr Rudd regularly sees President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, and the pair generally speak about China. Very occasionally, he speaks to President Obama, a fellow intellect who he got along well with as prime minister. Mr Rudd has also worked his way back into favour with some - but not all - senior Chinese figures, and he has publicly downplayed the threat posed by Communist China to regional security. Asked about his international diplomacy ambitions earlier this month, Mr Rudd replied: "I'm not a candidate. It's Eastern Europe's turn," he told the ABC's Lateline program. This may be the case but alternatives may be required if the old Soviet bloc cannot come up with a viable candidate or Russian President Vladimir Putin vetoes their choice. Even then, Rudd, who HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/world/putin-the-key-to-rudds-un-ambitions-20151110-gkvs0t visited Russia in March Bulgaria's Irina Bokova, director general of UNESCO and a former foreign affairs minister, and Croatia's foreign minister Vesna Pusic are viewed as early front runners for Eastern Europe.

Kevin Rudd (@MrKRudd) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/MrKRudd/status/672051487975931904 December 2, 2015 If that geographical bloc can't reach consensus, Western Europe, which Australia and New Zealand oddly fall into under the UN system, would be asked to stump up an alternative candidate. Former NZ prime minister Helen Clark, who is already in the UN system, would be a strong contender Mr Rudd would need to overcome. To have any chance of getting the job, Rudd would need to have the support of all five permanent members of the UN security council (or at least their assurance his appointment would not be blocked). Then his campaign would move to the floor of the general assembly where his punishing travel schedule would come in handy. This is where his assiduous networking - he spent some of his time in Paris meeting with the bloc of Pacific Island nations - will come in handy. About one-third of the votes at the UN are cast by permanent ambassadors belonging to governments of predominantly small countries which generally don't give instructions on who their official should vote for. Mr Rudd is living in New York, the same city where the UN is based. He is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, a position that allows him to regularly meet with senior international politicians and diplomats. "He's brilliantly positioned himself," one official said. Mr Rudd would require the support of the Australian government to run for the UN job. Tony Abbott's ousting in favour of Malcolm Turnbull is seen to increase that prospect. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told people earlier this year Australia "would not stand in the way" of a former prime minister seeking such high office. Ms Bishop and Mr Rudd speak occasionally on foreign policy and she has an amicable relationship with him. Of course, Rudd is no stranger to improbable election victories based on relentless campaigning. \</doc>

\~\~New technologies and innovation will be crucial to tackling the climate change challenge, says Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \~\~ He looks set to be an influential player at the COP21 climate change talks in Paris next week after his strong lobbying of Commonwealth leaders at their summit in Malta. \~\~ He urged them to send a powerful signal to Paris where a global consensus is being sought on climate change action and carbon emission reduction targets. \~\~ "What we want from Paris is a strong and durable agreement that commits all countries to effective, credible action on climate change," Mr Turnbull told reporters after the leaders' retreat. \~\~ "The solutions to the climate change challenge lie very much in the field of technology and innovation. \~\~ "It is absolutely critical to continue to unleash that innovative spirit as we find better technologies. \~\~ Mr Turnbull cited improvements in solar technology and battery storage as key examples. \~\~ The prime minister said it was important that agreement was reached in Paris on five-year reviews of each nation's emissions targets to ensure they were met. \~\~ "This will take a long time, but that is what we need to do in order to be able to safely arrest global warming." \</doc>

THE debate over a proposed wind farm at Cooranga North continues to divide the community, but the energy company behind the project maintains it is still committed. The Coopers Gap Wind Farm is initially proposed to have a capacity of up to 350 MW, which would produce about 1100 GWh of renewable energy, powering more than 190,000 average Australian homes. The renewable energy produced will reduce CO2 emissions by about 860,000 tonnes annually, which is the equivalent of taking more than 250,000 cars off the road each year. The project was put on hold due to the uncertainty surrounding the Renewable Energy Target, but Coopers Gap Wind Farm project manager Neil Cooke said the company was moving forward. During a community meeting on March 17, Mr Cooke said AGL would submit a revised Initial Assessment Report to the Queensland Department of Planning and Environment in a bid to get the proposal back on track. Mr Cooke said the IAR was the first step in the process of having the project approved. "The political and economic environment has changed dramatically in recent times, especially around climate change," Mr Cooke said. "The agreement by nations in Paris at COP21 to continue to work towards limiting climate change to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times will require the development of many new renewable projects." Mr Cooke said he expected to have the revised IAR ready for submission within the next few months and a public submissions period would follow. AGL would then address submissions and prepare a revised assessment report. Mr Cooke said the Coopers Gap wind farm remained AGL's foremost renewable energy project in Queensland. - Rhiannon Tuffield \</doc>

CSIRO expertise now even more pertinent It is with dismay that I have read of the huge cuts planned in the CSIRO climate programs. The idea that since we now know that climate change is happening, different people are required to "engineer solutions" is as simplistic as it is absurd. In fact, the exact same brilliant people who have been doing the research at CSIRO and have helped show that anthropogenic climate change is happening right now are the same people to answer the huge number of complex questions this knowledge raises. They are the people who know the earth- atmosphere system and interactions between the earth's surface and the atmosphere best. There are no better people in Australia to tackle the pressing questions about climate change that need to be answered, and this is particularly pertinent in a country with limited water supplies, fragile ecosystems, and a large reliance on fossil fuels for its energy requirements.CSIRO scientists have inspired me and many others throughout our scientific lives. The value of their work is extraordinary and they have always been at the forefront of discovery. In my own field of flow in canopies and the exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere they have led the world. My work on wind damage to forests would not have been possible without the inspiration and knowledge of the group of people working at the Pye Laboratory, Black Mountain, in Canberra. If you lose such excellence, not only will Australia's position in the scientific world be diminished, but Australia's ability to represent Australia's interests at international meetings on climate change, such as the recent COP21 meeting in Paris, will be undermined and Australia's opinions and advice taken less seriously.

GOLD Coast shopping centre, The Pines Elanora, has installed Australia's largest solar carpark structure as part of the centre's $30 million redevelopment. The 636kW system will generate over 1000MWh of electricity per annum, enabling the centre to run up to 20 per cent of its air conditioning from solar power. SunEdison, the world's largest renewable energy development company, managed the project on behalf of The Pines. It exceeds previous record-holding solar carpark installations by more than three times, including Alice Springs Airport with approximately 200kW, followed by Sydney markets with 170kW. The structure will make The Pines one of the largest generators of solar power in Australia. Its opening coincided with the COP21 UN climate change conference in Paris, France, at which 195 countries including Australia have reached a binding agreement on ways to curb global warming and its impact on the environment. The system will also be Australia's largest carpark installation using SolarEdge inverter technology - inverters that draw on DC-DC optimiser technology to increase solar production by maximising the power delivered from each individual solar panel. The Pines centre manager, Hilary Jacobs, said introducing solar was in line with the centre's vision to contribute positively to the local community. "As a community shopping centre, it is important that we lead the way in reducing our environmental footprint," Ms Jacobs said. "Thanks to the solar carpark, our CO2 offset will be the equivalent of taking 185 cars off the road each year." SunEdison's head of commercial and industrial sales Nick Brass, said: "Now one of Australia's top 20 solar installations, The Pines Elanora joins a strong pedigree of early adopters for solar on shopping centres including Casuarina Shopping Centre (1.3MW) and Shell Harbour Shopping Centre (1.2MW)."The Pines installation includes more than 2050 solar panels from Canadian Solar and 20 inverters from SolarEdge and represents enough electricity to power 170 Queensland households. \</doc>

Climate meet must go ahead to defy killers: Frydenberg By Nick Miller THE LEADERS Planned international meetings in Paris such as the COP21 climate summit "must" go ahead as planned or the terrorists will have won, Australian government minister Josh Frydenberg said during an emotional visit to one site of Paris' latest terror attack. Mr Frydenberg laid a simple green and gold bunch of flowers on the pavement outside the Bataclan Theatre in Paris, where three days earlier 19-year-old Australian Emma Parkinson was shot fleeing terrorists as almost 90 people were killed around her. On Monday night, even as Mr Frydenberg placed the flowers, Ms Parkinson was reunited with her mother Lisa, who had flown from Australia to be at her hospital bedside as she recovered. The teenager was recovering well from surgery on her hip where a bullet went through her, and would be discharged from hospital very soon, ambassador Stephen Brady said. She was "super-excited" to see her mother. After laying the flowers, Mr Frydenberg and Mr Brady inspected the rows of candles, the piles of roses and the poignant messages that locals have been leaving in a makeshift memorial outside the Bataclan. Behind them, street cleaners started shovelling old candles into a truck - a sign that the city wishes this normally busy street to soon return to business as usual. Cleaners in head-to-toe white protective gear walked around the Bataclan behind a police cordon, decontaminating the blood-soaked scene. Mr Frydenberg, the minister for Resources, Energy and Northern Australia, said Australia "grieves with France following the horrendous events that occurred here last Friday". "Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of the many victims and the hundreds that are injured. Terrorism has no place in civilised society and we cannot accept it as the new norm." \</doc>

Back in mid-September, which seems aeons ago now, the HYPERLINK http://www.timesofisrael.com/australian-pm-ousted-for-more-moderate-rival-with-jewish-roots/ Times of Israel greeted Malcolm Turnbull's coup against Tony Abbott with this headline: "Australian PM ousted for more moderate rival with Jewish roots". Leaving aside the Israeli publication's parochial perspectives, this was an interesting headline and begged several questions. How would Turnbull's "moderate" foreign policy differentiate itself from that of his predecessor? And to what extent would Turnbull's "Jewish roots" influence his worldview? The answer to the first question was further clarified this week when Turnbull delivered a national security statement to parliament that clearly defined his less hawkish foreign policy impulses from those of his predecessor. Whatever a lingering coterie of Abbott acolytes in the media might tell you, Turnbull is a vastly different foreign policy Prime Minister, better connected to a liberal internationalist tradition that is dominating western perspectives these days. In US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Turnbull we have something of a full house of like-minded world leaders on issues ranging from how to combat the scourge of Islamic terrorism to climate change. Germany's Angela Merkel may be an outlier in this grouping as a politician clearly of the centre-right, but her responses to the refugee crisis in Europe stamp her as a liberal internationalist in a humanitarian sense. We should pray America, under the influence of a sour "tea party" mindset, does not head off on a nativist gun-slinging "boots on the ground" tangent given the alarming spectacle of a presidential race that may result, heaven forbid, in a throwback to the Wild West being installed in the White House. Obama's critics bang on about his alleged weakness. While he has made mistakes such as being tardy in anticipating risks posed by Islamic State and acting accordingly, including establishing safe havens in Syria and "no fly zones" he has also displayed good judgment. Sometimes it takes strength to say "no". If indeed we are seeing in Turnbull the rise of the liberal internationalist, what does this imply for Australian foreign policy in our region and further afield? Quietly, Australia has shifted ground in preparations for this coming week's climate change summit in Paris, COP21 . It is not that Turnbull has altered a bare minimum emissions reduction target agreed on by cabinet, but Australia has played a more constructive role in officials' talks leading up to COP21 . In June, as a guest of the French and German governments I was assailed with complaints from top climate change advisers about Australia's nit-picking obstructionism. That has changed and along with it the performance of Environment Minister Greg Hunt who had earned a reputation as the "Baghdad Bob" of the Abbott government. Now, a liberated Hunt is addressing issues in a more straightforward way, and winning credit for doing so. This brings us back to Turnbull - the "Jewish roots" chameleon. Turnbull claims Jewish descent, telling the Jewish News in 2013 his mother "always used to say her mother's family was Jewish". No issue in Australian domestic politics is as vexed as that of the Arab-Israel dispute, none more sensitive than Australia's responses to Israel's provocations on issues like settlements. Turnbull, as representative of the largest Jewish community in Sydney in his electorate of Wentworth, has defined himself as "pro-Israel". However, the new Prime Minister is no one's patsy on complex Middle East issues as demonstrated by an agile give-and-take published recently in the Jewish Journal before Turnbull became Prime Minister. Jewish leaders in this country should not necessarily anticipate business as usual. Under John Howard and Tony Abbott Australia did not allow a sliver to separate itself from US and Israeli positions at the United Nations, even opposing - or failing to abstain - on perfectly reasonable resolutions critical of settlements. In the liberal internationalist tradition Turnbull would be advised to move Australia back to a more neutral position on issues like settlements and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to be accorded some form of recognition at the UN, including the right to fly their flag.

Leaders of the world's top economies have vowed to seek a deal to stave off catastrophic global warming at an upcoming UN conference in Paris, according to a draft statement drawn up at a summit in Turkey. Negotiators at the Group of 20 summit haggled though the night on the text of the statement as Saudi Arabia and India initially refused to include specific climate goals like curbing global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, sources said on Monday. "Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time," said the draft communique which is to go for a final review by leaders later in the day. "We affirm our determination to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force," at the COP21 talks, the draft obtained by AFP said. "We reaffirm the below 2C degree climate goal..," the draft statement added. The climate meeting is being held outside Paris from November 30 to December 11 and aims to agree a new international pact signed by 195 countries to fight global warming. France, with the backing of the European Union, is working furiously to make the climate talks a success and Paris officials bristled at the reluctance by certain countries at the G20 to include its basic objectives in the statement. "At a certain point there was a feeling that we were not living on the same planet," an exhausted European negotiator told reporters after more than 20 hours of talks with his G20 counterparts. "The idea was to just state that the G20 countries will be committed to a regular process, to get to the numbers of the target, with regular steps that was the idea. This is common sense," he said. \</doc>

There is a disconnect between the Prime Minister's rhetoric and his actions, writes Peter Hannam. When Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull rose to address the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris late last year, he told the world Australia would meet the challenges of global warming "with confidence and optimism". Australia's carbon emissions target - slicing 2000 levels by about 19 per cent by 2030 - would halve pollution on a per capita basis, "one of the biggest reductions" of any G20 nation, Turnbull said. The government would also double "clean energy innovation" investment over the next five years, and carve out $1 billion from the existing aid budget to help threatened Pacific neighbours build "climate resilience" and cut emissions. One cause for optimism was that Australian universities were leading the charge in "energy and climate science innovation". The University of NSW had held the world record for solar cell efficiency - now at 25.6 per cent - for 30 of the past 32 years. And by 2018 more than 60 per cent of all new solar cells would use technology developed in Australia, Turnbull noted. And on Friday, New York time, Environment Minister Greg Hunt will take the next step to lock in the climate pledges when Australia joins more than 150 nations at a UN ceremony to ink the Paris accord. The pact, which the government plans to ratify later this year if re-elected, aims to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels - even if current national offers fall far short of the greenhouse gas reductions needed. But in the four months since Turnbull's speech, climate news from abroad and at home has been anything but positive. Global temperature records were so decisively smashed in the first three months of 2016 that Gavin Schmidt, the head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, declared this year is already virtually certain to be the hottest on record - for a third year in a row. Hunt's send-off wasn't cheery either. Before boarding the plane he arranged a last-minute teleconference at the behest of Queensland counterpart Steven Miles to address the worst case of coral bleaching to hit the Great Barrier Reef. During the "occasionally heated" call, Miles said he called for an urgent meeting in Cairns so officials "could witness at first-hand the devastating effects of climate change". Hunt declined the invite but proposed to a weekly ministerial phone call to discuss the unfolding disaster. For policy areas directly under Turnbull's control it's been a dismal few months for climate action, not least CSIRO's assault on climate science launched on February 4 that will see dozens of leading researchers sacked among as many as 450 jobs to go. Despite pleas of budget penury, the government somehow managed to find $15.4 million a couple of weeks later for a new Oil, Gas and Energy Resources Growth Centre to, among other things, "foster community support" for non-renewables, including coal and nuclear energy. And a fresh concern surfaced this week with 61 leading scientists writing to Turnbull decrying the government's decision last month to end grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Set up by the Rudd-Gillard government, the agency still had $1.3 billion in funding to disburse by 2022. Instead, it will now work with the Clean Energy Finance Corp to offer $100 million in loans annually for 10 years to foster "clean and renewable energy". About $130 million in grants are still to be allocated, Hunt says. The signalled end of ARENA's grant funding removes "an essential component of technology innovation", the mostly solar researchers said in the letter obtained by Fairfax Media. Forty years of such grants had allowed Australia to contribute "very far above its weight" in renewable energy. By contrast, reliance on equity returns "have rarely been effective" in advancing early-stage research, the scientists said. Richard Corkish, chief operating officer of UNSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said his facility faced "an existential threat" if the $4 million in annual ARENA funds ended. The school continues to spawn world-leading technology, including new types of solar cells using abundant, non-toxic materials. "ARENA is our major funding source," Corkish says. "This is incredible", says Blakers, who heads the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the Australian National University. "You don't turn off R&D spending when there's a revolution under way." A record $US286 billion ($366 billion) was invested in renewable energy research and deployment last year, the UN Environment Programme said on Thursday. About $US130 billion was spent on new coal and gas-fired power plants. The PM's office declined to comment on the letter. Hunt does have a positive story to tell in New York about Australia's ambitions in that per capita emissions will drop more than most nations, says Malte Meinshausen, director of the Australian-German Climate & Energy College at Melbourne University. "But Australia is still going to be the highest in the developed world" at about 15.7 tonnes of CO2 emitted per person by then, Meinshausen says. However, even those goals - which will leave Australia "a black sheep" vying with Canada as the worst emitter among rich nations - may be out of reach. "The big gap is there are no policies on the horizon" to hit the target, and paying polluters to cut emissions and other existing measures won't get Australia anywhere close, Meinshausen says. "It has to be an economy-wide price on carbon in one form or another." Mark Butler, opposition environment spokesman, says Labor will release its policies in coming weeks. He notes, though, that while Australia is likely to meet its 2020 target to cut 2000-level emissions by 5 per cent, it would do so largely because of surplus credits under the existing Kyoto treaty: "By the government's own figures, by 2020 emissions will be 6 per cent above 2000 levels and will keep on rising. "The pressing challenge is to get emissions back under control and have them falling in the medium term to 2030." Greens deputy leader Larissa Waters said there's "an obvious disconnect between the Prime Minster's rhetoric in Paris last year and his actions in Canberra". "Presiding over cuts to CSIRO's world-leading climate research and gutting renewable technology research is stupid on so many levels," Waters says. "The government is tipping new money into fossil fuel research so that the big mining companies profiting off the world's warming don't have to pay for research themselves." Hunt, meanwhile, may be asked in New York about the state of the Great Barrier Reef, an issue the World Meteorological Organisation dubbed one of the "worrying developments" in the sizzling start to 2016. "The magnitude of the changes has been a surprise even for veteran climate scientists," Petteri Taalas, WMO's secretary-general, said ahead of the UN gathering. "The state of the planet is changing before our eyes." \</doc>

Is PM taking real action on climate change or is it just hot air? Peter Hannam Sunny days: UNSW lead researcher Xiaojing Hao has developed new solar cells using non-toxic, relatively abundant materials, which may open up new fields for the industry. W hen Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull rose to address the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris late last year, he told the world Australia would meet the challenges of global warming "with confidence and optimism". Australia's carbon emissions target - slicing 2000 levels by about 19per cent by 2030 - would halve pollution on a per capita basis, "one of the biggest reductions" of any G20 nation, Turnbull said. The government would also double "clean energy innovation" investment over the next five years, and carve out $1billion from the existing aid budget to help its threatened Pacific neighbours build "climate resilience" and to cut emissions. One cause for optimism was that Australian universities were leading the charge in "energy and climate science innovation". The University of NSW had held the world record for solar cell efficiency - now at 25.6 per cent - for 30 of the past 32 years. And by 2018, more than 60 per cent of all new solar cells would use technology developed in Australia, Turnbull noted. And on Friday, New York time, Environment Minister Greg Hunt will take the next step to lock in the climate pledges when Australia joins more than 150 nations at a UN ceremony to ink the Paris accord. The pact, which the government plans to ratify later this year if re- elected, aims to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels - even if current national offers fall far short of the greenhouse gas reductions needed. But in the four months since Turnbull's speech, climate news from abroad and at home has been anything but positive. Global temperature records were so decisively smashed in the first three months of 2016 that Gavin Schmidt, the head of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, declared this year is already virtually certain to be the hottest on record - for a third year in a row. Hunt's send-off wasn't cheery either. Before boarding the plane, he joined a last-minute teleconference arranged by Queensland counterpart Steven Miles to address the worst case of coral bleaching to hit the Great Barrier Reef. During the call, Miles says he called for an urgent meeting in Cairns so officials "could witness at first-hand the devastating effects of climate change". Hunt refused the invite but agreed to a weekly ministerial phone call. However, for policy areas directly under the Prime Minister's control, it's been a dismal few months for climate action, not least CSIRO's assault on climate science launched on February 4 that will see dozens of leading researchers sacked among as many as 450 jobs to go. Despite pleas of budget penury, the government somehow managed to find $15.4million a couple of weeks later for a new Oil, Gas and Energy Resources Growth Centre to, among other things, "foster community support" for non- renewables, including coal and nuclear energy. The federal government also forked out $3.3million to two researchers to examine the effects of wind farms on health. Just four researchers made submissions for the cash, a remarkably small number, according to Sydney University public health expert Simon Chapman. And a fresh concern surfaced this week with 61 leading scientists writing to Turnbull decrying the government's decision last month to end grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Originally set up by the Rudd- Gillard government, the agency still had $1.3billion in funding to disperse by 2022. Instead, it will now work with the Clean Energy Finance Corp to offer $100 million in loans annually for 10 years to foster "clean and renewable energy".

ANDREW Willoughby, convenor of the Making a Sustainable World Exhibition, has announced that Lismore will host the first of a new kind of public exhibition, from today until Friday. The exhibition is open to all schools and community organisations to display their ideas, art and projects. "It is unique in that it will travel around the world, gathering and sharing each region's ideas and projects," Andrew said. "It will encourage global citizens to join together to develop the changes we need to make a safer world. "The exhibition will be shown later this year in London, Madrid and Athens, and next year in China, Japan and France. "It includes both display posters and more detailed background stories, research and links, available free to all to copy." Andrew will speak about projects from the COP21 UN Climate Change Conference, held in November 2015 in Paris. "For example, China last year designed a complete global smart grid to power the entire earth with 100% renewable energy by moving electricity between countries, using specially developed ultra-high voltage transmission technology," he said. "They calculate that the current entire world energy use is only 0.5% of the energy available in sunlight." Andrew will also speak on participatory democracy: "...that everyone, wherever they live, is a citizen of the world, able to take action both locally and globally, to exert their political power." The exhibition aims to inspire by displaying the activities and innovations occurring in our community and around the world to move us forward into a sustainable world. Come and see and be part of the action. There will be speakers and displays on local and global strategies and projects occurring in the areas of climate change, direct action, Aboriginal wisdom, education, wellbeing, local and national government, community building, renewable energy, sustainable economics, food production, environmental conservation and participatory democracy. The exhibition opens at 8.30am today at 154 Molesworth St, Lismore, and the launch is 5.30pm today in the shop on the corner of Warina Walk Arcade and Molesworth St. Music and nibblies included. \</doc>

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt said new low-emissions coal power plants were unlikely to be built in Australia, despite the International Energy Agency saying the more efficient, super-critical plants would help ensure coal remained the dominant global fuel source for decades to come. Mr Hunt, who is in Paris for the global climate talks, said he expected renewable energy, such as wind and solar, would take up the slack when older coal-fired generators were phased out in Australia. He said the latest estimates from the Department of Environment predicted almost 20 per cent of coal-fired power stations will be shut down been 2010 and 2022. If you include high-intensity gas-fired power stations the figure is closer to 30 per cent. "In Australia, it's more likely to be substituted by renewables," Mr Hunt said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris. "The reason being, as the Renewable Energy Target grows and the electricity market has declined in real terms - even if its stabilises now with Queensland LNG [liquefied natural gas] projects - and with renewable energy growth, I don't think there will be much, if any new coal-fired power built." While anti-fossil fuel activists and environmentalists claim the current drop in international coal prices means the end of coal is nigh, lEA general manager Andrew Minchener??? said the cheap energy source will be around for a while yet. He said more than 200 gigawatts of new super-critical and ultra super-critical coal-fired power stations - or about 500 power plants - have been rolled out around the world which will ensure coal can still be used, while lowering carbon emissions by between 28 per cent to 40 per cent. The super critical technology, which involves burning coal at a higher temperature which results in reduced carbon emissions, was developed in Japan in the late 1990s, but really took off when China embraced the new technology in 2006 and 2007. Dr Minchener, who runs the IEA's Clean Coal Centre and was in Australia last week for meetings with investors as well as the federal government in Canberra, said he was confident that both critical and ultra-critical power stations would replaced older, more efficient ones in Australia. "This provides a very important step forward because these plants work very well, you can get them on the grid and start bringing down your CO??? emissions, not to zero, but by about 30 per cent," he told the Financial Review. "The next band of this technology - which won't be ready for 10 or 15 years - will take it further still." The super-critical technology can be retrofitted on existing power stations but it is more expensive than building a new plant. At the moment there are four super-critical power stations in Australia, including at CS Energy's Callide facility in Queensland. The IEA has forecast coal will remain a dominant energy source up to the 2040s, despite renewable energy growing quickly off a low base. Compensation ruled out But energy demand in Australia is falling with a surplus of generation capacity, meaning investors are unlikely to bankroll any new coal or gas-fired power stations in the next decade. Mr Hunt would not speculate if government compensation would be the only way to close down dirty, older brown coal power stations such as AGL Energy's Loy Yang facility in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. The former Rudd government looked at compensation to force the closure of the big polluting power stations, but baulked at the multibillion-dollar price tag. HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/energy/no-payment-for-agl-to-exit-coal-power-says-ian-macfarlane-20150420-1moqsq Former energy minister Ian Macfarlane earlier this year ruled out compensation saying it would cost $3 billion to close one power station alone. Mr Hunt said it was unlikely the big polluting power stations would continue to the end of the natural life into the 2040s. "I think industry expects movement earlier and is expecting to consolidate," he said. Dr Minchener it was a real challenge for countries to come to terms with the rise of renewables coming onto the grid, especially as base-load coal-fired power stations have had to be maintained as a back-up for intermittent wind and solar. "These power stations which were originally designed for base-load operation have had to learn some new tricks," he said. The IEA executive said carbon capture and storage technology was still an option, despite the UK government last week it had axed a $2 billion grant for CCS projects, although he conceded it was still a way off being commercially viable. Mr Hunt said he was confident ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris, saying the 26 to 28 per cent reduction target by 2030 stood up well against other country's efforts. "It's a highly credible target, but it will still be very difficult and challenging to meet," he said. "But a year ago no one said we would have a snowball's chance in hell of meeting the 2020 target." HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/politics/australia-to-beat-2020-carbon-targets-five-years-early-20151124-gl6cls Mr Hunt announced last week Australia had met the 2020 target of 5 per cent reduction on 2005 levels five years early. \</doc>

Terrorism, Chinese expansionism and the refugee crisis engulfing much of the world at present are set to dominate the East Asia Summit which started on Saturday night with a "gala dinner" in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, parts of which have been put into security lock-down to host the leaders. The 18-nation meeting is the third of five summits in a row attended by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in just his third month in the job. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the UN Paris climate summit, COP21 , will be held from next weekend. Those events, and Friday's attack in Mali, have made authorities especially nervous in managing events with such senior gatherings of world leaders. With the relatively recent inclusion of the US and Russia, and membership including China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, the EAS brings these big and small powers together on strategic matters. High on the agenda this year is the ongoing and potentially worsening stand-off between China and numerous member states over Beijing's territorial expansion in the South and East China Seas. Mr Turnbull was due to meet Premier Li Keqiang - the second bilateral discussion after a one-on-one with President Xi Jinping last week. Mr Turnbull is expected to reiterate his message that China's rise must not only be peaceful, but must be seen by its neighbours to be peaceful. In September, such comments had incurred the wrath of Beijing, with a foreign ministry spokesman stating: "We hope that Australia will stay committed to not taking sides on issues concerning disputes over sovereignty." \</doc>

EXCLUSIVE Full implementation of all carbon-dioxide savings pledges made at the Paris climate change conference would reduce global temperature increases less than 0.05C by 2030, analysis by policy researcher Bjorn Lomborg has found. Even if the promised actions were continued for the following 70 years and there was no "CO2 leakage" to noncommitted nations, the reduction in temperature increases since before the industrial age would be just 0.17C by 2100, the peer-reviewed paper says. Dr Lomborg's findings are at odds with official statements and comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres that a Paris agreement could lead to a 2.7C rise instead of a 4C or 5C increase by 2100. Dr Lomborg said Ms Figueres had "entirely misrepresented the world's options". He said adopting pledges made before this month's Paris conference by countries representing the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions would do little to stabilise the climate and any benefits would be undetectable for many decades. Using accepted modelling and methodology, the Lomborg paper, to be published today, rates individual pledges made by major emissions nations China, the US and EU and the world combined. Published in the journal Global Policy, the Lomborg paper said the best-case scenario for President Barack Obama's pledges for the US, if continued for a century, was a reduction in temperature increases of 0.031C. For China, it was 0.048C and for the EU it was 0.053C. Australia is included in the "rest of the world" where combined policies had a maximum potential of reducing global -temperature increases 0.036C by 2100. The paper concluded: "If we want to reduce climate impacts significantly we will have to find better ways than the ones currently proposed." Dr Lomborg has been a controversial figure in the climate change debate despite accepting that rising levels of CO2 from human sources will have an -impact on global temperatures. Academic protests have blocked attempts to open a res-earch centre in Australia, either in Perth or Adelaide, with backing from the federal government. Rather than rejecting climate science, Dr Lomborg's core position has been that greater attention needs to be paid to the economics of combating climate change. Releasing his new paper, he said negotiators in Paris were trying to tackle global warming in the same way that had failed for 30 years. He said this included making prom-ises that were individually expensive, that would have little impact even in 100 years and that many governments would try to avoid. "This didn't work in Kyoto, it didn't work in Copenhagen, it hasn't worked in the 18 other -climate conferences or countless more international gatherings," Dr Lomborg said. "The suggestion that it will make a large difference in Paris is wishful thinking." He said a Copenhagen Consensus on Climate project involving 27 of the world's top climate economists and three Nobel Laureates found the best strategy would be to invest in green research and development. "Instead of trying to make fossil fuels so expensive that no one wants them, which will never work, we should make green energy so cheap everybody will shift to it," Dr Lomborg said. Climate change negotiators have said the Paris pledges are a starting point. The conference will convene on November 30. In a statement, COP21 president Laurent Fabius, France's Foreign Minister, said national contributions could make a difference and help avoid the worst-case scenario of global warming of 4C-5C or more. "It confirms that it is possible to achieve a trajectory where warming is kept below 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but this will -require additional efforts over time," Mr Fabius said. "Some estimates put us on a trajectory of a 2.7C-3C increase by the end of the century. "This confirms the importance of reaching an agreement at COP21 in Paris that will lay down the rules for periodically -revising the national contributions upwards." Ms Figueres, the executive -secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said a Paris agreement could lead to a 2.7C rise instead of 4C or 5C increase. Dr Lomborg said Ms Figueres had "entirely misrepresented the world's options". "The 2.7C comes from the International Energy Agency and essentially assumes that if governments do little in Paris and then right after 2030 embark on incredibly ambitious climate reductions, we could get to 2.7C," Dr Lomborg said. "Figueres's own organisation estimates the Paris promises will reduce emissions by 33Gt CO2 in total. To limit rises to 2.7C, about 3000Gt CO2 would need to be -reduced - or about 100 times more than the Paris commitments. That is not optimism, it is wishful thinking." The latest Lomborg paper uses the MAGICC climate model, which has been used across all five IPCC reports and was co-funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Dr Lomborg said it had been run with standard parameters, and sensitivity analysis had shown that different assumptions of climate sensitivity, carbon cycle model or scenario did not substantially change the outcome.Dr Lomborg said the paper had used the same basic methodology of climate scientist, Tom Wigley, who analysed the Kyoto Protocol in a much-cited paper in 1998. \</doc>

WITH the Paris Climate Conference under way, lobby groups from around the world are calling the death rites on thermal coal for power generation. Two of the leaders of the "coal disinvestment" movement -350.org and Direct Invest -announced last week that 500 institutions responsible for more than $3.4 trillion in financial assets had made "some form of divestment commitment" in the 10 weeks before COP21 , as the conference is known. In Australia, the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis -which includes acampaign against coal use inits mission statement -said that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto had quietly "exited" thermal coal without anyone noticing. An article in the Fairfax-published Australian Financial Review said the divestment lobby had stopped campaigning against BHP and Rio because they had been "quietly selling their coal mines" and wereunlikely to approve new ones. But the head of the mineworkers' union in the Hunter, Peter Jordan, said on Sunday that BHP still owned the biggest thermal mine in the Valley, the giant Mount Arthur complex near Muswellbrook, which has approval to mine 36million tonnes a year. Rio Tinto recently announced the sale of its40 per stake in Muswellbrook's Bengalla mine, but it still owns the Hunter Valley Operations and Mount Thorley/Warkworth mines near Singleton, and the plannedMount Pleasant mine atMuswellbrook. Mr Jordan said Rio had been threatening to sell out of the Valley for years. "And our response has always been the same: we would welcome their departure, and we would welcome the arrival of a new operator," Mr Jordan said."They might sell them, but they won't close them down." Both companies have sold thermal mines interstate or overseas. But one of the biggest moves was in May whenBHP sold the South African mines it had acquired in its 2003 merger with Billiton into a newcompany, South32. \</doc>

Climate change Replacing low-cost with high-cost energy will bring unambiguous losses to individuals, firms and the economy. The objectives it claims "will require ... most countries, including Australia eventually reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to zero or below". It says this will entail considerable benefits and opportunities for Australia. These are difficult to envisage. If the emission reductions are achieved by reducing energy use, that means forcing people and firms to substitute energy for some other inputs, something that they would only do at some cost. Alternatively it means a replacement of low cost with high- cost energy, which brings unambiguous losses to individuals, firms and the economy as a whole. Losses are greatest for fossil fuel resource-rich economies like Australia, because coal has higher emissions of carbon dioxide than oil and gas. Without technological breakthrough, coal use would be eliminated first. Insisting on CCS for coal would be a bonanza for all the renewable funders trying to hobble a competitor that is one- third of their own products' costs. One outcome of the Climate Roundtable's objectives is, therefore, to sterilise Australia's coal reserves. This would entail a considerable loss of wealth to the nation. Australia has 76 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves - split roughly 50/50 into thermal and coking coal. Industry sources suggest that proven reserves of thermal coal with no infrastructure attached to them are worth between $1 and $4 per tonne. Coking coal is worth rather more but is difficult to price. If proven reserves of coal were to be worth only $4 per tonne, this would value Australia's 76 billion tonnes at over $300 billion, almost $12,000 per person. Australia renouncing its coal wealth would incur a deadweight loss of this magnitude. And the measure would have negligible effect on carbon dioxide emissions unless everyone else did likewise. These matters aside, the irony is that measures the Climate Roundtable advocates are not necessary to stabilising global temperatures at a 2 degree increase. The 2013 International Panel on Climate Change report put its estimated range of temperature increases from a doubling of carbon dioxide at 1.5 to 4.5 degrees. In its most recent report, the IPCC actually reduced their 2007 report's estimate of 2 to 5 degrees. Scientists like Massachussetts Institute of Technology's Richard Lindzen and the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre's Willie Soon demonstrate the maximum theoretical increase in global temperatures from carbon dioxide and its equivalent "greenhouse gases" is, in the absence of other factors, 1 degree. Increases greater than 1 degree depend on a magnification effect from the emissions through water vapour. This drives IPCC climate models used to project temperature increases. Lindzen rejects such a magnification. He also considers that the increased temperature from carbon dioxide has already occurred. As evidenced by the so-called "pause" in temperature increases since the mid-1990s, such views appear to have been corroborated. There are, moreover, few adverse consequences of temperature increases even of a 2\'c2\'b0C magnitude. The one economic study the IPCC referenced for that, estimated the effects of an increase in temperatures of 2\'c2\'b0C put the global income loss at a trivial 0.5 per cent of GDP incurred over a 50-year period. And this employed highly pessimistic assumptions about floods, human health, loss of tourism and the like. Abandoning low-cost energy would impose a far greater cost. Much is at stake for those firms that have invested in high-cost renewables in the hope that government regulations and subsidies will continue to offset their crippling uncompetitiveness. We will see an intensification of lobbying for ongoing government support in the lead-up to December's UN conference on climate change in Paris. Hopefully this will not further damage the Australian economy before the inevitable failure of that conference allows the costs of climate action to be wound back.

BHP Billiton's new chief commercial officer, Dean Dalla Valle, says the miner is hunting for partners in government and industry to invest in technology to reduce carbon emissions, including power generation and battery storage. Speaking in Washington at a climate change forum, Mr Dalla Valle said it was not just incumbent on governments to engineer a transition to a lower-carbon economy. "We all have a role to play and a responsibility to contribute to solutions," he said. "This includes carbon capture and storage, technologies to reduce fugitive emissions from coal and petroleum operations, high-efficiency / low-emissions power generation and transportation and battery storage." Mr Dalla Valle is also BHP's head of marketing and technology. Climate change would exacerbate existing risks and expose the operations to new risks, including increasing storm intensities, greater variability in water supply and more days of high temperatures, he said. BHP was in talks with the International Finance Corporation "to understand the role of finance mechanisms in climate change and identify what support BHP Billiton can provide", he said. In December, at COP21 - the United Nations' climate change forum to be held in Paris - BHP wants a deal struck that will put the world on a path to limit warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. And BHP, which assesses its portfolio under a range of climate-change scenarios, says it is well positioned to operate in a "2-degree world". "In a severely carbon-constrained world we believe there is significant upside for our potash and uranium commodities, our high-quality metallurgical coal and iron ore which mitigate the downside in other commodities," Mr Dalla Valle said. Thermal coal, also part of BHP's portfolio, was not mentioned. \</doc>

Professor Benjamin Reilly with scholarship winner Claire Smith and Professor Mal Nairn. MT Hawthorn resident Claire Smith says the more she learns about climate change, the more important it feels to get involved. The Sir Walter Murdoch School masters student is the inaugural winner of a scholarship that will give her the opportunity to meet Australian leaders in Canberra and then travel to Paris for COP21 , the United Nations international conference on climate change. Ms Smith works for the City of Perths economic development unit, which oversees international relations. Before that, she worked for the US State Department as a political adviser to the US Consul General in Perth. This scholarship is an amazing opportunity to begin working on important issues related to climate change such as creative ways in which countries can work together to foster sustainable development. It will be inspiring to hear first-hand from brilliant minds and dedicated activists changing the course of global efforts to fight climate change. Ms Smith said she was interested in how developing countries could find synergies and mutually beneficial partnerships that would promote sustainable development. In the future I would love to contribute to policy development as a consultant for government or in government affairs for a renewable energy company or another type of social enterprise, she said. Murdoch School of Public Policy and International Affairs Dean Professor Benjamin Reilly said the Mal and Karyl Nairn Global Voices Scholarship would give students the chance to complete their degree at a global level of decision-making. Claire had to undergo a merit-based selection to be chosen and her journey with Global Voices will involve some serious preparation, Professor Reilly said. The experience starts in Canberra with meetings with politicians and civil servants in government, the opposition and in Federal Parliament, before heading to Paris as part of an international delegation, working closely with Australian government officials. This experience will be a game-changer for Claire. Load-Date: \~August 17, 2015 \</doc>

Emissions Pressure is building on Australian policymakers ahead of the Paris conference, writes Tony Walker. This has not been a good week for climate sceptics in the Tony Abbott cabinet for a conservative approach on Australia's post-2020 emissions targets to be presented to the Paris Conference on Climate ( COP21 ) that convenes on November 30. Pressure on Australian policymakers continued to build, with bold announcements in Washington and Paris that flesh out a more adventurous global approach on climate than had seemed possible even a few months ago. COP21 In Washington, President Barack Obama and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff pledged on Tuesday to generate 20 per cent of electricity by renewables by 2030, not including hydropower. Brazil also promised to restore 12 million hectares of forests - an area roughly the size of Britain - by 2030 as part of its commitment to mitigating the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. In Paris, Premier Li Keqiang unveiled bolder initiatives than had seemed likely under which China would lower the amount of carbon emitted relative to the size of its economy by 60 to 65 per cent by 2030. Beijing had already pledged to achieve peak emissions by 2030, and may reach that earlier. Other countries, including Canada, Japan and members of the European Union, have shown their hands ahead of Paris, leaving Australia as one of the last significant economies to declare its intentions. This is cranking up pressure on an Abbott government that risks being exposed as an outlier in the climate change debate, or, at best, a laggard. AFR Weekend understands a "whole-of-government review" of options has worked its way through the system and the cabinet will sign off on a final position by around the middle of this month. A well-placed source told the AFR, Canberra was "edging towards" a similar position to that of the US and Canada, under which Australia would declare a "relatively ambitious" target. The US has declared a 2025 emissions reduction target of 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels. Such an outcome would enable Abbott respectably to show his face in Paris along with other leaders, including Obama and China's President Xi Jinping, to sign a new protocol that would lay out global emissions targets beyond 2020. Progressive ministers in the Abbott cabinet, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt, are said to be arguing the case that Australia should bring itself into line with a strengthening international consensus on climate. Abbott is leaning reluctantly towards their point of view, but has needed to be convinced. Sceptics in the cabinet include National Party ministers close to the resources sector. More than 190 parties will be represented at the United Nations-sponsored Paris conference. France is devoting significant energy and resources to ensuring the event's success in an effort to expunge memories of the fractured Copenhagen conference of 2009, which ended in disarray. French pride is involved. Climate change specialists, interviewed by the AFR on recent visits to Paris and Berlin, said commitments in hand, including those of the largest emitters, the US, China and the EU, were insufficient to avoid 2-degree-Celsius warming over pre-industrial levels this century. This is regarded as the benchmark to prevent further melting of the polar ice cap and rising sea levels. Much more, these climatologists said, would need to be done to ensure global warming was kept below the target of 2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. French and German officials spared little in their criticism of what they perceived to be the Abbott government's miserly approach towards preparations for the Paris conference. They contrasted this stance with that of the previous Australian government, which demonstrated greater engagement on climate. In Bonn, where officials have been locked in negotiations on a text for Paris, an Australian delegation, led by senior diplomat Peter Woolcott, has proven to be a reticent - even obstructive - participant, according to the Germans. A senior German official told the AFR Woolcott had appeared to be on a very tight leash in what he could - and could not - contribute to discussions. Australia proved something of a "black sheep" in these negotiations, the German official confided. He named New Zealand and South Korea as other black sheep on climate. In Paris, senior advisers to French President Francois Hollande were hardly less restrained, telling the AFR they had been "saddened" by what is perceived in Europe as Australia's backsliding on climate. What is clearly at hand in Canberra is a moment of reckoning on Australia's international obligations as a responsible middle power. It would be surprising if it chose not to live up to those obligations in such a way that it parted company with its natural constituency, including, particularly, the Americans and Canadians.

Paris | India's coal consumption will more than double by 2030 even as renewable energy supply is ramped up to meet carbon reduction targets, with one of New Delhi's negotiators in the Paris climate talks declaring widespread "energy poverty" means Australian exports will help meet demand. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a critical player in the two-week United Nations conference as he seeks to position his country at the forefront of the fight against global warming by promoting solar technology while pushing for an "equitable" deal that allows for greater use of fossil fuels to combat poverty and help 300 million of his citizens without access to electricity. Ajay Mathur, a former director of the UN's Green Climate Fund and one of New Delhi's negotiators in Paris, told The Australian Financial Review that India planned to increase renewable energy generation capacity by "seven to ten" times over the next 15 years but would still need to increase coal-based electricity supply by "two to three times". "We will do energy efficiency. But it has to be at prices that people are willing to pay. Our first goal is solar and wind. Then hydro and nuclear," he said. "The balance will be met by what is our cheapest source [of energy] and one that we know how to use - coal. "Some of it is produced in India. Some of it imported from countries like Australia," he said. "There is a place for Australian coal in India." New Delhi - which regards itself as something of a champion of developing countries - argues that curbing coal consumption would exacerbate widespread "energy poverty" and harm economic development. India argues that developing economies should not have to shoulder most of the burden for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem in the first place. The split over how developed and developing nations should allocate responsibility for global warming and disagreements over a commitment by richer nations to mobilise $US100 billion every year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change will be critical to the success of the Paris summit known as COP21 . Developing nations led by India are resisting attempts led by France, the US and Australia to have any Paris agreement include tougher five-year reviews of national climate pledges made in the lead up to COP21 in order to help meet the UN's goal of capping global temperature rises at 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels - a level most scientists regard as safe. However, government officials are also reluctant to embrace measures directly aimed at phasing out fossil fuels given coal is the country's second-largest export earner. "Mostly I thought we were over the neo-colonial moment where the wealthy decide what happens to the poor," said Environment Minister Greg Hunt, when asked on Tuesday why the government had approved the Carmichael coal project in Queensland to be build by India's Adani. "I would hope that you agree that the poorest countries should be able to describe their own energy future". India has become a critical customer for Australian coal producers, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. Annual exports of metallurgical coal used in steel making grew from 11.5 million tonnes in 2001 to 40.1 million tonnes in 2014. Only Japan (42 million tonnes) and China (46.3 million tonnes) imported more. Annual exports of thermal coal used by Indian power stations grew from 1.4 million tonnes to 6.4 million tonnes over the same period. However, some observers believe it is impossible to ignore India's coal total consumption - which is not expected to peak for many decades - given it is now the world's third biggest emitter of carbon. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who came up against Indian opposition during the Copenhagen negotiations in 2009, said India was facing "all sorts of difficulty over its own coal transition" which he said was about "about 30 years behind China". "[But] we can't walk away from the reality of India's carbon dependency given where it is in the industrialisation cycle. It's heavily coal dependent," he said. "Therefore we've got an obligation to work with the Indians on helping them through that with technology and energy infrastructure investment rather than just saying, 'It's all your problem sunshine'." Dr Mathur, who is currently director general of India's Bureau of Energy Efficiency, said India had not always done a great job of communicating its position on fossil fuels. He noted many countries including China and the US were still using more coal in absolute terms than India while India's carbon emissions measured on a per capita basis are well below those two nations. "In per capita terms most countries of the world will be using more coal than we are in 2030," he added. Key points Australian coal imports are set to play a critical role in lifting India out of poverty. All nations must strive to reduce emissions, India says. \</doc>

COP21 India and island coalition could refuse to sign climate deal. Kevin Rudd is familiar with the difficulties of pulling off a global climate change agreement, having been in the room when China derailed the 2009 Copenhagen talks. But the former Labor prime minister is more optimistic about whether the 190 countries attending the United Nations COP21 conference in Paris can reach a binding agreement to cut carbon emissions over the next fortnight. "Copenhagen at this stage - we would have given ourselves about a three or four out of 10 chance of success," he told The Australian Financial Review in the French capital. "I would give ourselves here in Paris about a six or seven out of 10 prospect of success, which means there is still plenty of opportunity for everyone to screw up." Mr Rudd is only half joking. France has learnt from the mistakes of Copenhagen - where the likes of US president Barack Obama spent the final hours scrambling to salvage a deal - by getting world leaders to set the tone by attending the opening day of the conference. China, which Mr Rudd memorably accused of "ratf---ing" the negotiations six years ago, is far less likely to be an obstacle, given the world's biggest carbon emitter has nominated its carbon reduction targets, indicated it is prepared to accept five-year reviews of its emissions and agreed to a "common vision" with the United States. However, there is a risk that developing countries such as India and a coalition of small island nations could baulk at signing up to an agreement they regard as inequitable. Mr Rudd, who is in Paris as president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and is accredited by the UN, says the key question for the Paris summit is: will the richer nations of north end up paying for the south? "Remember in Copenhagen the two opposed leading governments in the world were China and India together," he said. "I know because I was there in the room. What is truly remarkable in five years is the 180 degree shift in China's position, for which the world should register some genuine appreciation to the Chinese." Poorer countries argue they should not have to shoulder most of the burden for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem. India is pushing hard for innovation on solar and other renewable energy technologies but argues it needs to continue using coal to generate power for nearly 300 million of its citizens that do not have access to electricity. "India is in all sorts of difficulty over its own coal transition - it's about 30 years behind China," Mr Rudd said. "The big coal hump, frankly, in India's demand curve is emerging. China's has emerged and is stabilising. "[But] we can't walk away from the reality of India's carbon dependency given where it is in the industrialisation cycle. It's heavily coal dependent. Therefore we've got an obligation to work with the Indians on helping them through that with technology and energy infrastructure investment rather than just saying, 'It's all your problem, sunshine'." A key sticking point will be how developed nations handle a promise made in Copenhagen to "mobilise" $100 billion every year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change. Mr Rudd nominates this issue of climate finance as well as a push from countries such as Australia and France for the five-yearly reviews as two critical challenges. "If [the reviews don't] come about I believe we are in a world of pain," he said. With a series of national carbon reduction pledges made in the lead-up to the Paris talks expected to cap temperature rises at 2.7 degrees to 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels, well above the UN's 2 degree target deemed safe by many scientists, Mr Rudd says the Paris conference could deliver a result, "that is infinitely better than business as usual which would have us on track for 4 degrees-plus". Mr Rudd was sitting with the Papua New Guinea delegation on Monday when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced Australia would ratify the second stage of the Kyoto agreement as part of his speech on "leaders' day". Mr Rudd signed Australia up to the original Kyoto agreement in 1997. "I attended his speech. Absolutely. It was the right thing to do," Mr Rudd said. "The sooner we retain an enduring bipartisan consensus in Australia on climate change, the sooner we can put these mindless domestic debates to bed and get on the with the business of long-term adaptation to clean, green economies." Mr Turnbull retained his predecessor Tony Abbott's Direct Action climate policies - and his promise not to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme - to secure enough support to roll Mr Abbott for the prime ministership in September. Mr Rudd said he has no sympathy for the conservative wing of the Coalition. "On climate change and a range of other policy directions, Malcolm's challenge is to deal with that considerable array of right-wing nutjobs within his own party. And they continue to draw breath." \</doc>

PRIME Minister Malcolm Turnbull will arrive back in Australia this morning for the final two sitting days of the parliamentary year, optimistic that world leaders meeting in Paris are heading towards a historic global climate agreement. International divisions remained as Mr Turnbull flew home from from the United Nations COP21 summit in France last night and environmentalists were disappointed his government would not sign up to a plan to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies, but he said he was confident of a deal to limit warming of the planet to 2C. "We believe here in Paris we will achieve that global agreement," Mr Turnbull said before flying home. The US and China are steering the world's largest ever gathering of leaders towards that target, while some smaller nations more vulnerable to climate change want temperatures capped at 1.5C. India remains a big sticking point because it believes developed nations should do more, and is concerned growth could be slowed. Australia has in the past been criticised for not doing enough compared to other developed countries. Canberra points to its decision to ratify the second Kyoto agreement, a doubling of investment into research and development of clean energy, and a shift in aid funding towards mitigation and adaptation as proof it is doing its bit. Premier Jay Weatherill, preparing to leave yesterday for the summit, said Australia's part in solving the climate crisis "will depend on whether (Mr) Turnbull is able to essentially get free of the right wing of his party, who are a bunch of climate-change sceptics". Ratifying the Kyoto agreement framed three years ago is largely symbolic, but the PM said it had been carefully considered by both the party room and the Cabinet and was a very important part of the Government's commitment to action. Environment Minister Greg Hunt said it was " a very, very powerful symbol to the world". However, Mr Turnbull disappointed many by refusing to sign the communique promising a swifter end to fossil-fuel subsidies, which Nationals fear could affect the diesel fuel rebate for farmers.

"All low carbon technologies must be part of the conversation - including renewables, nuclear power, energy efficiency, and CCS. "Achieving these ambitious targets will require many acts of political courage over the next three decades, and an unwavering commitment to deep international collaboration on technological advancement, policy design, and funding. "Globally, more than 2,400 new coal-fired power stations are already planned for construction by the year 2030. This says nothing of the hundreds of existing facilities that will still be in operation for the coming decades ahead. CCS is vital to limiting the emissions that are effectively already locked in by these facilities. "Even replacing unabated coal power with gas is insufficient for the world to limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to meet its own nominated targets. Gas-fired power plants still require CCS in order to realise their full emissions reduction potential. "In light of these realities, it's important to acknowledge that global CCS investment since 2007 has been less than US$20billion. "For the sake of comparison, renewable power generation technologies have benefitted from investment of around 100 times that amount over the same period, due to policy disparity. "Outside of the power sector, one quarter (25 percent) of the world's CO2 emissions result from industrial sectors such as iron and steel, cement, petrochemicals refining, and chemicals and fertiliser manufacturing. "As we have seen from the success of the COP21 negotiations, the only way the world will achieve effective action on climate change is through a determined long-term commitment to international collaboration." ---Ends--- Media enquiries Grant Smith, +61 421 559 610 HYPERLINK mailto:grant.smith@globalccsinstitute.com grant.smith@globalccsinstitute.com HYPERLINK http://medianet.com.au/releases/release-details.aspx?id=855399 http://medianet.com.au/releases/release-details.aspx?id=855399 SOURCE: Global CCS Institute \</doc>

Representatives from almost 200 countries in Paris have signed an historic climate accord aimed at preventing unsafe global temperature rises that would for the first time commit nations to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and could force business to sharply reduce its use of fossil fuels. The landmark United Nations climate talks were concluded just before 7.30pm local time amid sustained applause, hugs and a few tears among the delegates on the floor of the vast conference centre in the north of French capital including French President Francois Hollande, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. "This is a small gavel, but I believe it can do big things," said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius as he approved the deal. Mr Fabius had previously reminded delegates of the ill-fated 2009 Copenhagen meeting, which failed to result in a global agreement. He said if that was to happen again "trust in the very ability of the concert of nations to get a solution to climate change would irrevocably be lost". The final agreement is built around the over-arching UN goal of holding global warming at "well below 2C above pre-industrial levels" as well as a pledge to "pursue efforts" to stop warming beyond 1.5C. In order to meet these targets the agreement says countries should aim to reach a "global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions" as soon as possible. Critically, the agreement appears to contain a goal of net zero emissions after 2050 by calling for "a balance between man-made emissions" and reductions from forests and other carbon sinks that absorb greenhouse gasses. "Achieving a balance between [man-made] sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century will require net carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced, in effect, to zero," said Professor Myles Allen from Oxford University. "It seems governments understand this, even if they couldn't quite bring themselves to say so." A smile!

Christiana Figueres (@CFigueres) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/675744635038400512 December 12, 2015 The agreement followed three sleepless nights of negotiations between ministers and several last-minute phone conversations between world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping. It marks the first successful UN climate change agreement since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 - and the first ever that required all countries to confront the problem. As chair of the Umbrella Group of non-European Union developed nations, Ms Bishop was the second foreign minister to respond from the floor once the deal was approved by the French hosts. "Our work here is done and now we can return home to implement this historic agreement," she said. "No country will see this as the perfect outcome. Certainly it does no include everything that we envisaged. However, this agreement does give us a strategy to work together over the coming years and decades." Speaking to the media afterwards, Ms Bishop described the agreement as "ambitious" and indicated the government will adjust its Direct Action climate policy after an already scheduled 2017 review. "It certainly means there is flexibility for us to do more," she said. "The spirit of the agreement is to encourage countries to be ambitious, to aim higher and to take into account their circumstances". Asked what the deal meant for Australia's large reserves of coal, gas and other fossil fuels, Ms Bishop said "nobody expects countries to destroy their own economies, that would be self-defeating". However, some observers are predicting Australia will find it difficult to switch to a "low-carbon economy". "Basically the message from here [in Paris] to the world is that this is the end of the fossil fuel era," said Keith Tuffley, a former head of Goldman Sachs in Australia and the chief executive of business group, The B Team. "We've taken far too long to transition our economy. Australia has been so dependent on fossil fuels." The final text reflects a series of compromises between developing and developed nations over who should shoulder the burden of curbing greenhouse gases and how much funding should be provided to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. Developing countries have argued they should not pay for a historical problem they did not create but developed countries including Australia argue this position is no longer realistic because India and China now make up two of the world's top three emitters. These divisions have dogged UN climate talks for decades but the new agreement goes some way to changing the dynamic of "differentiation" by requiring some form of action from all countries. The new agreement acknowledges "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances" and compels developed countries to engage in "absolute" reductions while calling on developing nations to "continue enhancing their mitigation efforts". This wording is critical for a nation such as India which will rely heavily on relatively cheap sources of energy like coal for many decades given 300 million of its citizens live without access to electricity. Final positions on the major sticking points include: A promise by richer countries to mobilise at least $US100 billion in annual aid from 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change and build up renewable energy generation was moved from the body of the deal into an accompanying decision. This is expected to make it easier for President Obama to ratify the agreement without relying on the support of a hostile Senate. However, developing countries have secured a pledge for a new, larger funding commitment to be delivered by 2025. Carbon reduction pledges made by 187 countries before the Paris talks will be reviewed every five years, with the first to be carried out in 2020. Nations can only change these pledges to make them more ambitious. India pushed unsuccessfully for reviews to be held every ten years. The agreement retained measures to support small-island countries and other nations most vulnerable to loss and damage from rising sea levels, drought and other adverse effects of rising temperatures. But in a nod to concerns that this could make richer nations legally liable, it says "the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation". One of the key demands from developed countries including Australia was a commitment to set up common rules for checking national pledges. The agreement allows for a "Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency" that requires developing nations to provide regular national "inventory reports" of emissions. However, richer nations still regards these measures are too vague. The deal requires a five-yearly global "stocktake" of all elements of the Paris agreement starting in 2023. "This Paris agreement...signals to communities, investors and companies around the world that the shift to clean energy is now unstoppable," said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute. Mr Connor said Australia's decision to support the zero net emissions goal and join the "high ambition coalition of nations" which championed the reference to 1.5C represented a positive contribution to negotiations. "However, Australia's domestic actions now need to match these fine outcomes and aspirations in Paris," he said. "Without stronger action, for example, 2030 country commitments will leave Australia as the highest per capita polluter in the G20 alongside just Saudi Arabia, one of the most obstructive forces in the Paris negotiations." Countries are not set emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. Instead they made individual national pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution. However, analysis by the UN predicts these national pledges will reduce global temperature rises by 2.7C - well short of the 2C goal. "This is a good agreement," said India's Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar. "This means that all together will act to mitigate the challenge presented by climate change."

UNDER\~\~ Bold policy commitments from political leaders are the only route to achieving the ambitious targets of the Paris Climate Agreement, according to Brad Page, Chief Executive Officer of the Global CCS Institute. With 155 countries indicating their intention to sign the historic agreement, Page has called for urgent action to address carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through proven carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. "In order to meet these demanding climate targets in the real world, we've got to reduce emissions from every possible sector of the global economy - urgently and without bias," said Page. "All low carbon technologies must be part of the conversation\~\~including renewables, nuclear power, energy efficiency, and CCS. over the next three decades, and an unwavering commitment to deep international collaboration on technological advancement, policy design, and funding. "Globally, more than 2,400 new coal-fired power stations are already planned for construction by the year 2030. This says nothing of the hundreds of existing facilities that will still be in operation for the coming decades ahead. CCS is vital to limiting the emissions that are effectively already locked in by these facilities. limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to meet its own nominated targets. Gas-fired power plants still require CCS in order to realize their full emissions reduction potential. "In light of these realities, it's important to acknowledge that global CCS investment since 2007 has been less than US$20 billion. period, due to policy disparity. petrochemicals refining, and chemicals and fertilizer manufacturing. "CCS is the only technology that can achieve large reductions in emissions from these industrial processes.

Western societies have given up rational thinking and embraced junk economics Like ancient Druids pleading with the gods for good seasons, world leaders and their aides recently devoted a fortnight in Paris to pleading with each other to stop global temperatures from rising more than an average 2C above pre-industrial levels, when the Earth was emerging from the Little Ice Age. Of the 196 nations represented at the COP21 conference, 154 were developing economies. Regardless of the direction of world temperatures, they left Paris happy that the UN's Green Climate Fund, which aims to reach $US100 billion a year by 2020, will give them cash for anything they can pass off as remotely -related to their intended national contributions to world CO2 -reduction. They argue this is only fair. Poor countries fare worst from climate change and must be compensated for unspecified damage and their share of repairing the West's legacy. You can bet $US100bn a year won't do it. Overwhelmingly, the money for the fund will come from 42 guilt-racked wealthy nations. That is their moral responsibility. They caused the warming. They threaten the planet. It's time for them to repay their climate debts. It matters not that there is no empirical scientific evidence to support these claims. Even the 2C target is not based on science, it was originally plucked out of thin air by the European People's Party for election purposes. But then climate change is not about credible scientific evidence. It has its roots in Marxism, and ultimately the Green Fund is presided over by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, run by Costa Rican Marxist Christiana Figueres. The "paradigm-shifting" fund will provide employment for an army of green bureaucrats who will offer "concessional finance" for the development needs of less advanced countries. China, the leading emitter, venting one billion tonnes of CO2 a year more than it admits to, has been adroit in dealing with the politics. It approaches its domestic air quality crisis under the banner of climate action and so turns a domestic necessity into a global virtue. From this and its lack of interest in aid for itself, China projects moral authority and, while there is no cap on its emissions and only a promise that they will peak by 2030, promotes emission restraints for others, for its own competitive advantage. India has adopted a similar line. The world's third largest emitter is set to overtake China. It will not accept constraints on -development and does not spell out when emissions will peak. Like China, it will adopt cleaner energy to improve air quality and will claim UN compensation. Having successfully captured the West, post-Paris, the noose will tighten. Despite assurances that intended nationally determined contributions, delivered before the conference, would keep temperature increases to no more than 2C, we are now told that even if fully implemented, temperatures will rise by 2.7C by 2100. So the Paris agreement will "only lay the groundwork" and all those hard-won pledges were based on a miscalculation. How disappointing. But there is now an aspirational 1.5C ambition on the table that Figueres quickly endorsed. Should it ever be agreed to, expect more ambit claims. And without a Tony -Abbott in Canberra or a Stephen Harper in Ottawa, no world leader utters a peep in protest. Caught in a moral dilemma of its own making, the developed world concedes its culpability. Its representatives succumb to propaganda and bullying and credulously accept bogus science and catastrophism. They pay no heed to alternative views. They consider abandoning fossil fuels, the world's cheapest, most -efficient and wealth-creating power source, and baulk at -nuclear alternatives. Instead, they pour hundreds of billions of dollars into costly, --in-efficient renewable energy, robbing their industries of flexibility and competitiveness and, punishing the world's poorest citizens. Indeed, Western capitalist societies have given up on rational thinking. They embrace junk -science and junk economics and adopt wealth-destroying postmodern pseudo-economics, which teaches that taxpayer subsidies can produce desirable "economic transformation" and faster growth. Pigs may also fly. Climate change has cowed once great powers into meekly surrendering sovereignty and independent thought to unelected bureaucrats in Geneva. From the White House to the Lodge, private choice now runs a distant second to collectivist visions. Although only an aspiration now, the 1.5C target will be relentlessly pursued until adopted. The media, in step with the Green -Machine, will bombard us with climate alarmism to the applause of the leader of the free world, Barack Obama, who says: "My mission is to make the world aware that climate change is a bigger threat than terrorism." -Really? That's serious. Clearly authority, not common sense or science, now rules the world. While some activists such as James Hansen may criticise the Paris agreement as "worthless words", those such as Figueres, interested in reconfiguring the world's political and economic structure, will be pleased with progress. We are another step closer to her ideal of "centralised transformation", with the UN at the authoritarian centre, calling the shots and doling out transfer payments from the rich to ensure poor countries remain her -mendicants. As UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says: "If we really want to put an end to global poverty, if we really want to make the world healthier and planet Earth environmentally sustainable, we have first to address the climate change issue."The only certainty to come out of COP21 is that there will be a COP22. \</doc>

Sixty-one prominent Australians, including Wallabies star David Pocock, a trio of former Australians of the year and eminent scientists and economists have pressed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to stop new coal mines and put an international moratorium on coal on the agenda of the forthcoming Paris climate talks. The high-powered group argue Australia's relatively small domestic share of global greenhouse emissions obscures the vast environmental damage Australian coal is doing in places such as China and India. Backed by green and social action organisations, the 61 eminent persons have signed an open letter featured in full-page advertisements in Fairfax Media newspapers, calling on the host of the December talks, French President Francois Hollande, and Mr Turnbull to oppose new coal developments. These include the Carmichael mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin. The Paris climate change meeting is the largest global gathering on the environment since the Copenhagen summit in 2009. "We, the undersigned, urge you to put coal exports on the agenda at the 2015 Paris COP21 climate summit and to help the world's governments negotiate a global moratorium on new coal mines and coal mine expansions, as called for by President Anote Tong of the Republic of Kiribati, and Pacific Island nations," the 61 say. The low-lying Pacific Island country of Kiribati is one of many micro-nations in danger of serious damage. Inundation from rising sea levels caused by melting polar ice is a real possibility. "Australia has a larger share of the seaborne coal market than Saudi Arabia has of the world oil market," the open letter states. \</doc>

DAVID MARK: The Australian Medical Association (AMA) says human health in Australia is already being affected by climate change. It says it's taking into account the most recent scientific evidence. The AMA's president, Professor Brian Owler, is urging the Government to show leadership on the issue at the UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris in December. Lucy Carter reports. AMA president Brian Owler says the potential impacts on the health of Australians are dire. BRIAN OWLER: There will be consequences from changing climate particularly in relation to the distribution patterns of diseases, particularly those tropical diseases which are likely to start to appear more and more in the southern areas of Australia as the climate warms. And, this not only has effects on humans, particularly with respect to borne diseases, that is diseases carried by mosquitoes but other diseases that affect food including animals. LUCY CARTER: Are we seeing health impacts on Australians from climate change now? BRIAN OWLER: Well, we know that climate change is associated with extreme weather events as well, and we've had very severe heat waves over recent summers and those are often associated with significant numbers of deaths and, in fact, a few years ago in Victoria we saw quite a number of people lose their lives associated with heat waves. And so these climate, although they're extremes, the frequency and pattern of those events is likely to increase and the suspicion is that is what we were already starting to see. LUCY CARTER: How does this new position statement differ from the statement put out by the AMA in 2008? BRIAN OWLER: Well, I think this position statement basically reaffirms the AMA's commitment, particularly around the health effects of climate change, and I think it's important ahead of the Paris summit later this year, does call on the Government to show leadership, particularly in relation to policies and programs that not only mitigate against climate change, but makes sure that the Australian population are going to well prepared if these sorts of changes, well, when they actually are occurring. We also talk about the importance of looking at renewable energies and I think also acknowledge the effects that decarbonisation of an economy can have particularly on people's employment and that can have significant health consequences as well. LUCY CARTER: In a statement, a spokesman for the Environment Minister Greg Hunt, says that "only the Coalition is committed to taking serious action to tackle climate change without hurting Australian families and businesses in the process with a painful carbon tax". He says that "as part of our commitment to tackling climate change, the Government will be pursuing a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 from 2005 levels. "This is the target that the Government will be taking to Paris later this year." Professor Brian Owler says he won't comment on the Government's exact emissions reduction percentage targets, but says it's a good change to hear the Governmnent acknowledge that climate change is real. BRIAN OWLER: We've seen a number of comments around climate change and whether or not people are actually accepting that there is climate change and whether or not that humans have had a factor in that and certainly there's been some scepticism from the Government in relation to that, so we're pleased at least to see the statements of the Minister that they are now taking this seriously and that they are committed to doing something about it. But of course, we'll all wait to see exactly how that commitment translates into the actions and what the outcomes of those policies are going to be in terms of reducing emissions and hopefully mitigating against climate change. LUCY CARTER: Professor Owler says it was powerful to see the US president Barack Obama this week declare that any world leader unwilling to take the problem seriously is "not fit to lead". BRIAN OWLER: There is overwhelming scientific evidence and agreement, consensus amongst scientists, that climate change is real and that there is a human element to it and that there is a need to have the right policies in place. So I think some of the scepticism that has been there in relation to climate change has not been, I think, what many people would like to see from the Government in terms of showing leadership on the issue. And I think you can contrasting compare that with some of the statements that have been made here in Australia compared to the statements of the US president.

THE streets of Paris were in lockdown as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull landed on French soil. Mr Turnbull was forced to change his plans at the last minute; instead of laying flowers in the Place de la Republique, he took the bouquet to the Bataclan nightclub where about 90 young people were slaughtered in the Paris terror attacks. Protesters were penned inside the Place de la Republique for much of the afternoon by riot police, who used tear gas and arrested about 100. Security concerns for the Prime Minister prompted the change of plan. COP21 , a global conference on climate change, but also against the restrictions on protesting brought in after the terror attacks. At the Bataclan memorial, Mr Turnbull declared solidarity with France in both French and English. "We are here, the New Zealand Prime Minister (John Key) and the Australian Prime Minister and our wives and we are here offering the people of France, the people of Paris, our most heartfelt condolences and our unflinching solidarity in the face of this terrorism," he said. Flowers, French flags and candles line Boulevard Voltaire outside the nightclub. Two weeks after the attacks people still flock there in grief. Mr Key said while NZ and Australia are far away from France, at such a sad time "we have never been closer together". "We come at this time to pay our respects to those that lost their lives, to their families, and to show support and solidarity for the people of France," Mr Key said. "The city of Paris has gone through a great deal with the terrible issues earlier in the year with Charlie Hebdo and now with the latest terrorist attacks but in the end the spirit of the French people will rise above the terrible actions of ISIL." Mr Turnbull arrived from the Commonwealth meeting in Malta and went straight to the memorial. He then went on to deliver a statement on climate change that was expected to focus on innovative power storage and financing. Australia and much of the world hopes Paris will deliver a binding, transparent, and credible agreement to halt global warming below 2C.It is the latest meeting following the successful Kyoto meeting and the much-less successful Copenhagen meeting. Mr Turnbull will arrive back in Australia for the last part of Parliament's final sitting week of the year. \</doc>

Australia's carbon emissions target - slicing 2000 levels by about 19 per cent by 2030 - would halve pollution on a per capita basis, "one of the biggest reductions" of any G20 nation, Turnbull said. The government would also double "clean energy innovation" investment over the next five years, and carve out $1 billion from the existing aid budget to help threatened Pacific neighbours build "climate resilience" and cut emissions. One cause for optimism was that Australian universities were leading the charge in "energy and climate science innovation". The University of NSW had held the world record for solar cell efficiency - now at 25.6 per cent - for 30 of the past 32 years. And by 2018, more than 60 per cent of all new solar cells would use technology developed in Australia, Turnbull noted. And on Friday, New York time, Environment Minister Greg Hunt will take the next step to lock in the climate pledges when Australia joins more than 150 nations at a UN ceremony to ink the Paris accord. The pact, which the government plans to ratify later this year if re-elected, aims to limit global temperature increases to between 1.5 and 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels - even if current national offers fall far short of the greenhouse gas reductions needed. Bad news on the climate front But in the four months since Turnbull's speech, climate news from abroad and at home has been anything but positive. Global temperature records were so HYPERLINK decisively smashed in the first three months of 2016 that Gavin Schmidt, the head of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, declared this year is already virtually certain to be the hottest on record - for a third year in a row: Too soon?

Before boarding the plane, he joined a last-minute teleconference arranged by Queensland counterpart Steven Miles to address the worst case of coral bleaching to hit the Great Barrier Reef. During the "occasionally heated" call, Miles says he called for an urgent meeting in Cairns so officials "could witness at first-hand the devastating effects of climate change". Hunt refused the invite but agreed to a weekly ministerial phone call to discuss the unfolding disaster. But for policy areas directly under Turnbull's control, it's been a dismal few months for climate action, not least CSIRO's HYPERLINK assault on climate science HYPERLINK http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/csiro-cuts-union-claims-jobs-cut-swells-to-450-as-formal-complaints-lodged-20160406-gnzq0s.html among as many as 450 jobs to go Despite pleas of budget penury, the government somehow managed to find $15.4 million a couple of weeks later for a new http://www.business.gov.au/advice-and-support/IndustryGrowthCentres/Pages/GC-Oil-Gas-and-Energy-Resources.aspx Oil, Gas and Energy Resources Growth Centre to, among other things, "foster community support" for non-renewables, including coal and nuclear energy. It is also forked out HYPERLINK $3.3 million to two researchers Taken for granted And a fresh concern surfaced this week with 61 leading scientists HYPERLINK http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/gobs8n/Arenaletter.docx writing to Turnbull Set up by the Rudd-Gillard government, the agency still had $1.3 billion in funding to disperse by 2022. Instead, HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/hunt/2016/pubs/mr20160323-factsheet.pdf it will now work with the Clean Energy Finance Corp to offer $100 million in loans annually for 10 years to foster "clean and renewable energy". The end of ARENA's grant funding removes "an essential component of technology innovation", the mostly solar researchers said in the letter obtained by Fairfax Media. Forty years of such grants over had allowed Australia to contribute "very far above its weight" in renewable energy. By contrast, reliance on equity returns "have rarely been effective" in advancing early-stage research, the scientists said. Richard Corkish, chief operating officer of UNSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said his facility faced "an existential threat" if the $4 million in annual ARENA funds ended. The school continues to spawn world-leading technology, including new types of solar cells using abundant, non-toxic materials. "ARENA is our major funding source," Corkish says. "This is incredible", says Blakers, who heads the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the Australian National University. "You don't turn off R&D spending when there's a revolution under way." A record $US286 billion ($366 billion) was invested in renewable energy research and deployment last year, the UN Environment Programme said on Thursday. About $US130 billion was spent on new coal and gas-fired power plants. The PM's office declined to comment on the letter, while Fairfax Media also sought comment from Hunt. Still a 'black sheep' Hunt does have a positive story to tell in New York about Australia's ambitions in that per capita emissions will drop more than most nations, says Malte Meinshausen, director of the HYPERLINK http://www.climate-energy-college.net/ Australian-German Climate & Energy College at Melbourne University. "But Australia is still going to be the highest in the developed world" at about 15.7 tonnes of CO2 emitted per person by then, Meinshausen says. However, even those goals - which will leave Australia "a black sheep" vying with Canada as the worst emitter among rich nations - may be out of reach. "We are still walking in the other direction," Mainshausen says."The big gap is there are no policies on the horizon" to hit the target. Paying polluters to cut emissions and other existing measures won't get Australia anywhere close. "It has to be an economy-wide price on carbon in one form or another," he says. Labor still to outline plans Mark Butler, opposition environment spokesman, says Labor will release its policies in coming weeks. He notes, though, that while Australia is likely to meet its 2020 target to cut 2000-level emissions by 5 per cent, it would do so largely because of surplus credits under the existing Kyoto treaty: "By the government's own figures, by 2020 emissions will be 6 per cent above 2000 levels and will keep on rising." "The pressing challenge is to get emissions back under control and have them falling in the medium term to 2030." Greens deputy leader Larissa Waters said there's "an obvious disconnect between the Prime Minster's rhetoric in Paris last year and his actions in Canberra". "Presiding over cuts to CSIRO's world-leading climate research and gutting renewable technology research is stupid on so many levels. "The government is tipping new money into fossil fuel research so that the big mining companies profiting off the world's warming don't have to pay for research themselves," Waters says. Hunt, meanwhile, may be asked in New York about the state of the Great Barrier Reef, an issue the World Meteorological Organisation dubbed one of the "worrying developments" in the sizzling start to 2016. "The magnitude of the changes has been a surprise even for veteran climate scientists," Petteri Taalas, WMO's secretary-general, said ahead of the UN gathering. "The state of the planet is changing before our eyes." \</doc>

The uranium price this year has not exactly set the world on fire. But for Toro Energy chief executive Vanessa Guthrie the stars seem to be aligning for the nuclear fuel to shake off the price sluggishness that set in after Japan's Fukushima accident in 2011. "Even though the price remains static, we've actually seen new markets opening up in India and the United Arab Emirates, China continuing to build, and Japan planning to bring the third reactor back on line by the end of the year and another two by June next year," Dr Guthrie told the The Australian. "So there is a bit of momentum gathering in the international markets. Hopefully it will put a bit of spice back in the price." Spot prices are $US36 a pound while the deeper long-term contract price is about $US47 a pound. While spot prices have improved slightly during the year, they remain well short of the $US60 a pound-plus "incentive" price the industry says is needed to encourage the development of new mine production. In Toro's case, work continues on planning for the $300 million development of its Wiluna project in Western Australia, with a two million pound-a-year operation possibly to be the state's first. "We have $15m in cash and a work program ahead of us. Even though the price continues to languish we've got enough cash and momentum at Wiluna to keep going," Dr Guthrie said. "And we are starting to see more appetite from power utilities around the world to start talking about supply contracts from next year. That's the first time in three or four years." A project economics study into the development of Wiluna is due in the first quarter next year. It will incorporate last month's updated resource estimate that included a 20 per cent uplift in grade. Dr Guthrie said the United Nations' COP21 climate talks in Paris were likely to be "good news for uranium". "All year in the lead-up to Paris there has been talk about nuclear and the role it can play tackling climate change."Uranium is almost a no brainer technology that is available. It's low carbon and it's now. So I am expecting the US, in particular, to reinforce its statement during the year that actually specified the role for nuclear." \</doc>

Not only as a separate goal but as an essential vehicle for development and health." \~\~\~\~Talking about climate change and the effect it has on his small island nation, the President of the Marshall Islands, Christopher J. Loeak said: "As the leader of my country I cannot look my people in the eyes and with good conscience say that everything will be ok when I know the world continues to travel down a very destructive path." \~\~\~\~The Prime Minister of Jordan, Abdulla Ensour, described the extreme pressure his country is under due to the combination of water scarcity and a very large refugee population. \~\~\~\~During the Week, three prizes are awarded.

Beijing residents have turned to social media to joke about the smog blanketing the capital, as authorities issue a rare pollution alert and urge schools to keep children indoors. For the second straight day, the city's official air quality index exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic metre. The unofficial US embassy measurement, which many people trust over the government figures, reached as high as 606. Prolonged exposure to air that contains more than 300 micrograms per cubic metre, known as PM2.5, is generally regarded as hazardous. "To be honest when I first saw it, I felt scared," 37-year mother Yu Hang said. She fears air purifiers in the family home would not be sufficient to protect her two children. "In the past, the pollution has been really bad but I've never felt scared before," she said. "I've been living in Beijing for eight years and today is the worst I've seen," he said. Beijing authorities have blamed the smog on "unfavourable weather", with no wind to disperse the pollution. Sales of face masks booming The Environmental Protection Agency has issued an orange alert, the second highest pollution alert in a four-tier system, which forces factories to temporarily shut down. On Chinese social media, some people have questioned why the government has not issued the highest warning - a red alert - which would restrict the number of cars on the road and shut down schools completely. "We've had more than 500 orders for masks in one day, when usually we only get one or two per day," Mu Ren, an agent for the Singaporean mask brand Totobobo in China, said. "And 90 per cent of these orders are sent to Beijing." Winter in northern China traditionally brings the heaviest pollution due to central heating, much of which is still reliant on burning coal.

COMMENT SIMON RICHARDSON Mayor THE Agreement laboriously birthed at Paris Climate Conference wasn't a scientific success, but it was a political one. Finally, nearly 200 nations, covering 97% of the world's carbon emission, agreed to transition away from fossil fuels, support developing countries with $500 billion, share their programs and to review their efforts and targets regularly. The heart of the people of the world demanded action. The head of science has developed and created the road to follow and now, the will of political leadership has determined to start walking down the road. Businesses, organisations, and communities around the world can now get on with the job of transitioning to zero net emission economies and truly sustainable societies. Byron can and will surf this new wave of change and enjoy the benefits of being a forerunner. At COP21 , I was invited on four occasions to share the Zero Emission Byron Project- the project developing a 10-year roadmap and action plans to become a zero net emission shire across building, energy, land use, transport and waste. Environment Minister Greg Hunt's advisors were excited when I shared the project and invited them to partner with us. The offer to be their test pilot for community sustainability and on the ground climate action was met with enthusiasm. Heads of Environmental facilities in Universities were keenly following what we are up to, one offering Phd students to help. Mayors from around the world and Australia offered to help and share their knowledge. Clover Moore, Lord Mayor of Sydney was keen to explore my offer to develop a sister city relationship with Sydney. The benefits for our shire are many. For example, a major city with huge ambitions and funds will need to find land to plant trees for carbon offsetting. Byron has land, and we will gratefully love the biodiversity and emission reduction benefits that come from large scale planting of local, diverse, endemic tree species in the Byron Shire. The community of Byron proudly wants to be part of the climate change solution. It has the skills to be so. It has the passion to be so. Returning from Paris, I am more emboldened, more committed and more sure than ever that we can re-navigate our economy and community away from a dependence on Tourism. \</doc>

ONE of Perth's newest, and smallest, law firms is working with some of the world's biggest companies, capitalising on a niche area in which few other businesses in the Asia Pacific region have expertise. Sneaking into the top 100 firms in BNiQ by number of legal professionals, HodgkinsonJohnston set up shop in West Perth four months ago as an aviation and climate change-focused law firm, when David Hodgkinson and Rebecca Johnston left Clayton Utz. Having forged strong working relationships with large national and international aviation clients at Clayton Utz, Mr Hodgkinson and Ms Johnston were pleased they retained the business at their new firm. One of their most interesting projects with a client, which they declined to name but they claim is one of the world's leading social media companies, involves HodgkinsonJohnston helping develop plans to use large unmanned aerial vehicles, flying at altitudes between 18 and 23 kilometres, to deliver internet to developing countries. "We're probably the only law firm in Australia working on UAV projects of the type that we are," Ms Johnston told Business News. Mr Hodgkinson said the project was one of their most exciting, as large UAVs, with wingspans longer than a Boeing 737, operated in a largely unsettled area of law, where regulations were still being developed. "It's a well-known client, an interesting area of law, it goes to our core areas of competence and also has a degree of difficulty ... so it's been an exciting project all round," he said. While it is commonplace for lawyers in Perth to leave one firm for another, the unique nature of the work Mr Hodgkinson and Ms Johnston carried out at Clayton Utz meant they were in a good position to open a boutique firm. Mr Hodgkinson told Business News setting up a new venture had allowed them more freedom to pursue legal aviation work as well as their other professional interests such as: writing and editing aviation and climate change policy content; lecturing at the University of Western Australia and the University of Notre Dame Australia; and attending the upcoming Paris Climate Conference Cop21 , as part of their work with non-government organisation EcoCarbon. Mr Hodgkinson said he believed the split from Clayton Utz went as well as could be expected, describing it as an amicable parting after which both parties continued to make cross referrals. \</doc>

\~\~\~\~- As the Annual Summit Takes Place This Week, Global Leaders Have an Opportunity to Scrutinize WHO's definition of transparency and accountability \~\~\~\~Health Ministers from 194 countries will gather this week in Geneva to set the direction for future health policy around the world. JTI - Japan Tobacco International - is calling for the Assembly to urgently address an alarming transparency and accountability crisis at the heart of the World Health Organization (WHO) during discussions on the agency's reform. \~\~\~\~(Logo: HYPERLINK http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130528/617491 http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130528/617491 ) \~\~\~\~In a recent report, the WHO states that "...significant progress has been made towards meeting the objectives of being a more effective, efficient, transparent and accountable organization."[1] This contradicts censorship practices that are increasingly being witnessed at WHO meetings. \~\~\~\~At the last Conference of the Parties (COP6) of the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2014, members of the public and journalists were unjustifiably ejected from the public gallery, leaving them unable to observe and report on plenary sessions that are meant to be transparent. The alarming tactic of conducting proceedings behind closed doors has prompted concerns - notably by the media - that health lobbyists and non-elected parties are wielding undue influence over treaty negotiations. \~\~\~\~These exclusion tactics go against basic transparency and accountability rules - and are in sharp contrast to other UN meetings. At the Sustainable Innovation Forum ( COP21 ) on climate change in Paris earlier this year, some 3000 journalists were accredited, while political and business leaders from around the world actively participated in debates. Proceedings were open to the public and live-streamed on the internet. Businesses sponsored the event. \~\~\~\~Michiel Reerink, Global Regulatory Strategy Vice-President at JTI, stated: "Nobody would argue against the need for tobacco to be appropriately regulated, but there is a right way and a wrong way of achieving that. Excluding the public and the media from debates amounts to censorship, and is unacceptable from a publicly-funded organization. This begs the question: what does the WHO have to hide?" \~\~\~\~JTI, a member of the Japan Tobacco Group of Companies, is a leading international tobacco manufacturer. It markets world-renowned brands such as Winston, Camel, Mevius and LD. Other global brands include Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut, Sobranie and Glamour. With headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and about 26,000 employees worldwide, JTI has operations in more than 120 countries.

Total chief executive Patrick Poyanne has flagged that the next batch of LNG projects may not be as far off as some think, speaking at the LNG18 conference today. The French supermajor is involved in a series of Australian projects, including two in Queensland, and holds a 30 per cent stake in the Inpex-controlled Ichthys. Mr Pouyanne said that a company with a good balance sheet would seek to invest countercyclically because if it was timed right, costs would be low. "Frankly the best strategy for a mature company like Total is to invest when the price is low, because then costs are low," he said. It would still be some time before cost reductions flowed through the supply chain, however. Many contractors took the view in 2015 that the oil price would come back and were hoping for recovery. "The more we wait, the more the situation will be difficult," he said. "All contractors we know still have a workload for 2016. "But for 2017... they face a very tough situation." "This will be the opportunity to rediscuss seriously about new projects," Mr Pouyanne said." Historically, he said the industry had had five price collapses in the past 35 years. When prices had taken off after the last collapse, companies had made windfall profits for the first few years as the market had adjusted. "Operators still had low costs and good fiscal terms." Mr Pouyanne said. "Then they shifted to higher costs and higher fiscal terms... today we are in the reverse cycle." Looking forward Total produces 12 million tonnes of LNG annually, with that figure to rise to 20mtpa by the end of the decade. Mr Pouyanne said demand growth for LNG had been slower than expected, particularly competing against the recent drastic fall in the price of coal. But as with many in the industry, he said the move to reduce global carbon emmissions underpinned demand for the product in future. In order to achieve the recent climate change targets at the COP21 conference, the share of gas in energy production would need to rise while coal fell. A further consideration should be carbon pricing, he said, which would integrate the cost of pollution. Today at the conference, Total signed a memorandum of understanding with Kogas, a South Korean gas importer. That agreement would move Total's involvement closer to LNG buyers, he said, and would include trading. It follows comments yesterday by Woodide Petroleum chief executive Peter Coleman suggesting LNG producers should think about moving into downstream markets. \</doc>

Australia needs to impose strict safeguards on international carbon permits or some companies may game the system, according to a leading energy expert. While big mining companies and the energy sector said international permits could be a cheaper way to meet Australia's carbon-reduction targets, others said there needed to be a limit on how many could be used in lieu of domestic abatement. Environment Minister Greg Hunt left the door open to the use of international credits following the political demise in September of former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was opposed to them. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's announcement at global talks in Paris that Australia will ratify the second phase of the Kyoto Agreement is further evidence carbon permits may be brought in sooner, rather than later. International permits would allow companies to purchase carbon abatement from overseas to offset their emissions in Australia. Grattan Institute's energy program director, Tony Wood, said international permits were a pragmatic way to reduce emissions but needed to be properly policed to ensure companies were not "gaming" the system. He said a company may be awarded a contract from the Emissions Reduction Fund to reduce emissions at $10 a tonne and could purchase international permits at $5 a tonne and pocket the windfall. "There should be limits to how many international permits can be used for domestic abatement. We have to make sure it doesn't become a backdoor mechanism for those not meeting their obligations," Mr Wood said from Paris where he is attending the COP21 summit. "I think international permits or credits are a perfectly viable mechanism in the circumstances. The world doesn't care where the emissions reduction comes from. "But there need to be proper safeguards and provisions to make sure people don't game the system." Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Brendan Pearson said the units would make it easier - and cheaper - to achieve Australia's reduction targets of 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030. "Economic analysis has shown that access to international permits can sharply reduce the cost of mitigation and simply makes good sense," Mr Pearson said. BHP Billiton said they backed international permits as the lowest cost form of abatement. They have previously told the federal government to keep the door open for permits in a submission to an inquiry into the so-called "safeguard mechanism". Mr Hunt said carbon permits - to be used in the $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund and the safeguard mechanism, which applies to companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon a year, were a "live option". \</doc>

Santa Shorten's looking more and more desperate This week France's popular weatherman Philippe Verdier was sacked by a French TV station for writing a book that challenges some scientists for inflating the effects of global warming. The UN gabfest, or COP21 , is aimed at securing agreement from countries with vastly different levels of development, from the prosperous West to fast-growing economies in China and India, to less developed in Africa, to restrict global temperature rises to 2C. It's a big ask, which may explain why the madness started even before Verdier was sacked by France 2. Addressing a September conference in London on climate change and international law, Philippe Sands QC called for a ruling from the International Court of Justice to "scotch" claims by "scientifically qualified, know-ledgeable and influential individuals" who challenge the "consensus" on man-made global warming. Are we re-entering the Middle Ages where you were treated as a traitor if you mentioned that the king might be dying - even if he was? More recently, the future king of England, Prince Charles, repeated his favourite claim that the Paris conference was our "last chance" to draw up a "Magna Carta for the Earth". Charles is no King John. But, equally, Charles seems to have scant understanding of the real Magna Carta, a document that aimed to curb the powers of the king. Charles and his global warming enthusiasts now want a treaty that will deny countries such as China and India the ability to do what rich nations have done - use readily accessible and cheap carbon energy to build prosperous economies. Here in Australia, just as the Prime Minister turned 61, 61 so-called "eminent" people signed an open letter calling on Malcolm Turnbull to put a moratorium on coalmining and new mines. That went nowhere. It was easily demolished when Turnbull said shutting down our coal industry would make zero difference to -global emissions. And if every silly season has a Santa, Shorten is surely it. More and more, the Opposition Leader resembles a second-rate actor who has assiduously studied a set of lines but hasn't managed to inject any conviction into the role. This week Shorten has been on "a fact-finding mission" to the Pacific -Islands. Translation: the Opposition Leader thinks he can use global warming to dent Turnbull's popularity. Shorten's core problem begins with his role in past policy. Shorten rode the Kevin '07 wave into office when Labor's position was that global warming was the great moral challenge of our time and required an emissions trading system. As a senior minister, he then backed Rudd's change of heart to dump the ETS. Shorten was a critical backer of Julia Gillard, when Labor's new position was "there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead". He was there too when Labor signed a deal with the Greens to legislate a carbon tax. Shorten has a long and unfortunate history of reactionary-style politics. As a union leader, he injected passion into his position. In politics, he simply looks like a desperate political leader trying to attract the increasing number of centrist voters who are looking favourably at Turnbull and the Coalition. Last week, there were racy lines Labor would devote more funding to encourage girls to learn coding, as he tried to beat off Turnbull's talk of innovation as a driver of growth. The education system has failed us, Shorten said. Ominous words, except it only serves as a reminder that while the country has doubled spending on education over the past decade to $40 billion, outcomes on basic measures of literacy and num-eracy have gone backwards -according to the most recent international scorecards of educational achievements. Shorten's shadow boxing was evident as soon as Turnbull became PM. Labor's attacks on Turnbull's wealth served only to remind voters we have a PM who was highly successful before he entered politics and understands business. It makes a refreshing change from the career politicians who have never worked in the real world. Last week Shorten proposed giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds. That went nowhere except into the cynical box, given Shorten thinks his best chance at winning an election comes by winning over teenagers under 18. If you can't attract enough adult votes, well, to put it politely, you're stuffed. With the COP21 Shorten's history, on the other hand, is replete with stark episodes of him making statements thrust into his hands by spin doctors and pollsters. There's no detail on the Opposition Leader's uncosted "aspirational" 50 per cent renewable energy target. Nor has Shorten told us what Labor's emissions target would be if he were the PM heading to Paris. A four-day visit to our Pacific neighbours does nothing to build Shorten and Labor's credentials. The hyperbole around global warming, Magna Cartas, last chances and moratoriums on coal will only ratchet up over the next few weeks. But the hyperbole won't alter Turnbull's commitment to take the Abbott government's policy of a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target on 2005 levels by 2030 to Paris. None of it will alter the fact, while China and India will happily extract money from the West's promised $US100bn Green Climate Fund, they won't agree to a deal that curbs their emissions, and therefore their economic growth. China is building a new coal plant every seven to 10 days and has plans to boost its coal power by 50 per cent by 2040; India is intent on doubling its coal production by 2020. In other words, none of the hype will deliver a meaningful treaty at the Paris gabfest that is legally binding, enforceable and verifiable.

Local super funds are being urged to follow US pension fund CalPERS in voting for ANZ Banking Group to commit to greater disclosure of its carbon risks and financing activities at its annual meeting on Thursday. Former Liberal Leader turned corporate climate change activist John Hewson is spearheading the campaign, in his role as chairman of the Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP). The group describes its objective as protecting retirement savings and other long-term investments from the risk of climate change. The AODP has co-sponsored two resolutions to be voted by ANZ shareholders, in a bid to force the bank to provide more information about its exposure to carbon intensive industries, and set public targets for reducing that exposure. On Tuesday California-based CalPERS, the largest pension fund in the United States with more than $US300 billion ($414 billion) in funds under management, revealed it would back the resolutions. CalPERS does not appear on ANZ's register as a significant shareholder. Online campaign In partnership with another lobby group, the Australasia Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), the AODP has been pushing an online campaign, Vote Your Super, to encourage individuals to tell their super funds how they want them to vote. ACCR executive director Caroline Le Couteur said thousands of Australians had voted across 150 super funds, 95 per cent of them calling on their fund to support the push for tighter carbon reduction and disclosure requirements. "The funds with the highest level of members voting in favour of their fund supporting better carbon disclosures and targets for carbon reduction are AustralianSuper, UniSuper, HESTA, AMP, First State Super and QSuper." The bank is the first major company in the local market to face a climate change resolution since the Paris COP21 climate talks, which resulted in an international commitment to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. Many local super funds spent members' money flying executives to the Paris talks, and this was their chance to act, Mr Hewson said. "It is incredible that CalPERS, one of the most advanced funds in the world, is prepared to challenge the ANZ board but Australia's own super funds don't have the courage or commitment," he said. Mr Hewson was also critical of the influence of cross-shareholdings across the wealth management divisions of the major banks. "Australia must break open the cosy relationships between banks, who all own shares in each other." \</doc>

Global greenhouse gas emissions from energy generation appear to have plateaued despite economic output continuing to grow. Preliminary data released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found global emissions of carbon dioxide stood at 32.1 billion tonnes last year, in line with 2014, and have remained essentially flat since 2013. The IEA - a Paris-based advisor to the OECD on energy issues - noted preliminary data suggested new sources of renewable energy were the driving force in greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth. The IEA said around 90 per cent of new electricity generation last year came from renewable sources, with wind providing around half of that. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: "The new figures confirm last year's surprising but welcome news [that] we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth." "Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate change," Dr Birol said. Biggest polluters China, US record falls in emissions Both China and the United States - the two largest emitters of carbon dioxide - recorded significant declines in energy-related emissions last year. China's emissions fell by 1.5 per cent as coal use and production continued to decline, driven by economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and the Government's efforts to de-carbonise electricity generation. Coal now accounts for 70 per cent of power production in China, down from 80 per cent four years ago as hydro and wind generation picked up the demand. In the US, the switch to less carbon-intense natural gas power generation was largely responsible for the 2 per cent decline in emissions last year. However, increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, as well as a moderate increase in Europe, offset the declines in China and the US. The IEA report said in the 40 years it had been providing information on carbon dioxide emissions, there have been only four periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. Three of those were in times of global weakness, such as the second oil shock of the early 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990s and the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. "But the recent stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion," the IEA said. \</doc>

\~\~Malcolm Turnbull has dismissed Bill Shorten's ambitious 45 per cent emissions reduction target as a "heroic offer" that's too expensive, as he prepares to fly to Paris for key climate change talks. \~\~ The prime minister looks set to be an influential player at the COP21 talks starting on Monday after his strong lobbying of Commonwealth leaders at their summit in Malta. \~\~ He urged them to send a strong signal on climate action to Paris where a global consensus is being sought on carbon emissions reductions. \~\~ The government has set a 26 to 28 per cent target for the same period. \~\~ He said the cost of meeting such cuts were way out of line with other comparable countries. \~\~ The prime minister said Australia's current reduction targets were "very reasonable" and ones the government was satisfied it would achieve. \~\~ Mr Turnbull said it was important that agreement was reached in Paris on five-year reviews of each nation's emissions targets to ensure they were met and adjusted if necessary. \~\~ He said he hoped that innovation and technology would play a big part in the Paris talks. \~\~ "You just have to look at the way that so many renewable technologies have improved rapidly in the years. \~\~CHOGM CLIMATE AUST WRAP 2 CANBERRA (REOPENS) \~\~ Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg described Mr Shorten's nominated target as a desperate ploy for relevance. \~\~ "Bill Shorten is taking a huge gamble here, I think it reflects why he's not fit for office," he told Sky News. \~\~ "Great targets but absolutely no detail at all ... they are mile ahead of a lot of our competitors globally," she told Sky News. \</doc>

Australia has signed up to a global commitment to boost soil health and reduce carbon emissions. The French Agriculture Minister launched the program called HYPERLINK http://4p1000.org/understand "4 per 1000" during climate talks in Paris this week. It is a target of increasing carbon in soils by 0.4 of a per cent a year, around the world. A communique on the commitment said a 0.4 per cent annual growth rate of soil carbon stock would make it possible to halt the present increase in atmospheric CO2. Soil scientist and Dean of Agriculture at Sydney University, Alex McBratney, said there was enormous opportunity http://theconversation.com/eyes-down-how-setting-our-sights-on-soil-could-help-save-the-climate-51514 to increase soil carbon in Australia "That's the joined up thinking that we need when we try to solve this climate change issue, we can also secure food and water into the future," Professor McBratney said. "When you increase yields, you have higher inputs of carbon into the soils." He said since Australian soil had been cultivated, it had lost about 50 per cent of its carbon. "But we're now at a stage where we understand that, and can build that carbon back up again." "For every kilogram of carbon we sequester we need 100 grams of nitrogen. "If it comes from a fertiliser bag it's expensive, but if it comes from legumes it costs nothing. "So we need water efficient legumes." Professor McBratney said nine billion tonnes of carbon were emitted each year. "So the French simply say if we, globally, can put 0.4 of a per cent of carbon into the soil additionally, every year, then we can negate all the carbon emissions into the atmosphere." The Paris agreement stated: "This international initiative can reconcile the aims of food security and the combat against climate change, and therefore engage every country in COP21 ." Australia's Environment Minister Greg Hunt said Australia had joined the campaign and had invested over $25 million to date on soil research, including a soil carbon baseline map. "Through the Emission Reduction Fund the Government has contracted around eight million tonnes of soil carbon abatement," Mr Hunt said. "This equates to approximately $100 million based on the contract price (of $12.25/tonne of CO2equivalent)." Professor McBratney said it would be preferable to have a free market trade of carbon, which might value carbon more highly, at up to $40 a tonne of abatement. "From a Government point of view it's a good way to buy carbon cheaply, but I think if we had a proper market based mechanism it would be higher and more attractive for landholders to do this." \</doc>

PRIME Minister Malcolm Turnbull last night joined other world leaders in Paris climate talks that will lead to a doubling of Australia's investment in clean energy. However tensions in the French capital remained high following a day of violent protests. Mr Turnbull's energy commitment is part of "Mission Innovation", spearheaded by philanthropist Bill Gates and US President Barack Obama. The White House has announced that 20 countries present at the Paris mega-conference on climate change will join the initiative. The White House said Mission Innovation and a complementary program to increase private investment in renewables recognised "a crucial reality". "We need to accelerate the development of clean energy solutions to match the urgency of tackling climate change," the statement said. Mr Turnbull flew into Paris after French police detained scores of climate change protesters over violent clashes on the Place de la Republique. France banned public protests after deadly attacks in the capital by terrorists on November 13 prompted authorities to impose a state of emergency. The riots forced Mr Turnbull to change his plans to lay flowers at the Place de la Republique in honour of those killed in the terror attack, instead taking a bouquet to the Bataclan nightclub where about 90 young people were slaughtered. Protesters were penned inside the Place de la Republique for much of the afternoon by riot police, who used tear gas and arrested about 100. The protests were partly about climate change as world leaders arrive in the French capital for COP21 , a global conference on climate change, but also against the restrictions on protesting brought in after the terror attacks. At the Bataclan memorial, Mr Turnbull declared solidarity with France in both French and English. "We are here, the New Zealand Prime Minister (John Key) and the Australian Prime Minister and our wives and we are here offering the people of France our most heartfelt condolences and our unflinching solidarity in the face of this terrorism," he said. "We are with all people committed to freedom in this battle against terrorism, against violence, against violent extremism." The statue on the Place de la Republique has become a makeshift shrine to the 130 people killed in the Paris terror, with Parisians and others placing flowers, candles and messages there. But early yesterday SA time, it resembled a battleground as riot police used tear gas to disperse about 200 protesters, some of them masked, who responded by hurling rocks and even candles. French President Francois Hollande accused the violent protesters of dishonouring the memory of the dead. "It's doubly regrettable, I was even going to say scandalous," Mr Hollande said.

The positive announcement from the leaders of the G7 on the need to decarbonise the global economy has created an optimistic buzz in the hallways of the current climate convention meeting in Bonn, which concludes tonight. However, the mood has been tempered by the mixed progress of meetings as delegates make painstaking attempts to streamline the draft Paris COP21 agreement \- the texts that will be the result of the end-of-year climate meeting. However, the core political issues in the Paris agreement \- such as the framework for future emissions reductions and how to support adaptation to unavoidable climate change impacts \- are making slow progress. Some of the key elements of the post-2020 framework \- like how to ensure the regular ratcheting up of action \- have had substantive discussions but still require much more work before a clearer outcome is defined. Image: Delegates take a breather before re-entering the fray Source: Erwin Jackson Overall, the Australian government delegation has been playing a constructive part in the process and attempting to support more rapid progress in the talks. In some areas more leadership from Australia could make a more positive contribution. Clear signals that they are moving from passive to more active players on important issues would be a useful additional contribution. Articulating a clear preference for targets that ensure countries are held accountable for their actions to 2025 and not just 2030 is one example of this. Shorter term cycles for target-setting increases ongoing pressure on all governments to step up actions, and is a more credible signal to business that policies will be implemented and countries don't hold back from additional policy implementation. How successful the meeting is viewed ultimately is now, in part, defined by the mandate given to the American and Algerian co-chairs to take the work that has been done in Bonn and consolidate it into a more workable negotiating text. This would be discussed at the next meeting August. This will be tested today when countries reconvene to take stock of the process they have made to date. Erwin Jackson is deputy CEO, The Climate Institute. \</doc>

The high-rise residential boom poses a challenge for carbon emissions reduction because apartment towers use more energy for every resident than standalone buildings. While denser living boosts the overall sustainability of cities by cutting the need for high-emitting car travel from outlying suburbs, high-rise towers lag commercial buildings in curbing emissions, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore said before departing for the Paris climate change summit. "Seventy-five per cent of our residents live in apartments, but high-rise apartments over six storeys use more energy per capita than standalone dwellings due to common area usage, such as lights, lifts and basement fans," Ms Moore said. The City of Sydney in August endorsed a Residential Sustainability Apartment Plan to cut emissions of the buildings that account for 10 per cent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions. CBD apartments are playing catch-up to the 35 per cent cut over the three years to 2014 that the city's commercial buildings made through Sydney's Better Building Partnership program. Growing recognition of the role buildings play in the wider climate-change agenda has been recognised through the inclusion of a Buildings Day in the Paris COP21 conference on Thursday. More than 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are building-related and the figure could rise to 50 per cent by 2050 without significant change. Thursday's discussions aim to create an alliance of property and construction-related organisations that will commit to putting the industry on a "below 2-degree path" - to boost collaboration and exchange so the industry can become more sustainable and help limit the increase in temperature to no more than 2 degrees celsius above the world's average pre-industrial level. "The buildings sector offers one of the most cost-effective and economically beneficial paths for reducing energy demand and associated emissions while at the same time supporting adaptation and resilience to climate change," the Global Buildings Performance Network, a Paris-based organisation, says. The development and ownership structures of high-rise apartments made it harder to take actions like green retrofitting, said Romilly Madew, chief executive of the Green Building Council of Australia. Commercial buildings generally had a small number of long-term owners who understood the financial as well as commercial benefits of lower-emitting buildings, Ms Madew said. "The ownership [of apartment towers] is slightly different," she said. "If you're talking about multi-unit residential, a developer will own the building and then sell each unit in a strata title and will move on to the next development. It's up to the owner of the unit about whether they care, whether they buy into a green development or not." \</doc>

THE climate deal reached in Paris by 196 nations is the death knell for petrol and diesel powered vehicles, Climate Tasmania says. The United Nations Climate Change conference Climate Tasmania co--ordinator Phil Harrington said it was time for the state and local governments to start phasing petrol cars out of fleets. Mr Harrington, who also works for infrastructure consultancy Pitt and Sherry, said his firm had found $38,000 Nissan Leaf electric cars to be a cost-effective replacement for an entire fleet run by Moreland City Council in Melbourne, with just a fifth of other cars' running costs.The Tasmanian Government is planning to trial at least 19 electric vehicles in its fleets from this month as part of the Tasmanian Energy Strategy. \</doc>

Qantas will centralise its fuel programs and use cutting-edge software to boost fuel efficiency to industry-leading levels. The airline this week signed an agreement to use GE Aviation's Flight Efficiency Services to help monitor, analyse and modify its fuel use as well as design Required Navigation Performance procedures at airports across its network. Qantas head of environment and fuel Alan Milne said the airline was also pulling together fuel efficiency programs in separate business units into one central team within the corporate area. "One of the reasons we're doing that is to ensure we're sharing all the benefits across the air operator certificates appropriately - we're not working in our little business units and it's a closed shop," he said. "We're going to make sure that happens and, we've got to be brutally honest here, there's going to be level of oversight that we haven't had before as well to hold the AOCs accountable for the delivery of these fuel savings." Mr Milne said a key enabler would be GE's software solution, which would draw on flight operations quality assurance data traditionally used as part of Qantas's safety performance reporting and some additional data streams to analyse operational performance. GE has provided versions of this service to other airlines, but Mr Milne said it has never been done to the extent covered by the Qantas agreement. Some of the hundreds of -parameters collected for the program will be sampled at a frequency of up to one parameter per second. "From a safety perspective, we use that data to measure if pilots are landing long or at a higher rate of descent than we like - those sorts of safety parameters," Mr Milne said. "But now we're going to be able to manipulate that data seriously like we've never been able to before, to look pointedly at operational efficiencies - are we flying the shortest track miles that we can?" The airline has more than 100 fuel saving projects under way, ranging from single-engine taxiing to use of auxiliary power units, weight initiatives and use of ground power. "The whole fuel program is lots of little gains. The low-hanging fruit has gone but we now we look at programs that can save as little as 70 kilos of fuel per flight," Mr Milne said. "But when you think about the amount of flights and the amount of sectors that we're flying over the year, that's a substantial amount of fuel." The fuel program has saved 65 million kilograms over the past two financial years - the equivalent of 210,000 tonnes of CO2, or 83,000 cars off the road for a year. However, executives are predicting that savings will ramp up as new initiatives emerge from analysis of the data flows coming from the airline's fleet of almost 300 aircraft and as people get used to the software and procedural changes. "We haven't got our head around the art of the possible yet until we fire it up," Mr Milne said. Qantas also expects to benefit from the renewal with GE of the RNP procedures agreement by doing away with duplication under which each flying unit has been given individual approval for approaches only it can use. GE will now be designing approaches that can be used across all the group's airlines. "Hobart's probably the best example," Mr Milne said. "GE will design the RNP approach into there but that will be able to be -accessed by both Qantas regional and Jetstar AOCs." The Qantas move is just one of hundreds of carbon emission projects being undertaken worldwide as the aviation industry moves to meet environmental goals of a 1.5 per cent increase in fuel -efficiency per year to 2020 and carbon neutral growth beyond that. A more ambitious goal commits the industry to halving net carbon emission by 2050 compared to 2005. The Air Transport Action Group, a global coalition promoting sustainable aviation development, underlined this commit-ment by this week releasing a report outlining projects by more than 400 organisations in 65 countries. Qantas contributed three examples: RNP approaches, the use of tri-generation power plants at the airline's Mascot headquarters and shortly in Sydney's Terminal 3, and its carbon offset program. Others ranged from solar power installations at hundreds of airports to new aircraft designs, lighter equipment on aircraft and more efficient flight paths. The addition of wingtip devices to 8300 in-service aircraft, for example, has saved about 56 million tonnes of CO2 in the past 15 years. More than 2000 commercial flights have now taken place using sustainable aviation alternative fuels and these are now being brought into everyday use, -although fossil fuels are still used to power most engines. The use of satellite technology is making air traffic control more efficient and allowing planes to fly fuel-saving routes. As ATAG executive director Michael Gill said, not all the projects are headline-grabbers but they are all significant. "It is a reflection of what will be needed to tackle the climate challenge at a broader level," Mr Gill said. "All parts of the economy and all parts of society have a role to play, with both small actions and large shifts in thinking." ATAG also co-ordinated a letter to government signed by 28 aviation industry leaders ahead of the UN-backed COP21 climate change conference in Paris. The industry is keen to avoid penalties on airlines, particularly the use of the industry as a cash cow to finance other environmental programs, and is pushing for global, market-based measures through a mandatory carbon offset program. The letter calls for government support for the industry carbon emission commitments through a range of actions, including investment and reform in air traffic management, support for research into new technology and sustainable alternative fuels as well as policy settings to support the commercialisation of biofuels. It also wants governments to back the offset scheme as well as the introduction of carbon emission standards for new aircraft. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is due to consider the global carbon offset proposal at its 39th assembly in September next year and ICAO president Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu said a positive outcome at COP21 would be crucial to progress at that meeting.Dr Aliu said action on ICAO's emissions reduction goals required adequate financial resources within the aviation sector. He said it was united with the industry against "any proposals to use international aviation as a potential source for the mobilisation of general revenues to finance climate programs in other sectors". \</doc>

Australia is hoping to enter the HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/why-the-paris-climate-talks-are-bad-news-for-coal-whatever-happens-20151121-gl4sjc climate talks in Paris In the final update ahead of next month's global climate talks in Paris, Mr Hunt said Australia is set to beat its 2020 targets by 28 million tonnes. He said he was confident Australia would reach the new 26 to 28 per cent reduction target by the end of next decade, which he described as "serious and credible" compared to other countries. The Department of Environment's national accounts to be released on Wednesday will show there has been an improvement of 264 million tonnes of potential abatement, which surpasses the 236 million tonnes target earlier this year - putting Australia in the black by 28 million tonnes. "We have closed the emissions gap and go to Paris officially sub-zero and on track to beat our 2020 target," Mr Hunt will tell the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday "This remains, however, a conservative forecast and I am hopeful that future updates will show an even greater surplus." While Australia's 2020 carbon abatement target has been significantly reduced in recent years - from 755 million tonnes when the Coalition took office in 2013 to 236 million tonnes earlier this year, mostly due to the economic slowdown - the Turnbull government is hoping it will give Australia some credibility at the Paris negotiations. Mr Hunt - who will attend the COP21 conference in Paris with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull - said Australia's 26 to 28 per cent target for 2030 were significant when compared to other big-emitters such as the United States, Canada and Japan. "In terms of the emissions intensity of our economy, our effort is even greater - with a reduction of up to 65 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. "I am confident we can achieve our 2030 target, but it will be a challenge as it should be." HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/politics/carbon-reduction-targets-are-fools-gold-20151121-gl4ngh But critics argue while Australia will meet its 2020 carbon abatement targets, its net emissions will increase due to increased land-clearing, a ramp-up of coal-fired electricity generation and increased coal and gas exports. They argue more needs to be done to reduce emissions in the next five years or it will only make it harder to reach the 2030 targets. Mr Hunt will also use his National Press Club address to spruik the Coalition's environmental successes, including the $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund which has paid companies to deliver 92.8 million tonnes of carbon abatement at $13.12 a tonne. \</doc>

The natural gas industry says a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions will propel the industry further. At the COP21 climate talks in Paris last year, an informal agreement was made keep global temperatures rises less than two degrees. Liquefied natural gas has up to half the carbon dioxide emissions profile as coal. United States corporation Chevron has just started exporting gas from a Gorgon project on Barrow Island off the WA coast. Chief executive John Watson said despite current low LNG prices, International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts supported the sector's future. "We see demand growing 35 per cent in the next 20 years, that will be a doubling in LNG production," he said. "To put it into perspective, we will likely need a project the size of Gorgon every year, for the next 20 years." Mr Watson was speaking at an LNG conference in Perth this week. Many at the conference spoke of LNG being the natural displacer of coal in global energy systems. The forecasts come amid price falls for all energy resources, including oil, in recent years. The CEO of French oil and gas giant Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said hydrocarbons would still play a role into the future. "We will still have oil, we'll still have coal, we'll still have gas, but the gas share will increase and the coal share will decrease," he said. "And that's what's being said by the experts (IEA)." The rise in demand, and from where, has surprised even long-time players in the industry. The head of Origin Energy, Grant King, said gas was the immediate fuel of choice to replace nuclear energy in Japan after the Fukushima meltdown. The growing demand from China, Korea and elsewhere in Asia was forecast, but Mr King said it would have been hard to have predicted that Jordan and Egypt would be importing Australian gas. Global carbon price if, not when Total also has Australian gas interests at the Gladstone LNG complex on Curtis Island in Queensland. The company is also developing renewable and biomass systems as well. Mr Pouyanne said in the wake of the Paris climate talks, it was inevitable a global price on carbon would come in. "There are many ways to do that, but when you look at what governments committed to at Paris - 40 countries have planned a carbon price," he said. "If we connect them, this will eventually provide a global carbon plan." That was a call echoed by the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell Ben van Beurden. "I believe it's not a matter of mandates, HYPERLINK it's not a matter of structures that are going to be imposed top down ," he said. "I believe in the concepts of markets doing their work, putting a price on carbon, making sure we level the playing field." \</doc>

AUSTRALIA has 30 years to eliminate all emissions or face irreparable ocean damage according to University of Queensland's leading ocean expert Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg. Prof Hoegh-Guldberg believes the 2009 Copenhagen negotiations underestimated the impact climate change will have on oceans. "At the conference every-one was looking at the coast, not the ocean as whole," he said. "This latest report really focuses on oceans." United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year would need to come up with a solid agreement to reduce carbon pollution. "China, the US and Europe are in negotiations. The question will be what will Australia bring to the table?" he said. \</doc>

SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH, 90 THIS WEEK, IS STILL IN AWE OF THE NATURAL WORLD, BUT CALL HIM A NATIONAL TREASURE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, WRITES JAMES RAMPTON I had to ask David Attenborough how he felt about the title of "national treasure", with which he is habitually labelled. "What does national treasure mean?" he replies, with a twinkle in his eye. "Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't! "It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium." A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter. "Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No." Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator. As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger. Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being apart from astronauts, and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning. What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered. Attenborough observes that: "I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf." By contrast, he continues, "I'm fantastically lucky. "I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things." Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations. That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world. "Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'. "But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of puffer fish and peacock spiders prove. "There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out." The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain. "Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied, quite beyond our comprehension. "But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did. "That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it." He adds that "these programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year. "It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do."I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand." \</doc>

PARIS may be a long way from Beecroft, but a small group of like-minded residents are hoping their voices may still reach the all-important United Nations Climate Change Conference starting later this month. The seven friends - one a local doctor, another a scientist - are not part of a political or an environmental group, but simply want to draw attention to the cause, says one of the members, Emma Heyde. "We felt strongly that we wanted to encourage world leaders to take action on climate change," Ms Heyde said. "We're all really involved in the local community and are concerned about the environment." To draw attention to the conference, the group has organised a Big Beecroft Climate Brunch in Beecroft Village Green on November"29, before a rally takes place in the Domain.

Shares in Whitehaven Coal jumped after the miner revealed its earnings for the first half could exceed $100 million and after it reaffirmed stronger cash flows will allow it to focus on debt reduction. Shares in the pure-play coal miner, which have lost about 46 per cent in 12 months, climbed as much as 28 per cent on Wednesday before closing up 6.6 per cent at 64.5\'c2\£2. Whitehaven said it expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to be between $100 million and $105 million for the first half of 2015-16, almost double the miner's EBITDA performance in the first half of 2015 of $52.1 million. Whitehaven reaffirmed it would be profitable during the half and said its cash margin was expected to exceed the $13 a tonne margin achieved last financial year, which would enable it to reduce net debt levels. "I tend to try and get around to see customers as much as I can ... and it always serves to remind you that perhaps our equity markets are at times a long way away from what is going on on the ground," Mr Flynn said. "The appetite for our quality coal is fantastic and that is why we are able to attract a premium. I think at a time when the industry is going through difficult times - you saw some major announcements from other players in the market about closures, you have COP21 coming to a head - the equity markets seem to demonstrate a disconnect between what is really going on in Asia and the Australian equity market psyche." Mr Flynn said Whitehaven's net debt of $938.5 million as of June 30 was the "peak" and the company was on track to reduce its debt over the course of the financial year. Whitehaven bumped up its production guidance for the full year to between 19.5 and 20.1 million tonnes per annum, from previous guidance of between 18.8 and 19.4 million tonnes. Meanwhile, Iluka Resources said mineral sands market conditions continued to deteriorate, impacting its full-year sales and capital expenditure. The producer said its customers were not purchasing as much of its products because of cash flow pressure and, particularly in regards to zircon, some customers had deferred purchases from Iluka to seize on "distressed selling by highly leveraged companies". Iluka, one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands, said its strategy ruled out increasing volumes to counter market challenges and claimed this helped prevent prices from crashing. \</doc>

Union transparency TREVOR Gauld (Letters, November 16), states unions' finances are disclosed publicly each year. Not so, according to the royal commission into trade union corruption. - B. A. ELLIS, West Launceston. Simple celebration DID anyone else notice the demeanour of Ross Taylor, the New Zealand batsman, on passing the 200-run mark? No running the length of the pitch, no jumping in the air, no punching the air, no kissing the New Zealand emblem, just acknowledgement of the crowd and a handshake from his partner. I found it very refreshing. Price of diesel AFTER spending 18 weeks on the mainland, and buying diesel in Victoria, NSW and Queensland, we noted that diesel was always about 10 cents a litre cheaper than unleaded. On returning to Tasmania in September we noted that it is still about 1-2 cents higher than unleaded. Will the report currently under review on fuel prices by Dr Michael Schaper mentioned in The Examiner, November 14 let us know who is making this extra 10 cents a litre difference in price between diesel and unleaded. No hope for terrorists ONCE more the world is reeling from a terror attack involving people innocently going about their business. The Paris attacks - where scores of people have been left dead and injured - is an affront to humanity and to all the values held dear by people of goodwill throughout the world. This further attempt in France to destabilise and undermine democracy must be met not only with waves of revulsion but also with a steely determination to never allow terrorists to have their objectives realised. United Nations Climate Change Conference These murderers of innocent victims have nothing to do with religion, but are simply a group of thugs who relish terrorising the population for the benefit of territorial gains and the dissemination of a warped ideology. The world gathering in Paris will help affirm that terrorists will never succeed in spreading a climate change of fear and anxiety. - ED SIANSKI, West Moonah. Do your own research What he omits in his statement is the unprecedented rate of change, (World Meteorological Organization, 2013), with the planet warming faster since the turn of the century than ever recorded. The likely rate of change will be at least 10 times that of any climate shift in the last 65 million years. (Stanford, 2013; Diffenbaugh/Field, 2013). "Ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of temperature change over thousands of years", now that change is "to occur over decades" (Marcott, 2013). With regard to the emotive issue that is climate change, it is very important to do your own research on the subject. Indeed, do not take my word or other correspondents on this subject. But please ensure that what you read has been properly peer reviewed. This process reinforces the veracity of the research. - MARTIN HAY, Rosevears. WOMEN and adolescents are being sent to interstate drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities because of a shortage of services within Tasmania (The Examiner, November 16). That's only if you can afford it. What happens to those who can't afford it? Pathways Tasmania offers a Hobart-based addiction program Live Free Tassie, but it is open only to young men. Why? A Launceston couple hope to open a dedicated rehab centre in the former Meander Primary School to deal with the issue. Let's hope they're not as selective with who they offer treatment. - A. R. TROUNSON, Needles. Delivery delays ON Wednesday morning, November 4, I took a card into the counter at the George Town Post Office. I asked how much for a stamp, the address was checked (a post office box in George Town 7253), it was a standard sized card so no extra was required. I paid for the stamp and left it with the staff member and left. The card arrived at its destination, the above PO box on the following Tuesday, November 10. The card only had to be taken out the back of the post office and posted into the private box, yet it took a week to be delivered. I queried the delay in delivery, from the front counter to the back office, and was told that unless I specify that it is for local delivery, all mail goes to Hobart for processing and then is returned for delivery. - JANET McMULLEN, George Town. No easy solution SPEAKING of the evil Islamic terrorists who killed in Paris, The Examiner rightly said "our world is not for some crazy, deranged extremists to hijack and subjugate, in pursuit of warped totalitarianism". But, the editorial could equally have been directed at the Americans and their allies who stupidly invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, killing thousands of innocents and thereby creating the vacuum that this new group has filled. Put troops on the ground? It will take a lot deeper thinking than that to find a solution. - MICHAEL MANSELL, Launceston. Leave Quadrant as is I work in this area , and people are constantly saying what a pleasant area it is, to sit and eat, or just contemplate life. If the cobbles are a problem, why not re-grout and clean them. The seats and lights suit the area, particularly with the decorations to suit. - CHRISTINE BEST, Launceston. Paying for your crimes THE editorial in (The Examiner, November 13) was spot on, suggesting that criminals should contribute to court costs of $50 or $150. Someone has to pay, why should it always be the long-suffering taxpayers. The decision to commit the crime was theirs, so they should at least cover some of the costs. As for the Legislative Council voting it down when it was part of the government's agenda that it took to last election, I can only say how left wing some MLCs have become. It is on record that our local member voted against the legislation, so he will never get my vote in the future. We are fast moving towards a society where criminals have more rights than the majority who are law abiding. - GRAEME BARWICK, Riverside. Taking the hard line THOSE that criticise mandatory detention of asylum seekers that come to Australia by illegal means (such as by people smugglers supplying boats) must now understand - with the recent events in Paris - why Australia must continue to take a hard line on border protection. Seekers of asylum (and this includes those migrating across Europe to other countries) can no longer expect to be welcomed with open arms by the country of their destination. This latest Paris terror attack has now made certain of that. To the people of France, we feel your pain; continue to sing your anthem with pride for you are a nation the rest of the world has always been proud of, an icon of democracy. - ROBERT LEE, Summerhill. EVER wondered why a lad born in Australia would want to become a violent radical and join groups such as ISIS? Lack of parenting is one answer. Monday's Four Corners (ABC) showed some of the violent video games most popular with young men, with "killing" as the main objective. Killing, in every way possible, but mostly with guns such as AK rifles, rocket launchers and so on. Parents should not allow such viewing. Better still, the government should ban such videos that depict this violence, just as John Howard did did with guns. Problem is this "criminality " generates huge profits, and profits are much more important than a few lives. - DON DAVEY, Launceston. \</doc>

There are many pros and cons to installing solar panels. Do your homework writes David Potts. Solar panels are landing on rooftops just as the Hills Hoist invaded backyards. If you're not solar-powered, you're not with it. In a few days' time the United Nations climate change conference will start in Paris, taking up where the previous talks in Copenhagen failed. In the six years since Copenhagen, the cost of solar panels has plummeted and battery technology has improved dramatically. If households can generate electricity by day and then store it to use in the evening, it would revolutionise electricity distribution. There are forecasts of a coming boom in solar batteries to rival the boom in panel installation of the first Kevin Rudd era. US-based Greentech Media claims Australia will be a leader in installing batteries, forecasting solar storage capacity to rise from 6.6 megawatts to 75 megawatts in 2016, hitting 800 megawatts by 2020. As the costs of panels and batteries keep falling, who would pay an energy company 45\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour when you can generate the power yourself, with some assistance from the sun, for 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour? Especially when it's never been easier, or cheaper, to finance a solar installation. The other thing that's changed since Copenhagen, and Australia's previous solar boom, is the rise of leasing or pay-as-you-go options. Still, solar panels aren't always as kind to your pocket as they are to the environment. If you buy a system that's too big they can even lift your bill when, for the first time, electricity prices are falling. As a rule solar pays off after five years in Sydney and seven in Melbourne due to the difference in the amount of sun in each city. Let's not go there. It's also because Melbourne has cheaper conventional power so the benefit is also slightly less. These payback periods stack up well against other investments that don't have the feel-good green benefits. For most shares and investment properties the payback period is more like 10 years or longer. The panels should be good for at least 25 years, though parts of the system might need replacing after a decade. Looked at another way - which is to say dispassionately by me - in Sydney it's a 15 per cent annual return after tax on your investment. Finance options for solar Then again, these days you can lease a solar system and, in NSW only, you can get one that's as free as the sunshine itself in return for buying all the power it generates. More on that later. Leasing a system works pretty much like car finance so interest is built into the monthly payments. Typically at the end of the lease you'll be able to buy the system outright at its depreciated value. An advantage is that you never have to worry about maintenance, not that there's much anyway. The reason the panels are tilted is so they self-clean when it rains. Roughly speaking, a leased system will cost you about 15\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour. That compares with 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 if you generate your own power - about what you pay off-peak from the grid. Trouble is, the grid's version of off-peak is different from your own. Do you really want to do the washing at 11pm? Oh, and did I mention the grid price can be as high as 46\'c2\£2 a kilowatt in peak periods? "The rule of thumb, depending where you are, is that the cost to you from solar will be 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour which avoids 25 to 30\'c2\£2 [conventionally]," says Damien Moyse, policy and research manager at the Alternative Technology Association. Energy companies are even offering Harvey Norman-style interest-free terms though there is a small deposit. Origin Energy, for example, charges $199 upfront plus monthly interest-free payments for two years - a total cost of $3295 for a two kilowatt system. The cheapest personal loan is Hunter United's green saver loan at 9.74 per cent. So if you don't have the cash, the cheapest way to go solar is putting it on the mortgage. Next comes leasing. Hang on, what was that about a free solar system? Under a power purchase agreement you have to buy what the system generates, even if you don't use it. While the charge will be higher than solar costs, it'll still be less than the energy company's regular electricity. Choose the wrong-sized system for your home, however, and the payback period can be longer than half your working life, which would detract somewhat from the warm inner glow of doing the right thing. "The payback range is huge - it can be five years to longer than the asset life, which is 25 to 30 years," Moyse says. "If you're at work so the only power you're using during the day is the fridge, forget solar. Like to burn the midnight oil? Sorry, solar's not for you." That's without batteries of course. It's not economic just yet to store the energy your solar panels generate, but it's close. Next month Enphase Energy will roll out a system that can store solar energy and lets you monitor your consumption. Tesla, of electric car fame, will roll out a battery next year as well but don't hold your breath. Although the price of solar batteries is falling it's still prohibitive for the average home. And they have less than half the life of the panels. "International forecasts show an 8 to 10 per cent drop per annum in the battery price. By 2020 you'll be able to have a battery economically," Moyse predicts. Solar costs falling Many people believe that it's become more expensive because government subsidies are falling. In fact the cost of installing a system has fallen faster than the government subsidies. A 1.5 kilowatt system, which should satisfy about one-third of the average household's electricity consumption, costs between $3000 to $6000. A souped-up five kilowatt affair, probably enough to light up a whole suburb, will cost $7000 to $11,500. Incidentally the reason for the big price range for each size is that a lot depends on how many panels you need, what your roof is made of, and sundry things such as whether you need a new meter and wiring or trees have to be removed. Most systems installed are under three kilowatts, according to a survey by Choice last year. The average cost was $8783. These costs take into account the federal incentive of small-scale technology certificates, which trade in the market like shares. These are credits for every megawatt hour it's estimated your system will generate over the next 15 years. Usually they're "sold" to the installer, who gives you a discount of the same amount. Energy companies buy the certificates because they count towards their mandated renewable energy target and are cheaper than building wind farms. If you're keen enough you can hang on to them and sell them in the market though it involves more paperwork. The price is set by the market and so bobs about but for all intents and purposes is capped at $40. Quotes are available from Trade in Green tradeingreen.com.au or Green Bank green-bank.com.au. When I looked the price was about $39. Another myth is that you need lots of sun. The truth is that you can have too much. Solar operates best at 25 degrees but roofs can get as hot as 60 degrees. Darren Gladman, policy manager at the Clean Energy Council recommends a check by an installer every five years. Selling to the grid As for the once thriving cottage industry of selling power back to the grid, it's too late. These days you're only paid a fraction of the cost of producing solar. Action plan for solar Check your last four energy bills to see how much power you use and when. This will tell you the size of the system you need. Only generate power you need - feed-in tariffs aren't worth it. Ask your energy company what your new night tariff will be. Use a Clean Energy Council approved installer (see solaraccreditation.com.au). Get three quotes. Sites such as cleanenergycouncil.org.au and solarchoice.net.au can arrange this.

SUPERCHARGED batteries and other hi-tech solutions will drive Australia's carbon emissions down, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will tell world leaders in Paris today. Just weeks after the deadly terror attacks that rocked France, more than 140 heads of state and government including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping and David Cameron will meet in the French capital today to try to reach a global consensus on climate change and emissions reduction targets. Although there has been no cancellations following the terrorist attacks, the COP 21 negotiations will open under tight security today. Overnight Mr Turnbull will speak at the global mega-conference, where he hopes to reach a legally binding agreement aimed at keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Australia has committed to a minimum 5 per cent reduction on 2000 emissions by 2020, and a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 emissions by 2030. "What we all want from Paris is a strong and durable agreement that commits all parties to effect credible action on climate change," Mr Turnbull said yesterday from Malta at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. "The solutions to the climate change challenge lie very much in the field of technology and hence innovation," he said. Last week Opposition Leader Bill Shorten - attending talks as an observer - announced a plan to cut carbon emissions to 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, and for net zero emissions by 2050.ANDREW BOLT, PAGE 13 \</doc>

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says global coal demand has stalled for the first time in a decade but it predicts the Australian industry will have a greater share of the seaborne coal trade. HYPERLINK http://www.iea.org/bookshop/712-Medium-Term_Coal_Market_Report_2015 The IEA lowered its five-year global coal demand growth forecast in its just-released annual coal market report. The Medium-Term Coal Market Report 2015 indicates that Chinese coal demand declined in 2015 with the trend expected to continue. The IEA now forecasts a drop in coal-demand growth of more than 500 million tonnes of 'coal equivalent' (Mtce). Executive director Fatih Birol said the economic transformation in China, and environmental policies worldwide would likely continue to constrain global coal demand. "Coal demand in China is sputtering as the Chinese economy gradually shifts to one based more on services and less on energy intensive industry. "New Chinese Hydro, nuclear, wind and solar are also significantly curtailing coal power generation." The report shows a decline in coal consumption in China for two consecutive years would be the first time that has happened since 1982. It also models what it calls an alternate scenario in which Chinese coal demand has already peaked and if that was the case, modelling indicates coal demand in 2020 would be 9.8 per cent below demand in 2013. "The Indian government's push for universal energy access and an expansion of manufacturing will drive electricity growth. "In addition to India's ambitious renewable targets (175 gigawatt of renewables by 2022, of which 100 g/w at solar PV) HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-07/india-seeks-balance-in-tackling-poverty-climate-change/7001114 coal will provide a significant share of the additional power requirements . "We anticipate that to be as much as 60 per cent through 2020 and preliminary data shows India will overtake China as the world's largest coal importer this year." This assessment reflects the stated aims of the Indian government which made it clear at the Paris climate talks ( COP21 ) that it expected to at least double coal fired power by 2020. The increasing demand for cheap energy is one of the reasons Indian company Adani is trying to develop the Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland. Some commentators have dismissed the possibility of the project going ahead on economic grounds HYPERLINK /news/2015-12-10/debate-over-future-of-australian-coal-industry-and-indian-demand/7010772 while others say despite talk of becoming self sufficient in coal, India will need to continue to import it . Even without that specific project moving ahead, the IEA predicts that Australia will take the 'growing share of the seaborne coal trade' as South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Korea continue to build more coal-fired power plants. \</doc>

Origin Energy chief executive Grant King knows better than most CEOs how risky it can be to get in on the ground floor with a new technology that promises huge growth potential. He was finishing his civil engineering degree at the University of NSW in the mid 1970s when he and a couple of fellow students founded Solar Technics, one of the first companies to offer solar heating for swimming pools. The company went broke and he lost everything. The abiding lesson he learnt was the importance of having sufficient working capital. As he tells Chanticleer in an interview: "People who supply you want cash and customers want credit." But 40 years later, he can rightly claim to be the "Sun King" of Australian energy markets. When you include the new Clare Solar Farm, which employs tracking technology to optimise output, Origin will have more solar generation than AGL, which is the country's largest privately owned investor in renewable energy. Origin's power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Clare Solar Farm, which is about 80kms south of Townsville, is seen by many as a turning point in Australia's renewable energy market. Origin signed a 13-year PPA to purchase the Clare Solar Farm energy output plus renewable certificates for a bundled price of $80 a megawatt hour. That is below the parity price for wind power. Credit Suisse analyst Mark Samter said last week that this deal was a milestone in the transition to renewables because solar prices have fallen to levels which the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) had targeted for 2020. He said "this could herald the start of a renewables investment boom". "We believe the stunning drop in solar PPA prices does put a cap on how far wholesale electricity prices can rise," Samter said. "However, we retain the view that tighter climate policy will necessarily lead to higher wholesale electricity prices which will benefit Origin and AGL's existing portfolio." King says investment in renewable energy died in 2014 and 2015 because of policy uncertainty about the renewable energy target (RET) and the sum of the value of electricity in the wholesale market and subsidies called renewable energy certificates (REC). But this year the economics have all changed according to King. The REC prices have doubled, there is bipartisan agreement of a RET of 33 terawatt hours by 2020 and there is a falling cost curve for installing renewable generation. Another way of looking at this is in relation to the necessary investment. It is likely that about $6 billion in renewable generation will need to happen over the next five years to ensure about 25 per cent of electricity generation is from renewables. King is not alone in believing that utility scale solar will come into its own over the next few years and become even more attractive if there can be bipartisan agreement about what happens after 2020. Australia is going to the COP21 conference in Paris later this year with a commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 per cent and up to 28 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels. If climate change becomes a hot election issue there will be a stark difference between the Coalition and Labor, which has promised 50 per cent renewables by 2030. King won't drawn on the politics of climate change but he says if we are to meet out COP21 targets there will have to be significant investment in renewables. Origin brings a unique perspective to the debate about renewables policy because of its involvement in utility scale solar in Chile for the past decade. Its 40 per cent investment in the 69 megawatt Javiera solar project in Chile's Atacama Desert has provided the upper echelon of Origin's management with an understanding of the rapid decline in solar generation investment when it occurs in optimal environmental conditions. Queensland offers the best conditions in Australia for solar. When King looks ahead to the mid-2020s, he cannot see any reason why there will ever be another coal-fired power station built. "All new investment in generation is likely to be renewables," he said. "When you get to that point there will no longer be a subsidy. "In any market when you have to bring on new supply - you have to pay the long run marginal cost for that supply." The question of everyone's lips in the energy sector is: how does coal fired generation get retired? King says the market forces will work to force coal out because renewables do two things. "It reduces the price of energy for many hours of the day because it is must run zero marginal cost generation," he said. "When the sun is not shining, when the wind is not blowing, it needs to be firmed. It is much more expensive to use gas turbines to firm it. "The average price of energy may even go up a bit but it will mean the economics of older base-load coal plants deteriorate reasonably quickly. "There will be many more hours in the day when they will get a much lower price. So they will naturally retire generation based on the economics." The exemplar for this is South Australia, where on some days when the wind is strong and the sun is shining about 50 per cent of all generation is from renewables. In South Australia, high cost coal fired power plants are being shut down. But the flip side is that when the wind does not blow there is enormous volatility. Brett Redman, chief financial officer at AGL told the Macquarie Equities conference in Sydney last week that when the wind is blowing there is negative prices for energy. "If you want your thermal generation on in the middle of the day when demand needs it you have got to be running in the middle of the night to be ready," Redman said. "A lot of thermal generators are paying the market to be on at night in order to be ready for the middle of the day. That volatility is getting worse and worse within that state. "It's actually putting a lot of stress and strain in that market and what you are seeing is price rises. "South Australia was historically heavily dominated by gas fired generation and brown coal fired generation." Redman said the forward price curve shows prices for energy in South Australia rising to $80 a megawatt hour to $90 a megawatt hour between October this year and April next year. That compare to about $45 in NSW and $50 to $60 in Queensland and about $40 in Victoria over the same time frame. Redman says that after years of demanding politicians provide policy certainty so investments can be made over a 20 year period, the industry now needs some critical decisions to be made over the next two to three years. "When you build infrastructure, you are making a 20 year investment decision," he said. "If you got any risk in the model that you have got to carry for 20 years that goes to how you are valuing that investment. "We need to move away from that almost entire reliance on government policy to bring back to more of a balance within the market place that starts to get us back to rely more on market supply fundamentals. "We need to remove old supply, we need close old generation to make room for new generation." \</doc>

Men face drugs charges after music festival A man accused of dealing drugs including MDMA at an electronic music festival in the NSW Hunter region will face court. A police sniffer dog detected the 22-year-old man on Saturday at the four-day Subsonic music festival at Monkerai. A search uncovered a stash including 15 MDMA capsules, LSD, liquid ecstasy and cash, police said. On the same day, a 24-year-old Victorian man was stopped by a police dog and handler. Police say he had more than 7g of MDMA, cocaine, 45 LSD tablets and cannabis. Both men were granted conditional bail to appear before Raymond Terrace Local Court in January. Search for Lord Howe snorkeller winds down The search for a snorkeller missing off Lord Howe Island for a week has been scaled back, police say. ACT man Jake Barrett was reported missing by friends after he failed to return from a snorkelling trip about 20m off Middle Beach last Wednesday. Emergency services wound back their search for the 20-year-old on Monday, but police continued to comb the area on foot yesterday. Commercial fishermen and private aircraft were enlisted to scope the area, police said. Mr Barrett was reportedly holidaying on the island, 600km east of Port Macquarie. Accused attackers 'left phone with selfies' Two men have been charged following a bashing and attempted robbery in Sydney's west. A 20-year-old and his alleged accomplice reportedly left a phone behind with selfies on it when they tried to break into a car. Police say a 48-year-old man woke to noises outside his Condell Park home early yesterday morning. He confronted the pair, who were believed to be known to him, before they bashed him and fled, leaving behind items including the phone. The victim was treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken to Bankstown Hospital. One man has been charged with assault and another, aged 20, with four offences including assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others. Both men were refused bail. Woman accused of shooting at cyclists An 18-year-old woman has been charged after two youths on pushbikes were allegedly shot at from a car in Sydney's west. Witnesses reported seeing a green Holden Commodore driving through a Shalvey intersection last Thursday where shots were fired at two males riding in the area, police said. An 18-year-old woman was arrested in Guildford on Monday and charged with five offences, including carrying a firearm and driving while disqualified. Territory joins alliance to cut greenhouse gasThe ACT government has committed to a sub-national alliance for greenhouse gas reduction. Environment Minister Simon Corbell said the territory's government had committed to assist in reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030. Mr Corbell, who is representing the ACT government at the COP21 UN climate change conference in Paris, said the Paris City Hall Declaration would help to bridge the gap between national carbon reduction commitments and the accepted 2 degree emissions pathway. \</doc>

Sixty-one prominent Australians including Wallaby David Pocock, three former Australians of the Year and eminent scientists and economists have pressed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to stop any new coal mines and to put an international moratorium on coal on the agenda of the Paris climate talks. The push represents the new front in the climate change wars, with the group arguing Australia's relatively small domestic share of global greenhouse emissions obscures the vast environmental damage of burning Australian coal in places such as China and India. Backed by green and social action organisations, the 61 have signed an open letter featured in full-page advertisements in Fairfax Media newspapers, calling on the host of the December talks, French President Francois Hollande, and Mr Turnbull to oppose new coal developments - including the Carmichael mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin. The Paris climate change meeting is the largest global gathering on the environment since the Copenhagen summit in 2009, which ended in disappointment. The signatories, which include erstwhile Australians of the Year Professors Fiona Stanley, Peter Doherty and Tim Flannery as well as one time Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser, current Wallabies flanker David Pocock and Anglican churchman Bishop George Browning, have called on Mr Turnbull and other world leaders to recognise that it is not just the fossil fuels a country burns for its own energy that matters, but those dug up for export to others. "We, the undersigned, urge you to put coal exports on the agenda at the 2015 Paris COP21 climate summit and to help the world's governments negotiate a global moratorium on new coal mines and coal mine expansions, as called for by President Anote Tong of the Republic of Kiribati, and Pacific Island nations," the 61 said. The low-lying Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is one of many micronations in danger of serious damage and even inundation from rising sea levels caused by melting polar ice and increasingly turbulent global weather. "While world leaders discuss emission reduction targets, a small number of countries with large coal reserves, including Australia, are planning to massively expand their coal exports. These plans are incompatible with the world's objective of limiting global warming below dangerous levels. "Over the next 10 years Australia plans to double its coal exports. If it goes ahead, the Carmichael mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin would export more than 2 billion tonnes of coal over its lifetime. "And that's just one mine. Australia has dozens of coal projects on the drawing board." Labor leader Bill Shorten plans to travel to Kiribati next week. \</doc>

The depressed coal market will take at least another few years to recover, and the Australian industry must do more to counter the anti-coal lobby, says the World Coal Association's new chief executive, Benjamin Sporton. When asked if he was managing an industry in decline, Mr Sporton said: "No, not at all", and stressed that the fundamentals for coal still remain very strong. He said it was too difficult to tell if the coal market was bouncing along the bottom, but he was confident it would recover. "I think the market will come back and we'll be doing well, but it will take a couple of years," he said. Coal will continue to be "a very important part" of the Australian economy, and local miners were working hard to maintain their social licence to operate in Australia, for example through sustainable mining, he said on Monday. The price of thermal coal has fallen 13 per cent since January to $US56 a tonne, a fraction of the roughly $US150 it was fetching in the heady days of 2011. Metallurgical coal has crashed another 26 per cent this year to about $US80 a tonne - nowhere near the $US300 a tonne it was trading at four years ago. "I see an industry that continues to grow, perhaps not at the pace that it has done historically, but it still continues to play a really important role in the world's energy mix. The growth in demand in China for coal is slowing down but I don't see it going away any time soon." And coal will be crucial to India's growth, and growth will be big in Indonesia too, he said. "I certainly don't see an industry in decline." Mr Sporton, who became chief of the WCA in June, has been on tour in Asia in the lead-up to the COP21 sustainable business conference in Paris in November to push clean, low-emissions coal technologies. "We can't wish coal away; many countries are looking to coal to power their economies and we need to be helping them do that in the cleanest way possible," he said. The role of coal was changing, and becoming an "Asian story" he said, and Australian coal was needed to power that. "Much of demand growth in recent years, and projected going forward, is actually in Asia. I don't think that is well understood in the United States and Europe, and North America. It's easy to think coal is going away because in those places coal is playing a lesser role." "I think we need to do more to explain the fact that Australian coal is needed elsewhere in the world, that is something that the industry here is focused on doing." The Australian industry also needed to do more to explain to communities the role that coal plays. \</doc>

Business is more comfortable speaking out about the need to address climate change following the ascendancy of Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. That's according to a former Goldman Sachs Australia managing director who now helps companies make the transition to a more sustainable future. Keith Tuffley, who is the managing director of The B Team, a group of executives founded by Richard Branson in the United Kingdom, said Australia was lagging behind the world when it came to tackling global warming, but things were changing. He said the change in leadership to Mr Turnbull and HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/energy/australia-will-promote-more-renewable-energy-says-hunt-20151101-gkof9c changed messages from federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt had brought some optimism in the international community ahead of crucial climate talks in Paris next month. "I think there is more optimism following the change of leaders in Australia and Canada. It is really significant to have two prime ministers in two high-intensity economies who get it," Mr Tuffley said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review. "Companies are now relieved they are not bullied into not talking about the issue. There was a sense the previous leadership would have reacted in an adverse way if they did." Mr Tuffley said there were business opportunities for Australia in the move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy like wind and solar. "On any factual basis, Australia has been lagging, both at a government level and a corporate level," he said. "There are very few Australian companies that have made any commitments but it's starting to shift. We're a high carbon economy. We're dependant on oil, gas and particularly coal. The future is not about fossil fuels, the future is about clean energy. "There's a growing recognition there is huge economic opportunities from this necessary economic shift. Renewable energy creates more jobs than digging out coal." Mr Tuffley will speak at the Australian Climate Leadership Summit in Sydney on Thursday which is an official lead-up event to the COP21 Paris climate talks. The summit will announce that 13 Australian companies including Westpac, National Australia Bank, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Origin Energy, AGL, Brambles and Bank Australia had endorsed 40 climate commitments under the "We Mean Business" climate leadership platform. HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/energy/origin-energy-to-ditch-coal-assets-20151020-gkdwam Origin Energy has already vowed to move away from coal assets and attempt to source power from renewable energy sources. Mr Tuffley - who is also the founder of NEUW Ventures SA based in Switzerland that helps finance new businesses in the move to a low-carbon future - said it was unreasonable to close down coal mines overnight. "To use the language such as coal is good for humanity and keep pumping it out is just wrong. What we should be doing is re-investing it in other areas. In 10 years you don't want to be a high-intensity carbon economy." He also rejected criticism of subsidies for renewable energy saying they were easily outweighed by subsidies to fossil fuels which was $548 billion globally, compared to $150 billion for renewables. \</doc>

From the Antarctic to the equator, Tim Jarvis is shedding light on climate change. One hundred years ago, the sound of splitting hull timber signalled the beginning of the end for polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, 100 kilometres off the coast of Antarctica. The probably apocryphal advertisement recruiting for the expedition - "Men wanted for hazardous journey ... safe return doubtful" - aptly summed up the crew's situation, thousands of kilometres from help and with no means of communication. But Shackleton defied incredible odds to save his men, first by eking out an improbable existence on the ice for almost a year, then by the most audacious of open-boat journeys across the storm-ravaged Southern Ocean, with a handful of the strongest men in one of the ship's tiny lifeboats. After reaching a whaling station on the remote subantarctic island of South Georgia, and a treacherous climb through its mountains, he returned to rescue those left behind. Sir Edmund Hillary described it as the greatest survival journey of all time and few disagree. How he did it has been the subject of endless analysis and is the reason many of the world's leading management schools cite Shackleton as the ultimate exemplar of crisis leadership. Having recreated only the final pieces of Shackleton's epic journey in a replica of his boat, in 2013, I feel humbled in knowing the totality of what he managed to achieve and privileged to have gained insights into the leadership required to achieve it. Central to this was his innate understanding that all teams are made up of individuals and getting them to work together to the best of their ability to achieve a common goal requires communicating to each in subtly different ways. As an environmental scientist, I am struck by how relevant this key aspect of his leadership is today when applied to a big issue such as climate change. Many different stakeholders and positions all need to be brought together to pull as one, using different language, evidence and argument. And the place this needs to occur is at the United Nations climate change talks, in Paris, from November 30. COP21 is the 21st such meeting - a process that in two decades of trying has failed because of the pursuit of individual self-interest. My 25zero project involves teams climbing those mountains at the equator that still have glaciers, and broadcasting images and information about their disappearance because of climate change into the conference and to global media and the public. The project is designed to appeal to a range of stakeholders and to support the Worldwide Fund for Nature's climate change projects. If Shackleton's goal was to save his men from Antarctica, our goal now is surely to save Antarctica from man. See 25zero.com to support the expedition and WWF. Load-Date: \~October 8, 2015 \</doc>

Randall Doyle details the huge challenges facing the world as it ploughs into the volatility of the 21st century WHERE does one begin to describe and unpack recent events that are rocking the world? First, let's take a look at the collapsing prices for iron ore and oil. Both represent primary indicators concerning global economic activity. Both commodities are absolutely necessary in producing economic growth. During the boom times, both commodities are used at incredible levels to fulfil global economic demands. Australia's economy has enjoyed a decade of strong economic growth due to Asia's insatiable appetite for its natural resources. That era is coming to an abrupt end, quicker than anticipated, especially for Australia. Today, both commodities are now trading at near, or below, $40 per tonne (iron ore), and below $40 per barrel (oil). These collapsing market prices for two primary resources have not been seen in several years. As a result, the profit margins for global mining companies and oil producers, and their profit-seeking investors, have utterly vanished. And, with the global marketplace, once again, standing at the edge staring into another black and foreboding economic abyss, international financial analysts are frantically scrambling to find any good news in any commodity sector. In truth, the commodities markets, and the workers in them, are facing an absolutely brutal near future. Second, the COP21 (the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties) in Paris was an exercise in futility. In short, things are not looking good on the home front for many nations. Point of fact, there is not one world leader who has, or is going to, publicly step forward and sacrifice whatever economic growth is occurring in his/her nation for the sake of reducing carbon emissions. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, US President Barack Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the other nearly 150 world leaders who attended the global extravaganza, will never commit political suicide on the world stage for this particular issue. Why? It has been recently discovered that several nations, especially those in the developing world, are either being strategically disingenuous, or are simply lying about their domestic environmental records. For example, Australian scientist Tim Flannery wrote in his new book, Atmosphere of Hope, that China's overall use of coal during the first half of 2014 had actually dropped for the first time in the 21st century. In truth, China has recently admitted that it under-reported its use of coal - substantially. Considering its future energy needs, and its already approved government policies, these factors do not bode well for the global environment. Professor Flannery, like many global environmental and climatic reports which are being produced, based his recent book on faulty statistics provided by the Chinese Government. Professor Flannery has experienced what world economists have confronted for years. It is widely accepted, and assumed, by financial analysts that China's economic numbers have been "cooked" for years. China's true growth figures have always been always viewed with an irrefutable degree of scepticism by the West. Why should China's coal figures be viewed any differently? In an article, "Airpocalypse Now", published in Newsweek magazine last month, Bill Powell wrote that China's Government seriously understated its annual (2014-2015) use of coal by 17 per cent. The Chinese Government's statistical bureau reported this statistical error last month. Hence, during the prior 12 months, China burned an additional 600 million tonnes of coal. This additional amount represents about 70 per cent of all the coal used in the US in one year. Though China has vowed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by "around" 2030, its Government has approved the construction of another 155 coal-fired plants by 2020. Hmmmmm. Does this sound like climatic progress? Of course, not. But, here is another undeniable fact, the Chinese deeply resent the criticism directed toward them from the West, and the developed world, concerning its environmental shortcomings. In fact, as I write this article, Beijing, the nation's capital, has announced a "smog emergency". Yet, the leaders of China have called such Western-based attacks on their environmental record as "environmental imperialism". So, at the end of the COP21 event, the participants joined in a final group picture, and signed an agreement. But the Global North and the Global South will still be arguing about who should sacrifice the most. The rich nations and the poor will refuse to recognise each others' vital national interests. Now what? Third, and rather ironically, considering what I have written about so far, the US has experienced another mass-shooting. This time 14 individuals were killed during a holiday luncheon at an Environmental Health Services Department in San Bernardino, California. Though most Americans are cognisant of the fact we literally slaughter thousands of each other every year with various weapons, we remained shocked to learn that one or two individuals can literally wipe out a holiday luncheon in California, a classroom of schoolchildren in Connecticut, or unarmed teenagers in South Chicago. Thus, in closing, I want to share with my readers in Tasmania, and, perhaps, even those on the Australian mainland, about a story that I came across this week that was truly disturbing and more than a bit unnerving - even by American standards. The article was published in Z Magazine, written by Eric Rodriguez, a Trustee Emeritus of Brown University and a Term Member at the Council on Foreign Relations. Rodriguez decided to call on a longtime friend in the old neighbourhood that he grew up in Los Angeles, California. He asked his old friend about getting a "piece." The former Ivy League Trustee explained that he wanted to show US politicians how simple it is to buy an assault weapon in America. Rodriguez asked his friend how long would it take to get a AK-47 or an AR-15? Though Rodriguez's friend was somewhat taken aback by this unexpected request, nevertheless, he told the former professor that he needed to make a few phone calls. Incredibly, the answer to Rodriguez's initial question was two hours. Rodriguez did not want to buy the guns, he just wanted to know their availability, and accessibility, on the black market. Rodriguez got his answer. So the next time you hear about another slaughter in America remember Eric Rodriguez's spontaneous experiment. In truth, I cannot provide a better example, or story, that explains the incomprehensible insanity that continues to exist and haunt US society in the 21st century. Based in the US, Dr Randall Doyle will be teaching at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, in 2016. A regular visitor to Tasmania, he is researching a book on Australia's new geopolitical importance in the 21st century. \</doc>

If the Paris climate talks fail, investors should prepare their portfolio for a doomsday scenario of significant sea rises and extreme weather events, says the global head of responsible investment at Mercer which advises clients with $7 trillion in funds. Mercer's Paris-based Jane Ambachtsheer, who will be in the thick of the climate talks which began on Monday, said institutional investors are mapping climate risk and doomsday scenarios, such as the impact of a 4 degree-plus rise in global temperatures by 2050. "Paris will be a key indicator of the speed of the transition [to global climate change policies] ... but the truth is this COP21 , it's the 21st year that governments have met on this issue, so it has proved a challenging issue," Ms Ambachtsheer told The Australian Financial Review from the ASFA superannuation conference in Brisbane, before returning to Paris for the talks. "As much as I hope we see a really strong commitment towards this economic transition, we also do counsel investors to make sure they think about the worst-case scenario. "It's not crystal clear that we will see the economic transition we need to stay within 2 degrees, so we also think it is important for investors to think about their exposure under the higher warming scenario and optimise around that. Think about what steps they can take to reduce their risk, if we do see more physical damage [to the planet]," Ms Ambachtsheer said. The Mercer executive said institutional investors were increasingly using tools relied on by the insurance sector, such as plotting their real assets on a world map. "We are looking at investors with exposure to real assets, infrastructure, timber, agriculture, real estate, actually putting their assets on a map of the world and analysing their vulnerability and exposure to things like a rise in sea water." Mercer's report, Investing in a Time of Climate Change, examined rises of 2, 3 or 4 degrees in temperature above pre-industrial global temperatures by 2050. It found energy and utilities were most impacted with average annual returns in the coal sub-sector falling by between 18 and 74 per cent over the next 35 years. "We expect, UK, Australian and Canadian equities to be more sensitive to climate risk, given the higher exposure of these regional equity markets to carbon-intensive sectors," the report said. "Australian equities [will be] more sensitive to a climate change policy shock, given the greater level of policy uncertainty in this market and the historical lack of support from the Australian government." Ms Ambachtsheer said while there were big risks there were also enormous opportunities such as a projected increase in returns for renewables of between 6 to 54 per cent, even for passive investors. "On the passive side there are also a number of low-carbon indices which track a broad market index with a significantly reduced carbon footprint." \</doc>

ON the last day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (called COP21 Getting this many countries to agree was in itself a huge achievement, given their different industries, socioeconomic levels and cultural influences. The attempt to reach an agreement for countries to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions has been going on since COP1 in 1995, 20 years ago. The world had come near to agreement on several occasions before; COP3 in 1997 gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol, which Australia signed in 1998 but did not ratify until 2007. As early as 1990, the Australian federal government under Bob Hawke estimated a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2005. In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher was stating the same intention and targets at the same time. The United Nations has been talking about the dangers of warming our planet with greenhouse gases since 1988 and scientists for years earlier. These words were printed in the Sydney Morning Herald in mid-1998: 'Scientists have warned about the 'greenhouse effect' for years. Now it is no longer a scientific nightmare; it has arrived.' Things were looking good at this point. Governments were knowledgeable on the issue, the media was reporting the facts, scientists were being heard and targets were being discussed. So what happened? Since 1990, the science hasn't become any less clear on climate change. The UN, through its International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, has consistently forecast the same impacts from a warming planet, only with more certainty. The predicted increase in ferocity of bushfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, hurricanes, typhoons and other events have all come to pass. Yet since 1990, annual global greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels has gone up 60 per cent and, all the while, consecutive attempts to get countries to agree on clear targets have failed. At the same time, media coverage has become less clear as fossil fuel industries have exerted their influence in both media coverage and on government policy. Why then, has the Paris COP21 conference managed to commit all countries to keeping warming well below 2 degrees, with the ultimate goal of staying below 1.5 degrees and to being continually monitored as to their success in ramping up their reduction targets? Perhaps the incredible scale of the plight of Syrian refugees gave the world an idea of what the predicted 50 million climate refugees by 2050 would look like (some say it will be as high as 200 million at today's emissions rates). Perhaps the 785,000 people in 175 countries hitting the streets for People's Climate March events managed to create enough pressure to counter that of the fossil fuel lobby. Whatever the reason, we can celebrate today but now the real effort starts. The pledged emissions reductions of all countries at COP21 deliver half of what is needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees. To get there, most fossil fuels will need to remain in the ground and countries will need to rapidly transition to renewable energy sources. Load-Date: \~December 21, 2015 \</doc>

Sydney's office towers are cutting carbon emissions by using more efficient lighting, heating and cooling. Their tenants' tablets and mobile devices are slashing power usage too. A city-led program covering 92 commercial buildings has already met half of the emissions reduction target that it set as its 2030 goal, lord mayor Clover Moore said. Under the Better Buildings Partnership (BBP), modelled on a British program, the buildings that make up just over half the CBD's commercial office space have pledged to cut their carbon dioxide emissions 70 per cent from the 2006 level of 318,079 tonnes. Office towers in the partnership, which include 255 George St, One Shelley St, One Bligh St and One Darling Island Road in Pyrmont, had by the end of June cut their collective emissions 45 per cent. That was an increase of 10 percentage points on the 35 per cent reduction achieved by June last year and equated to a combined saving of $30 million a year, Ms Moore said. "Sydney's biggest landlords have shown it makes financial sense to cut emissions," said Ms Moore, attending the COP21 Paris Climate Change conference. "The Better Buildings Partnership's ongoing success is a model for how much progress can be made when government and the private sector work together on sensible, effective climate policies." Buildings account for about 77 per cent of emissions by the City of Sydney, which itself makes up about 3 per cent of total NSW emissions. For the first time, however, the emissions cut includes the reductions that have come from sourcing green power or other carbon offsets. Between three and four percentage points of the total resulted from these measures rather than the direct improvement of the buildings' emission performances, said Paul Edwards, BBP chairman and head of sustainability for developer Mirvac. "It is a recognition that to get to a 70 per cent reduction in the future, there may be a need for us to include green power and carbon offsets, so we stated that from a transparency perspective," Mr Edwards said. In 2004, when Lendlease's groundbreaking sustainable 30 The Bond building was built, the replacement of desktop cathode-ray tube computer screens with flat screens was cutting the average "small power" consumption of office tenants to 22 watts a square metre, according to Che Wall, the sustainability engineer who consulted on the building and a co-founder of the Green Building Council of Australia. Since then, the replacement of PCs by laptops and increasingly to iPads and smartphones has cut that figure to 12 watts a square metre, Mr Wall said on Wednesday. "That's almost half of what The Bond was in just 10 years," he said. Mr Edwards said the BBP's emission cuts and lower power usage didn't include tenants' plug-in power consumption, but it indirectly benefited through measures like reduced airconditioning. \</doc>

SIX years ago a Labor leader told the Lowy Institute in Sydney that those who opposed immediate, global action on climate change were forcing the world to "take the single most reckless bet in our long history". Kevin Rudd, who just five months after he said those words dumped what he'd said was "the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our times", went off to the Copenhagen United Nations-sponsored climate talks a month later, having lost his first bet on the policy by failing to get Labor's emissions trading scheme through Parliament. On Friday, Bill Shorten, the current Labor chief, was in the lecture hall at Lowy, again talking about climate change and promising to outbid Malcolm Turnbull on carbon-emissions reduction action. Shorten says Labor would aim at an emissions-reduction target of 45 per cent - which is nominally much higher than the Coalition goal of a 26 to 28 per cent cut - within 15 years. When Turnbull meets with global leaders at the 21st annual UN climate conference ( COP21 ) in Paris next week, two things will happen. The action plans for reducing emissions, required by all governments, will be accepted and reviewed, and discussion will then move to what comes next. The Paris talks will not agree to any mandated action, rather endorsing what will be a range of targets and plans - such as a floating trading scheme or one with a set floor price, as well as mixed measures of regulation and incentives. Australia's direct action plan - which Turnbull dismissed as useless when it was announced by Tony Abbott but now has to live with as a price of getting the top job - sits at the "lower-action, greater-expense" end of the spectrum of policies, even though it has had one successful round of implementation and looks like having a second. Paris might dissolve in disarray and argument because of the great dilemma at the centre of climate policy. The push for action - and most of the progress that's being achieved - comes from the rich, developed nations who have prospered after 150 years, benefiting from everything that flowed from the invention of the steam and internal-combustion engines. Developing nations want some concessions in drawing up emissions-reduction plans, and there's an argument about how to establish and spend the planned $US100 billion-a-year ($138.43 billion) fund to help poorer countries adopt new policies and adapt to a hotter world. In its pre-Paris edition, The Economist said the best way to design and implement climate action is to have both ambition and realism - accepting the rigid ideas that caused Copenhagen to fail aren't going to cut it now, and there is a need for significant investment in new technologies and processes, clearer thinking on adaption (living with higher temperatures) and short-term responses such as artificial cooling. "In short: thinking caps should replace hair shirts, and pragmatism should replace green theology," says The Economist.

I had to ask David Attenborough how he felt about the title of 'national treasure' - actually it should be international treasure - with which he is habitually labelled. "What does 'national treasure' mean?" he replies, with a twinkle in his eye. "Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't! "It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium." A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter. "It's a national scandal." They say you should never meet your heroes, but I'm delighted to have met this one. In person, Attenborough is exactly the way you'd hope he would be: charismatic, compelling and charming. Eruptions of jollity such as the one above punctuate our hour together. At one point, he reflects on the fact that both he and the Queen are 90 this year. "Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No." Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator. As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger. Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being - apart from astronauts - and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning. What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered. Attenborough observes that: "I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where, after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf." By contrast, he continues, "I'm fantastically lucky. I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things." Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations. That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world. "Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'. "But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. "Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of pufferfish and peacock spiders prove. There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out." The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain. "Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied - quite beyond our comprehension. "But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did. "That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it." He adds that, "These programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year. "It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do. "I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand." Attenborough has long since passed the age when most of us would be reaching for the pipe and slippers. However, as he prepares to make more documentaries, including Planet Earth 2, he shudders at the very word 'retirement'."You never tire of the natural world. Putting your feet up is all very well..." casting me one last smile, Attenborough concludes: "but it's very boring, isn't it?" \</doc>

CITIES will need to adopt road-use pricing to effectively manage their traffic and transport, a global leader in technology said in Adelaide yesterday. Dr Roland Busch, a member of multinational company Siemens AG's managing board, said technological advances such as infrastructure which can communicate with vehicles would enable more sophisticated answers to urban issues. Lots of cities around the world wanted to be known as "smart cities", he told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia lunch - but there was no widely accepted definition of what a smart city was. "My interpretation of a smart city is a liveable, sustainable, growing city," he said. It was not just about technology but rather making the city attractive as a place where the best talent wanted to live. Key considerations included how people and goods moved around the city, how to provide energy in a sustainable, low-emission way, how to provide water and deal with waste, and how to ensure safety and security. Dr Busch identified several drivers of economic change including globalisation, ageing population in industrialised countries and climate change. "Heading for COP 21 in Paris (the UN summit), we see that about 2.5C of climate change is already embedded in our system even if we deploy all the technologies we have at hand - that's unavoidable," he said. "The trick now really ought to be how to limit it to that level because if we won't act now dramatically, our globe might warm up five or even six degrees and that would cause a lot of disasters."Earlier yesterday, Dr Busch visited Siemens' newly opened facility at Tonsley and was impressed with the work as well as the progress of the precinct. \</doc>

A commitment to report climate change information as a fiduciary duty, an agreement to ensure responsible corporate engagement in climate policy and a commitment to put a price on carbon are the latest climate policy endorsements by AGL, in a year that has placed climate change on the agenda at the 170-year-old utility. While AGL's decision to put a price on carbon was first made in their revised Greenhouse Gas Policy in April this year, Friday's commitment places additional requirements on AGL to publicly report back on how the internal price on carbon has impacted decision-making on investments and expenditure. The commitments make up three of seven climate leadership commitments devised by non-government organisation and environmental reporting platform CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the We Mean Business Coalition. "Companies today play a very significant role in the broader society and economy and they are responsible for a large proportion of the world's carbon emissions," said James Day, Australia and New Zealand director of CDP. "So commitments by them to reduce emissions can really help to drive strong action on climate change and also support what national governments are doing and committing to at international negotiations like Paris." CDP, along with other data providers, will feed information collected via the commitments through to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be showcased in Paris. Mr Day said while AGL had been reporting to CDP on its energy use for around a decade, their recent commitments are symbolic of the company's strong shift towards decentralised and renewable energy. "It is very welcome news," he said. "We hope that they will continue to move on that low-carbon journey." Andrew Vesey was announced as AGL's chief executive in November last year and, since his instalment, he has undertaken a radical shake-up of the organisation, including implementing a company policy for total decarbonisation of its electricity generation by 2050. "As Australia's largest CO2 emitter, AGL Energy Limited (AGL) understands we have a key role to play in helping to provide an orderly transformation to a carbon constrained future," he said. AGL's announcement comes before the Australian Climate Leadership Summit on November 5, a CDP initiative that will bring together major Australian businesses and investors with selected representatives from government and non-government organisations to announce significant climate commitments. The summit is the only event in Australia that has been labelled as an official lead-in event to COP21 "It will be connecting business with state and local governments that are actively creating conditions for a low carbon economy ??? [targeting] what types of action we should be taking and helping to consolidate a bipartisan approach to climate change," Mr Day said. \</doc>

Kiribati, one of the Pacific's lowest lying island nations, has urged Australia and New Zealand to show they are 'real friends" by supporting strong action on climate change at a regional summit. Kiribati president Anote Tong made the call at the Pacific Islands Forum - which started in Port Moresby on Monday - where Pacific nations have gathered to form a united position to take to the Paris COP21 meeting in December. "What we are talking about is survival, it's not about economic development... it's not politics, it's survival," Mr Tong said. Mr Tong said Australia and New Zealand should use their relative regional power to advocate for smaller countries. "I think they need to come to the party, if they really are our friends then they should be looking after our future as well," he said. Kiribati, with its population of 110,000 spread across 33 low-lying islands, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Last year, the Kiribati government purchased 20 square kilometres of land in Fiji as a back-up plan for food security and possibly even relocation of its citizens. The week-long Pacific Islands Forum kicked off with a meeting of a bloc of seven small island states - Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tuvalu. The Pacific Islands Forum's secretary general Dame Meg Taylor HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-08/climate-change-a-leading-issue-at-game-changing/6756786 told the ABC's The World program "They are members of the Pacific Islands Forum, but they are also developed economies [so] issues for them are different to those in the rest of the Pacific," she said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott will travel to Port Moresby on Wednesday and will take part in the main Pacific Islands Forum leaders retreat on Thursday. HYPERLINK /news/2015-08-23/pacific-leaders-repeat-climate-warnings/6717878 A climate change declaration in Suva last week - at a rival regional forum that does not include Australia and New Zealand - signalled what Pacific countries would likely bring to the negotiating table. The Suva declaration included a call to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, saying the current goal of 2 degrees above the pre-industrial level would push many beyond their ability to adapt. Oxfam Australia said there has been frustration amongst some Pacific island nations that Australia and New Zealand haven't taken a stronger position on climate change in the past. "The two big brothers of the Pacific have largely ignored their neighbours' calls for stronger emissions reduction targets and greater support to meet the challenges of climate change," said Dr Helen Szoke, Oxfam Australia's chief executive. "The question remains whether Australia will do the right thing by the Pacific and ensure the leaders meeting sends the strongest possible signal ahead of Paris, or whether together with New Zealand, it will use its influence in the Forum to weaken any outcomes," Dr Szoke said. The Pacific Island Forum will also discuss alleged human rights abuses in the West Papua and Papua provinces of Indonesia, fisheries, information and communication technology and cervical cancer. \</doc>

The French government is increasing pressure on Australian federal and state governments to act more aggressively to tackle climate change as it seeks to galvanise support for critical talks in Paris in December aimed at agreeing on a legally binding agreement to limit carbon dioxide emissions. In a speech in Sydney on Monday evening, France's ambassador to Australia Christophe Lecourtier also urged businesses to do their part to help solve the problem, pointing to pledges made in May by some of the world's biggest energy companies to reduce their carbon footprint. "Everybody knows that the private sector must - and will - play a major role to ensure a true transition to a low-carbon economy, by heavily investing in new technologies," Mr Lecourtier said in an address to a forum hosted by the Alliance Francaise. French policymakers have been critical of what is seen as a lack of commitment by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to addressing climate change. Australia is expected to announce its post-2020 targets for emissions reductions in the next few weeks, amid little international confidence it will commit to ambitious cuts. But Mr Lecourtier said France would "spare no effort" to drum up support for an international commitment at the Paris talks to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. "We urgently need to gain more political momentum in the coming weeks," he said. "This has to come from political leaders all over the world, at the highest possible level. But also by involving, as it is the case today, every stakeholder that shares the view that our generation must act in a fully responsible way before the bell tolls." Already too late Scientist, conservationist and former Australian of the year Tim Flannery, who is also speaking at the forum in Sydney, said he believed it was already too late to avoid an average temperature increase of 2 degrees within the next two or three decades. Such warming would cause severe harm to the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu wetlands and to southern alpine environments, as well as having extensive impacts on agriculture and water availability. Professor Flannery said one of Australia's key problems was its reluctance to tackle the use of fossil fuel. He called for recognition that biological sequestration of carbon and carbon capture and storage would be useless without measures to reduce the burning of coal. The potential Paris alliance targeted in December by the French government would incorporate national contributions on emissions reductions by all 196 countries and a financial commitment to provide $US100 billion ($128 billion) to developing countries by 2020 to boost investment in carbon-free technology, Mr Lecourtier said. After the recent G7 commitment to reach carbon-neutral fossil fuel use by the end of the century, the next step would be at the United Nations level, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and French President Francois Hollande to hold a meeting of leaders on September 27-28 in New York, Mr Lecourtier said. France was considering inviting heads of state for the first day of the COP21 climate talks in Paris "to give as much political momentum as possible to the conference", he said. Mr Abbott will be in the region for the G20 and for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in late November but it is not known if he intends to attend the Paris climate talks. \</doc>

French photographer Marc Dozier has captured a stunning series of portraits featuring Papua New Guinean Huli chief Mundiya Kepanga in some of America's biggest cities. Mr Dozier first met Mr Kepanga 15 years ago when the photographer was travelling in PNG, and the chief was his guide. The two stayed in close contact and in 2014, they were together when Mr Kepanga travelled to the US as part of a PNG tourism promotion. "We were just like tourists. But of course Mundiya is not like normal tourists because he's different, he comes from a tribal society. So he had a special look on things," Mr Dozier told Pacific Beat. They made the spontaneous decision to stay on in the US for another three months to document the chief's travels. "Mundiya and I looked at each other and we said, 'wow, we are in New York. It's crazy, we should stay in America... we should travel around and we should take pictures'," he said. The Huli people are an indigenous tribe who live in the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea. They are known for their striking traditional dress, known as bilas, featuring painted faces, huge wigs and woven clothing. "I would be worried first of the reaction the American people, if they would make fun of him or have silly comments," Mr Dozier said. "But it was totally different, when Mundiya would put on his body decoration, his bilas, everyone would come to see him and ask him questions and be very curious. Say, 'where are you from and can I take pictures of you?'" The pair travelled across the states, talking to people about Papua New Guinea and seeing America's biggest attractions. "America is like nowhere else. It's not at all like PNG, Australia or France. America is high level and everything is big, super sized," Mr Kepanga said. "I went around and I would tell stories about PNG, about my community," Mr Kepanga said. In Arizona, Mr Kepanga met members of the Navajo tribe. "They had a big festival there and they invited Mundiya to join them," Mr Dozier said. "He was very happy to wear his feathers and the Navajo people were very proud, so we danced together and it was a really strong relationship, it was really powerful." Mr Dozier HYPERLINK http://www.ulule.com/tribu-des-americains/ plans to turn the photographs into a book documenting the three-month journey. "This book is not about Papua New Guinea itself. It's more about ourselves," he said. "Because it shows that we can see western culture from another point of view. And Mundiya is very clever and very funny. He sees the western world from another perspective and it gives us the opportunity to think about it and change our own point of view." Mr Kepanga has travelled the world to share stories from Papua New Guinea, including a speech at the COP21 climate conference in Paris. "What seems to be very interesting for me, with the work we are doing with Mundiya, is he is giving us the chance to correct the point of view that we have, realise that maybe our point of view is not the only one," Mr Dozier said. "We can learn many things from other people, especially people from Papua New Guinea." \</doc>

While some farmers are sceptical about human-induced climate change, one woman in agriculture says Australia needs to listen to the concerns of farmers and remote communities who say they're already being affected. Professor Daniela Stehlik is a member and former board member of Australian Women in Agriculture (AWiA). She is their representative on a self-funded trip to Paris during the COP21 climate summit. Attending talks with other women in agriculture on the sidelines of the government negotiations, Professor Stehlik said agricultural women had sent a clear message. "Listening to the women from the Maldives and from Ecuador, from Canada and North Dakota [in the United States], it's affecting them right now," Professor Stehlik said. "For them, the discussion about whether it is or it isn't [affecting them] is moot. It's kind of like, well ... just get on with it. "What I'd be saying to people is, let's not always just look at our own backyard. "Let's see what's happening around the world, let's hear from other people about how they believe it's impacting them, and then let's think about how what we're doing can make a difference." The talks have provided practical examples of what communities in developed countries like Australia can do, and are already doing, Professor Stehlik said. Parisians undertake to meet renewable energy target She noted that a semi-rural Parisian suburb had joined 1,200 similar communities around Europe in aiming to ensure 20 per cent of their energy came from renewable sources. "For many of us, the actual climate change experience is something that's so big, and so global, and we just don't know how to deal with it locally so we might just say, 'oh well, I'll leave it to the government'," Professor Stehlik said. "These are individuals who are saying, 'no we can actually do something', so people feel that they are taking control in some way that it isn't beyond their scope." But it was farming women from developing countries who made the most passionate arguments in favour of action, Professor Stehlik said. "There, communities are already at the frontline," she said. Indigenous and remote communities miss out in discussion "One woman represented the people who live in Arctic Europe - north of Norway, north of Sweden, north of Finland and north of Russia. "She was saying that even now, their reindeer herds are becoming smaller, their access to fish is changing. "Increasingly, she was arguing, these remoter communities, these Indigenous communities, are being talked to, rather than being part of, the discussion." Another woman from the Maldives told the gathering that her community of small, low-lying islands off the coast of India, had now lost all their fresh water. "The salt water incursion into the Maldives is such that they have to process all their water to get rid of the salt, and their beach incursion is high," Professor Stehlik said. "She was extremely passionate in saying, 'How much more do we need to know? Why can't we act now?'. "So the developed world sits back and argues about language, but the developing world is actually experiencing it." \</doc>

Too late for Saudi Arabia to give up its oil addiction By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in London COMMENT Saudi Arabia has launched a radical shake-up to avert economic crisis and prepare the kingdom for the post-carbon world, stunning analysts with claims that it could break reliance on oil within just four years. Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler, vowed to build a $US3 trillion ($A3.9 trillion) wealth fund and break onto the world stage as an investment superpower, the spearhead of an historic package of measures intended to bring the deformed economy kicking and screaming into the 21st century. "We have an addiction to oil. This is dangerous. I think that by 2020 we can live without it," he told Al Arabiya television. It is an extraordinary claim for a government that has historically relied on oil exports for 90 per cent of its income and has yet to achieve much success in building alternative industries. Gulf veterans say his words should be understood as poetic licence. Prince Mohammad, a 31 year-old tornado determined to smash the status quo, has amassed immense power over the economy and defence that belies his title as deputy crown prince, filling the cabinet with modern technocrats and startling his sinecure cousins from the Al Saud family with the unfamiliar prospect of hard work. The plan, known as "Vision 2030", aims to slash $80billion of wasteful spending each year and impose some degree of order on the kingdom's chaotic finances with a consumption tax and fresh levies. The reform blueprint is inspired by a McKinsey study - Beyond Oil - that laid out how the country can double GDP over the next 15 years and reinvent itself with $4 trillion of investment across eight industries - electrical manufacturing, cars, healthcare, metals, steel, aluminium smelting, solar power and tourism. "I don't think they can pull this off," said Patrick Dennis from Oxford Economics. "The riyal peg is grossly overvalued and that makes it even harder. We think market pressures will become overwhelming if there is little evidence of real reform by 2018." Under the plan, Riyadh will sell up to 5 per cent of the state oil giant Aramco to global investors, and convert the secretive behemoth into a modern holding company with transparent accounts. The aim is to transfer the proceeds into the country's sovereign wealth fund, using the money to diversify into global investments. It is unclear how this Saudi fund can plausibly reach $3 trillion unless oil rises back above $100 a barrel, and stays there for a long time. The country is currently depleting its foreign exchange reserves by $10bn a month to cover a budget deficit still near 15pc of GDP, drawing down its overseas wealth to fund its military build-up, a war in Yemen, life-support for Egypt and paying state salaries. The Saudis may have left it too late already to break oil dependency in time, especially as renewable technology reaches parity and the COP21 climate accords signal a move to worldwide carbon pricing.. The parlous state of Saudi finances was made clear in a Bloomberg interview when the prince's economic guru, Mohammed al-Sheikh, said the country would have gone "completely broke" by early 2017 without drastic austerity measures. This was screened from the world last year. The question is if it is really any better now. Telegraph, London \</doc>

Looking out to 2030, the Australian Power Generation Technology study will cost commercially available and fast emerging technologies used for power including their emissions intensity, technical efficiencies, and water use. CO2CRC CEO, Tania Constable, said "The diverse organisations participating in this study underpin how valuable it will be to their common goal of lowering emissions. Governments and power professionals need current and high quality data on power generation technologies in order to make informed decisions about the changing energy sector." CSIRO's Executive Director, Energy and Resources, Dr Alex Wonhas, said "This report will compare a broad range of fossil and renewable energy technologies on a like for like basis on important dimensions such as costs and CO2 emissions - the value of this report will be its credibility, independence and transparency." The Climate Institute's Deputy CEO, Erwin Jackson, added "For Australia to make the most of technologies that modernise and decarbonise the electricity sector, we need to understand how they are developing, as worldwide efforts to reduce carbon emissions strengthen. This research is an important element of that understanding." The study is being led by a steering committee comprising low emissions research organisation, CO2CRC, CSIRO, Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Australian Government's Office of the Chief Economist at the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, and Australian National Low Emissions Coal Research & Development (ANLEC R&D). The study is being undertaken by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Worley Parsons in Australia and Ernst and Young, and peer reviewed by the Australian Government Bureau of Resource Research Economics. EPRI is a global independent non-profit organisation which specialises in research into the generation, delivery and use of electricity. The study data and report will be published in November 2015, in advance of COP21 and will be an important base data set for energy technologies in Australia. The report will be made public and given to governments across Australia. It will be technology neutral and not designed to comment on policy options.

ABSTRACT Could Turnbull-haters revive the Nats? How to get away with (political) murder. It was either a historic agreement or a massive failure: making sense of COP 21 . One of the biggest myths about coal debunked. Andrew Bolt's unusual replacement. The Lake Solution, and other bizarre findings from the Hazelwood mine fire inquiry. And the nominees are ... voting is now open in the 2015 Crikey awards. In retrospect, the decision by the Turnbull government to issue a normal Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook rather than use the opportunity of a political reset and a new Treasurer to undertake a mini-budget looks increasingly flawed. Tomorrow's MYEFO will show a significant revenue write-down from lower iron ore prices, lower wages growth and lower economic growth projections. Even putting aside Scott Morrison's weird fiscal denialism in his repeated assertions that Australia "doesn't have a revenue problem", there is also the challenge of spending. Morrison has made much of the need to get spending from 26.2% of GDP, the level it reached under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, back to the budget forecast for this year of 25.9%. Hockey took a deliberate decision to continue to pump tens of billions of deficit spending into the economy in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets, and was correct to do so given the tepid economy and unemployment above 6%. But 25.3% of GDP - where spending will still be at in 2018-19 - is too high given an improving economy. Morrison should be aiming for something closer to the 24.1% of GDP Wayne Swan managed in 2012-13. Regardless of how the tax reform debate plays out and whether Morrison ever snaps out of his "there's no revenue problem" delusion, the path to surplus lies in a more rapid reduction in spending than the current lazy plan put forward by the government. And the first step on that path should have been tomorrow's MYEFO. \</doc>

World on cusp of historic climate deal GLOBAL warming would be tackled and emissions curbed under a landmark global deal announced at the Paris climate conference last night. The 195-nation accord, revealed to a standing ovation and cheers at the COP 21 in the French capital, would commit countries to develop key policies to cut heat-trapping gases that threaten to wreak havoc on Earth's climate system. The draft plan, announced by French Foreign Minister and conference chairman Laurent Fabius, would aim to keep the rise in global temperatures "well below" 2C. Industrial countries would also "endeavour to limit" temperatures even further, to 1.5C, in a key demand of small island nations and other poor and vulnerable countries. The deal would also mean mobilising a minimum $100 billion a year from 2020 to help the developing world cope with global warming. The ambitious draft accord also sets five-year reviews of plans for curbing carbon emissions. Observers said that as the draft document had yet to be unveiled, it was not immediately clear if financing would be a legal commitment, which the US had been resisting. In a live television address to delegates, Mr Fabius, flanked by French President Fran\'c3\£7ois Hollande and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said the "final" draft would be legally binding. Last night countries involved in the marathon negotiations over the past fortnight were analysing the 27-page document, ready for sign off, although officials did not expect much change. Mr Fabius, his voice occasionally breaking with emotion, described the accord "sustainable, dynamic, balanced and legally binding". "The world is holding its breath and counting on all of us," he said. "Maybe the planets were not aligned but today they are." Mr Hollande said that "history is coming - in fact, history is here".FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENTSAT ADVERTISER.COM.AU \</doc>

TAX BENEFIT THE State Government will introduce a further Family Tax Benefit bill to Parliament this week to increase fortnightly payments, encourage workforce participation and fund the child care reforms in the Jobs for Families package. Education and Training Minister Simon Birmingham announced adjustments to the Jobs for Families package that will target childcare to those most in need. Changes will also allow the to better assist single-parents and grandparent carers through family tax benefits. LIVING LONGER A COMMON treatment for diabetes could enable adults to live well into their 120s, scientists say. They will carry out the first trials on metformin next year in the hope it may stave off illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Researchers have already conducted tests on animals that show it significantly extends their lives. Now the US Food and Drug Administration has given the go-ahead for the same trials in humans. OPEN FOR BUSINESS THE Palaszczuk Government has vowed it is open for business and willing to "back in" investors as it works to find a solution to stop green groups tying up multibillion-dollar mining projects. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and her ministers made their pitch to more than 200 investors at the Northern Queensland Economic Summit in Cairns last month. NO BACKING DOWN KAP MPs have vowed they will not back down against the Labor Government's proposed changes to vegetation management. Dalrymple MP Shane Knuth and Mt Isa MP Rob Katter say they will continue to stand for the rights of landowners. Mr Knuth said he was shocked and outraged to hear the State Government doesn't understand the need for a productive agricultural industry.

As the human population climbs beyond 7 billion and the desire for first world affluence spreads across the globe, the demand for oil has never been higher. Our thirst for crude oil is pushing civilisation simultaneously towards two perilous futures. In one, the flood of cheap energy we've taken for granted will dry up faster than our economies can adapt. In the other, our headlong rush to use the last of the resource has us on track to plunge the world into an unpredictable climate catastrophe. On the face of it, you might expect that running out of oil might at least save us from the climate threat. But as this clip from the 2007 ABC documentary " HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/science/crude/ Crude - the incredible journey of oil " explains, there is more than enough carbon in the oil still underground to raise the temperature of the planet well beyond the 2 degrees Celsius considered "safe" by the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ipcc.ch/ IPCC , and that's before we begin to count the carbon embodied in the world's natural gas reserves; let alone coal, the most abundant and dirtiest fossil fuel of all. We can easily "cook" our planet many times over. By 2040 the world's population is projected to reach 9 billion, with the demand for all forms of energy increasing by one third. The latest HYPERLINK World Energy Outlook COP 21 climate summit still imply a long-term temperature increase of 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100.

If you are feeling a sense of d\'e9j\'e0 vu about the forthcoming climate conference in Paris, it's because this is the 21st time nations of the world have met to seek agreement on how to stabilise the atmosphere and prevent dangerous climate change. The possibility that rising levels of carbon dioxide could alter the Earth's temperature balance has been known for more than a century, but it wasn't until 1987 and the release of a major United Nations report on sustainable development, " HYPERLINK http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf Our Common Future ", that global warming was identified as one of the most serious challenges facing humanity. This explainer on CO2 and the greenhouse effect was produced by ABC TV's Quantum program the following year. It's interesting to watch it again today, because even then, people had begun to suspect that something unusual was happening to the world's climate. Some of the questions posed in the story still seem very familiar. How much of the changes to the climate are due to natural variation and how much are to do with human activities? In 1992, an international treaty was drawn up with the goal to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous effects on the world's climate systems. The 196 parties who signed it have since met regularly to assess progress. The 2015 Conference of the Parties ( COP 21 ) in Paris will run from November 30 to December 11. The goal now is not to prevent global warming, but to limit it to less than 2 degrees Celsius. According to the http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/Outlook%20to%202050_Climate%20Change%20Chapter_HIGLIGHTS-FINA-8pager-UPDATED%20NOV2012.pdf OECD , in order to have a 50 per cent probability of reaching that goal, CO2 levels need to be limited to no more than 450 parts per million. When this video explainer was made 26 years ago, CO2 levels were 351 parts per million. Today the level is just over 400 parts per million. \</doc>

According to the director of the Energy Initiative at the University of Queensland, developing countries are looking at nuclear energy to provide base load power, while keeping carbon dioxide emissions down. Professor Chris Greig describes nuclear as a zero emissions power source that, despite being supplied by fossil fuels, is part of the renewable energy commitment some countries have made. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA) there are 437 nuclear reactor power plants across 31 countries, currently producing around 11 per cent of global electricity. Many of these are in already developed countries such as France, which produces 75 per cent of all its electricity from nuclear. The WNA said countries like Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland and Ukraine were producing an average of 30 per cent of their electricity needs from nuclear sources. But Professor Greig said planned and under-construction nuclear plants were increasing in developing countries. "Not many new plants are being built in the first world so much, but it's in the developing countries where we're seeing quite a lot of activity," he said. "If you look at somewhere like China, they have 17 or so [nuclear reactors] that are currently operational, 28 reactors are currently under construction, and around about 55 are planned to be implemented. "India has numbers around half that. They have 20 operational reactors now and there's probably another 25 or so that are under construction or planned. "Also Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, all of these sort of countries have nuclear reactors planned." Nuclear energy not a focus of Paris climate talks Professor Greig said it was surprising that nuclear energy did not receive much attention or subsequent media coverage at he recent climate talks in Paris ( COP21 ). "I mean, it's very low carbon, near zero, just as the renewable energy sources are. "And it is a base load, always available, electricity source, so in that sense you would think there was a lot of merit in it being a serious option." Base load power is defined as the minimum amount of electricity delivered, or required, over a period at a constant rate into a power grid. Traditionally fossil fuel sources like coal, gas, hydropower and nuclear power have been considered as the only way to provide base load power at affordable prices. Base load power has been considered necessary to provide energy, even in systems that have renewable energy sources, to ride out the intermittent peaks and troughs created by lack of wind and sunshine. However, that is being contested by some in the renewable energy sector, who believe renewables can provide base load power, HYPERLINK as argued using a computer model Retired US scientist Dr David Mills has produced a paper saying base load energy is ' HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/12/02/3081889.htm no longer a relevant prerequisite for modern power generating systems ' but can be achieved with a mix of renewables and fuels like nuclear and gas. Rise of battery power for renewable energy storage In recent times, batteries for storage of renewable energy have been developed, such as those by Tesla, which generated much talk at COP21 of developing countries "leapfrogging" directly to renewable power sources. Professor Greig supports the use of batteries in certain circumstances and for specific requirements. However, he does not believe battery storage technology has been developed enough, or is affordable enough, for developing countries to dismiss fossil fuels. "I think [the ability of] battery storage is a little overhyped, although it certainly has a role to play," Professor Greig said. "I think it will be a strong niche in the residential sector, and perhaps the commercial sector, but it's not going to be a player in large scale industrial requirements and grid scale storage. "Battery storage is still very expensive, and it's all very well for us to chart a theoretical pathway to a lower carbon future and say 'there you go, we've got an answer', but we haven't delivered that. "At Paris, we heard of grand plans and talk of [non-mandatory] targets that were set, but I don't think we heard a lot about any kind of mechanism or implementation plans to get us to the emissions reduction that we spoken of. "The 'how to' bit is still to come and in the meantime, developing countries will move ahead with developing their energy needs, some of which will be met by nuclear." China and India planning significant renewable energy programs Some of the discussions at the climate conference were about plans by China and India to develop significant renewable energy programs. However Professor Greig said these announcements and what they really meant needed to be recognised. "Let's be clear, the targets that are being set for China and India are not about reducing emissions," he said. "They're about peaking their emissions by 2030, or in a similar time frame. "There's a big difference between emissions continuing to rise until 2030, compared to commitment by developed countries to reduce their emissions. "But as a percentage of China's renewable energy program, it is similar or smaller than their renewable energy sources [hydro, wind, solar]. "The final outcome will depend on the true reduction of their emissions post-2030." Costs of developing nuclear power plants There is no denying nuclear power plants are expensive to build and a number of projects have suffered significant cost blowouts. But Professor Greig compares costs to other forms of energy over the lifetime of power plants, not initial costs. "Yes, the cost of nuclear is very high in initial [construction and commissioning] costs, as is the cost of hydropower in many instances, but the ongoing costs are very low compared to the cost of other fuels," he said. "It also depends on the jurisdiction; I think the Chinese seem to be building nuclear in reasonably cost effective terms. "So I don't think it's fair to say it's going to be more costly although certainly, some projects in the US and Europe have blown out. "But we have to question the issues as to why. A lot of [cost blow outs] are decisions by governments and even delays caused by public reaction and environmental activism." Australia's role in nuclear future Australia has around 40 per cent of the world's known nuclear reserves and with restrictions being lifted in states like Queensland, that will possibly grow. It seems like the next mine to go ahead, if any do, will be in Western Australia. The current spot price is $US34 per pound ($AU46.70) Professor Greig said Australian producers may benefit with the growth of nuclear energy, but as with everything it would be dictated by the market. "Potentially, it could increase but a lot of it depends on what the uptake of nuclear at a global scale really is," he said. "And I think that depends on how the challenge of decarbonisation is met. "I think at the moment there's a strong view by some that renewables can dominate this, but I'm a little sceptical there. "If we want to get real about decarbonisation, we are going to need some base load decarbonisation options, like nuclear. "And therefore, in decades to come, I expect the demand for nuclear power to increase, and therefore the potential for uranium markets to increase." \</doc>

The developed nations' government-funded energy think tank, the International Energy Agency, has HYPERLINK crunched the numbers The chart below, and Climate Spectator 's chart of the week, shows that what's been pledged would represent a dramatic breakthrough, severing the link between electricity demand growth and CO2 emissions. Growth in world electricity demand and related CO2 emissions since 1990 based on Paris pledges HYPERLINK http://www.iea.org/media/news/WEO_INDC_Paper_Final_WEB.PDF Source: International Energy Agency (2015) Energy and Climate Change \- World Energy Outlook Special Briefing for HYPERLINK http://www.iea.org/media/news/WEO_INDC_Paper_Final_WEB.PDF COP 21 If (and it's admittedly a big if) countries fulfil their pledges, the IEA expects it to drive a clean energy investment boom.\~$13.5 trillion would need to be invested in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies from 2015 to 2030, representing almost 40 per cent of total energy sector investment. More than 60 per cent of total investment in power generation capacity is projected to be for renewable capacity, at $4 trillion, with one-third of this being for wind power, almost 30 per cent for solar power (mainly solar photovoltaics) and around one-quarter for hydropower.\~ Countries accounting for more than half of global economic activity are projected to either see their energy-related GHG emissions plateau or be in decline by 2030, including the likes of the European Union, the US, China, Japan, Korea and South Africa. While this is an impressive story, it's worth noting that the globe has already commenced on this path with renewable energy garnering more than 40 per cent\~of net-new power generation capacity and just under 50 per cent of total investment since 2011. \~ In addition we can see a tantalising hint of the delinking between electricity demand and power sector CO2 emissions already beginning post -2010. \~This delinking has already occurred in much of the developed world. Across Europe, the US and Australia the vast majority of new power capacity is in renewable energy, while new-build coal is close to dead.\~ China's attempt to reign in excessive and unsustainable expansion of energy-intensive industry (see Peter Cai's article http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2015/10/21/china/beijing-steels-itself-iron-ore-battle Beijing steels itself for an iron ore battle , for an illustration of this issue) plus its own aggressive expansion of the renewable energy sector indicates it may potentially follow relatively soon. The IEA's chart below helps to illustrate this story. Between 2000 and 2014, China went through a huge expansion in electricity generation heavily built on coal. This rapid expansion is now over, indeed based on the estimates of bank commodity analysts the IEA is probably overestimating China's electricity emissions in 2030 (although in accordance with the Government's INDC). Also, emissions from Europe and the US are lower in 2014 than they were in 2000 and by 2030 will be almost half the levels they were in 2000.\~ However, India's expansion of coal generation counteracts these gains.

Instead of somewhere between 4 to 6 degrees of warming, the International Energy Agency believes the pledges would bring this down to 2.7 degrees.\~This is in line with the estimates of Climate Action Tracker (a US group called Climate Interactive estimated 3.5 degrees of warming but this is HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/news/228/Comparison-between-CAT-and-Climate-Interactive-assessments.html assuming no ongoing continuation of emissions reductions after 2030 ). Although the IEA points out that more can and needs to be done, it falls short of containing global warming to the two-degree goal agreed by world leaders. According to the IEA: "The energy sector can do more to restrain and reduce its GHG emissions; for all countries, there are many ways in which energy sector actions can still be accelerated." It points governments towards what it has outlined as the Bridge Strategy where, "just five energy sector measures (relying only on proven technologies and policies) could help achieve an early peak in total energy-related GHG emissions, at no net economic cost".

As the 40,000-plus attendees to the Paris climate summit congregate on Monday at a former aircraft hangar in north-east Paris, a surprisingly large chunk of Australian big business will be cheering them on. In the 12 months leading up to the 21st Conference of the Parties - more snappily known as COP21 - a groundswell of change has built across the business community and encroached on even the sector that has most to lose, energy and resources. One by one, miners and energy companies have been ditching any lingering reluctance to become engaged on climate commitments and started to urge world leaders to use the United Nations-backed talkfest to set long-term goals for emissions reductions. They want to know where they stand. "You're getting a sense of inevitability that this is the path, and now the question is how are we going to get on with it," says AGL Energy chief executive Andy Vesey, who will join business leaders flocking to Paris-Le Bourget. It is certainly not a Damascus conversion: the statements many chief executives have put their names to are meticulously worded and come with plenty of caveats from companies on the side on the realities of the energy mix, and of continuing reliance on fossil fuels. Green groups say they do not go nearly far enough and question whether some of the commitments constitute much more than "greenwashing". But an open acceptance of the necessity to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels and of action to support that has been signed by Vesey, as well as his peers at fossil fuel producers BHP Billiton, Santos and others. Such a public recognition would have been inconceivable for some of those involved several years ago. "Early global agreement on the steps to achieve this goal will allow for a responsible transition to decarbonised and sustainable economic development," the CEOs say in the September declaration. An open letter published last week by the CEOs of 78 companies with operations in 150 countries gave an idea of the breadth and depth of the business push on climate. The letter, signed by the heads of companies as diverse as Indian steel producers, confectioners Nestle and engineering giant Siemens, called for "bold action" at Paris "to secure a more prosperous world for us all". Rhetoric changes Photo: Brendan Esposito The rhetoric from business is quite different this time compared with the run-up to the failed Copenhagen climate talks in 2009, says Emma Herd of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors with more than $1 trillion of funds. Herd says the investor action of past years has helped galvanise business, which now has a much more sophisticated understanding of the issues, the carbon risks and how they should be positioning themselves in response. "There's much more understanding and consensus around the need for long-term commitment, but also that has to translate to more-regular and transparent review processes. Rather than having this all-or-nothing, do-or-die international agreement, the process is much more important." The investments potentially at risk are huge. Limiting global warming to 2 degrees, a level widely seen as avoiding the worst of the impacts from climate change and a key goal for some at the Paris talks, means no new coal mines will be needed, oil demand will peak near the end of the decade, and growth in gas demand will disappoint, according to respected British-based firm Carbon Tracker. It calculates that fossil fuel producers risk wasting up to $US2.2 trillion on uneconomic projects during the next 10 years that would be "stranded" under a 2-degrees deal, including $US103 billion in Australia. This week federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt recognised the need to achieve net zero emissions "over the course of the century", while Opposition Leader Bill Shorten went further, saying a Labor government would target net zero emissions by 2050. The investments potentially at risk are huge. Photo: Getty Images Labor would target a 45 per cent cut from 2005 levels by 2030, a bigger reduction than the 26-28 per cent target that Australia is taking to Paris, but falling short of the 58 per cent backed by the Investor Group on Climate Change. To achieve "net zero emissions" every tonne of carbon pollution produced would need to be balanced by sequestration or carbon offsets, so effectively stabilising atmospheric concentrations of CO???. To lower concentrations, further would be required - moving to "net negative". "There is a new dynamic afoot here and there is a new number that matters - zero," Connor says. "People are now beginning to work out how their business engines can drive under a zero-carbon economy." The notable change in past months is how the traditional early movers in climate, insurance and finance companies, are being joined by energy majors and some miners. AGL, the country's biggest carbon polluter from its huge coal-fired generators in Victoria and NSW, and Origin were among those that headed off shareholder AGM resolutions on climate change by pre-emptively announcing commitments on emissions reductions and reporting. BHP Billiton in September became the first big miner to release analysis on the impact to its business from international moves to limit temperature gains, and revealed for the first time the assumptions on carbon prices it uses to test every project investment. Origin has voiced support for Australia's coal-heavy electricity sector to become "carbon neutral" by 2050 and has signalled it would close down its Eraring coal-fired generation in NSW by 2030. Origin last month became the first energy company to sign up to all seven of the We Mean Business Coalition climate initiatives, joining international companies such as Air France-KLM and IKEA. AGL has adopted some of the commitments. Others are standing further back and emphasising the realities of energy supply and demand, with coal producers particularly on the back foot. Pure-play coal producer Whitehaven Coal wouldn't comment for this article but its website accurately points to forecasts from the International Energy Agency this month that coal will still account for 30 per cent of global electricity output by 2040. Whitehaven managing director Paul Flynn has pointed to the less-polluting qualities of Whitehaven coal, and some other Australian coals. Rio Tinto head of coal and copper Jean-Sebastien Jacques appeared dismissive of coal's contribution to the climate problem, telling a Sydney audience this week that despite the "PR challenge" faced by the fuel, it "will be part of the global energy solution for years to come". At the same time, however, the resources giant has done away with the energy division that held its coal business, and has been selling mines in Australia. "We fully acknowledge there is a climate change issue and we believe we need to be part of the solution," Jacques said on Thursday. Oil-and-gas play Woodside Petroleum maintains its support for a greenhouse gas regulatory regime that allows Australia to meet its international climate change commitments but goes no further. Chief executive Peter Coleman used a global energy summit in Paris in June to extol the greenhouse benefits of gas compared with coal. It is these tensions among fossil fuel producers that give a local slant to the international coal-versus-gas debate that has taken hold in Europe and North America this year. Coal is "still the cheapest way of bringing people out of poverty" and is "not going to be wished away", said Glencore's coal chief Peter Freyberg. Momentum builds The airline industry is targeting its own sector-specific agreement on climate. Photo: Rob Homer Allianz this week became the latest financial institution to pull back from coal, with chief executive Oliver Bate advising the company would no longer invest in companies that derive more than 30 per cent of revenues from coal mining or generate more than 30 per cent of their energy from coal. Last month ANZ tightened up its lending criteria for coal, ruling out financing to extend the operating life of any higher-emitting coal generators, unless the owner has a timetable in place to cut emissions. It will also limit financing for new coal plants to those using technology to keep emissions no higher than 0.8 tonnes of CO??? a megawatt hour, noting these levels are up to half as much lower than some power plants in use today. "We ... consider that decarbonisation of the economy must be managed responsibly and over time," the bank said. The airline industry is targeting its own sector-specific agreement on climate through a process run by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, but that will be influenced by COP21 so progress in Paris is still important, industry sources say. "Aviation is different from a lot of other industries in that airlines agreed to a global, market-based approach back in 2013, and we have a target to finalise what that will look like by next year," says Qantas head of environment Alan Milne. "Our focus is on the next round of talks at the International Civil Aviation Organisation in early 2016 but clearly, a strong commitment to 2 degrees C at Paris would be a big momentum boost going into that process." As things stand, pledges made by more than 175 countries on emissions cuts to be taken to Paris still fail to meet the 2-degrees goal, and the world is on track to see temperatures rise 2.5-2.7 degrees C, according to Professor Stefan Rahmstorf at University of NSW. But the transparent engagement and commitment by countries in the lead-up to Paris has been applauded by business, with BHP Billiton chief commercial officer Dean Dalla Valle saying it "provides clarity and direction for business". Dalla Valle says BHP "strongly supports" efforts to get the world on track for the 2-degrees goal and said COP21 is about building momentum, rules and review mechanisms to make that happen. "We want to see an outcome that reaffirms global commitment to limit climate change to the 2 degrees C goal, places all countries on a common platform and puts in place mechanisms to facilitate additional action over time," he says. Dalla Valle pointed to several challenges that still need to be addressed, such as the provision of climate finance, different treatment of developing and developed countries and the status of carbon markets. Reporting of business climate change performance and risk is also a likely topic of discussion in Paris, he said, pointing to BHP's analysis released in September. Origin chief executive Grant King is not expecting commitments in Paris that will limit warming to 2 degrees but insists the summit won't be a failure as a result. "I hope that it will build confidence in the international process that will lead to more-ambitious action over time," he said in June. King blames the Kyoto summit in 1997 for driving "20 years of questionable activity", wasting billions of dollars of public money to achieve an environmental outcome that fell well short of hopes and wants cool heads to prevail in Paris, resulting in an outcome that improves the environment and preserves economic growth. Ian Woods, head of environmental, social and governance investment research at AMP Capital, says a key outcome from Paris will be the mechanism by which more greenhouse gas reduction commitments will be made by countries for the future. "It is primarily a coming together to form a collective will to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across countries, across industries, across civil society and also incorporating the voice of the finance sector, which says it is prepared to assist but wants policy clarity," Woods says. "There will be confirmation that current reductions targets proposed by countries are not sufficient to meet the goal of limiting climate change to less than 2C, but momentum will be there for countries to review their targets either at or after the conference." AGL's Vesey says getting a first-hand feel for the mood at the Paris talks is critical. AGL Energy chief executive Andy Vesey. Photo: Chris Pearce "For me I'm really going there to exchange ideas, see what the rest of the industry is doing, to some degree to get the vibe of the place, to know how serious these discussions are so I can come back and know exactly what I need to do to help move this things forward," he says. With the commitments on emissions reductions already on the table from more than 175 countries, Paris is about what happens after that and how to achieve them. "It's not about the commitments; it's about negotiating what are we going to do next, what are the mechanisms to keep this moving," Vesey says. \</doc>

Kuala Lumpur: Terrorism, Chinese expansionism and the refugee crisis engulfing much of the world at present are set to dominate the East Asia Summit which kicked off on Saturday night with a "gala dinner" in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, parts of which have been put into security lock-down to host the leaders. The 18-nation meeting is the third of five summits in a row being attended by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in just his third month in the job. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the UN Paris climate summit, COP21 , will take place from next weekend. The East Asia Summit is the first to have regional security at its core even though the nominally economic summits, the G20 in Turkey, and APEC in the Philippines, became overwhelmed by the tragic killings in Paris a week ago, and the bloody aftermath. Those events, and Friday's attack in Mali, west Africa, have made authorities especially nervous in managing events with such senior gatherings of world leaders. With the relatively recent inclusion of both the US and Russia, and membership including China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, the EAS brings these big and small powers together on strategic matters. High on the agenda this year is the ongoing and potentially worsening stand-off between the world's emergent strategic and economic superpower, China, and numerous member states over Beijing's territorial expansion in the South and East China Seas. Mr Turnbull was due to meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang??? on Saturday evening - the second bilateral discussion with the Middle Kingdom after a one-on-one with President Xi Jinping??? last week. Mr Turnbull is expected to reiterate his message that China's rise must not only be peaceful, but must be seen by its neighbours to be peaceful. In September, such comments had incurred the wrath of Beijing, with a foreign ministry spokesman stating: "We hope that Australia will stay committed to not taking sides on issues concerning disputes over sovereignty." With an asylum-seeker vessel making it almost to Christmas Island on Friday, there are fears the resolve of the Turnbull government, which has stuck by Tony Abbott's policies but toned down the bellicose rhetoric, could be tested by people smugglers. US President Barack Obama is among the attendees and expects that the meeting will focus heavily on the Chinese territorial claim to the Spratly archipelago in which it has constructed a number of artificial islands. The White House has also made clear via a fact sheet released just days ahead of the meeting, that it expects its strong allies in the region to support such actions - although Mr Obama stopped short of specifically requesting either Tokyo or Canberra to send ships into the Chinese claim. "We are increasing the maritime security capacity of our allies and partners, to respond to threats in waters off their coasts and to provide maritime security more broadly across the region," the fact sheet stated before listing several ways in which this would be achieved including gifting warships to the Philippines and: "Coordinating with our strong allies Japan and Australia on maritime security assistance to align and synchronise regional security and law enforcement assistance programs for maximum effect". \</doc>

It is far from the end for thermal coal, but HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/mining/fossil-fuels-producers-insist-they-have-a-future-in-a-renewable-energy-world-20151027-gkjfn4 the path ahead is a difficult one In a move no doubt to be seized on by the anti-coal lobby, the closely-watched International Energy Agency looks to be preparing to revise down its forecast for coal demand growth. Given how widely cited the forecasts from the Paris-based organisation are by resources companies to justify investments, any revisions are significant. The unexpected slowdown in HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/world/china-burns-much-more-coal-than-it-claims-20151104-gkqi0r Chinese coal demand COP21 global climate talks in Paris at the end of the month. Those commitments, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or more snappily INDCs, have come from more than 150 countries representing nearly 90 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing the pledges would dramatically uncouple power-sector CO2 emissions from electricity demand, with emissions staying broadly flat, out to 2030, despite electricity demand rising by more than 40 per cent, "We estimate that all countries' INDCs will have a substantial impact on the growth in coal, more than other fossil fuels, in particular gas," Mr Sadamori told Drilling Down. "We consider that in the next medium-term coal market report we would expect slower coal demand growth than the one last year." Last year's version of the report, published in December, forecast 2.1 per cent a year demand growth for coal for the following five years to pass 9 billion tonnes by 2019. That was down from 2013's forecast for 2.3 per cent annual growth for the following five years and the actual growth of 3.3 per cent each year between 2010 and 2013. IEA expectations But Mr Sadamori's words signal the IEA is expecting the deceleration in growth to pick up, as long as the estimated $US13.5 trillion in investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies required to implement the pledges is indeed forthcoming. Even then, more was needed to limit warming to 2 degrees relative to pre-industrial levels, the IEA said. Mr Sadamori still expected "fairly robust" growth in demand in India and the Association of South-East Asian Nations, given the new coal-fired generation capacity still being built there, while hinting at a "substantial slow down" in China. Even in the growth regions, however, questions remain on demand for imports, as highlighted by predictions from Bloomberg New Energy Finance this week that the big growth markets of India and south-east Asia would meet their requirements from domestic sources. In any case, based on the INDCs, gas is left as the only fossil fuel to show substantial growth and expand its share of the global energy mix. In Asia, despite the dramatic decline in gas prices over the past 18 months, coal still clearly wins on economic grounds. Mr Sadamori said a carbon price of about $US50 a tonne would be required for gas to match coal in power generation. That is down hugely from the price of about $US150 a tonne in early 2014 but it is still a sizeable gap. Speaking from the Asian Energy Financial and Investment Conference in Singapore last week, Citigroup's top Asian energy investment banker, Philip Graham, said coal would still have a core role to supply existing generation fleets and new super-critical and ultra-critical power plants, but would lose market share to increasingly competitive wind and solar. Thermal coal use outside power generation also faces headwinds, with both Mr Sadamori and Mr Graham pointing to the potential for a whole-scale switch to gas in industrial and central heating boilers in China.

As world leaders converge on the French capital to come up with a roadmap to save the world from climate change, TORY SHEPHERD fills in the blanks about the process. WHAT IS IT? There was Kyoto, then Copenhagen, now Paris. It's called (uncatchily) COP21 . That is shorthand for Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - and it's actually the 21st meeting, although Kyoto and Copenhagen are the most well known. This is serious. This is where the world decides how it will tackle climate change; specifically, how it will keep this Earth of ours from warming by more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That's the "red line" climatologists have set. It's a major world event and the culmination of years of discussions. They will deliver a new agreement (they hope). It will map out how we prevent catastrophic changes, how we stop the oceans swamping low-lying islands, how we stop increasingly severe and deadly floods and droughts, bushfires and typhoons. Basically, thousands and thousands of people will fly thousands of miles, emitting tonnes of carbon dioxide, to talk about how not to emit so much. But it has to happen. WHO IS GOING? Two hundred countries that emit more than 90 per cent of the world's emissions - about 93 per cent - will be there. There are big players and, well, bit players. The big players include the powerhouses of US, with President Barack Obama, right, and China, represented by President Xi Jingping, right. Other big players include India (PM Narendra Modi), Russia (President Vladimir Putina) and Britain (PM David Cameron). For Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is obviously the biggest ticket but Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt are also going. Other local attendees include Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, shadow climate change spokesman Mark Butler, Premier Jay Weatherill, and Adelaide Lord Mayor Martin Haese. WHAT'S THE POINT? In short, to keep global warming below 2C. Almost all the world's experts concur that the climate is changing, that the effects are already being felt, and that if nothing is done things will get worse. Individual countries work out what they're going to do. They set their own targets. What Paris is about is getting everyone on the same page; that their targets are transparent, comparable, and measurable. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? It's important globally, obviously, but particularly important for Australia. Politically it's a hot topic but in real life it's also a\'e2\€ \£6 hot topic. We're more vulnerable than many other nations to droughts and bushfires, for example. Climate change will also be a big wedge issue at the next election. Mr Turnbull has adopted his predecessor Tony Abbott's policy with the promise of more later. But Mr Shorten intends to highlight the difference between the two parties. He has set an ambitious target; to have 50 per cent of Australia's energy generated from renewables by 2030. But Labor does not yet have a specific target. And they have a historic political problem with pricing carbon. WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME? Copenhagen was disastrous. The 2009 conference was a standoff between wealthy developed nations and poorer developing nations - like China and India. It seemed to them that the rich world was trying to put the handbrakes on their growth just as they were really revving up their economic engines. Former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd famously said the Chinese were "ratfing us" over an agreement. Everyone is more optimistic about Paris; not least because China is enthusiastically on board. WHERE DOES AUSTRALIA STAND?Mr Turnbull, above, will attend the conference with our commitment to reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020, making us a middling contributor. \</doc>

Thousands of people have descended on Parliament House to demand action on climate change as part of demonstrations throughout the country. More than 6000 people attended the People's Climate March in Canberra on Sunday as world leaders prepare to meet in Paris for the United Nations climate summit on Monday. Canberra was one of more than 600 cities around the world to take part in the largest international weekend of climate action ahead of the Paris talks. Conservation Council ACT assistant director of communications Phoebe Howe described the turnout at the Canberra march as "amazing". "The People's Climate March is a global movement and the main message was that ahead of Paris, people from all walks of life coming together and across their differences, showing unity in our call for real climate outcomes at Paris but also putting our leaders on notice that whatever happens in Paris, we'll be watching," she said. "We want that Paris framework to become the first stepping stone to a real solution for our climate. "The main message here in Australia is that we want to move to 100 per cent clean homegrown energy as fast as possible and we want to see an end to dirty fossil fuels." Greens Minister Shane Rattenbury attended Sunday's march and said it was clear that the community wanted action on the climate. "It was a great turnout and there was a lot of enthusiasm in the crowd and there were strong views that Australia needs to be a leader when it comes to global climate action," he said. Mr Rattenbury said there needed to be some sort of resolution on climate action from the Paris talks. "The role that Canberra can play is demonstrating what is possible when you put your mind to it. We're are taking a lead in the ACT and I hope that acts as a source of inspiration to leaders from other parts of the world." Ms Howe said it was "hugely encouraging" to see such a strong level of support in Canberra for climate action. "I know the Canberra community is very active, but what we saw today - that those people are willing to come out and tell leaders, internationally and nationally, that we are only going to accept strong action from them, so it is very heartening to see these numbers both here and in capital cities across Australia." ACT Environment Minister HYPERLINK /act-news/act-environment-minister-simon-corbell-to-attend-climate-change-talks-in-paris-20151126-gl8uuf.html Simon Corbell will attend the Paris climate change talks , saying previously that the reason for the ACT's presence at the high-level international conference was because the United Nations was treating climate change as an issue which could also be addressed at local level. COP21 [Conference of the Parties] discussion," he said. "Unlike Copenhagen, the UN and the French government have recognised there needs to be a voice for subnational governments, regional governments and city governments at the table, to demonstrate the ambition that is being put in place, the programs that are being driven by city and subnational governments. "And that needs to be recognised as part of the UN negotiations. So they are actively encouraging sub-national governments to attend. "The ACT is increasingly recognised as a leader internationally in terms of its greenhouse gas abatements and its renewable energy targets and I will be participating in a broad range of events designed to highlight what is happening at the sub-national government level," Mr Corbell said. \</doc>

A year ago, he and I were both in favour of an (emissions trading scheme); the good news is I still am. We all know he did a deal with the devil to take the leadership of the Liberal Party. Shorten yesterday: (Turnbull) knows his own party's policies are bad, but he's done his deal with the devil. Can't be the devil, though - isn't he always thinking about a comeback? Paradise Lost (1667): For who can yet believe, though after loss, / That all these puissant legions whose exile / Hath emptied Heav'n shall fail to re-ascend, / Self-raised, and repossess their native seat. What comeback? The Today show yesterday: Karl Stefanovic: Are you concerned inside parliament, though, that Tony Abbott is gathering numbers, gathering a storm against Malcolm Turnbull? Christopher Pyne: That simply is not happening. Anthony Albanese: He's doing it in the office next to Chris's. They have, every Tuesday, they have a little gathering in the office next to Chris's, there's a monkey pod room, it's called, named after the type of timber that's in the table. It's attached to Chris's office. Chris is outside with glasses and a false moustache on taking names. Pyne: I've got Groucho Marx's disguise on. Everyone relax. Kevin Rudd on Twitter on Thursday: Seems to be much breathless commentary around concerning possible World War III. There won't be. -Neither Russia nor US have any such interest. Still hard at work.

Merci, Sam. Missing in action? Gerard Henderson in Media Watch Dog yesterday: Some of ABC1's key programs have already gone into what journalists call a Well Earned Break. Four Corners, Q&A and Media Watch shut down last Monday and will remain closed for over two months. The December 2015 issue of The Australian Financial Review Magazine - published today - contains a story by Anne Hyland on the ABC managing director titled "his ABC". In a generally soft piece, Anne Hyland makes the following point concerning Mark Scott's 10 years at the ABC: "The pace has certainly been manic over the past decade as the ABC rolled out podcasts, multiple websites, a television catch-up service in iView, apps for its radio services and additional digital television channels - including ABC News 24 - along with embracing social media. Most of these initiatives came well in advance of its commercial peers \'e2\€ \£6"The ABC now has multiple television and radio channels and more besides. But, despite an annual budget of over $1 billion, some of the taxpayer-funded public broadcaster's key news and current affairs programs on the ABC's main channel go into a ridiculously long Silly Season vacation. Why, even ABC's Offsiders program closes down during the 2015-16 summer of sport. \</doc>

Performance art group Climate Guardian Angels plans to defy a veto on outside protests at the UN Climate Conference at Paris. Photo: MAGGIE MILES Climate activists descend on Paris to fly in face of bans By Larissa Dubecki Hundreds of thousands of climate activists descending on Paris ahead of the UN Climate Conference are preparing to defy a ban on street protests in the wake of the recent terror attacks. The carnival-esque combination of street acts and political activists that has accompanied previous global climate summits, including Copenhagen in 2009, is threatened by a state of emergency declared in the wake of the November 13 attacks that killed 130 people. Environmental activists had hoped for more than 200,000 people to take to the streets of Paris for the People's Climate March on Sunday. But the government of Francois Hollande last week issued a ban on protests, marches and other "outdoor activities" during the 12-day summit, which will be attended by 40,000 official delegates. Demonstrations in closed spaces or in places where security can be ensured can proceed, the government said. Activists are split on the ban, with some, including Greenpeace, believing it will simply shift emphasis to thousands of planned protests across the globe, including in Melbourne on Friday and Sydney on Sunday. "We respect the French government's decision to ban the Paris march," said Greenpeace Australia spokesman Ben Solity. "We believe it will be the largest mobilisation in Australia's history." But others have accused the French government of using the terrorist attacks as an excuse to crack down on lawful protest. "It's telling that they aren't banning football matches or night markets," said ClimActs co-founder Deborah Hart, in Paris with their performance art group Climate Guardian Angels. "I respect that they must take measures to ensure the safety of their citizens and visitors, but I believe they are cynically taking advantage of these horrific terrorist attacks to silence community voices during COP21 [the Paris Climate Conference]." ClimActs and other activist groups are planning ways to get around the ban. "Fortunately our modus operandi of highlighting environmental catastrophe through performance art in uniquely effective under crackdown conditions. What could possibly be threatening about a group of women in angel costumes?" said Hart, the author of the recently released Guarding Eden. Hart noted that federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt will be in Paris. "Without giving too much away, the Angels are very good at drawing attention to particular politicians," she said. Samantha Castro, Friends of the Earth operations co-ordinator and co-founder of the Wikileaks Australian Citizens Alliance, said she expects the ban to be ineffectual. "The global community is descending on Paris. I can't imagine going all that way and people not being on the streets. I do believe that by the end of the conference the French police won't be able to contain them," she said. The question remains whether the ban could affect the outcome of the talks, widely seen as the world's last chance to cap greenhouse gas emissions to contain global warming below the two-degree threshold scientists warn will lead to catastrophic global warming. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has urged Australians in Paris to avoid public spaces and exercise a high degree of caution. The Angels and many of their activist friends remain undeterred. "I have no doubt some of us will go in hard, especially towards the end of the conference. We're peaceful demonstrators, but if civil disobedience is required to get our message across we're not afraid of the consequences," said Hart. "You can run pretty fast in an angel costume - just so long as you hitch up the skirt." \</doc>

Developing nations must be part of any global accord In the politics of climate change, we often see gestures triumph over policy. Countries and individuals are often more interested in being seen to do the right thing rather than taking the most effective action. So, conscious of the massive carbon footprint generated by the 40,000 people descending on Paris for the COP21 climate talks, organisers have conjured offsets so they can claim the event is carbon neutral. Such deals are more about public relations than environmental outcomes - what really matters are the commitments offered by participating nations and the agreement they reach. And - as has become standard for such talks - the haggling and posturing is keeping the outcome uncertain until the final hours. Despite years of preparation and a fortnight of intense diplomacy, the much anticipated Paris talks have reached their endgame with the core aims still to be realised. It is most likely that a deal will be struck soon but it must be judged on the extent to which it succeeds in bringing the major emitters of greenhouse gases into a single tent. It has always been the case that without substantial buy-in from the US, China and India - as well as the EU - any climate agreement will be largely window-dressing. Yet despite much positive spin in the lead-up about how China, in particular, was committed to action, the reality of negotiations has been somewhat more challenging. Three issues have emerged as stumbling blocks: Who will contribute to and manage a $100 billion a year climate fund from 2020? How will the voluntary pledges from all countries to take action on emissions be measured and verified? And how will the responsibility to act extend to all countries, not just the developed world? The issue of differentiation, which has separated the world on the basis of past actions and economic status, is laden with philosophical and strategic importance for many developing nations, not least India. Without an agreement that provides a clear pathway to bring everyone into a shared plan of action, Paris will have been a failure. This is because without co-operation and openness from developing nations the task is simply not achievable. US Secretary of State John Kerry has outlined the basic arithmetic behind this reality. If all the industrialised nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions to zero it would not be enough to meet a 2C target because 65 per cent of the world's emissions come from developing countries.Legacy arguments about historic carbon dioxide emissions from Western countries are weakening - by 2030 half of the world's historic carbon dioxide emissions will have come from developing nations. Nonetheless it must be accepted that India, especially, has a right to pursue its poverty-busting economic growth and by necessity this will involve coal-generated electricity. Developed countries must do all they can to assist India's transformation, including through financial assistance and the provision of technology. In return India, China and others must agree to be part of any long-term solution to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It is imperative these finance deals are used not to redistribute wealth across the globe - as seems to be the hidden agenda behind much of the posturing - but to deliver the required emissions reduction. Whether a Paris accord tries to limit future warming to 1.5C or 2C is really a sideshow that shouldn't overshadow the crucial transition from the existing two-track process to a genuinely global response embraced by all nations. \</doc>

IT will be interesting to see which way Daniel Andrews jumps, following the Setka arrest ("Dan's toxic mate", HS, Dec 7). Earlier this year the Premier abolished the "move on" powers for police, introduced by the Napthine government in the wake of CFMEU thuggery at Grocon's Lonsdale St site. Recently, this same Government had no compunction about outlawing pro-lifers from protesting outside abortion clinics, showing a very partial exercise of the law. The police have responded magnificently in this arrest, but it will be a test for a judicial system that has disappointed Victorians by not observing reformed sentencing laws. John Morrissey, Hawthorn Michael Long, Frankston Arrest when it suits SO CFMEU national secretary Dave Noonan believes "the police should have made the arrests at the union's Swanston St offices instead of in front of the men's families and that the police could have conducted their business at the office during working hours". But Dave, what if Mr Setka and Mr Reardon worked variable working hours, or were on a rostered day off when police called? Maybe the police should have called and asked the men which week suited them to be arrested. After all, they are the CFMEU, aren't they? Greg Collins, Deniliquin, NSW Toll truths untold LOOKING at your road toll breakdown (HS, Dec 7), as drivers are subjected to changes to road rules, etc, based on these figures, I believe it is only fitting that we know what proportion of the road toll victims are the result of excessive law-breakers? How many deaths are as a result of unlicensed drivers, how many are a result of excessive speed (say, 50km/h over the posted speed) and how many are due to excessive drinking (say, over .09)? I would like these numbers to see if the suggested restrictions of .03 alcohol or 40km/h limits would make a reasonable difference. Based on what you read in the paper, it seems a fair proportion of deaths would occur even if very low limits were introduced as a vast number of people are just not law-abiding, and their actions set the rules for us all. John King, McCrae Councils see the light YOUR editorial, "Councils must come to heel" (HS, Dec 3), quaintly favours the 19th-century opinion that councils should be concerned with rates, roads and rubbish. Fortunately, time and common sense has moved on from such a Dickensian opinion. Among Mornington Peninsula Shire Council's social obligations is its commitment to carbon neutrality. This commitment will drive soundly based business case initiatives to reduce council's carbon footprint such as closing its obsolescent landfill in favour of the "hubbing" of household waste (consistent with state government policy), replacing LED street lighting and renewable energy initiatives. I make no apology for councillors attending the Paris COP21 conference and being better informed about such matters. Cr Hugh Fraser, Mornington Peninsula Shire Council Ugliness laid bare THE stone rockery on Alexandra Ave was not so "hideous" before Melbourne City Council decided to destroy the yucca plants that had adorned the structure for more than 40 years ("Must have had rocks in their heads", HS, Dec 7).

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has used her speech at the United Nation's climate change talks in Paris to promote the government's HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/politics/innovation-statement-at-a-glance-20151206-glgwza innovation statement Ms Bishop, who arrived in the French capital on Sunday for the second and final week of negotiations, joined other ministers from around the world in giving a brief statement during which she linked HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/innovation-package-finally-delivers-holistic-approach-to-innovation-20151207-glhpgq the launch of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's national innovation and science agenda with global attempts to reduce the impact of climate change. "Australia will lead by example in the way we invest in and reward technology," she said. "It will be innovation and technological breakthroughs that will ultimately bring the breakthroughs in our climate change responses." Speaking to journalists on Monday afternoon, Ms Bishop said there was "a great deal optimism" the summit would result in the 190 countries taking part in the Paris talks striking an agreement, "there's still a lot of work to be done". Most observers believe the Paris talks are progressing better than the 2009 Copenhagen conference - where last minute differences between nations prevented a binding agreement - but there remain concerns that divisions between developed and developing nations could still derail this year's conference. More than 150 nations made carbon reduction pledges in the lead up to the Paris talks which are expected to cap global temperature rises at 2.7C above pre-industrial levels - well above the UN's target of 2C, which most scientists regard as safe. The Paris negotiations will not change the national pledges but do aim to cover a number of related issues such as reviews of the pledges and how a 2020 goal of $US100 billion a year in climate funding for developed nations would be managed and paid for. ???The Paris talks HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/un-climate-conference-2015-paris-talks-agree-draft-accord-20151205-glgh2v moved into a critical phase on Saturday after negotiators agreed to a draft accord that still leaves hundreds of points of dispute for ministers to resolve this week. Mr Bishop confirmed Australia was still pushing for five-year reviews of the national pledges with a start date of 2023. Developed nations and Island states vulnerable to climate change has pushed for strict reviews of the pledges which are aimed at encouraging countries to be accountable and progressively lower their emission reduction targets. However, some developing nations such as India - which argue fossil fuels are essential to economic growth and the provision of electricity in poorer areas - are resisting strict reviews or asking for the start date to be pushed back. Ms Bishop arrived in Paris needing to avert a potential diplomatic dispute with the Marshall Islands after her attempt to ridicule Labor's Tanya Plibersek backfired in the days before the conference. Ms Bishop accused her rival of wrongly claiming the island of Eneko had "disappeared" but instead got the name of the island wrong herself. Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum has said he hoped to confront Ms Bishop over the incident while in Paris. However, Ms Bishop said she was reading off a transcript issued by Ms Plibersek's office. "Let's get some facts on the record because some seem to have a great deal of difficulty dealing with facts," she said. "It transpires (the transcript) contains a shocking blunder. If she makes mistakes in her transcripts, I am not her subeditor." Ms Bishop's first day at the Paris conference known as Cop21 also included: A scheduled meeting with Japanese Environment Minister Ms Tamayo Marukawa.

It is far from the end for thermal coal, but the path ahead is a difficult one. In a move no doubt to be seized on by the anti-coal lobby, the closely watched International Energy Agency looks to be preparing to revise down its forecast for coal demand growth. Given how widely cited the forecasts from the Paris-based organisation are by resources companies to justify investments, any revisions are significant. The unexpected slowdown in Chinese coal demand that was particularly evident in 2014 is a factor, but the IEA's director for energy markets and security, Keisuke Sadamori, points more so to the commitments made by countries in their submitted pledges on greenhouse gas emissions before the COP21 global climate talks in Paris at the end of the month.Those commitments, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or, more snappily, INDCs, have come from more than 150 countries representing nearly 90 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing the pledges would dramatically uncouple power-sector CO2 emissions from electricity demand, with emissions staying broadly flat, out to 2030, despite electricity demand rising by more than 40 per cent. "We estimate that all countries' INDCs will have a substantial impact on the growth in coal, more than other fossil fuels, in particular gas," Mr Sadamori told Drilling Down. "We consider that in the next medium-term coal market report we would expect slower coal demand growth than the one last year." Last year's version of the report, published in December, forecast 2.1 per cent a year demand growth for coal for the following five years to pass 9 billion tonnes by 2019. That was down from 2013's forecast for 2.3 per cent annual growth for the following five years and the actual growth of 3.3 per cent each year between 2010 and 2013. But Mr Sadamori's words signal the IEA is expecting the deceleration in growth to pick up, as long as the estimated $US13.5 trillion in investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies required to implement the pledges is indeed forthcoming. Even then, more was needed to limit warming to 2 degrees relative to pre-industrial levels, the IEA said. Mr Sadamori still expected "fairly robust" growth in demand in India and the Association of South-East Asian Nations, given the new coal-fired generation capacity still being built there, while hinting at a "substantial slowdown" in China. Even in the growth regions, however, questions remain on demand for imports, as highlighted by predictions from Bloomberg New Energy Finance this week that the big growth markets of India and south-east Asia would meet their requirements from domestic sources. In any case, based on the INDCs, gas is left as the only fossil fuel to show substantial growth and expand its share of the global energy mix. In Asia, despite the dramatic decline in gas prices over the past 18 months, coal still clearly wins on economic grounds. Mr Sadamori said a carbon price of about $US50 a tonne would be required for gas to match coal in power generation. That is down hugely from the price of about $US150 a tonne in early 2014 but it is still a sizeable gap. Speaking from the Asian Energy Financial and Investment Conference in Singapore last week, Citigroup's top Asian energy investment banker, Philip Graham, said coal would still have a core role to supply existing generation fleets and new super-critical and ultra-critical power plants, but would lose market share to increasingly competitive wind and solar.

The President of Kiribati, a small island nation in the Pacific at risk of disappearing if sea levels rise, says he is very appreciative of Australia's "very active" role at the Paris climate talks. President Anote Tong, an outspoken advocate for global action on climate change, said the agreement reached at the COP21 summit was a "major achievement". "It's a very positive step forward and of course, what was most gratifying was the position of the countries that we had thought would have taken a very negative position," he told the ABC's The World program. All 195 countries that attended the summit approved the agreement, HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-12/world-adopts-climate-deal-at-paris-talks/7023712 which aims to limit temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels . The agreement also references the "urgent need" to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. The text does not mandate specific measures or targets. Instead, it creates a system for ensuring countries make good on voluntary domestic efforts to curb emissions. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the deal was an important step forward, HYPERLINK /news/2015-12-14/federal-government-climate-change-targets-cop-criticism/7024814 but it has been criticised by some Liberal MPs . President Tong, who is in Morocco for another round of climate talks, said it was "absolutely vital" that leaders followed through on the targets agreed upon in Paris. "I think it's absolutely vital. Of course, it's part of the reason why we are here in Morocco, to discuss perhaps what should be coming up at the next meeting, how the commitments that were made from Paris could be followed up and how they can be translated into concrete action," he said. "There was very clear acknowledgement of the special circumstances of the most vulnerable countries on the front line of climate change. "We are hoping that in spite of the lack of clarity in the wording, there is this very clear understanding that if it comes to building up climate resilience and adaptation and just recovery, we are hopeful that the countries that made a commitment will deliver." President Tong pleased the 'miracle did happen' President Tong said the summit's adoption of the 1.5C target was a victory. "I think [at] the start of the discussions, quite a number of countries did not go for the 1.5C increase, but by the end of the discussions ... the miracle did happen," he told The World. "Even Australia, we felt, was supporting that. The environment and perhaps the chairmanship, the presidency at the conference, was of course very instrumental. "But Australia was very active, we noted that. And of course the US, and a number of other countries that initially were a bit negative." Negotiators have said the long-term push by island nations was instrumental in bringing the 1.5C target to prominence. Australia signed on to the 1.5 target HYPERLINK /news/2015-12-13/how-the-1-5-degree-target-overcame-the-odds-in-paris/7024006 when it cut a deal with St Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, to back the target in exchange for being allowed to carry over its savings from the Kyoto Protocol . President Tong said the agreement, if followed through, will mean future Kiribatians will have a future. "I think it's been very, very significant and it sets the bottom line - it establishes the basis of the foundation of what future behaviour on energy should be. "I know we did not get 100 per cent of what it was that we went for, but nevertheless I think what's happened ... in the circumstances, could not have been better." \</doc>

ABSTRACT We need a strong agreement and we need it yesterday, writes deputy CEO of The Climate Institute Erwin Jackson . Trying to follow what happens at a climate summit is a bit like trying to swim up a waterfall. Negotiators are meeting behind closed doors, businesses are spruiking their wares, and NGOs are rushing from meeting to meeting, pushing governments to do more. It is a gushing torrent of ideas, advocacy and activity. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop arrived in Paris on the weekend and hit the ground running. She delivered Australia's ministerial statement to the rest of the world around lunchtime Monday. Her speech largely reiterated past statements by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and committed to funding programs to help women engage in climate change decision-making (go to any energy policy conference in Australia and you will see why this is needed - they are all-male affairs). She reiterated that the "new agreement must promote further ambition and action over time". Building further action through time is one of the core ingredients for the outcome in Paris. Past climate agreements have not established a system for political leaders to regularly stand up among their peers to commit to do more. We saw the start of this process in advance of Paris when countries representing over 95% of global emissions put forward new emissions reduction targets. If implemented, we will be on a path for just under 3 degrees of global warming - better than the path of 4-6 degrees we were on before the Paris process. From COP21 In this regard, two things here are different from past summits. First, the desire from most countries to deliver a durable agreement that can stand the test of time. Investors, communities and the climate can't afford the time it will take for the global community to negotiate a brand-spanking new agreement every time they gather. So, future major summits should be more focused on stocktaking global action and finding ways to step it up, not be about reinventing international frameworks and rules every few years. Secondly, never before has there been such recognition from a broad range of countries that warming of 2 degrees is too risky. So we need to consider limiting warming to less than even 1.5 degrees. This goal has created solidarity among many vulnerable countries in the developing world. Developed countries such as the USA, China, Australia and those within the European Union have also been open to recognising this in the agreement. In her speech, Bishop\~re-iterated the messages from the government's innovation statement. But when it comes to climate action that will avoid two, and let alone 1.5 degrees warming, national policies will matter as much as technological innovation. In Australia's energy system, for example, all the best innovations will only be deployed around the edges - unless we have a plan to replace the ageing and inefficient coal-fired power stations that are blocking the modernisation of the power system. As we enter the rapids of the last week of the Paris summit, we are in a position where the key elements exist for an outcome that can build on recent momentum and boost global action. A best possible outcome from the meeting is now possible. It is up to ministers to knuckle down and find the compromises that will deliver a durable agreement that keeps countries coming back to the table with stronger actions. \</doc>

THE Great Barrier Reef is in imminent danger from a worldwide weather pattern threatening to destroy coral masses. Record warm Pacific Ocean temperatures have spiked due to a combination of climate change, El Nino weather effects and a warm and nutrient-poor water mass off the US known as "the blob". Bleaching is threatening to severely deplete 38 per cent of coral reefs and fish habitats by the end of the year, spreading into a rare worldwide crisis. It is tipped to kill more than 12,000sq km of reefs and will likely worsen, say researchers from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Queensland. Bleaching is expected to hit the Reef from about February to March although the extent of damage is unknown. It is catastrophic news for state and federal governments and farmers who are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into repairing the Reef after UNESCO threatened to list it as being in danger of widespread degradation. UQ bleaching expert and chief scientist for XL Catlin Seaview Survey, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, said the Reef could suffer widespread bleaching, the most common effect of rising sea temperatures. "In the first major global event in 1998, more than half the Reef experienced bleaching with about 5 to 10 per cent of the corals dying," he said. Prof Hoegh-Guldberg said 2010 was hotter than 1998 but the Reef was spared the worst due to storms which alleviated heat stress. "The Reef may not be so lucky in 2016. In 1999 my research predicted mass coral bleaching events to become successively worse over time if we failed to deal with rising atmospheric gases," he said. Australia faces challenges about its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions in less than two months when world leaders meet in Paris for the COP 21 agreement to keep global warming below 2C. "We either cut emissions deeply or risk losing coral reefs for future generations," Prof Hoegh-Guldberg said.Coral represents less than 0.1 per cent of the world's ocean floor but supports about 25 per cent of all marine -species, 500 million people and income of more than $30 billion. \</doc>

One study by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded California's drought was driven more by natural causes than global warming. But another HYPERLINK http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL062433/abstract study from the American Geophysical Union found it was the worst drought in 1,200 years.

The drought has already cost the state more than $2 billion. The great fear is that it is a forerunner of HYPERLINK https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/february/nasa-study-finds-carbon-emissions-could-dramatically-increase-risk-of-us mega droughts lasting decades.

Plenty offered at Paris bazaar With trade negotiators and experts on hand, the climate talks look like the biggest foreign policy swap meet since Copenhagen. Heads of state from small island nations most at risk from the harmful effects of climate change with US President Barack Obama in Paris. Photo: AP W ant your country to enter the European Union? Want better access to Indian agricultural markets? Want some extra aid funding? Perhaps a seat on the UN Security Council? Which would you like? How can I help you? Step right in. Welcome to the biggest foreign policy swap meet since Copenhagen in 2009. The Paris climate talks are not just about climate change. Paris isn't full of scientists, engineers or even economists. It's full of trade negotiators and lobbyists, most of whom know little about, and care even less about, what burning fossil fuels is doing to the atmosphere. Anyone who has ever solved a problem or chaired a meeting knows that it doesn't take 40,000 negotiators and "observers" to break an impasse or solve a problem. Indeed, a cynic might argue that the creation of a process that requires so many participants was designed to ensure that the market for coal and oil continues to grow each year. In 1992, world leaders first agreed that burning fossil fuels caused climate change, that we needed to burn less fossil fuels, and that rich countries should act first. Fossil fuel consumption and production have risen steadily since. Intriguingly, the same countries that tell us how hard it is to tackle climate change move quickly when it comes to wars and "real human tragedies" like the near collapse of the big banks in 2008. When the banks were in trouble, world leaders found time in their diaries to meet, trillions of dollars in their budgets, and trust not just in each other, but in the role of government. It's often said that there are no atheists in a foxhole, well, now we know there are no free marketeers in a banking crisis. There are plenty when it comes to climate change though. One thing is for sure, it did not take 40,000 delegates to rescue the banking system. And not once did the rich countries trying to "rescue the world economy" suggest that they couldn't act to save capitalism unless all the poor countries "pulled their weight". As the banks fell, and public cash was flying, no one knew "with certainty" that anything would work, and no one stopped to ask what the "fair share" of effort for Bangladesh would be. In what rich countries saw as a real crisis, no one demanded certainty or equity. They just wanted to avoid catastrophe, so they acted. It is time for those working to prevent dangerous climate change to admit that the vast majority of the world's leaders do not see climate change as a crisis; they see it as an opportunity. An opportunity to do "real foreign policy". Even the ones who are prepared to act see it as an opportunity to convert that willingness into some other foreign policy bauble. Why do it quickly and for free when you will get a reward if you drag your feet and look reluctant for long enough? It is wrong to dismiss the COP21 as a talk fest. It is much more than that. The talks about climate change are just the cover story for the real work of 195 countries twisting each other's arms and scratching each other's backs in ways that, by and large, are unrelated to task of shutting down coal mines or building more renewable energy. As in any negotiation, not all players start with the same resources, and not everyone is playing for the same objectives, but in a broad sense there are three broad ways the climate change bargaining chips are being played. The small island states that face submersion in the lifetime of their current inhabitants typically throw all of their chips on the table early. In the most passionate speech I have yet heard at the Paris talks, the Fijian Minister for Emergency Services, a man on the front line of the storm damage climate change is already causing, describes the "ambition" of limiting global warming to 2 degrees as being designed to save economies, not countries. He is right. But other countries just see the Pacific Island position as self- interested and, in turn, morally identical to Australia's desire to increase coal exports. The candour and passion of the island states delivers them little in the way of global emission reductions and even less in foreign policy wins. Indeed, they use all of their foreign policy chips buying tiny gains to deals that can't possibly save their countries. Then there is the strategy of the small number of fossil fuel energy exporting countries, Australia among them, who actually want greenhouse gas emissions to keep rising. For decades we used the impending arrival of "carbon capture and storage" to pretend there was no tension between our desire to increase coal exports and the world's desire to reduce emissions. Now we just pretend we want to sell more coal to help the poor. Maybe if we wanted to help the poor we shouldn't have slashed our aid budget. Key to Australia's success is ensuring that the climate change agenda is always focused on the abstract notion of "emissions" and commitments to reduce them in the future. When the debate strays into specific things like whether it makes sense for Australia to subsidise the doubling of our coal exports things get a bit messy. But while the public might ask impolite questions about why we need to build new coal mines if the world is going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, no such questions are raised at events like the COP. It would be impolite, and undiplomatic, to call a "valued participant" like Australia a deceiving hypocrite. Knowing this, Australian negotiators work on the assumption that as long as they pretend to share the rest of the world's objectives no one will call them out. Finally, there is the strategy adopted by the vast majority of countries at the Paris foreign policy bazaar, which is to snap up a foreign policy trinkets in exchange for supporting some push to replace "must" with "may" in a document with no legal force. It's not that they want climate change to happen, but they have other priorities. Why not get access to a new market in exchange for supporting words that don't mean much? So what is to be done? The first step is to get better at foreign policy. Those who want to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions need to become better at influencing foreign policy than those who want to increase them. For the last decade the environment movement has worked on the scientific and economic case for tackling climate change while the fossil fuel producers have worked on the foreign policy case for doing nothing. It's pretty clear who is winning. The second thing to do is shift the debate away from the abstract and towards the concrete. Kiribati President Anote Tong's call for a moratorium on new coal mines is diplomatically disruptive because it is simple, immediate and concrete. The same national leaders who find it easy to give eloquent speeches about the urgent need for emission reductions find it impossible to support a halt to building new coal mines in the present. Why do you think that is? No one would trust a politician who simply committed to making the tax system fair in the future without some detail about what they meant by fair and what actions they were willing to take to achieve it. Building new coalitions, shifting the terms of the debate and inventing new structures to facilitate new negotiations about the climate actions we should take rather than the global emissions we should reduce will not be easy. It wasn't easy to find a trillion dollars in the financial crisis. But when the stakes are high, history suggests we can do things that aren't easy. And history suggests that leaders don't need 40,000 people to help them make a decision. When the cards have been stacked against you it makes more sense to tip over the table than to bet all your chips. Of course Australia would say countries taking such diplomatic action are being impolite but we would say that. We think it is in our national interest for the world to burn more of our coal.

Insurance companies are shaping as the next battlefront in the local fossil fuels divestment fight. Australia's big four banks were the main targets last year, but activist groups say insurance companies are as important as banks in divestment, and fossil fuel companies cannot operate without them. Julien Vincent, lead campaigner at Market Forces, said the country's major insurers, and regulator APRA, have "their heads in the sand on climate change". Divestment campaigners will try to put pressure on the insurance sector "by forcing the industry to have an honest, public conversation about the realities of climate change hurting their sector". The top three Australian insurers - QBE, Suncorp and IAG - manage about $76 billion. "The first step is to show how entwined in the fossil fuel industry, and its fortunes, insurance is, from insuring physical assets and infrastructure as QBE does with coal mines, to holding equity in fossil fuel companies, to investing in projects and companies through asset management." In addition, insurance companies were on the "front line" of the impacts of climate change, Mr Vincent said. "Losing hundreds of millions of dollars on extreme weather events and putting it down to bad luck, while glossing over or ignoring climate change in their shareholder communications, is a massive disservice to the people who share in the risk of lost company value. It is similarly useless to policyholders who face increased premiums." The opening battle of the campaign will be to try to get Australia's listed major insurers to link climate change to profitability, such as by specifying the amount they have lost on extreme weather payouts in recent years. Activists all want insurers to address climate and carbon in their annual reports more comprehensively, or even at all, in some instances. But the ultimate aim is to pressure insurers to stop underwriting fossil fuel projects and investing in fossil fuel companies, and start investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The approach will be different from that to the banks, where the activists began by revealing which banks were most actively financing fossil fuels. That information is not available on insurers so they are instead starting at the other end - impacts and their risks to the industry. Of the three big listed insurers in Australia, QBE is the only one known to underwrite fossil fuel projects, but the size of its exposure is not clear. While QBE, Suncorp and IAG participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, none disclose so-called "Scope 3" emissions, which would include the projects they underwrite and their investment portfolios. A spokesperson for IAG said it works on "prevention, rather than cure" to improve Australia's resilience to climate change. "We work tirelessly to mitigate the risks that climate change may have to our business, communities and economy," the spokesperson said, and IAG is carbon neutral. A Suncorp spokesperson on Monday did not speak directly to climate change, but said: "Suncorp recognises that an increase in the frequency and severity of natural hazard events impacts the community and our business, and we adjust our provisions for such events annually." Suncorp said it is "publicly advocating for greater investment in natural disaster mitigation". It had only a small exposure to equity investments in fossil fuel companies, and they were managed externally, Suncorp said. QBE, the Insurance Council of Australia, and regulator APRA declined to comment. Late last year, ahead of the COP21 talks in Paris, the world's biggest insurer, Allianz, said it was divesting coal from its portfolios - but what that meant in dollar terms is not clear. And last week, the California Insurance Commissioner called for the insurance industry to voluntarily divest from thermal coal. London's insurance industry is far more advanced than Australia's on acknowledging climate change. Last year 15 insurance CEOs in the UK demanded urgent action on climate change. They made their commitments shortly after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said climate change could pose a significant long-term financial risk to insurers. \</doc>

Investors are increasingly balancing risk and return with environmental, social and governance responsibilities as a strategy ESG- focused investments can be made across individual securities, be they equities, bonds or managed funds. In its 2015 report on the ESG sector, the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia estimated that, at the end of 2014, core responsible investment or socially responsible investing portfolios exceeded $36 billion. This is against Morningstar's estimate of a total pool of $1.26 trillion of investments, which means responsible investments represent just 2.51 per cent of the market (up from 2.34 per cent the year before). The reasons being given to explain the large uptake in ESG in Australia as considered by the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia include: " An increasing number of examples of a company's poor management of ESG impacting shareholder value. " The growing demand by investors to align their savings with their beliefs. " An increase in activist groups engaging with the finance sector. " The increasing awareness by fiduciaries that consideration of ESG issues is an important element of their responsibilities. I understand that, for an investor looking at ESG, the different definitions of what is ethical can be confusing. It's not like comparing apples with apples. Nevertheless, the reality is that increasing numbers of institutional fund managers are taking ESG very seriously as the demand from their investors rises. Everyone, it seems, has a different definition. COP21 countries committed to pursue efforts to stop warming beyond 1.5C. To achieve this will force businesses globally to sharply reduce the use of fossil fuels to zero. One of the issues in Australia is that we as a country have an abundance of cheap coal. To exacerbate this situation further, until recently, wind and solar power generation experienced what can only be described as antagonistic government policies under the former prime minister Tony Abbott. However, the switch to Malcolm Turnbull is leading to more favourable policy support for renewables. There is also the concern around where to draw the line as to what is ethical and what is not. For example, there are some investors who would say that uranium is more ethical or responsible than coal, yet ethical investing convention currently holds the reverse view. Many listed companies, among them the big four banks, are responding to pressure from both shareholders and activist groups. Westpac has announced that all new financing proposals will be judged against the transition to a model aligned to a two-degree-temperature-rise economy, meaning that coal and oil and gas projects will struggle to gain support. This is a tangible way of making Westpac more accountable than its other peers on climate change. There is also a negative perception that sustainability and profitability are mutually exclusive. As recently observed by a trustee of a leading Australian charitable fund: "To those of us with the luxury of investing perpetual funds, the focus has to be return over the long run while not ignoring annual yield requirements. Applying such a focus, sustainability and profitability generally go hand in hand." In a June 2015 paper, Can ESG add Alpha, MSCI concludes ESG overlays do contribute to outperformance of the MSCI World Index and lead to stock-specific decisions indirectly attributed to ESG signals. ESG is going to continue to grow as an additional investment approach as both not-for-profit clients and increasingly families and individuals seek to align their investment approach with wanting to invest to ensure a better world can exist. The important takeaway is that these investors want their money to be run ethically - and the various categories of what is and is not ethical need to align with investor interest.Will Hamilton is managing partner of Hamilton Wealth Management, a Melbourne-based independent wealth manager HYPERLINK mailto:will.hamilton@hamiltonwealth.com.au will.hamilton@hamiltonwealth.com.au \</doc>

ACT Environment Minister Simon Corbell will attend the United Nations climate change talks in Paris, assured security measures will be tight and committed to showcasing the territory as a leader in greener living. The territory's Environment and Planning director-general, Dorte Ekelund, will also go on the 10-day trip. Mr Corbell said it was "certainly disconcerting" to visit Paris next week in the wake of the terror attacks earlier this month. "The attacks in Paris were an atrocity and it's certainly confronting to contemplate being in the city so soon afterwards," he said. "The government has had excellent advice from Commonwealth agencies and our own security assessments and the key issue is to be present and cautious in the way we manage our time in Paris." However, Mr Corbell said the attacks were also not a reason to not attend the conference on climate change. "And, indeed, the message from the Paris authorities, particularly the mayor of Paris, is that they are actively urging people and governments who are contemplating attending to continue to attend, continue to participate," he said. "It's important to not allow what happened in Paris with the terror attacks to undermine the significance of the negotiations that will be occurring there over the next two weeks and what they mean for the future of our planet in terms of addressing the impacts of greenhouse gas pollution." It is the 21st Conference of the Parties - the annual meeting of all countries which want to take action on climate change. Mr Corbell on Monday released a review of the ACT government's climate change strategy, Action Plan 2, which outlined the next steps for the ACT to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Those plans including switching to 90 per cent renewable energy in 2020. By then, electricity would account for just 14 per cent of emissions in the ACT. Mr Corbell said the reason the ACT was being represented in Paris amongst more than 190 nations and close to 150 heads of state and government including United States President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron, was because the United Nations was treating climate change as an issue which could also be addressed at a local level. "The UN has for the first time actively sought the involvement of sub-national governments as part of the COP21 [Conference of the Parties] discussion," he said. "Unlike Copenhagen, the UN and the French government have recognised there needs to be a voice for sub-national governments, regional governments, city governments at the table to demonstrate the ambition that is being put in place, the programs that are being driven by city and sub-national governments and that needs to be recognised as part of the UN negotiations. "So they are actively encouraging sub-national governments to attend. The ACT is increasingly recognised as a leader internationally in terms of its greenhouse gas abatements and its renewable energy targets and I will be participating in a broad range of events designed to highlight what is happening at the sub-national government level." As to potential critics of the trip, Mr Corbell maintained it was important for the ACT to be represented in Paris. "The ACT is recognised as a global leader and it's important to share our story with other governments and to demonstrate what's possible," he said. Mr Corbell said he would also be working to see what other cities and smaller jurisdictions could teach the ACT. Among the events Mr Corbell will attend is a summit for local leaders to be convened by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, the UN Secretary's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. He will also be involved in an assembly of states and regions which will discuss the Compact of States and Regions, which records greenhouse gas reduction targets made by state and regional governments. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill will also attend the summit, pending the outcome of bushfires now being fought in the state. An estimated 40,000 people are expected to attend the summit which starts on Monday and concludes on December 11. \</doc>

Strive for innovation "People will naturally strive to be a clear differentiator, to be truly recognised as innovators," Mr Wall said. "It would be unfortunate if in five years' time there wasn't that opportunity available for true innovation, because there's become a rating for every building, rather than just the pointy end of the market." Ms Madew said the rating system had to be wide-ranging and had scope to reward innovation. "We can't restrict our focus to a small number of buildings when massive market transformation is needed," she said. Ms Atkinson also congratulated the GBCA but said more was needed.

Next month's innovation statement will restore funding to Australia's flagship information technology research agency in a reversal of a decision by the Abbott government, which stripped the agency of assistance and caused embarrassment at last year's Group of 20 leaders' summit in Brisbane. The decision to restore funding to National Information Communications Technology Australia, which has been renamed Data61 and merged with the CSIRO, has been driven by the Turnbull government's emphasis on innovation and a commitment to be unveiled this weekend in Berlin to boost collaboration with Germany's prestigious Fraunhofer Institute. The Fraunhofer Institute is a global leader in commercialising research, which will be the central aim of the measures contained in the Turnbull government's innovation statement. Australia rates the lowest in the OECD at turning ideas into money. The federal government was embarrassed on the sidelines of last year's G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane when German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a physicist by trade, requested a tour of NICTA's Sydney facilities. Mr Turnbull, as communications minister, accompanied Dr Merkel on the tour, which was seized on by critics of the cuts to embarrass the government. Mr Turnbull, who heads overseas on Thursday morning for a series of bilateral visits and summits, including the G20 in Turkey, will arrive in Berlin late on Friday night Australian time. Mr Turnbull and Dr Merkel will release the recommendations of the Australia-Germany Advisory Group, established a year ago by Mr Abbott and Dr Merkel. Among its recommendations to boost trade, investment and cultural ties, will be a recommendation to increase the level of collaboration and co-operation between Fraunhofer and NICTA, including embracing Fraunhofer's methodologies for commercialising research. NICTA, or Data61, merged with the CSIRO earlier this year to cut costs and survive. It will stay merged with the CSIRO, meaning it does not need the full $42 million in funding a year restored because about half of that was for administration, a role which has been taken over by the CSIRO. Sources told The Australian Financial Review that the agency would receive about $20 million a year in funding, in the belief this would fully reverse the impact on research and development the Abbott cuts would have created, and allow it to continue to operate within the CSIRO as a separate entity. Though the amount of money is relatively small, one senior source said the message the government intended to send would be "enormous" in terms of the premium it placed in innovation and science, and to differentiate itself from Mr Abbott.

TIM PALMER: As world leaders prepare to meet for climate change talks in Paris next week, the Prince of Wales has warned of links between climate change and terrorism. Prince Charles says one of the main reasons for the conflict in Syria, and the terrorism that it's spawned, is climate change and drought. An Australian terrorism expert and a former defence chief agree. Simon Lauder reports. SIMON LAUDER: The conflict in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions more and helped the group Islamic State gain ground. Prince Charles believes the conflict has been driven by climate change. He spoke to Sky News UK. PRINCE CHARLES: There is very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land. And increasingly they came into the cities, and this combined to create a very difficult situation. REPORTER: Are you suggesting that there was a link between climate change and conflict and terrorism? PRINCE CHARLES: Absolutely. SIMON LAUDER: That interview was recorded several weeks ago, and has been released ahead of the Paris climate talks - now just a week away. Many climate scientists are cautious about linking individual weather events with climate change, so the suggestion that climate change is responsible for the Syrian crisis is open to debate. But it's not the first time it's been suggested. A paper published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that climate change exacerbated the country's drought and contributed to Syria's conflict. Professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, Greg Barton, says the drought was a contributing factor. GREG BARTON: This is a very sensible position. It's been widely put around over the last year or so that the drought in Syria from 2006 to 2009 which pushed up food prices added significantly to social stresses, and that was one of the precipitating factors in the civil war breaking up. So, actually Prince Charles was entirely sensible. The former chief of the Australian Defence Force, Professor Admiral Chris Barrie, says climate change is a significant and growing national security threat. CHRIS BARRIE: Of course there are a whole range of reasons why that conflict broke out. We simply argue that climate change consequences was one of the impacts, but interestingly enough, even though a major effort was made in 2008 to try and resurrect the problem over food, now the consequences of the civil war are making the situation even worse. SIMON LAUDER: Do you think there is a growing awareness of this link between climate change and its effects and global conflict? CHRIS BARRIE: Somebody like me - I am a member of the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change, we've been at this for several years now. To have somebody like the Prince of Wales talk about something elevates that conversation to a much higher level. SIMON LAUDER: And of course since the assaults on Paris earlier this month, there's been intense focus on terrorism. Do you think that will take away from efforts to address climate change? CHRIS BARRIE: People who are going to Paris for COP21 are going to experience a high level of security, and along with that, some nervousness about things that are going on. Whether that will detract, I think, from the negotiations that will take place, both in the public forums and behind closed doors, I doubt that because to be honest I think my read is people are now taking this seriously. They realise that the game is up and the planet and all of us - I mean all of us - have to really start doing something much more drastic in order to try and contain the impacts. SIMON LAUDER: The climate conference opens in Paris on the 30th of November. TIM PALMER: Simon Lauder reporting. \</doc>

Success will be rated on whether the dream is realised ANALYSIS By Peter Hannam France's special representative Laurence Tubiana shares hugs with United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres and French Foreign Minister and COP21 president Laurent Fabius after the final conference in Le Bourget, north of Paris, on Saturday. Is the Paris climate summit, as the French phrase goes, "the mountain that gives birth to the mouse"? The first test was passed - the summit didn't fail. None of the potential spoilers - such as fossil-fuel rich Saudi Arabia and Russia - stormed out or obstructed the final agreement involving 187 nations. But the real test will take decades to play out, long after the congratulatory speeches are a fading memory. "I'm totally frustrated," a European negotiator said after talks on the crucial climate finance section wrapped up this week. "This is a minimal deal." Going into the conference, global greenhouse emissions were on course to rise about 10 per cent from current levels by 2030. They remain so after Paris, at least until a stocktake in 2018 and a review of targets agreed in five- yearly intervals from 2020. By then, new leaders will have replaced the current climate champions, such as US President Barack Obama. Research by Malte Meinshausen and his team at the University of Melbourne shows emissions must fall more than 22 per cent from current levels by 2030 to avoid dangerous climate change. Paris has left the door open, Meinshausen says, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and the carbon reduction goals are in line with staying well below 2degrees. The problem is that what nations have offered as post-2020 targets "is woefully inadequate compared to the goalpost that the international community has set itself". But what might shift those goalposts to within range? Will political pressure prompt Malcolm Turnbull to lift his government's post- 2020 targets, which countries such as China rank as among the least ambitious in the world? Nations like India were wary - with reason as it turns out - about the extra funds the rich world might stump up to encourage a faster exit from fossil fuels. After Paris, the target of $US100 billion ($139 billion) a year climate aid by 2020 may be extended to as late as 2025. When it does get a review, the figure is supposed to rise above that floor - but by how much (and whether it will be inflation-indexed) is left for some future conference to approve. True, China and other emerging nations are already providing funds - and these will be welcomed. In the eyes of the frustrated negotiator, the blurring in Paris of the distinction between rich and poor nations - a practice since the Montreal Protocol in 1989 to phase out ozone-destroying chemicals - may be one of this conference's biggest achievements. While the investment world will get a signal from Paris that the world is heading for a lower-carbon future, the challenge remains huge. The 1.5 degree temperature goal means new carbon-dioxide emissions must be phased out by 2050, while the target date would be 2070 for a 2-degree limit, says John Schellnhuber, director of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. "My thinking is that 2degrees is probably the red line for the Greenland ice sheet melting," Schellnhuber said. Climate talks have changed since the initial 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. Now, scientists are onlookers in what is mostly a political exercise. Take Pakistan, which aligned with blocs opposed to the more aggressive climate action at Paris despite being one of the most vulnerable countries. As Schellnhuber notes, Pakistan has 60 per cent of its workforce in agriculture and a population set to swell from 200 million to 350 million over the next 25 years. "It's crazy. Pakistan is squeezed from all sides: glacier melt, the big floods, and the jet stream is changing," Schellnhuber says. "This country could become unmanageable." Whether the leaders of such countries come to tackle climate change as a mountain, rather than a mouse, will determine whether the Paris dream is ultimately realised. \</doc>

TALKING POINT: Paris agreement is a political test for Turnbull Malcolm Turnbull will indeed need to be agile and innovative to keep his own party from splitting before the next election so he can make good on Australia's commitments at the Paris climate talks. The 2017 review of the Direct -Action policy signals he is intent on using the safeguard mechanism to set up a baseline and credit scheme. Australia also signed up to the New Zealand declaration to set up rules for carbon trading, allowing businesses to offset growing emissions overseas. The linking of coal exports to development during the conference and the approval of the Carmichael mine show that the -Coalition is keen to flog off our fossil fuels, even as the market signal goes the other way. The line that we mustn't get ahead of the pack is no longer possible after Paris. The market has spoken. John Shute, East Brunswick, Vic The climate agreement says countries are not legally bound to reduce greenhouse emissions and developed countries are under no binding agreement to contribute to the $100 billion a year Green Climate Fund. Even if all countries stick to the targets in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, total world emissions will nevertheless continue to rise by up to 20 per cent by 2030. The developed world's emissions amount to about 30 per cent while countries such as India and China have made it clear they will not jeopardise economic growth and rising living standards. The Coalition government has said it will not move ahead of the rest of the world and it is incumbent on us ordinary voters to hold it to it. Ian Hipwell, Sydney, NSW It's about time each adult assumed responsibility to improve our carbon footprint. Plug leaks in your home insulation, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off the lights in any empty room, drive less by consolidating trips or taking public transport, waste less food, and eat less meat. Perhaps the biggest thing individuals can do is to take fewer aeroplane trips. Joseph Ting, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Qld As US Secretary of State John Kerry says, the pledge of billions of dollars by the first world governments is perhaps the most extraordinary market opportunity in mankind's history. This creates a speculative market opportunity in a global project that is flying by the seat of its pants. The promise of a bank of billions of dollars will immediately attract the attention of shifty operators who are in the global market for financial gain. John Bell, Heidelberg Heights, Vic Supposing that efforts to control climate change succeed, will these presage a world commission to predict and adjust for natural perturbations such as ice ages? Would a prediction of one find renewed favour for coal mines? Moreover, as climate control science develops, who is to decide what climate we should all aim for? Beyond temperature, there could be other tweaks. For example, if a means is found to offset temperature rise from increase in CO2, could then CO2 levels be optimised for plant growth? David Ferry, Parrearra, Qld Observational evidence shows that prediction errors don't average out enough to avoid an unreliable final forecast. The 2C temperature rise limit talked about in Paris is guessed fantasy, not a product of science. Judged by limited observational evidence, present-day climate -forecasting mostly errs in forecasting inaccurately great warming, and is not reliable enough to justify any government action to limit CO2 emissions. So 40,000 people descended on Paris for the COP21 climate change talks, causing a massive carbon footprint. They then try to explain this away by buying carbon credits. What a load of codswallop. If they had all gone home and planted 10 trees each, it would have been better.Ron Horton, Halls Head, WA \</doc>

A Paris rally to demand strong action on climate change has been cancelled due to concerns about terrorism. Organisers were hoping as many as 200,000 people would have marched. Environmental campaigners were disheartened by the decision. However they have vowed to find creative ways of drawing attention to the talks. French Campaigner for 350.org Nicolas Haeringer said: "While this makes it difficult to go forward with our original plans, we will still find a way for people in Paris to make the call for climate justice heard, and we encourage everyone around the world to join a global climate march and raise their voices louder than ever." Similar marches are planned for cities around the world, with local campaigners confirming the Australian marches would go on. Official delegates to the climate conference have not been deterred by the terrorism. Environment Minister Greg Hunt said failing to attend the upcoming talks would "hand the terrorists a victory." "As the Prime Minister has already indicated, we will absolutely be attending the climate change talks in Paris as planned," he said. "This is the very moment for global action on climate and global resolve on countering terrorism." The ABC spoke to several people scheduled to attend the talks. All expressed their solidarity with the French people and their determination that the talks should not be derailed. Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Australian National University's Centre for Climate Economics and Policy, said he was not aware of anyone altering their arrangements for Paris. "With security that tight there's a very low risk of anything dangerous happening. It's more going to be a problem for the logistics of the meeting in terms of getting people in and out of the place." He said that more heads of government may in fact attend, in a show of solidarity with the French government. However he did note that a cancellation of related events would risk some elements of the meeting being compromised. "The major effect of that is that it diminishes the value of the event in terms of its aspect as a trade fair. It doesn't have a major effect on the negotiations as such." Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a research organisation based in Germany, agreed. "Potential curtailment of civil society activities could have a negative effect on the necessary political pressure for increasing the level of ambition and quality of the agreement overall," he said. But he said, contrary to expectations, that he had been inundated with emails from colleagues from around the world emphasising their commitment to attend the meeting. "I think people working on this issue from around the world, irrespective of their different religious beliefs, share a common belief in the potential of humanity to work together to solve problems," he said. In the wake of the attacks, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Insiders on Sunday that: "At this time, the French government is expecting that the conference of the parties - the climate change conference - will go ahead and I have no doubt that it will go ahead. And if it goes ahead, which I'm sure it will, I will certainly be there, as indeed will other ministers." A spokesperson for Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who is in the Philippines at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, said her plans to be at the summit had also not changed. Nick Nuttall, spokesperson for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will host the talks, confirmed " COP21 will go ahead as planned." "Security is always tight at UN climate conferences, but understandably will be tighter in Paris," he said. \</doc>

\~\~ EDS: Takes in Climate Putin, Climate Bank, Climate Study \~\~ PARIS, Nov 9 AFP - France's top diplomat, who will preside over a year-end Paris summit tasked with inking a climate rescue pact, has warned of looming planetary "catastrophe" if negotiations fail. \~\~ Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius's remarks on Sunday came as separate reports warned of the devastating effects of global warming on the poor and those living in megacities around the world. \~\~ "It is life on our planet itself which is at stake," Fabius told journalists as ministers and climate envoys from 70 countries met for pre-summit talks to iron out tough political questions. \~\~ Russia, a major oil producer, is seen as a deal-maker or -breaker in the years-long attempt to negotiate the world's first truly universal pact to curb climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions. \~\~ The UN's climate science panel has warned of an average temperature rise of "four, five, six degrees, if we do not act extremely quickly", he said. \~\~ Separate reports released on Sunday echoed those concerns. \~\~ "The poor are more vulnerable to climate-related shocks than wealthier people because they are more exposed, lose more in relative terms, and lack the financial systems and social safety nets that would allow them to better prepare and cope," it said. \~\~ It added that a worse-case scenario of a 4C rise could particularly affect China, with four of the 10 most devastated cities in that forecast set to be Chinese. \~\~ A global deal to prevent worst case-scenario warming is meant to be inked by ministers at the end of a November 30-December 11 Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) in the French capital. \~\~ The three-day ministerial "pre-COP" from Sunday to Tuesday must seek political convergence on key issues still dividing nations, to avoid a repeat of the 2009 Copenhagen summit which ended without a binding global pact. \~\~ But the UN this week issued a fresh warning that pledges submitted to date set the stage for warming of closer to 3C, or more. \~\~ Ministers will base their discussions in the coming days on a rough draft of a deal compiled by rank-and-file diplomats over years of tough negotiations in the UN climate forum. \~\~ For now, the blueprint remains little more than a laundry list of often directly opposing national options for dealing with the challenge at hand. \~\~ They also want assurances of finance to make the shift from cheap and abundant fossil fuel to greener energy sources, and to shore up defences against climate change-induced superstorms, drought, flood and sea-level rise. \~\~ AFP sn \</doc>

Lower demand for fossil fuels due to climate change constraints has removed the need for any new investment in liquefied natural gas in Australia for the next 10 years, leaving $US68 billion of proposed projects on the shelf, according to high-profile UK-based research group Carbon Tracker. The group, whose 2013 report on "unburnable carbon" drew global attention, found that some 97 per cent of global LNG required through to 2025 can be met by projects that have already been committed to. Of the $US73 billion of LNG investment still required, much will be provided by low-cost projects in the US and east Africa, making some $US283 billion of proposed projects worldwide surplus to requirements, said Carbon Tracker, an independent group of financial and energy experts. The total includes $US82 billion of unnecessary LNG investments proposed in Canada and $US71 billion in the US, as well as the Australian projects. The report, to be launched in London on Tuesday, sounds a warning for investors counting on projections from gas companies of strong investment opportunities in LNG. It finds that no new investment in LNG is required by Woodside Petroleum in the next decade, nor by majors Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BG Group. "This picture questions whether the gas industry can expand its LNG capacity significantly in the next decade beyond what has already been committed to," Carbon Tracker's report said. "Shareholders need to question whether the strategy presentations of the companies add up." The group's findings are based on expectations of much lower demand for gas than the companies themselves are forecasting, assuming international commitments to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. It allows for some growth in global gas demand through to 2040 - unlike for coal and oil - but at a rate that enables only the most competitive supply projects to go ahead. Even after 2025, only minimal new investment in LNG supply in Australia is required, Carbon Tracker found, adding that the depressed demand outlook would allow only for projects with a supply cost of less than $US10 per million British thermal units. That rules out Woodside's Browse floating LNG project in Western Australia, its Sunrise project in the Timor Sea and its Kitimat venture in Canada, as well as any expansion of the Queensland coal seam gas ventures by BG Group, Santos or Origin Energy, according to Carbon Tracker's cost curve of new projects. ExxonMobil's Scarborough LNG project off WA also misses the cut, as does an expansion of Chevron's Gorgon venture. In a sobering assessment of growth prospects for Shell after its $US70 billion takeover of BG Group, Carbon Tracker calculates that the combined group has $US58.9 billion of proposed projects for which there is no need through to 2025, rising to $US85 billion in the period through to 2035. It finds that only $US6 billion of Shell-BG projects would be required through to 2035 if gas demand is as low as it is assuming. Carbon Tracker finds that only three major gas companies have projects that require investment in the next 10 years - Italian major Eni, the US terminal developer Cheniere Energy and US oil and gas producer Noble Energy. "Investors should scrutinise the true potential for growth of LNG businesses over the next decade," said James Leaton, Carbon Tracker's head of research. "The current oversupply of LNG means there is already a pipeline of projects waiting to come on stream. It is not clear whether these will be needed and generate value for shareholders." International commitment to limit the increase in the average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius has been growing in the lead-up to the United Nations-hosted COP21 climate summit in December in Paris, with the G7 agreeing to reduce emissions by 70 per cent below 2010 levels by 2050. Carbon Tracker's 2013 report brought the issue of "stranded" coal investments into the mainstream public gaze. \</doc>

BP's head of energy economics has defended the oil major's global energy outlook against criticism it has failed to take into account climate change commitments made at the COP 21 meeting in Paris, saying more ambitious projections on renewable energy and coal use aren't warranted. Paul Appleby acknowledged that even in the most aggressive low-carbon scenario in BP's 2016 energy outlook, the changes forecast in energy use fail to meet the goal to limit global temperature increases to well within 2 degrees. "We don't yet see the policies in place that are going to achieve what the countries have said they are going to achieve," London-based Mr Appleby said. "We need more on policy front and even faster development on technology to give the world the option of getting on the path to limiting expected temperatures increase to less than 2 degrees." BP's latest outlook, released earlier this month, estimates global energy demand will increase by 34 per cent between 2014 and 2035, by which time fossil fuels will still dominate, accounting for almost 80 per cent of supplies. Gas would grow fastest among fossil fuels, rising by 1.8 per cent a year, while oil demand grows at 0.9 per cent a year. While growth of coal slows sharply, it is still seen rising by 0.5 per cent a year through to 2035, driven by India and south-east Asia. Mr Appleby said the Paris accord had caused BP to step up its forecasts for renewable energy use, with the 2035 projection some 14 per cent above last year's. But it sees renewables still only accounting for 9 per cent of primary energy by 2035, much lower than estimates by the International Renewable Energy Agency. Expectations around energy efficiency have also been ramped up, Mr Appleby said. BP's estimates for continued modest growth in coal use, including in China, have also alarmed environmental groups, some of which argue Chinese demand already peaked in 2013. Although it has slashed the growth rate, BP's base case still sees China's coal demand expanding by 0.2 per cent annually through 2035, down from more than 8 per cent in 2000-14. In contrast, ExxonMobil has predicted global demand would peak in about 2025 and then decline. \</doc>

Taxpayers have forked out -almost $13,000 for South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, his department's chief executive and two political staffers to stay in a five-star hotel for the Paris climate change talks in December. This comes after taxpayers outlaid more than $185,500 for a private film crew to follow the Labor Premier on two overseas trips, including to Paris, to produce promotional videos. Government figures showed it cost about $53,600 for two people from Adelaide company 57 Films to follow Mr Weatherill on the Paris trip. According to credit card -receipts for the Paris trip, released by the government, Mr Weatherill spent $3559.33 to stay for four nights at the luxury W Paris- Opera hotel, which occupies an 1870s Haussmann-style building and faces the Palais Garnier opera house in the city's 9th -arrondissement. The hotel boasts "plush rooms that come with ... en suite bathrooms with rainfall showers" and amenities "that include a 24/7 gym, a trendy restaurant and a hip lounge bar". Department of Premier and Cabinet chief executive Kym Winter-Dewhirst spent $3278.72 at the hotel on December 8, records show. Chris Burford, the Premier's media adviser, racked up $3011.90, and Matthew Ryan, the Premier's deputy chief of staff, spent 3010.37 at the hotel in Paris's ritzy Right Bank. The total bill to taxpayers was $12,860. Opposition Treasury spokesman Rob Lucas said the splurge on a luxury hotel was not a prudent use of taxpayers' money. "South Australians will be angry that Jay Weatherill and his staff have spent so much public money to stay at a five-star Paris hotel," he said. "The Premier spending nearly $900 of public money per night to stay in Paris is excessive and doesn't meet public expectations." Asked why such an expensive hotel was chosen, a spokesman for the Premier said it was an important moment for the climate change issue. "The Premier was in Paris representing the state at the COP 21 Climate Change Conference," the spokesman said. "This was the largest gathering of world leaders and sub-national governments around the issue of climate change in history."During the trip, Mr Weatherill also visited London at taxpayers' expense to inspect a British soccer club aiming to become "environmentally sustainable" and meet green energy advocate Dave Vince, the chief executive of wind turbine company Ecotricity, who showed him around facilities at Forest Green Rovers, which he owns, in Gloucestershire. \</doc>

United States oil giant ExxonMobil has predicted that global demand for coal will peak in about 2025 and then fall into terminal decline as natural gas gains the ascendancy amid increased efforts to clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions. The decline of coal, now the world's second-largest fuel, will be driven by moves by the industrial and power generation sectors to improve energy efficiency and switch to lower-emitting fuels, the energy major said in its 2016 outlook for energy, released overnight Australian time. By 2040, coal is expected to account for 20 per cent of global energy demand, down from a quarter in 2014. The bleak forecast for coal contrasts with bullish expectations for gas, which is expected to meet 40 per cent in the world's growth for energy demand by 2040 and play its part to cut the carbon intensity of the global economy by half by that time. Demand for gas would rise by 50 per cent over the next 26 years, Exxon said. But almost as much of the growth in global energy demand is expected to be met by nuclear and renewable energy, including bio-energy, hydro, geothermal wind and solar. By 2040, those fuels would meet nearly a quarter of energy supplies, with nuclear the biggest chunk. Exxon is predicting that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will peak in about 2030, and then start to decline. In the OECD, emissions would fall by about 20 per cent between 2014 and 2040. William Colton, vice-president of ExxonMobil's corporate strategic planning division, pointed to the climate deal reached at the recent COP 21 conference in Paris and said while policies to achieve the targets are still emerging, "the outlook continues to anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time". By 2040, oil and gas are still expected to meet almost 60 per cent of energy needs, while nuclear and renewables would meet almost 25 per cent. Oil is set to provide one-third of energy in 2040, remaining the world's No.1 fuel. Last month, the International Energy Agency wound back its forecasts for coal demand growth, predicting demand would increase just 0.8 per cent a year out to 2020 because of the downturn in the Chinese economy and the drive to cut emissions. Exxon predicts that demand for electricity will rise 65 per cent through to 2040, but the share produced from coal would fall to about 30 per cent, down from about 40 per cent in 2014. \</doc>

For a moment Bill Gates, the world's richest man, cut a lonely figure on stage at the Paris climate conference, announcing a $US20 billion ($27.5bn) fund to do for renewable energy what similar public-private partnerships had done for the personal computer, the internet and medicine. Chairs set aside for US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were empty. But as Mr Gates outlined his belief that innovation was the -answer for both poverty eradication and combating climate change, leaders representing more than half the world's population joined him on stage. Like the flowering of an idea whose time had come, Mr Gates, Mr Obama and Mr Modi were joined by leaders from Britain, Japan, France and a dozen other countries who had signed up to support "Mission Innovation". Australia has joined 19 countries in Mission Innovation to pledge an increase in research and development spending to $US20bn within five years. A group of 18 billionaire investors, led by Mr Gates, has formed another coalition to take the clean energy breakthroughs from the laboratory to market. Mr Gates said the challenge was to make renewable energy clean, reliable and cheaper than today's hydrocarbon energy. "I think we will look back on today as an important milestone in achieving that goal," he said. Mr Obama said the research effort would concentrate on existing and new technologies. "Access to energy and a better life is a universal aspiration and so is a clean environment," he said. "We will ensure in the spirit of climate justice that the light of a few does not put out the opportunity of the many still on the -initial steps of the development ladder. The rich must leave enough room for the developing countries to grow. "We can make conventional energy cleaner and we can -develop newer sources of renewable energy. "This is a global responsibility towards our collective future." Australia's contribution to the increased research effort would involve an additional $100 million. Mr Turnbull will outline where the money is going to come from for the renewable innovation spending in the government's innovation statement, which could be announced in the next week. The Prime Minister, who met Mr Gates before the announcement, said everyone agreed innovation was the key to solving climate problems. "Innovation is an absolutely key priority for my government," he said. "It is the key to this effort here in Paris and ... the key to ensuring our prosperity as a first-world nation in Australia," he said. Mr Gates said research was needed into many options. "Each of them will have huge problems but if we back over 50 breakthrough projects we know that several of those will give us the -solutions that we need," he said. Mr Gates said his role had been to bring together private investors so that once an idea had been proven at the research level, start- up capital could be raised and the risk moved to the private sector. The focus would be on early- stage companies that could be scaled up to major carbon solutions. "In the energy sector you have to be patient and there will be a lot of dead ends," Mr Gates said. The project received widespread applause."This announcement at the start of COP21 signals serious intent, both by the private and public sectors, to act on climate change," said British economist Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics and Political Science. \</doc>

Bill Shorten has unleashed a strong attack on the "green" credentials of Malcolm Turnbull ahead of the G20 meeting in Turkey and the subsequent Paris climate summit, depicting the new Liberal leader as all talk and of selling out on climate policy in exchange for the prime ministership. In exclusive comments to Fairfax Media, Mr Shorten upped the ante on Sunday, calling on Mr Turnbull, for the first time in such explicit terms, to lift the Abbott government's 2030 emissions targets now that he is in charge. "We simply can't afford Malcolm Turnbull to be Tony Abbott in drag when it comes to taking action on climate change," he said. "There is a real risk that despite all the talk, Australia will actually continue to go backwards on climate change action. "I'm worried that all the talk and platitudes is just a mask to hide embarrassing inaction, to keep the climate sceptics in the Coalition happy," he said. Mr Shorten said Mr Abbott's 26 to 28 per cent cuts on year 2005 emissions by 2030 were manifestly inadequate and showed Australia even under Mr Turnbull's stewardship, was determined to bring up the rear rather than lead the international effort to limit global warming to 2 degrees maximum, this century. "Tony Abbott was a joke on the international stage when it came to climate change, but Malcolm Turnbull has signed up to the exact same policy," he said. Mr Shorten also slammed Direct Action, based around the $2.5 billion emissions reduction fund which pays polluters to lower their emissions. "This is the policy Mr Turnbull famously called fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and if he goes to Paris with Tony Abbott's policies, he will be exposed as a fraud on climate change." Along with US President Barack Obama, Mr Turnbull has indicated he is to attend the United Nations Paris talks - known officially as the conference of parties or COP 21 - as a statement of Australia's intention to play a strong role. But his government has also indicated it is not prepared to negotiate at the Paris summit and will not have its emissions targets themselves, on the table. Rather, its efforts would go into pushing the world towards technological solutions such as improved renewable energy production through research and development. In a significant change of presentation, if not actual policy stance, Australia has recently been selected to chair the UN-sponsored Green Climate Fund, once dubbed by Tony Abbott as Bob Brown's green bank on an international scale. \</doc>

The global summit season ends not with a bang, but with a whimper. We've had the G20, APEC, and the Paris COP21 . Expectations of the conference could hardly be lower. Nearly 15 years of Doha round talks have delivered little, and prospects remain bleak. The talks hit a wall in July of 2008. Various observers thought an agreement was close at that point, but talks broke down over disagreements about agriculture - chief protagonists included the US on one side and India on the other. Since 2008, agreement on the Doha round has become even more difficult. The large emerging countries have grown more powerful, and the world of yesteryear, where an agreement rose or fell on the basis of a US-European deal, is gone. There are new kids on the block. A minor triumph occurred at the Ninth Ministerial in Bali in 2013. The "Bali Package" was born. An important part of the package was the Trade Facilitation Agreement, which basically was an agreement to cut red tape. Remarkably, agriculture was an issue again. For agreements forged in the 21st century, it is striking that we always seem to get stuck on issues that belong in the 19th. In any case, a compromise was reached in 2014, and now the agreement is set to enter into force once enough WTO members have ratified it. The whole episode highlights how difficult things are. And so we find ourselves in Nairobi, with little progress in sight. A draft communique has been HYPERLINK https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/hod_draft_decl_27112015.pdf released before the meetings There is no doubt the WTO has disappointed. Proponents of bilateral and regional deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, argue that this disappointment leads us naturally down the route they prefer. If a global deal is out of reach, so the argument goes, these deals are now the only game in town, and so we have to sign on. That's wrong. They are not the only game in town. Unilateral liberalisation is still on the table. Why on earth does Australia still have tariffs? We could eliminate them tomorrow if we wished. And we should. However, advocates of these preferential agreements suggest the deals will pave the way for global reform in a way that unilateral liberalisation cannot. The hope is these agreements can be stitched together one day and facilitate a truly global deal. If that's the case - and it's a big if - a lot of thought needs to be given to the design of these agreements. If they are stitched together, then their terms will, by default, form the basis of the hoped-for global, consolidated, settlement. One area where it appears little such attention has been paid intellectual property. Intellectual property protections seem to be motivated by a desire to increase innovation and economic growth. However, there is a considerable amount of economic literature suggesting existing intellectual property protections actually inhibit innovation. One of my favourite books, Against Intellectual Monopoly by Michele Boldrin and David Levine, summarises this literature. They argue that more intellectual protection leads to less innovation, as companies divert attention away from creation toward legal manoeuvring intended to protect their intellectual turf.Yet many preferential agreements, including those that Australia has signed up to, enshrine in international treaty strong intellectual property protections. These protections go further than existing multilaterally agreed minimums. Concern about this practice has led many reviews of Australian policy to suggest caution in adopting these intellectual property provisions. Examples include the Harper Review, the Pharmaceutical Patents Review, and the Productivity Commission's review into free trade agreements from 2010. The Productivity Commission has been asked to conduct an inquiry into Australia's intellectual property arrangements that may look at this issue in detail once again. I certainly hope they do apply their intellectual firepower to this question ???again! However, I fear that just like its forebears, any recommendations in this area will be left to gather dust. We have a new Prime Minister who emphasises innovation. There is potentially no more important part of our trade policy than how it relates to innovation. And we look to be getting it wrong. In Australia and globally. \</doc>

THE slaughter of civilians in the heart of Paris opens a crushing new front in the war against terror. Paris was already reeling from the devastating slaughter in January of 12 people associated with the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, and another five in related attacks. The outpouring of grief for this loss was felt around the world. Ten months later, another 126 or more are dead, many slain at restaurants and bars close to the offices of Charlie Hebdo. The face of terrorism is constantly shifting. In the week that we learn the Islamic exe-cut-ioner known as Jihadi John was killed, a new plague of terrorists, some speaking French, have brought one of the world's most beautiful and civilised cities to its knees. While the latest perpetrators have not declared themselves, they have in common with other Islamic fundamentalists a hatred of those of us who do not adhere to their extremist rhetoric of hate. In scenes unparalleled in modern peace time, France has closed its borders, declared a nationwide state of emergency and sent the army into Paris. What this means for the global Paris COP 21 climate talks at the end of the month which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, United States President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron are due to attend cannot yet be known. Those details can wait. Today, every decent person is gripped by grief that terror has struck Paris again. The news spread with a rapidity we now expect from modern communications. Hostages held inside the Bataclan concert hall tweeted their terror to the world; Facebook implemented its Safety Check tool so people could check through a central point that friends and family were safe. And the Twitter hashtag #ouvreporte directed people to homes willing to take in those seeking safety. All this made real the trauma Parisians were going through. Two days before the killings, President Francois Holland tweeted a message for Remembrance Day, telling people to remember that peace was fragile and war never far away. Yesterday, he called for the nation to summon its strength because it had been called on again to vanquish terrorism in its midst. The terrorist must not win, but Paris - the home of liberty, equality and brotherhood - reminds us of the price that must be paid to uphold the civilising principles in which we believe. The world must continue to rally behind France. This is a battle they do not fight alone.Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Andrew Holman, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, 5000 \</doc>

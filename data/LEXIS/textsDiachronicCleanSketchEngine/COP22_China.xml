During a Wednesday debate at the European Parliament on the results of the 22nd United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) recently held in Marrakech, Morocco, Member of European Parliament (MEP) Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy said "China is one of the leading countries in the post-Paris process." Gathered in Strasbourg for their plenary session, MEPs were examining the progress made at COP22 Dutch parliamentarian Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy expressed himself to the Strasbourg hemicycle in praising the work of European Commissioner on Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete for "the way he works very inclusively for the parliament, but also for the way he is dealing with the other important states in the world and especially for the way you have improved the relationship with China ... which is very encouraging to see." "At the start of the Marrakech COP I had one hope, that is that the entire world would send a message to Washington that the Paris agreement and the process after that would be irreversible, that the world would move towards this zero carbon economy," said this member of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. "China is one of the leading countries in the post-Paris process, and that is extremely encouraging," he congratulated. "What happened in Marrakech shows how very well how rapidly the geopolitical scene is changing at the moment," he added. "Even countries like India seem to be much more determined than they were a few months ago," he specified. Climate action is "also an economic question," insisted Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy. The MEP judged, however, that "Europe is still leading by example, but we need to be careful. Look at the difficult internal negotiations," he lamented, noting "We have to be extremely careful there. This is also a race on technology and Europe should win that race." \</doc>

Africa presents united front and calls for action at the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) scheduled from Nov. 7 to 18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Africa is among the world's regions most vulnerable to climate change, reiterated a statement from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on Monday. Africa's key priorities include ensuring that global ambitions and historic responsibilities regarding means of implementation, particularly predictable financing, to facilitate low carbon climate resilient development are in line with the continent's development goals, said the statement. A collaborative partnership between the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the African Union Commission, ECA, and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) established the Africa Pavilion in the blue zone of the COP22 village, dedicated to engagement, networking and dialogue, said the statement. The Pavilion also aims to provide a platform for the voices of the continent to be heard. The Pavilion embodies the united front of an Africa "speaking with one voice" in articulating its interests given the high stakes of climate change negotiations The Africa Pavilion features a dynamic program of round-tables, conferences and bilateral meetings, where key issues of adaptation and mitigation; green industrialization; agriculture; transport; health; water and sanitation; biodiversity and innovation are discussed. Both COP21 President and French Minister of the Environment, Energy and the Sea, in charge of international climate negotiations, Segolene Royal and COP22 President and Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Salaheddine Mezouar, visited the Africa pavilion in the early days of COP22 . COP22 , and especially on Africa Day, on Wednesday, according to the statement. COP22 is the fourth COP to take place on African soil, the second time in Morocco, presenting an important opportunity to place special emphasis on the continent's needs and proposals. COP22 \</doc>

The message was delivered by the European Parliament delegation, consisting of 12 parliament members, before they fly to Marrakech, Morocco to attend the second week of United Nations climate change conference . Moroccan security stand guard in front of the entrance of the World Climate Change Conference 2016 ( COP22 With the election of Donald Trump as the next US president, who has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the European Union indicated on Friday that it will work closely with China to prevent the US from backsliding on its commitment to making the Paris accord effective. The message was delivered by the European Parliament delegation, consisting of 12 parliament members, before they fly to Marrakech, Morocco to attend the second week of United Nations climate change conference . The parties which have approved the Paris agreement will embark on their first talks at the conference and Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama have signed three presidential documents to inject special political will in the process of talking and approving the global pact. Though it is still unknown whether the incoming Trump administration will reject the Paris agreement, during his presidential campaign Trump called global warming a hoax and promised towithdraw from the US from the accord. "Trump's victory will undoubtedly have severe consequences on the way of tackling climate change at global level," Jo Leinen, vice-chair of the European Parliament delegation told China Daily on Friday in an email. "The EU and China should join forces in Marrakech in order to move forward the Paris agreement." Leinen predicted that Trump's election risks to "paralyze or even jeopardize the process of ratification and implementation of the Paris agreement." China and the US approved the agreement shortly before the G20 summit in Hangzhou in September and European Union followed the suit in October. The leading global emitters' approval and ratification have paved the way to ensure that the agreement took effect earlier this month. Leinen said in Paris, China and the EU played a key role of honest brokers among different "camps" during the negotiations, which contributed to the final conclusion of the ground-breaking agreement. "And this time in Marrakech, China is expected to line up with the EU," he said. "These two global powers should assume their responsibility by forming a new coalition with the aim of fighting for a progressive global climate policy." The delegation chair, Giovanni La Via, said in Marrakesh that the 12 parliament members will work on the implementation of the Paris agreement. "We helped to make it become binding, but it is evident that the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions currently on the table are not sufficient to achieve the objective of limiting climate change to well below 2 degrees", said La Via. "We shall also work to consolidate the trust between developed and developing countries." "Marrakesh should send out the signal that the path chosen in Paris is irreversible", said Leinen. "The climate targets need to be achieved step by step in the coming years. The European Union must be an engaged player in this process and act as a broker between the partners of the North and the South."

The United Nations conference on climate change later this year in Morocco will mark a "turning point" in fighting climate change, president of the COP22 Salaheddine Mezouar said Thursday in the Moroccan city of Skhirate. Speaking at the opening of the Informal consultations in preparation for the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Mezouar added that the conference will significantly contribute to "meeting the urgent needs of a united humanity overwhelmed by climate change." COP22 He said that the large number of participants in Thursday's meeting is "a proof of the undeniable wave of mobilization which marks the beginning of long and necessary way for the implementation of the Paris Agreements." The participants in the informal consultations, to be held for two days behind closed doors, will discuss topics that reflect the concerns of hundreds of thousands of citizens in the world and the needs of all mankind for years to come, said COP22 president, stressing that sustainable development is an "absolute" need and a "fundamental condition to our collective well-being." "Fair and sustainable" solutions are possible thanks to the mobilization of public and private actors, large and small businesses, civil society and collaborative networks, said Mezouar. These informal consultations are bringing together over 140 delegates from 50 countries, to discuss the various priority issues for Parties to make the COP22 a successful event and an impactful step in the implementation of the Paris Agreements. \</doc>

Moroccan Foreign Minister and COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar (L) and French Minister for Environment Segolene Royal launch the opening of the UN Climate Change Conference 2016 ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, November 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies] MARRAKECH - The integrity and fairness should remain the major principles of the 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), a senior Chinese official said here on Monday. Xie Ji, deputy chief of Chinese delegation to COP22 in Marrakech of Morocco, made the remarks and expected all the parties could reach a consensus for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. As the first UN climate change conference after the Paris Agreement which took effects three days ago, the COP22 kicked off on Monday morning, and around 20,000 participants from the globe will discuss in the next 11 days on the details related to execution of the Paris Agreement. While negotiating on some technique and procedure issues, Xie said developed countries and developing ones show different attitudes and positions, underlining that only insisting the principle of "common interest and different responsibility" could cover the interests of all the parties. As the biggest developing country, China is playing a model role on the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, he stressed. China makes great positive efforts to reduce its emission and initializes the green and carbon-low development mode. The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued last Friday a five-year plan to reduce greenhouse gas emission and showed its ambition by targeting the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18 percent compared with that in 2015 by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, China would continue to help developing countries to cut their greenhouse gas emission and improve their abilities of handling climate changes, especially climate disasters. "We have a concrete program to help our developing partners. We will help build up ten carbon-low demonstration zones, launch 100 projects to cope with climate changes and reduce greenhouse gas emission, and offer over 1,000 training places in China," said Xie, adding that the main objective of China is to make its contribution, as a country of responsibility, to deal with the human's challenge. According to a report published by World Bank, 57 percent of the energy savings achieved between 1990 and 2010 were contributed by China. "That's a fair comment on China's efforts," said Xie. \</doc>

The Solar Impulse Foundation launched on Friday the World Alliance for Clean Technologies at the Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. Less than four months after the first ever solar flight around the world, Bertrand Piccard, pilot of the flight, said during a press conference that the alliance proves his vision that clean technologies can reach the objectives of the Climate Action Agenda. The coalition brings together start-ups, companies, institutions and organizations producing, implementing and supporting the use of clean technologies. The alliance's ambition is to globally advance the cause of clean technologies, said Bertrand Piccard, chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation. "Initiatives like the World Alliance for Clean Technologies are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean technologies that already exist or are under development," said Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). "We need the best and brightest minds -- from the North and the South -- to deliver clean technologies that can collectively accomplish the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and all the sustainable development goals to catalyze a healthy and prosperous future for all," she added. \</doc>

Global drylands might be facing a more severe threat than humid lands if the Paris Agreement is not implemented, a research paper has shown. Drylands will suffer from disproportionate climate disasters despite their relatively insignificant greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to humid areas, according to the peer-reviewed paper "Potential threats over drylands behind 2 degrees Celsius global warming target" by Huang Jianping, a professor with northwest China's Lanzhou University, and his collaborators. In order to prevent disastrous effects over drylands, it is necessary to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius on the basis of the implementation of 2 degrees Celsius global warming target proposed in the Paris Agreement, according to the paper. The Paris Agreement was agreed by 195 member economies that attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The agreement seeks to contain the rise in global average temperatures to under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and strive for 1.5 degrees if possible. However, this new research finds that the 2 degrees Celsius global warming target is acceptable only for humid areas, whereas drylands will bear greater warming risks. The international community should pay attention to the inequality of climate change risks and responsibility in different regions as well as the climate change process in undeveloped drylands, according to the paper. The paper was published Monday in the Nature Climate Change journal online. \</doc>

President of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), Salaheddine Mezouar, said Wednesday climate change issue transcends politics, after Donald Trump was elected the 45th U.S. president. He congratulated Trump on the election, while attached great importance to the climate change issue, saying that it transcends politics and concerns "the preservation of our livelihood, dignity and the only planet on which we all live." Trump has expressed his willingness to ditch the Paris Agreement in his presidential campaign, doubting mainstream scientific findings that droughts, floods and rising sea levels are linked to human activities. COP22 will continue to discuss and mobilize to pursue progress, particularly with the new U.S. administration. Now that the Paris Agreement has entered into force, all parties have the shared responsibility to continue the great progress achieved to date, he highlighted. Meanwhile, dozens of U.S. young activists gathered Wednesday at the center of the conference site to denounce the election of Trump, "mourning" his win and shouting slogans against his positions on climate change. Ryan Camero, a SustainUS member said that they are keeping the U.S. accountable to not just the communities most affected by climate change domestically, but also frontline communities across the globe. \</doc>

Illustration: Liu Rui/GT Things are moving quickly in the world of climate change policy. On Friday, less than a year after it was agreed, the Paris Climate Agreement came into force, after it had been ratified by over 55 nations representing more than 55 percent of global emissions output. For a global agreement, brokered by the United Nations, the progress of the pact from agreement to coming into effect has been extraordinarily rapid. It took eight years for 1997's Kyoto Protocol to come into force - and then its first commitment period didn't start until 2008. Those were crucial years lost while countries bickered over who should bear responsibility and pay to mitigate and adapt to the effects of global climate change. Developing countries were excluded, and during the almost two decades since Kyoto, as many have transitioned to become middle-income economies, their emissions have risen greatly as developed countries have lessened. Emissions have also been flatlining or dropping in some countries, including the US - but this is not down to effective policymaking, rather to the effects of economic downturns and some businesses, such as the coal industry in both the US and China, shutting down production as mines are no longer economically viable.So the Conference of the Parties, or COP22 , which starts in Marrakesh, Morocco on Monday, has a lot riding on it. Many details of the Paris Agreement still need to be ironed out before nations start implementing the measures necessary to contain global warming to a maximum of 2 C, preferably 1.5 C.Each country had to submit a plan of action to cut greenhouse gas emissions prior to COP21, but these are still voluntary, and climate scientists have said that these do not go nearly far enough - the world would still be on track for warming of at least 3 C, which would leave many vulnerable countries and regions at risk of catastrophic damage - not least small island states, Sub Saharan African nations already at risk because of drought, and densely populated coastal regions in many countries. Low-lying countries, such as Bangladesh, are in danger, but so are economic powerhouse regions of China, like Shanghai and the Pearl Delta region. The Marrakesh meeting coincides with 10th anniversary of the influential climate change report by British economist, Nicholas Stern. The 2006 Stern Report was an attempt to quantify the cost of unregulated global warming, and warned that mitigation taken before the world was on a track to climate change it could not get off would be cheaper than trying to adapt to the effects of climate change in the decades to come. But speaking to the Observer newspaper Sunday, Stern said that his report did not go far enough - he said he underplayed the dangers and should have been far stronger in his warnings than he was. The biggest problem for the delegates at COP22 is going to be wrangling over the mechanisms to reduce emissions in countries that desperately need to modernize their economies, but lack the means to pay for it. Who should pay for global warming caused by decades of emissions from developed countries? In the past, especially at the notorious Copenhagen meeting in 2009, this issue almost derailed the entire meeting. The problem of greenhouse gas emissions is transboundary - should China or India be blamed for all their emissions when developed nations have effectively outsourced many of their emissions by transferring "dirty" manufacturing processes overseas? Why should Big Oil get away with not paying for the damage their product does in countries far away from where oil is produced and even used? Oil companies just recently pledged a $1 billion fund to help mitigate against the cost of climate change - but this amount has been roundly criticized by climate scientists as being a mere drop in the ocean for these companies who make profits today from a product which will impact the world for generations to come. It must be remembered that gases emitted today have a strong lag time in the atmosphere - so even if strong action starts to take place after 2020, the world will not see any effect for decades.Finally, the result of the US election will undoubtedly be in the minds of delegates at Marrakesh. Donald Trump, who said climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China, has said he will row back on the Paris Agreement. New Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has questioned it too, even though his country is one which is already suffering from the effects of global warming in the increased intensity of typhoons and flooding.After the hard graft at Paris last year, it is concerning that the rise of populist politicians may derail what is a crucial agreement for the world. The COP22 meeting must not be sidetracked by climate change deniers, and must build on the rapid progress that has been made since Paris. It is after all, better to prevent than to clean up afterward.The author is a Global Times editor.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will depart New York late Sunday evening for attending United UN's Climate Change Conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, Deputy UN spokesman, Farhan Haq, told reporters here Friday. "On the morning of Tuesday, 15 November, the secretary-general will take part in the opening of the high-level segment of the Climate Change Conference, known as COP22 ," Haq said at a daily news briefing here. "This will also serve as the first meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement." The COP 22 COP22 The meeting brought together health and environment ministers to promote healthier environments for healthier people. The participants are expected to identify ways and means for a potential future coalition and adopt Marrakesh declaration on health, environment and climate change. The historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change entered into force on Nov. 4 after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 percent of global emissions, have ratified the agreement. Under the agreement adopted in the French capital in December 2015, nations have agreed to combat climate change and to unleash actions and investment toward a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. While in Marrakech, the secretary-general will also participate in events on topics including economic diversification and climate finance, Haq said. "He will also meet with world leaders and civil society representatives on the margins of COP22 ." "He will also visit the headquarters of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ), where he will meet with Director-General Irina Bokova and staff members." The secretary-general will return to New York on Nov. 18, the deputy spokesman added. \</doc>

As Confucius taught us, there are three methods to gaining wisdom. "Reflection, which is the noblest. Imitation, which is in essence perhaps the easiest. Experience, which is the bitterest." A Moroccan policeman stands guard outside the COP22 village during the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, on Nov 15, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua] As Confucius taught us, there are three methods to gaining wisdom. "Reflection, which is the noblest. Imitation, which is in essence perhaps the easiest. Experience, which is the bitterest." The climate agreement, approved by nearly 200 states at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris last year, embodies these three elements precisely. First, in the run-up to the conference, every country was invited to "reflect" on its contribution to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Also, a five-year cycle of reflection to measure progress was agreed. Second, countries are learning from and building on each other. Leading countries developing the right policies and leading companies developing new technologies are closely watched and "imitated" by others. These collective efforts must eventually add up to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 C to 2 C, as agreed in Paris. Third, we are already learning from bitter "experiences" that multiply the risks of poverty, migrations and conflicts. To help those who are most vulnerable to these hardships adapt to climate change, agreements regarding climate finance were also made in Paris. China is taking a lead in realizing the historic Paris Agreement, which has been now ratified by 119 parties. At the G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, Beijing submitted its ratification document of the Paris Agreement to the UN. The Chinese government takes climate change seriously and has taken practical actions to fight it. In 2011, it started carbon trading pilot programs in seven provinces, exploring ways to reduce the cost of controlling greenhouse gas emissions via the market. Drawing on the experience of these pilots, China is building a national carbon trading scheme that covers all key industrial sectors, which is expected to be introduced in 2017. China is also running several low carbon demonstrations at provincial, city, industrial park and community levels. And the extensive low-carbon programs have contributed to its climate change response. For China, it is clear that economic growth and addressing climate change to achieve sustainable development can, will and must proceed hand-in-hand. Such an approach will make societies and countries, like China, only stronger and more resilient, or in other words: future-proof. Most notably, a great opportunity lies in carbon pricing as a critical instrument to unlock the public and the private capital needed for the transition to low-carbon technologies. Putting a meaningful price on carbon, for instance, will stimulate energy efficiency technology and make renewable energy more competitive. Our generation is pivotal: we have a moral duty to act on the science that is irrefutable. By putting a meaningful price on carbon, the current generation can take responsibility for its carbon footprint and anchor addressing climate change into our economic system. The unprecedented challenge of climate change is now recognized by central banks, too. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, recently called climate change a "tragedy of the horizons" because the impact of climate stretches beyond the traditional horizons of business and governments. From the perspective of international financial stability, an interest all countries share, he promotes addressing climate change with more urgency. The political momentum for carbon pricing is unparalleled. Along with China, about 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces are already implementing mechanisms to tax or trade carbon, or are planning to do so. This is why it is important for governments, businesses, universities and other parties to share the best practices, learning from each other to set definitions, to measure, to set targets and to report progress, to share the experience of working with carbon pricing and creating the most effective carbon-pricing system and policies. Several initiatives are emerging to facilitate such collaboration. It is noteworthy that more than 700 companies are considering an internal carbon price. Another 500 companies already have set an internal carbon price. While designing and implementing carbon-pricing systems and policies comes with many challenges, the stakes couldn't be higher. Accelerated implementation of a meaningful carbon price across the globe can turn the notion of "tragedy of the commons" into an "opportunity of the commons" and create low-carbon prosperity for all. It not only makes business sense: our children and generations to come will thank us for finally stepping up.

China's pavilion kicks off Wednesday at the ongoing COP22 in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, highlighting China's forestry success story. The first side event in the Chinese pavilion was co-organized by China's National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner, and China Green Carbon Foundation, with support by international organizations like the World Wildlife Fund. Combining with domestic and international partners, China Green Carbon Foundation told China's forestry story, which shows the successful experience of China's forestry reform and innovation as well as foreign positive cases to benefit more developing countries on forestry development. It served as a great platform for the world forestry workers to exchange good experiences and ideas, and contribute to address global climate change and improve human being welfare. The COP 22 , held in Marrakech from Nov. 7 to 18, will focus on action items in order to implement the priorities of the Paris Agreement, especially those related to adaptation, transparency, technology transfer, mitigation, capacity building and loss and damages. Around 20,000 delegates, 30,000 civil society members from some 200 countries are gathering at the 11-day climate change conference. \</doc>

Last November, the United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. Participants from all over the world came together to create a plan for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It was an important step forward, but the issue remains far more complex than most would care to admit. The global cooperation that has emerged lately is certainly welcome. But, while teamwork is critical to success, so is recognition of the distinct roles and responsibilities of governments in the industrialized and developing worlds. The industrialized countries have long produced massive amounts of emissions and other kinds of pollution, while consuming a huge share of the world\' s resources  including 90 percent of the world\' s water  all in the name of their own development. As a result, these countries now enjoy high standards of living and food security. The situation for developing countries is different. Not only have they contributed substantially less to climate change; they are also suffering its worst effects, including food shortages and the loss of livelihoods, brought about by increasingly extreme and frequent weather events like floods and droughts.   Africa is paying a particularly heavy price. Though the continent is responsible for only 4 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it is suffering more than any other continent from climate change, as rising temperatures, shifting seasons, and proliferating droughts deplete biodiversity, destroy ecosystems, and undermine security and stability. Already, Africa has ten million  climate refugees. If nothing is done, that figure will rise to almost 60 million in just three years. The industrialized countries have pledged to support their developing-country counterparts, like those in Africa, in their effort to steel themselves against climate change. But their promises are modest, relative to what is actually needed. Policymakers often tout  sustainable development, but lack clear answers for how to achieve it. In many cases  Donald Trump being the most notable example  they seem determined to do just the opposite. As it stands, economic power is being used as a political tool, wielded by leaders attempting to evade their global responsibilities. Trump has explicitly declared his intention to ignore the Paris agreement. But, as the Marrakesh declaration emphasizes, success in mitigating climate change will require political commitment at the highest level. Moreover, climate action must take into account the special needs and context of developing countries, especially the least-developed economies and those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. With this in mind, the declaration demands greater efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security, and meet the agriculture challenges posed by climate change. And it calls for greater support for climate projects, including through capacity building and technology transfer from developed to developing countries. Notwithstanding Trump\' s reluctance, many countries seem to recognize the imperative to act. Participants in the Africa Action Summit, held on the sidelines of the Marrakesh conference, offered their own commitment to build an Africa that is resilient to climate change.

Recent floods and deadly mudslides, as well as withering droughts in Latin America have put the spotlight on extreme weather conditions that are likely to be more frequent due to climate change, according to experts. Though the rise in global temperature has been gradual, its consequences are often swift and disastrous. Earlier this year, the so-called "coastal El Nino" phenomenon, caused by unusually high sea temperatures, sparked torrential rains and floodings that claimed more than 100 lives in Peru, according to the National Emergency Operations Center. The disaster also left more than 155,000 people homeless, destroyed nearly 6,000 kilometers of roadways, and swept away 258 bridges. Reconstruction is estimated to cost 12 billion to 15 billion U.S. dollars, Peru's Minister of Defense Jorge Nieto said in early April. Successive natural disasters caused by extreme weathers followed fast on the heels of Peru, hitting Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay, before returning to lash Colombia again. A landslide in Colombia's southern city of Mocoa killed more than 300 people on April 1. Less than three weeks later, mudslides destroyed some 75 homes and killed at least 14 residents in Manizales, a town in west-central Colombia. "Dramatic changes (in the environment) have accelerated phenomena associated with climate change that are lashing the region," Carlos Dario Ramirez, a biologist at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research, told Xinhua. "Latin America has in recent years seen changes in the weather system that were previously controlled, but due to human intervention, phenomena such as El Nino and La Nina are increasingly affecting countries closest to the Pacific region," said Ramirez. "Venezuela has experienced a problematic drought for nearly two years, from 2015 to 2016," he recalled, "which damaged crops and wildlife," and led the government to explore "what the vulnerabilities were in order to minimize the impact of climate change." Venezuela also decided to pursue environment-friendly policies to move away from fossil fuels by promoting the use of solar and wind power. While countries need to take individual steps to mitigate the effects of extreme weathers on their populations, the problem of climate change requires a global effort, the experts agreed. Venezuelan climate analyst Cesar Eulogio Prieto said that "since we are already feeling the effects of climate change, the issue has become a priority on the agenda of nearly every country in the world, as shown by the 2015 Paris agreement." Reached at the United Nations climate change conference held in the French capital in 2015, the Paris agreement aims to prevent global warming, setting a temperature hike limit target. "The topic is so important and urgent that in discussions on how to tackle it, the debate is not just about how to reduce its causes, but also how to prepare for its consequences," said Prieto. Cindy Fernandez, of Argentina's national meteorological service, believed that global warming is altering weather patterns. "Climate change is affecting the whole world in different ways, and Argentina is no exception," she noted. "In recent years, we have seen an increase in extreme rain incidents, so we can expect it to become increasingly more frequent," Fernandez said. Precipitation in Argentina has risen, "not because there are more rainy days, but because it rains more each time. When it rains, we get more water than before," she explained. In the past few weeks, severe downpours have been reported in seven provinces, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people and material damage. \</doc>

Mediterranean countries urged late on Tuesday in the Moroccan city of Tangier to the implementation of a strategy for adaptation to climate change, based on coordinated and ambitious action plans that reflect a balance between adaptation and mitigation. They stressed in final statement of MedCop Climate Tangier, for collective mobilization to mitigate the effects of climate change, according to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility. The statement said the countries will pay close attention to developing countries which are the most vulnerable to climate change, and provide access to financing methods that suit best the territories and the economy. It added that this Mediterranean conference will build and carry a unified voice among the States that will gather in Marrakesh at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP 22 ). Organized by the Moroccan Region of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, this Mediterranean multi-actor climate conference brought together representatives from Mediterranean countries, private sector, civil society, as well as regional and international organizations. The two-day event was be the opportunity to discuss the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015, to highlight the existing initiatives related to the climate action in the region and to formulate innovative ideas. This conference was an important milestone for the Mediterranean countries and for the upcoming COP22 which will take place on November 7-18 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. \</doc>

Vietnam's national green growth strategy, especially cross-cutting issues with the fight against climate change and efforts in the post-Paris Agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , was discussed here Tuesday. Vietnamese officials, and representatives of foreign diplomatic corps and institutions touched upon the strategy at a high-level seminar entitled "Vietnam Green Growth Strategy: Pathways towards Implementing the Paris Agreement - Vietnam & EU Experience," held by the Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment and the Delegation of the European Union (EU) to Vietnam. At the seminar, the ministry's Deputy Minister Nguyen The Phuong said five Vietnamese ministries and almost 30 localities have so far implemented their green growth action plans which cover many fields, including resource mobilization, institutional and policy improvement, capacity enhancement and technology, contributing to concretizing the country's actions towards the sustainable development goals by 2030. The seminar's delegates also shared the EU's expertise in decision-making and implementation of green growth strategies in Europe; addressed green growth at the strategic level; and outlined the strategic planning in the continent and European support to strategic planning and implementation in Vietnam. \</doc>

The World Meteorological Organization(WMO) Tuesday said the year 2016 remains on track to be the hottest year on record, with average global temperatures set to break even the records of 2015. According to data covering the first 11 months of the year,temperatures spiked in the early months of 2016 because of a very strong El Nino event and remained well above the long-term average for the latter part of the year. Long-term indicators of human-caused climate change, including record carbon dioxide concentrations, and glacier melt, and low sea ice, continued. WMO will issue consolidated figures on 2016 global temperatures in early 2017. December data confirms WMO's assessment issued in November that 2016 will very likely be the hottest since records began in the mid 1880s. The WMO provisional statement on the climate in 2016, released for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, cited preliminary data (to the end of September) that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures in the Arctic have been particularly high. As a result, Arctic sea ice was exceptionally low, especially during early 2016 and the October-November re-freezing period. Antarctic ice extent was also the lowest on record in November, in contrast to the trend of recent years. Scientific studies are increasingly proving the link between extreme weather -- especially heat -- and human-induced climate change from greenhouse gases. \</doc>

Morocco's Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar called on Monday for designing concrete actions to support countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. Speaking at the opening of the 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Mezouar said that all participants should commit to concrete climate initiatives and actions to support the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change especially in Africa, least developed and small island developing states. He announced that during COP22 Morocco, the National Determined Contributions (NDC) Partnership will be launched to build capacity and direct climate finance flows towards the most vulnerable. He reiterated the importance of accelerating climate finance, innovation, transfer and capacity building to create the low-carbon economy the planet needs to stay below the 2 degree Celsius mark of global warming. "Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change," the COP22 president asserted. UNFCCC Executive Director Patricia Espinosa sressed the historic significance of Morocco and Marrakech as host of the UN Climate Change Conference. "We need to work together with speed and scale on all fronts," she said. The COP22 , held in Marrakech until November 18, will focus on action items in order to implement the priorities of the Paris Agreement, especially those related to adaptation, transparency, technology transfer, mitigation, capacity building and loss and damages. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in December 2015 at COP21 in Paris, was ratified in October by 96 countries and the European Union and entered into force on Nov. 4. The conference will also be an opportunity to debate and discuss several issues related in particular to agriculture, food security, energy, industry, transport and water. \</doc>

The Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, announced on Sunday that 100 parties formally joined the Paris Agreement on climate change. The announcement was made during a press conference before the official kick-off of the UNFCCC's 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Nov. 7. The Paris Agreement, adopted in Dec. 2015 at the COP21 in Paris, was ratified in Oct. by 96 countries and the European Union, and entered into force on Nov. 4. Espinosa said that the 100 parties who joined demonstrate "real climate action." She also announced that the 1st meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1) would take place at COP22 on Nov. 15. COP22 "We're changing the paradigm towards a low-carbon global economy that needs key climate finance flows to the most vulnerable countries," said Mezouar. This shows serious commitment from all levels of society to continue the critical momentum towards a low-carbon economy and the fight against climate change, he added. Over 50,000 people are expected to attend COP22 in Morocco, including around 20,000 delegates, some 30,000 civil society members, over 40 heads of state and 30 heads of government. \</doc>

The world climate conference in Morocco next Monday will focus on the ways to implement the Paris Agreement after it entered into force on Friday. "The agreement is undoubtedly a turning point in the history of common human endeavor, capturing the combined political, economic and social will of governments, cities, regions, citizens, businesses and investors to overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change," UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and President of COP22 Salaheddine Mezouar said in a joint statement on Friday. The foundations of the Paris Agreement are solid and other key features of humanity's new home are starting to rise, they said, stressing that "we cannot and we must not rest until the roof is in place. This November in Marrakesh we will make sure it will be in place, sooner rather than later." While this unprecedented achievement shows a clear commitment from countries across the globe to tackle climate change, there is much more work to be done in Morocco to translate this commitment into action. The ambitious goal to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid dangerous tipping points in the climate system means that global emissions must be driven down rapidly from the current near-peak. Another key pledge in the agreement is that developed countries will continue to allocate 100 billion U.S. dollars per year from 2020 to 2025 in support of climate action by developing ones. According to UN estimates, sustainable development will require 5-7 trillion dollars annually to fund the global transition to a low-carbon resilient economy. To this end, creative funding options must be encouraged in both public and private sectors. In addition to national determined contributions, COP22 also aims to include non-state actors into the Global Climate Action Agenda. " COP22 will be a COP of action with a special focus on the important contributions of civil society. The Moroccan presidency will work together with civil society during the Marrakesh climate change conference and chart a common agenda under the presidency," said Mezouar at a Pre- COP22 ministerial meeting in Marrakesh in October. \</doc>

Donald Trump is not able to fundamentally change the trend of united global efforts to combat climate change, environmental activists said on Wednesday. "As a global community, we can and must solve the climate crisis," Mariana Panuncio, climate change director with the World Wildlife Fund, said after news of Donald Trump's victory reached Marrakech, Morocco, where delegates from more than 190 countries gathered at the United Nations climate change conference to discuss details of implementing the Paris Agreement in the next two weeks. "In politics we know the pendulum swings from one side to the other, but science keeps moving in one direction," she said. Trump's denial of manmade activities causing climate change could hardly strip the progress being made by more than 100 countries, according to Panuncio. As of Wednesday, a total of 103 out of 197 parties have ratified the agreement. Panuncio said that although election results will impact the tone of negotiations at the climate change conference, it will not stop global cooperation on tackling climate change. "The tasks ahead on tackling climate change challenges remain the same," she said. In line with her remarks, Alden Meyer\u-244 director of strategy and policy for Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based NGO, said that Trump needs to acknowledge the reality of climate change. Meyer said if he insists upon his current attitudes, it would cause a negative impact to US collaboration with countries in other fields. "I assume that other countries of the world will move ahead with climate ambition, because it's in their own self-interest to protect their citizens and reap economic benefits," he said. "If President Trump were not to honor US commitments, it will negatively impact his ability to negotiate on other priorities of international collaboration he has," Meyer said. \</doc>

He noted that an historic first meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement will take place on November 15. UNFCCC Executive Director Patricia Espinosa emphasized the historic significance of Morocco and Marrakech as host of the UN Climate Change Conference. "We need to work together with speed and scale on all fronts," she said. The opening ceremony was brought to a close by an invigorating performance by a local traditional Moroccan drumming group "Ostina Tono," who set the rhythm for the two-week climate action conference in the Ochre City. The conference will also be an opportunity to debate and discuss several issues relating in particular to agriculture, food security, energy, industry, transport and water. The event is taking place in Bab Ighli village, which extends over an area of nearly 300,000 square meters. Around 20,000 delegates from 196 countries are gathering at the COP22 climate change conference. \</doc>

Australia must do more to assist its Pacific island neighbors battle the issue of climate change, a new Oxfam Australia report on climate change has recommended. The Australian-based arm of the not-for-profit released its "After Paris: Climate Finance in the Pacific Islands" report on Tuesday, which said Australia was "underfunding" climate research in the Pacific, an issue which could spell the end of low-lying island nations such as Kiribati. The Turnbull government currently allocates 150 million U.S dollars to climate finance annually, however following the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris last year, it chose not to increase its contribution in 2016. Oxfam Australia's chief executive Helen Szoke described Australia as "lagging behind" other developed nations in increasing its contributions to climate change research. "In coming decades, big numbers of Pacific people - in some cases entire nations - could be forced from their homes and losing their livelihoods in the face of an escalation in climate related impacts," Szoke told the Australian Associated Press (AAP) on Tuesday. "As a wealthy nation and one of the biggest countries in the region, Australia has a particular responsibility to support its vulnerable neighbors in the Pacific." Szoke said Australia should aim to up its contribution to 2.5 billion U.S dollars by 2020, and called on the government to boost its aid budget, which had fallen to a "historic low". "Australia's contribution is weak compared to other developed nations, which have increased their spending on climate finance," she said. "What's more, our contributions are now being drawn from an aid budget which has been slashed to a historic low of 23 cents in every 100 dollars. "Oxfam is calling for Australia's total public and private annual contribution to climate finance to reach at least 2.5 billion U.S dollars in less than four years." The report listed 50 recommendations to help fight climate change in the Pacific, including improving access to the Green Climate Fund global initiative. \</doc>

China would strive to strive to lower carbon emissions in the next five years while shouldering common but different principles, the deputy head of the Chinese Confrence of the Parties delegation said on Monday. The twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) officially opensing on Monday. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] China would strive to lower carbon emissions in the next five years while shouldering common but different principles, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation said on Monday. Speaking on the first day of the United Nation Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ), Xie Ji, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, said China would continue to wean the economy from coal fired to more sustainable one. The Chinese delegation, consisting of more than 80 participants, will negotiate with other parties to discuss details regarding how to move forward to achieve the Paris Agreement during the two-week meetings held in Marrakech, Morocco. "China has just released five-year plan for cutting carbon emissions lelves, that means we will sure to stick to that," said Xie, referring to the nation's greenhouse gas emission plan released on Friday, which aims to cut 18 percent of emissions per GDP, compared with that in 2015 by the end of 2020. As the world's second largest economy, China is moving faster than expected along the path to de-carbon its economy to meet the target set in the Paris Agreement, according to Xie, where the nation pledged to cut emissions per GDP by 40-45 percent, compared to the level in 2005, by 2020, suggesting CO2 emissions would peak in 2030. By the end of 2015, China cut its carbon intensity by 5.6 percent, better than the 3.6 percent outlined in the 12thfive-year plan. Commenting on expectations for the climate change conference, Xie said China would sure to contribute together with other partieson all fronts to achieve goals in the Paris pact, and strive to do a better job as long as efforts are in line with the nation's sustainable economic development goals. "China would continue to shoulder common but differentiated principles," said Xie. In the meantime, China would provide financial and technical support to help other developing countries to enhance capacity building to combat climate change, according to Xie. China has pledged to support and facilitate developing countries to fight with climate change challenges under South-South Cooperation scheme. "China will help establish pilot low-carbon zones in developing countries in support of vulnerable countries," said Xie.

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said Monday that transformation to a "low-emission resilient society and economy" should be a singular global target. "Our work here in Marrakech must reflect our new reality. No politician or citizen, no business manager or investor can doubt that the transformation to a low-emission, resilient society and economy is the singular determination of the community of nations," Espinosa said in her address at the opening of the 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ). She also stressed that achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given, considering the huge difficulties of changing the course of two centuries of carbon-intensive development. According to the UN official, another key work is to mobilize financial resources to allow developing countries to green their economies and build resilience. She noted that countries should take more audacious nationally determined contributions and integrate them into national policies and investment plans. Espinosa also called on giving support for adaptation higher priority to safeguard development gains in the most vulnerable communities. The COP22 , held in Marrakech until Nov. 18, will focus on action items to implement the Paris Agreement, especially those related to adaptation, transparency, technology transfer, mitigation, capacity building and loss and damage mechanisms. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 at COP21 in Paris, was ratified in October by 96 countries and the European Union and entered info force on Nov. 4. The conference will also be an opportunity to debate and discuss issues concerning agriculture, food security, energy, industry, transport and water. The event is taking place in Bab Ighli village, which extends over an area of nearly 300,000 square meters. Around 20,000 delegates from 196 countries are gathering at the COP22 climate change conference. \</doc>

The Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco celebrated Forest Action Day on Tuesday. MARRAKECH - The Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco celebrated Forest Action Day on Tuesday. COP22 's Forest Action Day celebrations are a part of the Global Climate Action Agenda to protect, restore and sustainably manage forests. Launched earlier on Tuesday by the climate champions for Morocco and France, Hakima El Haite and Laurence Tubiana, the Agenda aims to boost cooperation between governments, cities, businesses, investors and citizens to cut emissions and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy and sustainable futures. Speaking at a special event entitled "Global Climate Action Launch Event," Abdeladim Lhafi, Morocco's High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight against Desertification, said that conserving, restoring and managing forests is essential to meeting global sustainable development goals, including combating desertification and water insecurity. Lhafi announced that Morocco will launch a new initiative called "Strengthened Action in Favor of Forests in the Mediterranean-Sahel Region in the Context of Climate Change" (AFMS). He elaborated that the initiative aims to help countries meet multilateral commitments to forests, including adaptation and mitigation actions under the Paris Agreement, and to facilitate climate change investments to improve forest management and build the resilience of forest-dependent communities. Helen Clark, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Administrator, said that forests are one of the largest and most cost-effective responses we have to climate change. "Countries, civil society, the private sector and indigenous peoples are working powerfully together to protect forests to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement," he stressed. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Assistant Director-General, Forestry, Rene Castro Salazar, stressed that healthier forests will also contribute to many other global development goals by providing food, income, fuel and shelter. "The Zero Hunger goal of the SDGs cannot be achieved by 2030 without addressing climate change, and climate change cannot be addressed without managing the world's forests in a sustainable manner," he said. Deforestation and forest degradation currently contribute up to 12 percent of carbon emissions, more than the entire transport sector. However, by halting deforestation, reducing and reversing forest degradation, forests could contribute significantly to the climate solution in the coming decades. The COP22 Global Action Agenda will feature eight other theme days, namely water, industry and businesses, as well as resilience in cities, buildings, energy, transport, oceans and agriculture. \</doc>

The joint High-Level Segment of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) and the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP12) opens here Tuesday. The segment will be proceeded by the 1st Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1). King Mohammed VI of Morocco, the host country, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will address the high-level segment. Representatives of each party, including those to the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, will have the opportunity to deliver a national statement. The historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change entered into force on Nov. 4, committing its signatories to limiting global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, to combat climate change, and to unleash actions and investment toward a low-carbon, resilient and sustainable future. Under the agreement, the ongoing climate change conference represents a new departure for the international community, when CMA became the first meeting of the Paris Agreement's governing body. Before the opening of High-Level Segment, the COP22 president, Morocco's Foreign Affairs Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, took stock at half way point of the conference on Nov. 12, saying that progress is being made on the Paris Agreement rule book. More than 90 countries have moved from Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to formal Nationally Determined Contributions in record short time, which confirmed the world's commitment to addressing climate change, UNFCCC's Patricia Espinosa said. Important announcements would be made in the following week regarding capacity building for developing countries, Mezouar said. The COP22 president also underscored the importance of making headway during the conference on the question of climate finance, matching bankable projects with climate funds and mobilizing private sector finance to leverage public money. \</doc>

Will the next US president cast a shadow on cooperative climate action between China and the United States? "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive," Trump said in a 2012 tweet. If he takes the White House, Trump has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, which the US and China both ratified during the G20 Leaders Summit in September in a move that has been regarded as "crucial steps that helped accelerating the process of the rapid approval of the Paris Agreement," said Hakima El Haite, one of the steering committee members of the United Nations Climate Change Conference The two-week UN Climate Change Conference, set for Monday to Nov 18 in Marrakech, would witness the election of the next US president on the second day of the meeting. The world's two largest carbon-emitters "took the lead and set good examples for other countries", said El Haite, making the Paris Agreement one of the quickest international pacts to come into force. But as bold a comment as it seems, Trump's options on pulling out of the Paris Agreement are limited. Although his comments add uncertainties, he is unlikely to be able to undo the deal, El Haite said. Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy, shared similar views. "Although the US is able to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, it takes time," Zou said. "China is well-prepared to deal with challenges whoever will be the next president," Zou said. Echoing his remarks, Chai Qimin, an analyst with Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said that even with any uncertainties, China has opportunities to make things better by taking actions to promote communications in the private sectors. "China is able to take a step forward by enhancing cooperative mechanisms on municipal levels, such as the annual Low-Carbon Cities Summit that two nations started to jointly organize since 2015," Chai said.

Amid global uncertainty about future US policy, China could set the pace for environmental action Implementation was the keyword for the 22nd Conference of Parties meeting ( COP22 ), recently held in Marrakech, Morocco. In October, 113 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol. Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era. Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference, discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of $100 billion (94 billion euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change, so far there is still an annual $40 to $70 billion gap to fill. Additionally, this is only the financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement. Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the European Union and the United States, secretly formed a "high ambition coalition" with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement, therefore, states "pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels". This plan serves the best interests of vulnerable countries. But the climate finance conundrum dragged the ambition down to earth at COP22 , with the name "Donald Trump" contributing to the process. Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at COP22 , an expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump's election. Over the years, China has indeed proactively helped other developing countries on climate change. From 2011, China has invested more than $1 billion to help African and vulnerable countries. In last year's US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change, China committed to establishing the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change Fund and to provide $3.1 billion in three years. This will finance programs including infrastructure construction, personnel training and capacity building in developing countries. At COP22 , this commitment was strengthened again by Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, during the High-Level Forum on South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, which was the most important event in the China pavilion. During the forum, the COP22 president, UN officials and dozens of ministers from developing countries shared their views and visions on south-south cooperation and China's positive role in it. By incorporating climate change in south-south cooperation, China expanded the scope for foreign aid, which is widely recognized as an important strategy in every country's foreign policy portfolio. The poor and vulnerable countries cry for money, technology and expertise to adapt to climate change and develop a green economy. In this sense, conventional foreign aid targets such as poverty, health and education can be considered more broadly as climate change issues. Geopolitically, large powers compete for greater influence in global governance through foreign aid programs. The gap in climate financing therefore offers considerable opportunities for competitive donors to influence the climate agenda and international affairs more generally. In this potential competition, China has many advantages, including empathy for the need for economic development and the necessity of cooperation. This has resulted in China's "assistance-plus investment" foreign aid model. International opinion on China's foreign aid, however, is extremely polarized. Some argue that China's no "strings attached" approach is efficient and generates win-win outcomes. Others criticize this direct, economically-driven assistance as a form of neocolonialism. Unarguably, China's influence on less-developed countries has been growing rapidly, along with growing concern from the West. The reasons behind this come not only from concerns that China may undermine the democratic process of these countries but also, and more important, from the fear of losing advantages they earn from their own foreign aid programs. The elephant in the room at COP22 was the question, Does Trump fear losing these advantages? He claimed on the campaign trail that he would halt US funding for UN climate change programs, seemingly undermining US President Barack Obama's original commitment of $3 billion. What he will actually do once in office remains to be seen. Regardless, China is taking on a growing leadership role in global climate governance. It is inevitable that the shifting landscape toward China's leadership will put pressure on the US in terms of its global image and influence. The world can only hope that, as a self-proclaimed successful investor, Trump will come to agree with Obama that climate finance is "a smart investment for us to make".

French President Francois Hollande on Friday welcomed "a historic day for the planet as it marks the entry into force of the agreement on the climate." With ratification of 55 states, accounting for 55 percent of total green gas emissions, commitments of the Paris climate summit in December 2015 "are now irreversible," Hollande said in a statement released by his office. "After this milestone, France mobilization will remain strong so that climate justice is met through the mobilization of fund...so that the spirit of Paris will continue and be amplified by the implementation of coalitions for solar energy, renewable energy in Africa, the fight against desertification, ocean's protection and the support for the most vulnerable countries," Hollande added. The Paris Agreement eyes 100 billion U.S. dollars a year for developing world from 2020. It also calls for efforts to keep the rise of global average temperature below 2 Celsius over pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to 1.5. Regarding the upcoming 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) slated for Nov. 7-18 in Marrakech, Morocco, the French president said the conference "should be one of solutions."

The ongoing United Nations climate change conference needs to reaffirm global support for the historic Paris Agreement, Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said here Thursday. Given the fact that the Paris Agreement has entered into force, and fears of uncertainty about its implementation, the UN conference should "send a strong message" that the fight against climate change has become a global trend and will be carried on in the future, Xie told reporters on the sidelines of the conference in the southern Moroccan city. The two-week conference, which entered its ministerial phase Tuesday, is expected to adopt a proclamation for action before it concludes late Friday. Related parties are still in negotiations in an effort to produce a "balanced" declaration which takes into account requirements from all parties, Xie said, adding that the document is expected to be finalized Thursday. Xie called on related parties to proceed with the negotiations from a strategic perspective, taking into account the overall situation, against the backdrop that Donald Trump's win of the U.S. presidential election may bring about uncertainty to the global combat against climate change. Xie stressed that the declaration must reaffirm the tasks and provisions established by the Paris Agreement and make it clear that every provision of the agreement will be implemented in line with the principle of common but shared responsibility under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In so doing, the declaration will ensure that the international community be rest assured that global cooperation in addressing climate change will continue, he said. The top Chinese climate official also noted that the Chinese side has repeatedly stressed that there will not be any changes in China's climate goals, policies, measures and actions following the U.S. elections. Such clarifications by China have been well received at this UN climate conference, Xie said, adding that China will continue to make contributions to the global fight against climate change in accordance with its national circumstances. Xie urged U.S. President-elect Trump to follow the global trend of low-carbon green development and make a "far-sighted and wise" decision on climate change. "Any government acts against this trend, there may be some problems as a result," he warned. During his campaign, Trump described the issue of climate change as a "hoax" and vowed to cancel various actions taken by the Obama administration, including the U.S. ratification of the Paris Agreement. Trump's election victory has cast a shadow over the current climate conference. \</doc>

The World Bank would continue to be a strong partner of China, with the country's commitment and leadership on climate changes issues, vice president for sustainable development of the World Bank said on Friday. Laura Tuck made the remarks during an interview with Xinhua in the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) held in Marrakech of Morocco. Tuck hailed China's effort on climate issues, praising its impressive National Determined Contributions (NDC) targets for 2030, which will take a variety of measures to achieve, among them the planned Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Tuck said the ETS China will be worth 50 billion U.S. dollars, the largest in the global range. "The scale of the ETS China would be an inspiration for the countries and it has the potential to change investment and consumption decisions made by individuals and that can lead to a much lower-carbon economy," said Tuck, adding that it could be a "model." China is the first developing country to set up the national carbon emission trading market based on its seven pilots that are running now. Xie Ji, deputy chief of Chinese delegation to COP22 , confirmed that China will push forward the emission trading market "actively and steadily." Tuck stressed that the World Bank appreciated China's efforts in developing the ETS based on their experiences and analytical work. The World Bank is also providing 8 million dollars to back China's ETS plans, including policy development like cap setting, legal frameworks and monitoring. She added that another 2 million dollars would be provided through the Partnership of Market Readiness as China is moving into the implementation phase of its national system. \</doc>

The following are news highlights in Zambia's major media outlets on Thursday. -- Zambian President Edgar Lungu said climate change has the potential to reverse developmental gains the country has made. Lungu said Zambia was deeply concerned that there was a growing risk of adverse climate change and a catastrophic impact on agriculture, water and sanitation, energy, infrastructure and health sector. UN ) Conference on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco, the Zambian leader said climate change had reduced productivity in the agriculture sector and brought challenges in the energy sector in the country. (Times of Zambia) -- A trade union has lambasted councilors in Zambia for demanding monthly salaries as the civic leaders were part-time workers. The Zambia United Local Authorities Workers Union said the councilors do not deserve salaries as they were part-time leaders only entitled to a monthly allowance. Councilors in Zambia have said they would boycott meetings if the central government fails to address their demands of replacing their monthly allowances with an economically reasonable monthly salary.

French President Francois Hollande said Tuesday he wanted to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election in April-May 2017, on the sidelines of the ongoing COP22 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, the French press reported. French President Francois Hollande is seen at Paris 11th district town hall, France, November 13, 2016, during a ceremony held for the victims of last year's Paris attacks which targeted the Bataclan concert hall as well as a series of bars and killed 130 people. [Photo/Agencies] PARIS - French President Francois Hollande said Tuesday he wanted to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election in April-May 2017, on the sidelines of the ongoing COP22 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, the French press reported. Faced with terrorist risks, "we need measures that are, of course, exceptional. And since there will be a presidential election, rallies in the coming weeks, the government has made me the proposal to extend the state of emergency and it will be submitted to parliament," Hollande said, as quoted by the French newspaper Le Parisien on its website. Earlier on Tuesday, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls confirmed in Paris that he was going to ask parliament for a further extension of the state of emergency, beyond its normal term in January 2017. The state of emergency rules would, in particular, allow for house arrest and widen the possibility of searches.  According to the official agenda, the results of the first and second tour of the French presidential election will be published on April 23 and May 7 next year.

New Zealand has signalled its commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change by joining an international program to fast-track the accord, Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett said Monday. New Zealand had joined countries at the 2016 UN climate change conference, COP22 (the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), in supporting to the Marrakech Proclamation, which highlighted the global momentum on tackling climate change, said Bennett. "The COP22 "It was also an opportunity to have fruitful discussions on issues important to New Zealand such as how to reduce emissions from agriculture and how to create high integrity international carbon markets," she said in a statement. "New Zealand has a fair and ambitious target of reducing emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. I have several work streams in place which will help form an effective plan to meet that target." New Zealand ratified the Paris Agreement, agreed in December last year, on Oct. 5. Earlier this month, the opposition Green Party said the government needed to "real evidence" of a plan to reduce New Zealand's emissions, which were up 19 percent since 2008. The international campaign group, Greenpeace, has called for a summer of action to highlight the government's "sham plan" on climate change, saying the country was forecast to meet 80 percent of its target by offsetting emissions in the international carbon market. \</doc>

The US special envoy for climate change, Jonathan Pershing, said he "can't speculate" in response to questions on the US policy over climate agreements under Trump at a press conference during the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Morocco's Marrakesh on Monday, the China News Agency (CNA) reported.Trump has pledged to roll back the Obama administration's environmental policies, including the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, according to the Associated Press.China's position on dealing with climate change is firm and consistent. Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to COP22 , was quoted by CNA on Thursday as saying that "China will reach peak carbon emission around 2030, and many cities in China have already promised they will reach their peak around 2020.""I don't think they will win their people's support, and US economic and social progress will also be impacted," Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change, said of Trump's policies before the vote, the Guardian reported."Trump's uncertainty on climate change agreements has highlighted China's responsibility as a great power," Wang Yiwei, a senior fellow of International Relations at the Renmin University, told the Global Times. "Despite the US future moves, China will keep up its efforts and promises." Wang also pointed out that "Trump may not renege on the Paris Agreement since the Obama administration has already signed on behalf of the US, but Trump may choose not to execute the agreement seriously in order to protect some enterprises with greater emissions."UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Tuesday that action on climate change has become "unstoppable", and he hoped that Trump would drop plans to quit a global accord aimed at weaning the world off fossil fuels, Reuters reported. \</doc>

A senior EU politician said recently that China represents an external threat to Europe, an accusation which is groundless as well as outrageous. As a matter of fact, China's development provides an enormous opportunity for Europe and both sides benefit from strong and stable bilateral ties. The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, and China is the EU's second biggest, following a dramatic increase in trade in recent years. Data from Chinese customs show that bilateral trade reached 2.94 trillion yuan (423.34 billion U.S. dollars) in the first 10 months of 2016, reaching a new high, and overcoming the global trade downturn. China and Europe should also work closer together in global governance issues, with climate change as a primary example. China and the EU played key roles as brokers of the COP21 Climate Agreement in Paris, and were urged to work even more closely for COP22 in Marrakech. With the Paris Agreement having entered into force, China and the EU will need to trust each other more than ever to help ensure that these critical measures are being implemented fully and correctly. In all global issues, China is a partner to the European Union, a sign of the friendship and mutual trust built over the 42 years since diplomatic relations were formally established in 1975. Strong bilateral ties need these twin guarantees to ensure that different political systems and different cultures can still find common ground. International relations are not a zero-sum game, as China has repeatedly shown in its partnerships with Europe. Through strong bilateral ties, China seeks a relationship with the European Union that promotes win-win development and mutually benefiting cooperation. Senior European politicians should be cautious about the statements they make, and safeguard the long-term and steady development of China-EU relations. Biased views will do no good for such development. \</doc>

One possible explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs is that climate change disrupted the ecological balance and dinosaurs failed to adapt. Temperatures and sea levels will rise, while heat waves are set to become more frequent and deadly One possible explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs is that climate change disrupted the ecological balance and dinosaurs failed to adapt. Scientific research has now suggested that the same situation could happen to humankind given the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes. An international team of researchers studied the impact of global climate change that has occurred in the past few decades as a result of human activities, and found that a global increase in temperature of 1 degree Celsius has already had a significant affect on a wide range of basic biological processes, from genes to ecosystems. "Global warming of 1 degree Celsius has had both a positive and negative impact on agriculture and food supply, because some crop species benefit from warmer conditions, but others are hampered," said Richard Corlett, director of the Center for Integrative Conservation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden. "There have also been noticeable changes in marine fish catches, with commercially important species moving north as the oceans get warmer. Freshwater fish have also been affected, and the impact of global climate change has mostly been negative," Corlett said. No ecosystem on Earth has been unaffected. For example, several commercial fish species have shrunk in the past 40 years, while some fruits, such as apples and peaches, which need cold winter temperatures, have also been affected. In addition to reducing agricultural yields, rising temperatures have also affected people, as pest and disease outbreaks have increased. The research results were published in the journal Science on Friday, describing the future of humankind as "unpredictable". Political leaders across the world reached an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse emissions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. "The global commitments made at that meeting target a 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature, which is still dangerous," Corlett said. "While the first 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature took a century, the next will only take a few decades, so both the human and animal kingdoms will have less time to adjust." Another 1 degree Celsius rise would result in large decreases in some sensitive natural ecosystems, such as coral reefs, and the extinction of many species, while others will move to cooler areas. "Climate change doesn't only affect temperatures. Changes in rainfall are more difficult to predict, but some places will get wetter and some drier. Sea levels will continue to rise and the oceans will become more acidic as they absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Heat waves will be more frequent and more deadly," Corlett said. The research conclusion was reached after studying hundreds of previously published scientific papers. The scientists identified a set of core ecological processes and assessed the already observed impacts of climate change on each one. "The research systematically evaluated the impact of climate change on different species on Earth. It aims to make people more aware of the urgent need for reductions of carbon emissions, and give decision-makers a better understanding of the impact of global warming," said Chen Jin, director of the botanical garden.

China will continue to play an active role in climate change with much stronger actions, while enhancing cooperation with related parties. MARRAKECH, Morocco - China will continue to play an active role in climate change with much stronger actions, while enhancing cooperation with related parties. The 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) is being held in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. Participants in the meeting are expected to identify ways for a potential future coalition and adopt a declaration on health, environment and climate change. MUCH STRONGER ACTIONS "Many cities promised they can reach their peaking before 2030, and a few cities try to achieve the target around 2020," said Xie, adding that many industries, especially energy-intensive ones, were asked to control CO2 emissions and try to reach the peaking around 2020. Gou Haibo, another deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, said Wednesday that China would continue to uphold a development concept highlighting innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing. He said that China would act positively and forcefully in maintaining the international mechanism, promoting international cooperation and combating climate change. CHINA-US COOPERATION CONTINUES China's policies will not be affected by any external changes, Chen Zhihua, a member of the Chinese delegation, said Friday. "No matter what happens in the new US government, China will continue to constructively participate in the international climate change process," Chen said. Chen was referring to concerns that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change after US President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to cancel the agreement during his campaign, takes office in January. "We still need to wait," Chen said, adding that now is not the right time to assess it. Even if the United States withdraws from the agreement, cooperation between China and the US will continue, Chen said. "This is the attitude we hold toward the matter." Catherine Novelli, US undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, said the United States and China have an "incredible working relationship" on climate issues. "And I think it would portend well for leadership for the future," Novelli said. "I think everybody acknowledges that the momentum for Paris was generated by the agreement between the US and China." Novelli also said her country would continue the existing cooperation with China after Trump takes office in January. COOPERATION WITH ALL PARTIES The World Bank would continue to be a strong partner of China, with the country's commitment and leadership on climate changes issues, Laura Tuck, vice president for sustainable development of the World Bank, said Friday. In an interview with Xinhua, Tuck hailed China's effort on climate issues, praising its impressive National Determined Contributions targets for 2030, which will take a variety of measures to achieve, among them the planned Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Tuck said the ETS China will be worth 50 billion US dollars, the largest in the global range. "The scale of the ETS China would be an inspiration for the countries and it has the potential to change investment and consumption decisions made by individuals and that can lead to a much lower-carbon economy," said Tuck, adding that it could be a model. Meanwhile, members of the European Parliament on Friday urged the European Union and China to join forces at COP22 . "In Paris, China and the EU played a key role of honest brokers among different 'camps' during negotiations. That contributed to the final conclusion of the ground-breaking agreement," said Jo Leinen, chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with China. The historic Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, has been ratified by 96 countries and the EU, and entered info force on Nov 4. Under the agreement, nations have agreed to combat climate change and to unleash actions and investment toward a low-carbon, resilient and sustainable future. "In Marrakech, we will have to work on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We shall also work to consolidate the trust between developed and developing countries," said Giovanni La Via, chair of the European Parliament's delegation to COP22 . \</doc>

The European Parliament on Tuesday approved European Union (EU) ratification of the Paris agreement on fighting climate change, paving the way for the international deal to come into force earlier than predicted. With 610 votes in favor, 38 against and 31 abstentions, the European Parliament gave its consent to EU ratification and signaled it would join China, India, the United States, and other global players in trying to limit the worldwide impact of climate change. The agreement, which was negotiated and drafted during the international COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, seeks a global action plan to reduce emissions and limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level. The deal needed the ratification of 55 parties representing 55 percent of global emissions for entry into force. Prior to Tuesday's vote, 62 parties had already ratified, representing 51.89 percent of emissions. Seven EU member states - Hungary, France, Slovakia, Austria, Malta, Portugal and Germany - have already ratified the agreement. The European Union, however, representing some 12 percent of global emissions, will fulfill the second requirement for entry into force of the climate deal, just in time for the COP22 conference, scheduled to be held in Marrakech from November 7 to 18. "Our vote paves the way to ensure that the agreement meets the necessary threshold ... The entry into force of the Paris agreement less than one year after its signature is a massive achievement, given that it took eight years for the Kyoto protocol. Today's vote also means that the EU remains a climate leader," declared European Parliament President Martin Schulz during the signing of the letter of transfer of consent to be sent by the Parliament to the European Council. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was present for the signing, thanked Members of European Parliament (MEPs) before the vote, noting that: "The European Union has a long track record of leadership against climate change." Also present at the signing ceremony were French environment minister and COP21 President Segolene Royale, State Secretary of Slovakia Ivan Korcok, representing the Presidency of the European Council, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Now that the European Parliament has given its consent, the European Council can formally adopt the decision, and file the ratification instruments at the UN's New York headquarters by Friday. MEPs will also vote on a resolution Thursday to set out priorities for the next round of talks planned for COP22 in Morocco in November. Enditem. \</doc>

The world's first fully electric racing series is revving up excitement in global motor sports. Racing's electric revolution hits the track in Marrakesh The world's first fully electric racing series is revving up excitement in global motor sports. On Saturday, a grid of battery-powered Formula E cars will assemble in North Africa for the inaugural Marrakesh ePrix. Ten teams and 20 world-class drivers will fight wheel to wheel on the famous Moulay El Hassen street circuit. "The Marrakesh ePrix will be the first time Formula E visits the continent of Africa, and it reflects the growing demand for e-mobility solutions across the globe," said a posting on Formula E's official website. Marrakesh's 12-turn, 2.97km street circuit is the second-longest used by Formula E to date, after the Beijing Olympic circuit. The track previously hosted the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and Formula E stars Ma Qinghua and Jose Maria Lopez. Ma, the only Chinese driver on the Formula E grid, told China Daily he hopes to at least complete the Marrakesh race after several days of preparation in the simulator. He failed to finish the Hong Kong ePrix after his car was damaged on the first lap. "With the speed of our car, a reasonable result should be achievable this time," added Ma, who posted WTCC wins in Russia and Portugal. "Formula E requires some skills that are not needed in petrol-powered motor racing. Managing the electric energy throughout the race can make a huge difference." In season one, all teams used identical cars. They are now allowed to tinker with the powertrain. The freedom to innovate has attracted some of the world's biggest carmakers, including Renault, Audi, Jaguar and BMW, as sponsors or partners. "Formula E has grown very quickly, probably faster than everyone's expectation. And I don't see the expansion slowing down," Ma said. The Marrakesh race coincides with the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), being held in the city Nov 7-18 . As the official sporting opening event of COP22 , "Formula E fully understands the challenges and risks that climate change presents, and to be a part of the most significant forum for tacking this problem is a huge honor," said Alejandro Agag, CEO of Formula E. COP22 on Nov 13 Season Three of the Formula E Championship runs through July 2017, with stops in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Monaco, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, and double runs in New York and Montreal. HYPERLINK mailto:songwei@chinadaily.com.cn songwei@chinadaily.com.cn Innovative mission on emissions One of the principle aims of Formula E is to promote the use of electric cars. Formula E believes that increased electric car usage will make significant benefits to urban air quality, which in turn will lead to an improved quality of life. But one of the main objections from the anti-electric car lobby is that pollution caused by the production of the electricity negates the environmental credentials. That argument carries some weight in countries where the main supply to the national grid comes from coal-fired power stations. But if electric cars are to make a significant difference to urban air quality, charging them with electricity produced by low-emission sources is crucial. As Formula E wants to play a key role in advancing the technology surrounding electric car ownership, not just the cars themselves, the decision was taken that charging the cars had to come from a sustainable source.

A United Nations conference on climate change concluded here early Saturday after hours of negotiations that finally achieved compromise over the text on outcomes. Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), hailed the momentum of strong support for climate action and sustainable development. Seventy heads of state and government attended the high-level segment of COP22 and the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1), an indication of "irreversible momentum" for climate action. Informal consultations over the text of outcome documents lasted well into Friday night, pushing the closing session into the wee hours of Saturday. Mamadou Honadia, head of the Burkina Faso delegation, told Xinhua that negotiators had been trying to bridge their differences over the fate of the so-called Adaptation Fund, which was set up under the Kyodo Protocol. Developing countries worried about the fate of the Adaptation Fund since the Kyodo Protocol will expire in 2020 and be replaced by the Paris Agreement, he said. "The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to financing adaptation concrete projects," Honadia said. "We don't want this fund to disappear." Developing countries demand a change in the wording related to the fund in a draft decision to be adopted by the conference, Honadia revealed, adding that the document must make it clear that the Adaptation Fund "shall" serve the Paris Agreement. An explanatory note released earlier Friday by Mezouar said that the fund "should" serve the Paris deal. Developed countries and developing countries had also differed over when the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1) resume and over its agenda. Many developing countries that have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, such as Burkina Faso, demand that CAM1 be "suspended" so that they could attend it as a signatory instead of as an observer, Honadia said. He said that developing countries hope CAM1 would have a balanced agenda and discuss all major issues under the Paris Agreement, including mitigation, adaption and technology transfer. The agenda under discussion mainly focuses on the implementation of nationally determined contributions and is thus in favor of developed countries, he added. The conference, which started on Nov. 7, brought together thousands of government officials as well as representatives from international organizations, the civil society and businesses. It aims to pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Photo: Wang Yunsong/People's Daily China is cooperating with African countries in the fight against climate change through changes in agriculture on the continent, an Ivory Coast minister said at a high-level meeting for the Adaption of African Agriculture (AAA) September 30 in Marrakesh, Morocco.Mamadou Sangafowa Coulibaly, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Ivory Coast, told the Global Times that China has made a commitment to aid Africa in transforming the agricultural sector, "hence, we [African countries] are here to get united," said the minister.China has made incredible progress in recent years through improvements in agricultural practice to cope with climate change issues, Ethel Sennhauser, Director of the Agriculture Global Practice of World Bank, told the Global Times September 29."China has a lot of technology that can be extremely useful for the African continent to move forward," said Sennhauser, "China can bring a lot of experience into many of the countries in Africa."The high-level meeting was held as part of the coalition for the Initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA) to climate change.African nations must do more to adjust agricultural practices, according to experts. At the meeting, Rene Castro Salazar, Assistant Director General of the Forestry Department, suggested that governments reinforce their soil and water management.Others, such as Tariq Sijilmassi, Chairman of Cr\'e9dit Agricole du Maroc Group, advised to further develop the value chain from breeding to processing. He also highlighted the role of traditional banks in related projects.So far, Africa has not taken into account the importance of agriculture in climate change, said Aziz Akhannouch, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of Morocco. "Agriculture in Africa is a critical part of the solution to the global challenges raised by climate change," said the minister.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil science and a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, said that mankind is on the "horns of a dilemma.""The choices we have already made about the way we lead our lives have been slowly eating away at the very support system that enable us to live and breathe," said Lal.Ministers from over 20 African countries, scientists and experts attended the meeting.The AAA initiative aims to put AAA at the heart of the upcoming COP22 in Morocco, targeting concrete and innovative projects in soil management, agricultural-water control, climate-risk management, capacity building and funding solutions.

WETLANDS, forests, and oceans absorb and store carbon, which makes them a vital asset for countries pursuing the Paris climate agreement\' s targets for reducing CO2 emissions. So how can we use them most effectively? The Paris accord was concluded by 196 governments last December, and came into force earlier this month. Now, its signatories are meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, for the annual United Nations climate change conference . Several conference events specifically focus on how countries can use natural systems to meet their CO2-reduction targets. While the climate-change challenge is immense, so, too, is the opportunity to accelerate sustainable development and ensure a better future for everyone on the planet. Under the Paris agreement, governments have committed to reducing their carbon emissions drastically, in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The vast majority of signatory countries have already presented national action plans for achieving this goal, and these plans will become more ambitious over time. These Nationally Determined Contributions include renewable-energy targets and proposals for sustainable transportation, energy efficiency, and education. In addition, countries should consider adopting policies to manage natural capital better. The Paris agreement itself recognizes the important role that natural ecosystems play in limiting the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and governments should not neglect such powerful tools. Governments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems in people-friendly ways. This is particularly true of wetlands, which include all land areas that are covered with water, either seasonally or permanently. Peatlands are particularly important. Though they cover only 3 percent of the world\' s total surface area, they store twice as much carbon as all forests combined. Peatland soils are composed of carbon that has accumulated for thousands of years; and when peatlands are drained or burned, that carbon is released into the atmosphere. In fact, draining peatlands releases two times more carbon into the atmosphere than the aviation industry does. In 2015, fires raged across Indonesia\' s forested peatlands, raising concerns worldwide about how much carbon was being released into the atmosphere, to say nothing of the far-reaching health effects. Indonesia\' s government estimates that peatland fires and deforestation alone account for more than 60 percent of the country\' s total greenhouse-gas emissions. Conserving and restoring peatlands could significantly reduce global CO2 emissions, which is why, in 2015, the Nordic Council of Ministers announced a commitment to preserve the region\' s peatlands. Almost half of Nordic countries\' peatlands have been lost, and this ecosystem degradation contributes 25 percent of their total carbon emissions. The Paris agreement entered fully into force in less than a year. This indicates that there is global momentum for concrete action to address the causes of climate change, as well as its effects, such as the disastrous floods, water shortages, and droughts already afflicting many countries. That sense of urgency is not surprising. According to UN-Water, 90 percent of all natural hazards are water-related, and they will increase in frequency and intensity as climate change worsens. But natural systems can mitigate them: wetlands act as sponges that reduce flooding and delay the onset of droughts; and mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs all act as buffers that protect against storm surges. And wetlands, oceans, and forests do far more than just absorb and store carbon; they also provide fresh water, and are a food source for nearly three billion people.

Braving the chills in Marrakech, delegates attending a United Nations conference on climate change crossed through low-carbon fabricated pavilions, pondering pragmatic prescriptions to curb the fever gripping mother Earth. As has been always the case, China, as the largest developing country, has taken concrete moves to act on its pledges on this issue of global concern. From billions of dollars in climate investment over the years to Yangtze electric shuttle buses serving the conference in Marrakech, one can see China's role as a positive force behind endeavors to save the planet. As Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai put it, "whatever other countries may do or may not do, China will continue to make genuine efforts to respond to climate change to seek to realize green and sustainable development." SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS STRATEGY Since 1997, when sustainable development was set as a national strategy, China has been stressing its crucial role both domestically and at world forums. Pursuing sustainable development is the fundamental solution to all kinds of global problems, the premier said, adding that as a responsible developing country, China is willing to join in relevant international efforts and continuously increase investment in South-South cooperation. SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION "China plays a 'very important' role in promoting and consolidating South-South partnership," said Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), on Saturday. Cooperation among developing countries, with its great potential in managing climate change, is a main area of discussion at COP22 , to help developing economies come up with common responses to their pressing needs. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said here Monday that China stands ready to continue contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change through South-South cooperation. China is willing to share its best practices, including in capacity-building, with other developing countries, Xie told the opening session of a forum on South-South cooperation. With 27 MoUs signed and many regional dialogues and exchanges, China has made considerable donations to other developing countries to help them address climate change issues according to their own requirements, Xie said. CHINA'S CONTRIBUTION Standing as an active contributor in the global climate campaign, China, itself still a developing country, now tops the world in conservation efforts and utilization of new and renewable energies. Since 2011, China has earmarked around 85 million U.S. dollars for low-carbon, energy-saving, capacity-building and other projects in developing countries. "China becomes the largest investor for renewable energies across the world," said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. "It shows the Chinese commitment towards climate change and tackling air pollution." Earlier November, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Erik Solheim, hailed China's contribution to advancing the global green agenda, commending China for its "robust leadership" in advancing the December 2015 Paris Agreement. Signed during COP21, the Paris Agreement entered into force on Nov. 4, committing its 180 signatories to limiting global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. At the Paris climate summit in late 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated China's pledge to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent from the 2005 levels by 2030. On Monday in Marrakech, Xie, China's top climate change envoy, reaffirmed the country's plan to set up a 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) fund for South-South cooperation, to help establish low-carbon model parks, implement mitigation and adaption projects, and train personnel in developing countries. Laura Tuck, vice president for sustainable development of the World Bank, on Friday praised as "impressive" China's planned Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which will be worth 50 billion dollars, the largest in the world. China is the first developing country to set up a national carbon emissions trading market, based on its seven pilots that are running now. Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to COP22 , said on Thursday that China has set up an ambitious target of reaching the peaking of CO2 emissions around the year 2030. "Many cities promised they can reach their peaking before 2030, and a few cities are trying to achieve the target around 2020," Xie said, adding that many industries, especially energy intensive ones, were asked to cut CO2 emissions and try to reach the peaking around 2020. \</doc>

The United Nations Marrakech climate conference on Thursday adopted a proclamation calling for the highest political commitment and solidarity in the fight against climate change, amid fears that the next US administration may change US policy in this regard. A Moroccan policeman stands guard outside the COP22 village during the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, on Nov 15, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua] MARRAKETCH, Morocco - The United Nations Marrakech climate conference on Thursday adopted a proclamation calling for the highest political commitment and solidarity in the fight against climate change, amid fears that the next US administration may change US policy in this regard. "We call for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority," said the proclamation adopted at the closing plenary session of the conference. "We call for strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and underscore the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability," read the document. This brief proclamation was issued to "signal a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development." The proclamation stressed that an "extraordinary" momentum on climate change generated worldwide this year is "irreversible" since "it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels." "Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its sustainable development goals," it said. The conference, which opened on Nov 7 to pave the way for the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement, has been overshadowed by the unexpected win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election. During his campaign, Trump described the issue of climate change as a "hoax" and vowed to cancel various actions taken by the Obama administration, including the US ratification of the Paris Agreement. The statement also reaffirmed the goal of mobilizing 100 billion US dollars to help developing countries cope with climate change, but it doesn't mention any clear timeline or roadmap for developed countries to provide this funding as promised in 2009. According to US special envoy for climate change Jonathan Pershing, developed countries have pledged more than 60 million dollars to help developing countries build their capacity to report on their efforts in addressing climate change. "We were able to adopt a robust work plan that will enable us to flesh out the transparency framework that forms the bedrock of the Paris Agreement," he said. "Countries announced more than 60 million dollars for initiatives on capacity building for transparency... to ensure all countries can implement their obligation to report." Earlier Thursday, EU commissioner for climate action and energy Miguel Arias Canete applauded the host country's proposal for the UN conference to issue the proclamation. "This presidential initiative would send an important and timely political signal, with the proclamation as a powerful expression of the continued resolve to follow through on our Paris commitment to the decarbonization of the global economy," he told a press conference. "The European Union's commitment to the Paris Agreement is not in question," he said.

1) Work to promote ecological progress moved ahead. We promulgated and implemented the measures on evaluating performance in advancing ecological progress. We decided to build pilot zones for ecological advancement in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guizhou provinces, and stepped up the development of pilot demonstration zones for promoting ecological progress. We issued and implemented a number of reform plans on ecological progress, including: the pilot plan on improving the national system for natural-resource asset management; the guidelines for trial reforms to establish a system to bring county- and prefecture-level environmental monitoring, inspection, and law enforcement bodies directly under the jurisdiction of provincial-level environmental bodies; the plan for implementing the emissions permit system to tighten emissions control; and the guidelines on establishing and holding firm to the red lines for ecological conservation and on fostering market entities for environmental governance and ecological conservation. Pilot reforms of the compensation system for ecological and environmental damage were carried out in seven provinces and municipalities directly under the central government including Jilin. The guidelines on bringing the river chief system into full operation were issued, and mechanisms for compensating ecological conservation efforts were improved. We moved faster to implement a new round of projects to return marginal farmland to forest and grassland, build key forest shelterbelts, comprehensively address the expansion of stony deserts, control the sources of dust storms affecting Beijing and Tianjin, and bring soil erosion under control. A basic framework for wetland conservation was put in place. The central government carried out environmental inspections. 2) The development strategy for functional zones was further implemented. Key ecosystem service zones have been established in 676 counties and 87 forestry bureaus in key state forestry areas. A negative list for industry access to key ecosystem service zones was issued and put into force. Work got under way in 11 coastal provinces to draw up and implement plans for marine functional zones. The plan for establishing a national park system on a trial basis was implemented, with trials going ahead in national parks at the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang riversources, in the habitats of Siberian tigers, Far Eastern leopards, and giant pandas, in the Shennongjia area, in the Wuyi Mountains, and at the source of the Qiantang River. The mechanisms for monitoring and providing early warning on the carrying capacity of resources and the environment were basically established, with initial trials being implemented in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The pilot project for municipal or county-level governments to integrate various types of urban plans into a single urban plan moved forward, and the plan to carry out spatial-planning trials at the provincial level was implemented. The National Land Plan (2016-2030) and the Adjustments to the General Plan for National Land Use (2006-2020) were introduced. 3) Sustained progress was made in energy conservation and emissions reduction. The results of performance evaluations of provincial-level governments in fulfilling responsibilities for energy conservation targets during the 12th Five-Year Plan period were released to the public. The system to control both the total amount and intensity of energy and water consumption during the 13th Five-Year Plan period was established. Pilot projects to set up systems for the paid use and trade of energy consumption rights were carried out in Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, and Sichuan provinces. We stepped up development of the circular economy, issuing the plan to create a system for extended producer responsibility and making strides in promoting circular operations within industrial parks. The plan for developing energy conservation and environmental protection industries during the 13th Five-Year Plan period was issued. The guidelines on establishing a green finance system were introduced and applied, bonds worth 229.66 billion yuan for launching eco-friendly initiatives were issued, and the energy conservation and environmental protection industries achieved robust growth in terms of both scale and strength. 4) More was done to comprehensively address environmental problems. Stronger measures on the prevention and control of air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (2016-2017) were promulgated and implemented, and coal consumption in key areas was further cut. Coal-fired power plants were urged to swiftly upgrade their facilities and achieve ultra-low emissions. A total of 4.046 million old and high-emission vehicles were removed from roads nationwide. The action plan on environmental protection of the Yangtze Economic Belt (2016-2017) was implemented. Planning was completed on the establishment of protection zones for 319 centralized drinking water sources in 126 cities at or above prefectural level in 11 provinces and provincial-level municipalities. The national list of major drinking watersources was formulated. We identified and cleaned up both black, malodorous water bodies and undesignated refuse dumping points in urban areas. A project to manage household refuse in rural areas got fully under way, and comprehensive measures were taken to improve the rural living environments. We issued the action plan to prevent and control soil pollution and the measures for soil environmental governance on polluted land plots, launched 14 related pilot projects aimed at prevention, control, and restoration, and also established six trial zones for comprehensively preventing and curbing soil pollution. Greater efforts were taken to comprehensively improve land in key areas contaminated by heavy metals. We continued to improve and restore the geological environment in mining areas throughout the country. We made headway in managing and controlling environmental risks and in responding effectively to environmental emergencies. 5) Our efforts to respond to climate change grew stronger. A work plan to control greenhouse gas emissions during the 13th Five-Year Plan period was introduced. Trials and demonstrations to encourage low-carbon growth in provinces, municipalities, cities, towns, industrial parks, and communities proceeded in an orderly manner. Encouraging progress was made in establishing a national market for the trading of carbon emission rights. The Action Plan on Developing Climate Resilient Cities was promulgated. We quickened the pace of South-South cooperation on climate change and launched cooperation projects in developing countries to set up 10 low-carbon demonstration zones, launch 100 mitigation and adaption programs, and provide 1,000 places on climate-change training programs. China was one of the first countries to sign the Paris Climate Agreement and also ratified it at a relatively early stage. The presidents of China and the United States deposited with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon their respective country's instrument to join the Paris Agreement-the proposal to hold the ceremony, which was the first of its kind, was put forward by China, making a significant contribution toward the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement. China attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, where it played a constructive role and contributed to the overall success of the conference. 8. We moved faster to develop social programs and improve people's wellbeing, ensuring that living standards continued to rise. We directed major efforts toward implementing targeted measures for poverty alleviation and elimination, made social policies more effective in meeting basic living needs, and ensured more equitable access to basic public services.

The United Nations climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, concluded on Nov 20 without making any substantial progress, because it was tasked with charting the course of implementing the climate deal reached in Paris in December 2015. Although the Paris agreement has been ratified by 105 countries at last count, including China and India, it is not fully in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and many see it as rewarding the big defaulters who also happen to be, historically, the biggest polluters the countries in the developed North. There are two categories of such countries: those that agreed, under the Kyoto Protocol, the principle of historical culpability and the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" to reduce emissions more deeply than developing countries, but reneged; and those that refused to ratify the protocol, led by the historically biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the United States. The Kyoto Protocol was based on the principle that since the developed countries emitted huge amounts of GHGs for more than a century during their industrialization and development drives, they should yield "emission space" to the developing countries. Consequently, it was further incumbent on them not only to undertake more stringent, and binding, emission cuts but also help developing countries to chart cleaner growth trajectories through financial aid and technology transfers. None of this happened on a scale significant enough to make the kind of impact necessary to arrest climate change. The US refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol: its position was that of classical climate change denier, with former US president George H.W. Bush saying the American way of life was not up for negotiation. The Paris climate agreement buried the Kyoto Protocol and the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" and placed all countries, irrespective of their historical contribution to GHG emission or level of development, in the same position of having to undertake binding reduction targets, even if, obviously, the depth of cuts were not envisaged to be matching. Critically, the cuts accepted by the Barack Obama administration, although Obama himself is a not climate change denier, were nowhere near the levels required to keep the temperature from rising 2 C above pre-industrial levels, which climate scientists say is just short of the tipping point. The US is vital to any climate treaty because in the absence of adequate action by it, cuts accepted by most countries of the global South (including China and India) won't cut the mustard. Perhaps the leaderships of the countries of the South should have done more to compel the developed world to fulfill its responsibilities. India is especially guilty of selling out. For years, successive Indian governments have been clear that the Kyoto Protocol framework should be the basis for the fight against climate change. It was clearly in assiduous pursuit of the "special relationship" with the US that the Indian government craved so desperately. While previous Indian governments resisted the urge to give in to the demands of the developed world, especially the US', this one has, literally, stooped to genuflect before Washington's interests. This is not to say that India should not take urgent steps to reduce emissions. The recent crisis in Delhi caused by extremely hazardous air quality, which almost shut down the city, is enough of a warning. Action, however, should be taken by countries of the South on their own terms, rather than under the pressure of developed countries. India has, in fact, been running an emissions-reduction program to meet voluntarily set targets, which will not hurt commitments to development and factor employment. Now that Donald Trump, who is a self-proclaimed climate change denier, has been elected US president, the climate deal is back in the mix. If Trump sticks to his known anti-climate change stance, the only option would be to go back to the Kyoto Protocol and hope the White House accepts its principles.

China's top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Saturday called for a new system of green development. GUIYANG - China's top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Saturday called for a new system of green development. Yu, chairman of the National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was addressing the Eco Forum Global Annual Conference 2016 in Guiyang, capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province. China will continue green development, he said, emphasizing the importance of planning, innovation, structure transformation, reform and international cooperation in achieving the goal of green development. China took part in the negotiations on the Paris Agreement with a responsible, cooperative and constructive attitude and made important contributions, he said. On Dec. 12, 2015, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris sealed the pact, aiming to reverse the trend of global warming mainly caused by carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement is a crucial step in coping with climate change and shows the determination of the whole of mankind to protect the earth, he said. China has full confidence in the pact, he said. China is acting on its new vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, the five cornerstones proposed by President Xi Jinping for China to secure resilient, sustainable growth. Eco-civilization concerns the welfare and future of mankind, he said. The forum, which runs until Sunday has gathered more than 1,000 guests from China and abroad. Foreign leaders who addressed the opening ceremony included Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, President of the National Council of Switzerland Christa Markwalder, Deputy President of Kenya William Ruto and Laotian Deputy Prime Minister Bounthong Chitmany. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon sent a video of congratulation to the opening ceremony. \</doc>

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday welcomed a joint statement by U.S. and Indian leaders to announce their support for the Paris Agreement to enter into force early. Ban "is further encouraged by the resolve of India and the United States to pursue low greenhouse gas emission development strategies and successful outcomes this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Montreal Protocol, the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly, and the G20," according to a statement issued by the secretary-general's spokesman. Early on Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama and visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed climate change, nuclear energy and economic cooperation during a meeting at the White House. "The United States and India recognize the urgency of the threat of climate change and are therefore committed to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as quickly as possible," said a statement issued by the White House after Obama and Modi's meeting. The two nations' joint announcement, which follows the historic signing ceremony on April 22 for the Paris Agreement, "demonstrates the growing momentum towards the rapid entry into force and successful implementation of the Paris Agreement," said the UN statement. "The secretary-general encourages all countries to accelerate their domestic processes to join or ratify the agreement to ensure its early entry into force," the statement added. The Paris Agreement, reached at a UN conference on climate change in Paris in December 2015, is mainly aimed at keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and limiting the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5-degree-Celsius limit is believed to be a significantly safer defense line against the worst impacts of the climate change. On April 22, the first day that the Paris Agreement was open for signature, representatives from 175 countries signed the document, marking the largest one-day signing of any international agreement. As of today, 177 countries have inked, and 17 have ratified the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Along the main corridor connecting venues of the Marrakech climate summit stands a foot-high sculpture, of a nurse caring a globe, made with trash jars, rusty nails and screws, entitled "Our mother Earth is sick." Similar pieces of artwork dot the site of the United Nations conference, where delegates were bickering over how to save the "sick mother." Although a broad consensus looked unlikely at the gathering, Marrakech has showcased a model of green ideas and moves, with its diligent actions through the whole process of the conference. REUSABLE STRUCTURES Located at the Bab Ighli, which was a gate to old Marrakech city, the whole conference site covers 25 hectares, of which 10 hectares hosts light structure. COP22 ), all the buildings at the site will be reused after the summit and distributed to local associations. Particularly, the predominant use of oriented structural board in pavilions and structures of exhibition corners ensured flexibility during construction, which will be easy to dismantle after the event. The services during the conference are also in line with the green principle, echoing the historic December 2015 Paris Agreement, which took effect on Nov. 4 this year and has been ratified by 111 parties. Most of the art decorations, display booths, posters and display walls are made of recycled or reusable materials, showing stunning pictures of global catastrophic impacts by climate change. On both sides of the main corridor, a set of three trash cans are placed about every 20 meters for three waste categories, namely "paper," "plastic" and "others." For transportation, around 50 Chinese electric buses are serving COP22 , while arrays of French self-service bicycles wait outside the venues. NOT A SHOW As China's special representative on climate change affairs, Xie Zhenhua, stressed here, fighting climate change needs more actions than just making shows. What Morocco has been doing echoes the Chinese official's assertion. Its green campaign goes far beyond the 25-hectare site during the 12-day spotlight summit. No plastic bags are served at any mall, supermarket, convenience store, or street kiosk in Marrakech, which in fact has become a strategy in the entire country. A landmark bill was passed by the Moroccan parliament last October, and entered into force on July 1 this year to ban the production, import, sale and distribution of plastic bags across the country. The ban is part of a larger environmentally conscious effort across Morocco to go green, which, along with ambitious goals to crackdown on carbon emissions, has turned the country into a green leader among developing nations. Before the ban, Morocco was the world's second-largest plastic bag consumer after the United States, using about 3 billion such bags annually, or 900 for each Moroccan. However, earlier worries that consumers may need years to fully adapt to the ban turned out to be ill-founded. Where there is a will, there is a way. So is the human struggle against global warming. \</doc>

The Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco on Wednesday marked the Water Action Day, as part of the Global Climate Action Agenda that is aimed to bring more attention to water as a way of providing solutions to help implement the Paris Agreement. The agenda seeks to boost cooperation between governments, cities, businesses, investors and citizens to cut emissions and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy and sustainable futures. Countries have identified water as a key to adaptation in 93 percent of their national climate action plans. Charafat Afilal, Moroccan minister in charge of water, said on Wednesday that her country and its partners will launch the "Blue Book on Water and Climate." The publication is the concrete outcome of its interim International Conference on Water and Climate, hosted in Rabat in July 2016, in cooperation with the government of France and the World Water Council. For his part, Benedito Braga, president of the World Water Council, said that while humanity experiences increasing demographic and socioeconomic pressures, water remains one of the most impacted resources. \</doc>

Fiji, the upcoming presidency of a United Nations climate conference, on Friday urged U.S. president-elect Donald Trump to act positively on climate change to avoid "catastrophe." Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama called on Trump to abandon the view that global warming was a 'hoax" and to take responsibility in combating climate change. "A global scientific consensus is that it (global warming) is very real," Bainimarama said. "We must act more decisively and avert catastrophe," the Fijian prime minister told the closing plenary of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). While Fiji serves as the COP23 presidency, COP23 conferences will be hosted by Germany. Bainimarama invited the U.S. president-elect to visit Fiji and to see for himself the effects of climate change. "We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for its leadership and for its engagement and assistance on climate change," he said. "As the second biggest carbon emitter on earth, the United States must take responsibility for contributing to our collective response to this crisis and show leadership at this critical stage," Bainimarama said. On his campaigning trail, Trump had said he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stop funding international climate actions. \</doc>

The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Friday for giving health a central priority in the Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ), currently held in Morocco, and including it in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. According to a WHO statement, almost one quarter of the global burden of disease and approximately 12.6 million deaths each year are attributable to avoidable environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures and ultraviolet radiation. Global environmental and social changes, including climate change, exacerbate many of these risks, it added. Despite the growing evidence of the effect of environmental risk factors on health, political action and investments remain largely insufficient: only about 3 percent of health resources are invested in prevention, with approximately 97 percent are spent on treatment, increasing healthcare costs, it pointed out. Health gains represent major social and economic benefits of environmental protection, and therefore should be put forward as key motivating forces for public support and political action, it said. Morocco, the WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme will host later in the day a ministerial meeting on health, environment and climate change. The meeting will bring together health and environment ministers to promote healthier environments for healthier people. The participants are expected to identify ways and means for a potential future coalition and a adopt Marrakesh declaration on health, environment and climate change. \</doc>

The Marrakech climate summit is successful, yet further negotiations should be carried out soon to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement, China's top climate envoy said here Saturday. "I think the conference is a success, yet we still have a lot more to work on," Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said after the closing session of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). "There are still some issues ended up waiting consolidation and perfection," Xie said in remarks delivered after adoption of the outcome documents, expressing the hope that due attention will be paid to those issues and their resolution. "Developed countries should fulfill their commitments, especially the financial support for developing countries," Xie said, referring to the annual 100 billion U.S. dollars promised in 2009. Meanwhile, future negotiations should better address developing countries' concerns over adaptation, financing and capacity building, he added. The Paris Agreement was signed last December and entered into force on Nov. 4. So far 111 of the 193 signatory parties have ratified the agreement. \</doc>

The Moroccan region of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima and the Union for the Mediterranean concluded a partnership agreement, aiming at reinforcing regional cooperation to combat climate change in the Mediterranean, the council of the Moroccan region said in a statement on Wednesday. The agreement came only a few days prior to the MedCOP Climate 2016 in Tangier on July 18-19, which is a part of Morocco's preparation for the climate summit to take place in Marrakech in November. Ilyas El Omari, president of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Regional Council, said in the statement that keeping the global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius, a goal set by the Paris Agreement, requires other actions besides contributions determined on a national level. "In light of COP22 , which is due to take place in Marrakech in November, a coordinated regional approach within the scope of Climate Action is fundamental in order to achieve this goal within the Mediterranean, one of the regions that are most sensitive to the harmful effects of climate change," he added. The MedCOP Climate will bring together more than 2,000 representatives from various countries in the Mediterranean basin and civil society organizations. Following the first MedCOP edition in Marseille in June 2015, it will mark a crucial step towards the implementation of a Mediterranean agenda for climate change. \</doc>

Source: Xinhua | September 14, 2016, Wednesday | PRINT EDITION CHINA has shown strong climate leadership by incorporating green finance into the agenda of the G20 Summit, a step that will further push the Paris Agreement into force, climate experts said. China proposed the G20 Green Finance Study Group, led by the central banks of China and the UK, which developed a report on green finance for the Hangzhou summit. The report clarifies the definition and scope of green finance and identifies challenges and options for countries to move towards a greener economy. Ahead of the G20 Summit, Chinese authorities unveiled guidelines for establishing a green finance mechanism to facilitate the domestic economy\' s transition to sustainable growth, making China the first country with a complete green finance system.  Following the G20, China will continue to lead green finance development and it will also start more international cooperation in green finance, said Wang Yao, director of the Climate and Energy Finance Research Center at Central University of Finance and Economics. Before the G20 Summit, legislative authorities in China and the United States ratified the Paris Agreement. Formally joining the agreement is in line with China\' s domestic aim to clean up pollution and attain green growth, Wang said. Li Junfeng, director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said the ratification was a big step towards bringing the climate agreement into effect. It will bring the contracting parties\' shares of global emissions from 1.08 percent to 39.06 percent, he said. Green finance can turn environmental burdens into assets and will mobilize the funds many countries need to cut emissions, especially in times of economic hardship, Li said. Emissions On December 12, 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris reached an agreement to hold the average global rise in temperatures at below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees. Li said that besides the voluntary options of contracting parties, a further 12 billion tons of emissions needed to be cut, which requires more forceful measures around the globe. In the first seven months of 2016, China\' s green bond issues hit about US$18 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the world total during the period. Analysts say the green finance sector is a promising area for global investors. Liu Qiang, director of the strategic planning department of the climate change center said China will build a national carbon trade market in 2017, and by 2020 it plans to build 1,000 low-carbon communities. \</doc>

The global climate summit COP 22 is slated for November in Marrakech, Morocco, as a move to achieve the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, Moroccan foreign minister Salahedine Mezour said Thursday. The COP 22 "Today, climate actions involve not only countries, but also the private sector, the financial area, cities, regions and civil societies," Mezouar said. Segolene Royal, chairwoman of the COP 21, said the issue of climate change is a matter of life, which causes death of millions across the world, calling for urgent actions. The Paris Agreement on climate change can only take effect when the 55 countries with 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions ratify it, she noted. Royal also praised the close cooperation between Morocco and France during Morocco's preparation for organizing the COP 22 . COP 22 Participants will discuss means to strengthen voluntary initiatives to accelerate the process of limiting global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius from the former target as two degrees Celsius. \</doc>

The European Union and eight countries pledged here on Wednesday 23 million U.S. dollars to support technology transfer in developing countries to meet their mitigation and adaptation goals. The pledge was announced at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakech by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland, aiming at delivering tailored capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries. It provides a major scale-up of Climate Technology Center and Network (CTCN) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the implementation arm of the Technology Mechanism by the COP, and a key institution to help nations realize their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UNFCCC, said that accelerating the deployment of clean and green technologies and finance is going to be crucial for realizing the aims of the agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. This new funding support will enable the CTCN to meet the growing demand for technology solutions that work for developing countries, Spencer Thomas, the CTCN Advisory Board Chair said. Received assistance requests include providing capacity building support for national energy efficiency policies in Colombia, technical assistance for design and financing of crop drying and storage technologies for enhanced food security in Mali, and facilitation of South-South technology transfer in Bhutan for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. \</doc>

Morocco's King Mohammed VI said here on Wednesday that Africa should unite in the fight against climate change. "It is important that our continent speak with one voice, demand climate justice and mobilization of necessary resources, and submit concerted proposals in connection with the fight against climate change," he told the opening of "Africa Action Summit." All types of vulnerabilities are concentrated in Africa, as there are already 10 million climate refugees in the continent, the king said at the gathering, which was held on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). "The immense freshwater reservoir of Lake Chad has already lost 94 percent of its surface area and is facing the risk of drying up once and for all," he said, recalling that 4 million hectares of forest, twice the global average, are lost each year in Africa. African agriculture, which consists predominantly of subsistence farming, employs 60 percent of the African workforce, yet "our crops suffer from severe disruptions, and our food security is seriously jeopardized," he said. The king stressed the importance of identifying measures and mechanisms needed to support the implementation of flagship programs, ensuring institutional capacity building in Africa, as well as seizing opportunities and studying the implications of low carbon development in the fields of energy, technological innovation and "green" jobs. \</doc>

China has shown strong climate leadership by incorporating green finance into the agenda of G20, and the outcome of the summit will further push the Paris Agreement to come into force, climate experts said. BEIJING - China has shown strong climate leadership by incorporating green finance into the agenda of G20, and the outcome of the summit will further push the Paris Agreement to come into force, climate experts said. The report clarifies the definition and scope of green finance and identifies challenges and options for countries to move towards a greener economy. Ahead of the G20 Summit, Chinese authorities unveiled guidelines for establishing a green finance mechanism to facilitate the economy's transition to sustainable growth, making China the first country with a complete green finance system in the world. "Following the G20, China will continue to lead green finance development and it will also start more international cooperation in green finance," said Wang Yao, director of the the Climate and Energy Finance Research Center of the Central University of Finance and Economics. Before the G20 Summit, legislative authorities in China and the United States ratified the Paris Agreement. Formally joining the agreement is in line with China's domestic aim to clean up pollution and attain green growth, Wang said. Li Junfeng, director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said the ratification was a big step towards bringing the climate agreement into effect. It will bring the contracting parties' shares of global emissions from 1.08 percent to 39.06 percent, he said. Green finance can turn environmental burdens into assets and will mobilize the fund many countries need to cut emissions, especially in times of economic hardship, Li said. On Dec 12, 2015, 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris reached agreement to hold the average global rise in temperatures at below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees. Li said that besides the voluntary options of contracting parties, a further 12 billion tons of emissions needed to be cut, which requires more forceful measures around the globe. In the first seven months of 2016, China's green bond issues hit about $18 billion, about 40 percent of the world total during the period.

Source: Xinhua | September 3, 2016, Saturday | ONLINE EDITION CHINA'S top legislature on Saturday ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, a significant international legal document that outlines post-2020 global climate governance. Lawmakers voted to adopt "the proposal to review and ratify the Paris Agreement," at the closing meeting of the week-long bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. The much-anticipated Paris Agreement on climate change is the third document to attempt to address climate change, following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. BIGGER ROLE IN GLOBAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE "Ratifying the agreement accords with China's policy of actively dealing with climate change," according to the proposal, which added that addressing climate change would help the country realize sustainable development. The ratification will "further advance China's green, low-carbon development and safeguard environmental security," it said. "Ratifying the agreement is conducive to China's development interests," and it will also help the country "play a bigger role in global climate governance," according to the proposal. China signed the Paris Agreement at UN Headquarters in New York on April 22, Earth Day, sending a strong messaging to the international community as it joins forces against global warming. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, the special envoy of President Xi Jinping, signed the document and announced that China aimed to finalize domestic legal procedures to ratify the pact before the G20 summit in Hangzhou. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, negotiators representing 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris (COP21) sealed the pact, aiming to reverse temperature increases, mainly caused by carbon emissions. The agreement sets a target of holding the global average rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees. It is a major milestone for global climate negotiations, especially after the failed climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009 and disputes among countries on their responsibilities. Environmental experts said that, during the Paris negotiations, China helped resolve several thorny issues. To fulfill its commitment to the Paris climate pact, China will have to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. These targets were reflected in China's intended national determined contribution (INDCs) and also in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). After the signing, the Paris Agreement is still missing the support of 55 nations that account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions before it can enter into force. Countries still have one year to ink the agreement as it is open for signatures until April 21, 2017. \</doc>

Following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, reactions poured in from across the world. Both China and the United States bear the special responsibility of maintaining world peace and stability and boosting global development and prosperity; the two share extensive interests. "I am looking forward to working together with you to expand China-U.S. cooperation in every field, at the bilateral, regional and global levels, on the basis of the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, with differences controlled in a constructive manner, so as to push China-U.S. relations further forward from a new starting point, benefiting the peoples of the two countries and other countries as well," Xi said. Russian President Vladimir Putin: Putin "expressed his hope for joint work aimed at steering Russia-U.S. relations out of the crisis, as well as solving pressing issues on the international agenda and searching for efficient responses to global security challenges." UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: Ban encouraged the United States to stay true to its "unity in diversity." "As a founding member of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council, the United States is an essential actor across the international agenda," he said, adding that "now more than ever, we must mobilize around the principles and common values of the United Nations Charter." European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: "Only by cooperating closely can the EU and the United States continue to make a difference when dealing with unprecedented challenges." NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg: Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ): COP22 will continue to pursue progress, particularly with the new U.S. administration. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Abe reminded Trump of the importance of the Asia-Pacific region, saying its peace and stability are "a driving force of the global economy" that also brings peace and prosperity to the United States. British Prime Minister Theresa May: The United Kingdom and the United States "are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defense." Both countries will build on these ties "to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead." French President Francois Hollande: Trump's victory in the U.S. election "opens a period of uncertainty." He called for "a united Europe, capable of making itself heard and of promoting policies wherever its interests or its values are challenged." German Chancellor Angela Merkel: Merkel has offered Trump "close cooperation" on the basis of shared trans-Atlantic values, adding that the partnership with the United States "is a foundation stone of German foreign policy." Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern: Kern believed that Trump would not implement many of the controversial announcements he made during the U.S. presidential election campaign, and that people would have to wait and see what would happen during the Trump administration. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen: Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila: The election result indicated that Americans were longing for change. It also reflects the uncertainty caused by globalization, he said. Sipila also hoped that Trump would open new doors to resolve, for example, the crisis in Syria. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: "We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security." Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto: Pena Nieto and Trump had agreed on a meeting to define the future of bilateral relations. "Our teams should...begin to outline a new work agenda which incorporates topics of common interest, such as security, cooperation and the prosperity of our societies." Brazilian President Michel Temer: "We view positively the message of overcoming national divisions and the search of a constructive compromise with all countries, spoken by Donald Trump in his acceptance speech." Bolivian President Evo Morales: Morales said he hopes to work with the new administration "against racism, sexism, anti-immigration (and) for the sovereignty of our peoples." Peruvian Minister of Economy and Finance Alfredo Thorne: "The markets are very worried...due to an unexpected result. They were waiting for the opposition candidate (Hillary Clinton) but the indicators of Peru are very stable and we have all the instruments to anchor our expectations," he said, adding that "things will be fine, we have all manner of presidents in American history." The Burundian ruling party chief Evariste Ndayishimiye: "We hope that new leaders of the United States will know the real and objective situation of Burundi." \</doc>

CHINA will continue to be an active player in climate talks and its policies will not be affected by any external changes, a Chinese negotiator at a UN climate change conference said here Friday. Chen Zhihua, a member of the Chinese delegation and an official of China's National Development and Reform Commission, made the remarks on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) held in the Morrocan city of Marrakesh. Whether the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to cancel the agreement during his campaign, takes office in January, Chen said now isn't the right time to assess it. "We still need to wait. No matter what happens in the new U.S.government, China will continue to constructively participate in the international climate change process," said Chen, adding that global efforts to curb climate change will not stop. Even if the United States withdraws from the agreement, cooperation between China and the U.S. will continue, Chen said. "This is the attitude we hold toward the matter." The UN climate change conference opened on Monday and will end next Friday. Chen said there were indeed some difficulties on issues such as financing and technology transfer in climate change talks. Developed countries have proposed about 100 billion U.S. dollars to help developing countries counter climate change; the offer would be assessed very soon by all the participants, he said. However, no consensus has been reached on the "common but differentiated responsibilities," or the basic principle to implement the Paris Agreement, he said. Chen urged developed countries to show their leadership and fulfill their promises to help developing countries reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. "We should shorten the distance between our actions and goals before 2020," said Chen, adding that China is willing to offer its own proposals to combat climate change that could satisfy all parties. \</doc>

African leaders committed here on Wednesday to promoting the climate change adaptation measures and policies as catalysts for profound economic and social structural transformation in Africa. In a declaration of the first Africa Action Summit for continental co-emergence, heads of delegations from 50 African countries vowed to consolidate their respective commitments to tackle the effects of climate change in order to give more coherence to their strategies and move forward together. They also agreed to speed up the implementation of initiatives that have already been identified or launched, not only by building on their own resources, but also by mobilizing multilateral and bilateral donors as well as non-state ones. The initiatives mainly aim at enhancing Africa's resilience to the threats of climate change, such as the "Africa Adaptation Initiative," the "Adaptation of African Agriculture" initiative, the "Security, Stability and Sustainability" initiative, and the "Rural Resilience" initiative. Some other initiatives are expected to boost African sustainable co-emergence, like the "Africa Renewable Energy Initiative" and the "Conservation of the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem". The leaders committed to encouraging and facilitating the participation of the private sector in mobilizing additional capabilities and funding to tackle the challenge of climate change. They stressed that Africa, which has contributed the least to global greenhouse gas emissions, is the continent most affected by the impacts of climate change, the consequences of which may jeopardize peace, security and sustainable development in the region. Held on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), the Africa Action Summit was an opportunity for African countries to develop a common vision regarding funding and technology transfer. The Summit also brought together representatives of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the United States, France, African Union, the World Bank and the African Development Bank. \</doc>

As delegates attending the Marrakech United Nations climate conference leave for home, the global community should start working on bolder, faster steps right away, acting on the renewed determination displayed in this "Rose City" to save humankind from itself. All countries, both developing and especially developed ones, should seize and build on the "irreversible" and "extraordinary" momentum reflected at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 12th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP12), and the 1st session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1). A proclamation issued on Thursday in Marrakech demanded the "highest political commitment" to combating climate change, as "a matter of urgent priority." The United States, the largest developed economy, and China, the largest developing country, should take the lead in the fight against global warming. China, for its part, has steadily forged ahead with efforts in promoting a green, low-carbon economy at home and in helping fellow developing countries in the South tackling climate change. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said the Chinese government considers it an inherent requirement under its own sustainable development to address climate change and shoulders its share of responsibility for the common destiny of the human race. China has set itself a binding target of 19 percent cut of CO2 emission per unit of GDP for the period of 2015-2020. China has launched the China Fund for South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, to establish low-carbon model parks, implement mitigation and adaption projects, and train personnel in developing countries. Many have expressed optimism that Trump would do the right thing after taking office inside the White House; others have warned of the dire consequences if he does not. In a speech in Marrakech, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned against making "irrevocable choices" for "decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture." "No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input," Kerry said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was among the most optimistic. "I am sure that he will make a good, wise decision," Ban said, stressing that the Paris Agreement is advocated by "not just a few countries" but represents a "wholehearted commitment by the whole world." Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji, which takes over the presidency of UN climate change conference next year, asked Trump to make the right climate decisions to save the world from "catastrophe." "A global scientific consensus is that it (global warming) is very real," Bainimarama said, inviting the U.S. president-elect to visit Fiji and to see for himself the effects of climate change. "As the second biggest carbon emitter on earth, the United States must take responsibility for contributing to our collective response to this crisis and show leadership at this critical stage," Bainimarama said. In addition to uncertainties over future U.S. climate policy, another focal point in Marrakech was arrangements for financial support for global climate action, especially among delegates from developing countries. They were disappointed at developed countries' slowness and inadequacy in contributing to global climate action. A report on the progress of rich countries' commitment to provide an annual 100 billion U.S. dollars to developing countries before 2020 was rejected as not reflecting reality. "There is reluctance to acknowledge that action needs to happen today, if not yesterday," Meena Raman, of Friends of the Earth Malaysia, told a press conference on Friday, accusing developed countries of dragging feet. "There is an attempt here to introduce a report... which pretends to show that they are on track," she said. "All of us know that they are not on track." "The numbers are being forged, the methodology is flawed, and the developed countries are way, way short," she said. Many called for immediate action rather than waiting until after 2020. "The action before 2020 is absolutely crucial," said Dipti Bahatnagar, of Friends of the Earth International. "Developed countries, the ones with the historical responsibility, need to have stronger targets on reducing emissions." In his remarks at the closing plenary, Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, who serves as president of COP22 , said Marrakech has pushed the implementation of the Paris Agreement up a gear. Marrakech represents a landmark between the historic Paris Agreement and the way forward, he said. The world should work harder, faster on climate change, and make the Rose City the new start of a rosier future for this and future generations. \</doc>

The agreement is the third document to attempt to address climate change, following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. BIGGER ROLE IN GLOBAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE "Ratifying the agreement accords with China's policy of actively dealing with climate change," said the proposal, and addressing climate change will help sustainable development. Ratification will "advance China's green, low-carbon development and safeguard environmental security," it said. Ratifying the agreement is in China's interests and will help the country "play a bigger role in global climate governance," according to the proposal. China signed the Paris Agreement at UN Headquarters in New York on April 22, Earth Day. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, acting for President Xi Jinping, signed the document and announced that China would ratify the pact before the G20 summit in Hangzhou. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of talks, 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris (COP21) reached agreement on holding the average global rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees. It is a major milestone for global climate negotiations, especially after the failed 2009 Copenhagen summit and disputes among countries on their responsibilities. To fulfill its commitments, China will have to cut carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. These targets are reflected in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The Paris Agreement still lacks the support of 55 nations that account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Countries still have one year to ink the agreement as it is open for signatures until April 21, 2017. ENGENDERING BANDWAGON EFFECT Joanna Lewis of Georgetown University said in a signed article, "Climate change is the area in which China has shown perhaps the strongest international leadership. As China hosts the G20, we can expect energy and climate to be front and center." "China seems to be taking a responsible lead to join others in setting the example of implementing steps to limit global warming," Douglas H. Paal, director of Asia Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Xinhua. "It is smart for China to use its hosting of the G20 Summit try to engender a bandwagon effect among the participating countries," he said. Environmental experts said that concrete commitment by major powers, like China, would increase expectations for an early start to the pact, before the original deadline of 2020. "I think the Paris Agreement will enter into force very, very soon," said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \</doc>

An international forum started here Thursday in preparation for a United Nations conference on climate change later this year in Morocco. About 300 participants, including leaders, legislators, experts and representatives from the civil society were present at the two-day Global Forum of Alliances and Coalitions. COP 22 , or the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is scheduled to take place in November in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. The forum aims to establish the structure and the organization of a high-level event on climate action, planned for COP 22 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, in order to encourage innovative voluntary initiatives. It will also provide an opportunity for coalitions to discuss the implementation and plans for the Marrakech event, and potential cooperation, organizers say. Participants will discuss means to strengthen voluntary initiatives to accelerate the climate trajectory by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from the original target of 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

Morocco has taken all the necessary security measures to ensure the success of the climate summit COP 22 slated for November in Marrakech, a senior official said on Wednesday. Cherki Drais, Moroccan Minister delegate for the Interior, underlined that preparations are going smoothly, and Moroccan security services are paying the highest levels of vigilance in the kingdom's ports and airports. He made the remarks at a meeting in Rabat with a delegation of 27 reporters from 15 African countries, on a visit to Morocco to cover the preparations under way for holding the climate summit. The COP 22 , or the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is to take place from November 7 to 18 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. Morocco has a great experience in the field of organizing international, Arab and African summits and conferences which had attracted thousands of participants from around the world, the official said. The UNFCCC entered into force in 1994, aiming at reducing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The Conference of the Parties (COP) was designated as the supreme governing body of the convention. \</doc>

UN conference on climate change held in Morocco's Marrakech concluded Saturday after negotiations that finally achieved compromise over the text on outcomes, which has constituted the most outstanding topic among a series of major news events taking place in the Middle East region in the outgoing week from Nov. 13-19. UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE ADOPTS DECLARATION FOR ACTION Seventy heads of state and government attended the high-level segment of COP22 and the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1), an indication of "irreversible momentum" for climate action. Developing countries demand a change in the wording related to the fund in a draft decision to be adopted by the conference, Honadia revealed, and the document must make it clear that the Adaptation Fund "shall" serve the Paris Agreement. The United Nations Marrakech climate conference on Thursday adopted a proclamation calling for the highest political commitment and solidarity in the fight against climate change, amid fears that the next U.S. administration may change U.S. policy in this regard. This brief proclamation was issued to signal a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development. The conference, which opened on Nov. 7 to pave the way for the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement, has been overshadowed by the unexpected win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. A major achievement of the talks is that the spirit of unity and flexibility demonstrated by all parties helped rebuild the international community's confidence in global cooperation on climate change, which has been overshadowed by uncertainty caused by the election victory of Donald Trump, delegates and civil society members say. TURKEY DETAINS 73 ACADEMICS IN CRACKDOWN Turkish authorities on Friday detained 73 academicians from the Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul as part of an ongoing crackdown launched in the wake of a failed coup in July, local media reported. Press reports said some suspects were accused of using the so-called Bylock messaging App adopted by an outlawed organization led by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who was accused of masterminding the coup attempt on July 15. More than 40,000 people have been detained in the ongoing investigation, with some 80,000 others removed from public office in the purges. BUMPY ROAD AHEAD TO RECONCILE YEMEN WARRING SIDES The internationally recognized government of Yemen has rejected a peace plan proposed by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shortly after it turned down a UN-proposed peace roadmap. It is saying neither the U.S. nor UN plans can lay the groundwork for permanent peace or they may legitimize the Houthi-Saleh coup. Moreover, the two plans were not based on the Gulf Initiative, the outcomes of the national dialogue conference and the UNSC's resolution 2216, it says. The government's rejection of the US and UN plans is a sign of total confusion of all including foreign players, the US in particular. Observers argued that the US role toward Yemen is based on commitment to back the US biggest ally in the region, Saudi Arabia. Both countries are now seeking any peace deal before US president Barack Obama leaves office. CEASEFIRE GOES INTO EFFECT IN YEMEN A 48-hour ceasefire declared by Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen began on Saturday to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to besieged areas. The two-day ceasefire that began from 12:00 noon in Yemen's timing (09:00 GMT) will be automatically renewed if the Shiite Houthi fighters and supporters of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh adhere to it. The main purpose of the ceasefire is allowing humanitarian aid access to reach besieged areas including the southwestern province of Taiz, according to the Saudi-led military coalition. UN "APPALLED" BY ESCALATION OF BATTLES IN ALEPPO The UN said it was "extremely appalled" by the escalation in fighting in Syria, particularly in Aleppo. The statement on Saturday recounted instances of intensified violence, such as the raging conflict in the northern city of Aleppo, and the mortar shelling that targeted several residential areas in the capital Damascus. It said such attacks targeted civilians and infrastructures, calling on all warring parties to cease "indiscriminate attacks." The targets included hospitals in the rebel-held areas in eastern Aleppo, and the university in the government-controlled parts west of Aleppo. It highlighted the need for all parties to accept the plan and accept to provide safe access to the affected people in eastern Aleppo. IRAQI FORCES CONTINUE OPERATION NEAR MOSUL Iraqi security forces on Saturday recaptured a town and two villages in south of the city of Mosul, while special forces fought heavy clashes with Islamic State (IS) militants as they pushed deeper into the eastern part of the city, a security source said. The security forces have been fighting to push deeper into the eastern side of the city, but met resistance of the militants, who are fighting in small groups of well-trained fighters with snipers, suicide bomb attacks and many landmines, in addition to the heavy presence of civilians in their homes in Mosul districts. The Iraqi security forces continued their advance in south and west of the city of Mosul, as fierce battles continued in the city to drive out the Islamic State (IS) militants from their last major stronghold in Iraq. CHINESE FILMS WELCOME IN CAIRO FILM FESTIVAL The Chinese cinema is very rich and future cooperation between Egypt and China, the guest of honor of the ongoing 38th Cairo International Film Festival (CIFF), is a necessity, said the festival's president. Wassef noted that Egyptian filmmakers have discovered many excellent Chinese movies through film festivals around the world, such as those of Canne and Berlin. With 204 contesting films from 61 countries, the CIFF jury will award the Golden Pyramid for best film, the Silver Pyramid for best director, the Bronze Pyramid for best first or second work of a director, Naguib Mahfouz Prize for best screenplay, as well as other prizes for best actor, best actress and best artistic contribution. TURKEY VOWS REFERENDUM FOR EU BID IN 2017 Turkey could hold a Brexit-like referendum next year on whether to continue membership talks with the EU, Turkish President Erdogan said Monday, local NTV reported. Erdogan slammed European Parliament (EP) President Martin Schulz for his remarks that the EU could impose sanctions on Turkey following its anti-terror arrests. In a televised speech, Erdogan cited to calls from some EU members states to stop membership negotiations with Turkey and said "You are even too late. Make up your mind immediately," he said. Meanwhile, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus also slammed European Parliament President Schulz on Monday for signaling that the EU could impose sanctions on Turkey following its anti-terror arrests. BATTLES CONTINUE TO RETAKE AL-RAQQA FROM IS One week after the operation began to retake al-Raqqa from the so-called Islamic State (IS), Turkey still has misgivings about the U.S. handling of the fighting against the militant group both in Syria and Iraq, while a Turkish confrontation with the Syrian Kurds is not ruled out. Ankara is concerned that Washington is trying to create a Kurdish entity along the Turkish border in northern Syria by using the IS as a tool. Many towns and villages originally captured by the IS in civil war-torn Syria and Iraq were later liberated by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) outlawed by Turkey or the People's Protection Units (YPG), seen by Ankara as PKK's Syrian offshoot. OIL PRODUCERS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUTPUT CUT DEAL Oil producers said Friday after a meeting in Doha that they are optimistic about reaching a deal at next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna. Officials from eleven OPEC and non-OPEC member countries gathered today in an informal consultative meeting to discuss talks on output cut under the general terms of a proposal tabled in Algeria in September. Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed Al-Sada said that Friday's meeting came within the framework of meetings held periodically by countries inside and outside the OPEC to negotiate the stabilization of oil production. Talking about Iran and Iraq freezing oil production, he noted that the meeting touched on all issues related to fixing oil production. Iraq and Iran both want exemptions from any OPEC cuts in output. DUBAI TO BUILD WORLD'S LARGEST E-LIBRARY The Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum has issued Friday a law to establish a one billion dirham (USD 272 million) library with two million e-books, making it the world's largest electronic collection. Spreading over one million square feet, the facility will include eight specialized libraries, can accommodate 42 million visitors annually and will host over 100 annual cultural events. ''We want this library to serve as a cultural forum, an incubator for knowledge and a civilization centre in the region,'' said His Highness Sheikh Mohammed. The announcement marks the culmination of the UAE government's program "2016 -- the year of reading." THE WEEK AHEAD Ceasefire in Yemen, battles in Mosul, Aleppo and al-Raqqa and OPEC's oil output cuts as well as Turkey's widening crackdown will remain focus of topics in the Middle East region in the upcoming week from Nov. 20-26. A 48-hour ceasefire declared by Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen began on Saturday to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to besieged areas. The main purpose of the ceasefire is allowing humanitarian aid access to reach besieged areas. Turkey vowed to hold a Brexit-like referendum next year on whether to continue membership talks with the EU, which aroused wide concerns over its ties with EU. Oil producers said that they are optimistic about reaching a deal at next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna. However, Iraq and Iran both want exemptions from any OPEC cuts in output. \</doc>

Africa was the hardest hit continent by weather events in 2015, according to Global Climate Risk Index. However, he revealed that heat waves claimed the lives of many people in both developing and developed countries. People are suffering from lack of protection and insufficient disaster management, especially in less developed countries, he said. The report noted that from 1996 to 2015, there were more than 530,000 deaths caused by more than 11,000 extreme weather events. The hardest hit countries during the same period were Honduras, Myanmar and Haiti. "These results remind us of the importance to support resilience policy to mitigate the negative effects of climate events on people and countries," he said. The COP 22 The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in December 2015 at COP 21 in Paris, was ratified in October by 96 countries and the European Union and entered into force on Nov. 4. Around 20,000 delegates, 30,000 civil society members from some 200 countries are gathering at the COP 22 climate change conference. \</doc>

The handover of the legal document signifies a new and solemn commitment of the Chinese government, Xi said, adding that by depositing the documents together, China and the US have displayed their ambition and determination to jointly tackle the global challenge."I believe that history will judge today's efforts as pivotal," Obama said. "This is not a fight that any one country, no matter how powerful, can take alone Some day we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."Obama touched down in Hangzhou on Saturday to attend the G20 summit and also to debut his last overseas diplomacy in Asia before his successor takes office in January.China's top legislature on Saturday also ratified the Paris agreement as lawmakers voted to adopt "the proposal to review and ratify" the legal document that outlines post-2020 global climate governance at the closing meeting of the week-long bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Yang Fuqiang, a senior advisor on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the Global Times that the move right before the Hangzhou summit from China and the US, who together are responsible for 40 percent of the world's carbon emissions, will urge more countries to get involved in dealing with global climate issues."China and the US may have persistent differences and disputes, but they have reached a consensus in climate change, one of the greatest threats facing humanity," Yang said.Yang pointed out that after the proposal to the UN, the two sides will have more detailed discussions on energy conservation and emissions reduction, which will include setting a timetable on reducing fossil energy subsidies and reaching an agreement on energy reduction in the commercial aviation industry.Xi said on Saturday that in order to take full advantage of the implementation of the Paris Agreement the international community should make a greater effort to improve global governance mechanism and innovation on relevant.Xi also noted that developed countries should honor their commitments and provide financial and technological support to developing countries in order to enhance their capability in climate actions.To fulfill its commitment to the Paris climate pact, China will have to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent and peak its carbon emissions by 2030, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Yang said that China's commitment is in accordance with its ongoing industry transformation and upgrading and fits its needs to develop its green economy.China, a responsible developing country and an active player in global climate governance, will implement its development concepts of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared growth, fully advance energy conservation, emission reduction and low-carbon development, and embrace the new era of ecological civilization, the Chinese president said on Saturday in Hangzhou.On December 12, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, negotiators representing 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris sealed the pact, which aims to reverse temperature increases mainly caused by carbon emissions.The agreement set a target to hold the average global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius and preferably below 1.5 degrees.The Paris agreement will require the support of 55 nations accounting for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions before it enters into force legally. Countries still have one year to ratify the agreement that is open for signatures until April 21, 2017. \</doc>

Spotlight has been focusing on the much-attentive COP22 in Morocco, Lebanon's long-thirsty election of president and Egypt's push for economic reform in the outgoing week from Oct. 30-Nov. 5 in the Mideast region, alongside with see-saw battles in Iraq's Mosul and Syria's Aleppo. As the landmark Paris Agreement entered into force on Friday, the upcoming COP22 in Morocco will focus on the ways to implement it and accelerate work on the rulebook and definable pathway for cohesive global climate action. After long-term vacancy, Lebanon has at last elected Michel Aoun as president on Monday, who vows to pursue a unified foreign policy which is seen as a stimulus to both domestic and regional stability. To counter economic recession, Egypt is gearing up to push the long-awaited economic reform and its central bank has floated the Egyptian pound and the government raised fuel prices in a package to curb budget deficit, push local production and boost foreign investments. For ground battles in the region, the Iraqi forces are digging graveyard for the resistant IS groups in Mosul. Heavy clashes are underway amid a major offensive to flush out the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants from their last stronghold in Iraq. While in Syria's Aleppo, the 10-hour truce that went into force on Friday has ended without achieving its goals of evacuating rebels and civilians from rebel-held areas. Rebels in Aleppo blocked the evacuation and vow to fight till the siege is broken. MOROCCO CRUCIAL FOR COHESIVE CLIMATE ACTION The event is initiated ahead of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, slated for Nov. 7-18 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. The world climate conference in Morocco next Monday will focus on the ways to implement the Paris Agreement after it entered into force on Friday. IRAQI FORCES DIG GRAVEYARD IN MOSUL FOR RESISTANT IS Heavy clashes are underway as the Iraqi forces are fighting inside the city of Mosul on Thursday after over two weeks of a major offensive to flush out the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants from their last stronghold in Iraq. Progress has also been made on front lines in other directions around Mosul. IS militants have been fighting off the offensive with mortar fire, rockets, bombs, snipers, suicide attacks and booby traps. ALEPPO TRUCE ENDS WITH REBELS BLOCKING EVACUATION The Syrian government accused the rebels of blocking civilians from leaving, or extorting money from them in exchange for permission to leave. Rebels in eastern Aleppo have repeatedly said they will fight till the siege is broken. Friday's humanitarian pause came a day after the rebels in Aleppo launched the second phase of their offensive to break the government siege. The Syrian army has laid siege on eastern Aleppo in recent months, urging the rebels to surrender or leave the city. LEBANON ELECTS PRESIDENT AFTER 29 MONTHS OF VACANCY Lebanon had been without a president since May 2014, when former President Michel Suleiman's six-year term ended. Since then, the parliament had held 45 failed sessions to elect a successor. Aoun pledged Friday that he will seek to "unite the Lebanese over a unified foreign policy," claiming the priority as approving a new electoral law to hold the parliamentary polls on time. EGYPT IN URGENT NEED TO PUSH ECONOMIC REFORM Egypt's Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said Friday that the state "no longer has the luxury" of being able to postponing urgent economic reforms, a day after the central bank floated the Egyptian pound and the government raised fuel prices. On Thursday, the central bank floated its currency to address a dollar crunch that has threatened to bring some imports to a halt, and to make a final push to secure a 12 billion U.S. dollars International Monetary Fund loan within days. The bank in a statement said the decision of floating is part of an economic reform program to curb the budget deficit, push local production, boost foreign investments and save funds to improve healthcare and education services. TURKEY PLEDGES TO BOOST WIN-WIN COOPERATION WITH AFRICA Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged Wednesday to boost cooperation with African countries. He appealed to Turkish companies to increase investments which would contribute to the continent's economic, cultural, touristic and agricultural development. Turkey's direct investment in sub-Saharan countries reached 3.9 billion U.S. dollars, while its trade volume with the entire continent jumped to 17.5 billion dollars in 2015. MASSIVE YEMENIS DEMONSTRATE TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT Tens of thousands of Yemenis staged on Thursday large demonstrations in the temporary capital of Aden to show support for the president. The protesters raised slogans that denounced a UN roadmap prepared to end the 19 months of military conflict in the impoverished Arab country. On Saturday, President Hadi announced his rejection of the UN envoy's peace plan, saying its contents were "bare seeds of war in the country." THE WEEK AHEAD For the week starting from Nov. 6, the 22nd Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Morocco will be one of the most important events in the Mideast region. The climate conference will focus on the ways to implement the Paris Agreement after it entered into force on Friday. The coming week will witness fierce battles in Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced Sunday the beginning of a military campaign against Syria's northern city of al-Raqqa, the de facto capital of IS group, and they vow to liberate Syria's al-Raqqa from IS. Heavier battles are also anticipated in Iraq's Mosul in the coming week, as some 3,000 to 5,000 IS militants are expected to show stiffer resistance in the populated neighborhoods amid Syrian forces' major offensive to flush out the IS militants from their last stronghold in Iraq. The formation of Lebanese government has been pressed ahead with Michel Aoun swearing in as the country's new president. In addition to pledges of economic growth and security, Aoun said in his oath of office that Lebanon must work to ensure Syrian refugees to "return quickly" to their country. \</doc>

An official with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations said here on Monday that climate change is one of the most formidable challenges facing humanity. The comments of Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, FAO's assistant director-general and regional representative for the Near East and North Africa, came during the inauguration of the Pre- COP22 Dialogue for Countries of the League of Arab States on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and Climate Finance at the Arab League's headquarters in Cairo that will last for two days. "Our region, one of the most arid and water scarce regions in the world, is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts," he addressed the meeting. Despite massive investments in agriculture water, Ahmed said, per capita fresh water availability has declined by two third over the last 40 years and is expected to decline by another 50 percent by 2050, as a result of rapid population growth as well as the pressure on both the level and quality of water supply. "With higher temperatures and reduced rainfall, the region will be highly vulnerable to land degradation and desertification," he stressed. He added that this meeting is part of a series of consultations initiated by FAO in collaboration with the League of Arab States (LAS), the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) and the governments of Egypt and Morocco to better understand countries' visions and pledges to address climate change as they relate to agriculture and food security. "The meeting in the LAS will specifically discuss the INDC`s agricultural related issues and priority areas where FAO can assist countries of the region to strengthen their adaptation capacities to climate change," he said. The UN official said that overall climate change will reduce food availability because of its impact on agriculture production, adding that it will affect access to food because of its negative impact on rural population income and on poverty. "It will impact food utilization, because less water in rural areas means greater risks of water contamination," he revealed. Climate change is likely to increase the dependency of the region on imports as well as the instability of local production because of the increased frequency of droughts, he said. "Evidence from worldwide studies suggests that countries that pursue sustainable water resource management and agriculture strategies are better able to wither the impacts of climate change," Ould Ahmed explained. He stressed that mismanagement of natural resources and climate change are likely to contribute to instability and protracted crisis. "It is therefore imperative for the region to implement now a comprehensive reform agenda to put firmly the water and agriculture sectors on the path of sustainability and adapt to the likely impacts of climate change," he said. Ould Ahmed said there will be no improved food security and no eradication of poverty in our region without adaptation to climate change and vice-versa. \</doc>

Pneumonia and diarrhoea together kill 1.4 million children each year, mostly in lower and middle-income countries, Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman, said here Friday, quoting a a new report issued by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). "Pneumonia in particular remains the leading infectious killer of children under five, claiming the lives of nearly a million children in 2015 -- more than malaria, TB, measles, and AIDS combined," Haq said at a daily news briefing here. Approximately half of all childhood pneumonia deaths are linked to air pollution, a fact UNICEF said world leaders should keep in mind during ongoing climate change talks at the UN climate change conference, which is going on in Morocco. The UNICEF report -- "One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea" -- said that pneumonia kills approximately one child every 35 seconds across the world. "We have seen clearly that air pollution linked to climate change is damaging the health and development of children by causing pneumonia and other respiratory infections," said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye. "Two billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds international guidelines, with many falling ill and dying as a result," Ndiaye said. "World leaders meeting at COP22 can help to save children's lives by committing to actions that will reduce air pollution linked to climate change and agreeing to investments in prevention and healthcare." Like pneumonia, diarrhoea cases among children can, in many instances, be linked to lower levels of precipitation caused by climate change. Reduced availability of safe water leaves children at greater risk of contracting diarrhoeal diseases and suffering impaired physical and cognitive growth. Nearly 34 million children have died from pneumonia and diarrhoea since 2000. Without further investment in key prevention and treatment measures, UNICEF estimates that 24 million more children will die from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2030. "These illnesses have such a disproportionately high impact on child mortality and are relatively inexpensive to treat," said Ndiaye. "Yet they continue to receive only a fraction of global health investment which makes absolutely zero sense," the deputy head of UNICEF said. "That's why we're calling for increased global funding for protective, preventive and treatment interventions that we know will work to save children's lives." Meanwhile, UNICEF is also recommending increased funding for child healthcare generally and also for that focused on groups of children especially vulnerable to pneumonia and diarrhoea -- the youngest and those living in lower and middle-income countries. The report shows: -- Approximately 80 percent of childhood deaths linked to pneumonia and 70 percent of those linked to diarrhoea occur during the first two years of life; -- Low- and lower-middle income countries are home to 62 percent of the world's under five population, but account for more than 90 percent of child pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths globally. \</doc>

Ban Ki-moon, outgoing UN Secretary General, whose second five-year term is set to end by the end of this year, reclaimed the top spot in recent South Korean presidential polls. Austria's President-elect Alexander Van der Bellen, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (L-R) arrive for a photo opportunity in Vienna, Austria, December 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies] According to a survey of 2,528 voters nationwide conducted by local pollster Realmeter between Dec 19 and 23, support for Ban as the country's next leader was 23.3 percent, up 2.8 percentage points from the previous week. His main support base was the North Gyeongsang province, a traditional home turf for impeached President Park Geun-hye and the ruling Saenuri Party, in which Ban garnered 35.8 percent in approval scores, up 9.3 percentage points from a week earlier. As there is no competitive presidential contender found in the ruling bloc, Ban is seen as the last remaining hope for conservative voters. Ban has not officially declared his run for president in his homeland, but local media outlets speculated that he had already indicated his candidacy in recent press conference with South Korean journalists in New York. Since the scandal involving President Park erupted in late October, Ban's approval rating declined in tandem with growing fury over Park which resulted in the presidential impeachment on Dec 9. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks at the UN World Climate Change Conference 2016 ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, November 15, 2016. [Photo/Agencies The outgoing UN chief was known to have been close to President Park and the ruling party, as seen in his seven meetings with Park during her four-day trip to New York in September 2015, but he recently drew a line to the close relations. Moon Jae-in, former head of the biggest opposition Minjoo Party who had been the frontrunner in presidential surveys for the past seven weeks, surrendered to Ban last week with an approval rating of 23.1 percent. It was 0.2 percentage points lower than Ban's. Lee Jae-myung of the Minjoo Party, mayor of Seongnam, a city to the southeast of capital Seoul, maintained the third place at 12.3 percent, but it was down 2.6 percentage points compared with a week ago. Ahn Cheol-soo of the minor opposition People's Party came next with a support score of 8.2 percent, almost unchanged from the prior week.

China sent a strong message about its commitment to the battle against global climate change by ratifying the Paris Agreement earlier this month, experts said. China and the United States formally joined the Paris climate pact on Sept. 3, one day ahead of the G20 summit held in the eastern Chinese lake side city of Hangzhou. The deal marks a turning point in the united efforts to address global warming. "China seems to be [...] setting an example by implementing steps to limit global warming," Douglas H. Paal, director of the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Xinhua. China, the world's second largest economy and a major emitter of greenhouse gases, signed the Paris Agreement at UN Headquarters in New York on April 22, which is also Earth Day. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, acting for President Xi Jinping, signed the document and announced that China would ratify the pact before the G20 summit in Hangzhou. To fulfill its commitments, China will have to cut carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. These targets are reflected in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). Many agree that China's ratification of the Paris Agreement ahead of the G20 summit, as wells as the summit's outcomes, will also strengthen China's leadership in the area. Moreover, concrete actions by major powers, like China, will increase expectations for an early initiation of the pact, ahead of its original deadline of 2020. "I think the Paris Agreement will enter into force very, very soon," said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. Just a few months ago, the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement seemed unachievable. The Paris deal, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions, was sealed by negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change on Dec. 12, 2015, after a hard and lengthy bargaining process. It will enter into force once 55 nations, making up 55 percent of global emissions, ratify the pact. The joint announcement by President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama of their nations's commitment to the Paris deal could be a game changer, and sets the stage for other countries to follow suit. The world's two largest economies, China and the United States, together account for 39 percent of global emissions. In a Leaders' Communique issued after G20 summit, the remaining G20 members agree to join the agreement as soon as possible. "We commit to complete our respective domestic procedures in order to join the Paris Agreement as soon as our national procedures allow," the communique read. "We welcome those G20 members who joined the Agreement and efforts to enable the Paris Agreement to enter into force by the end of 2016 and look forward to its timely implementation with all its aspects," it said. Joanna Lewis of Georgetown University, meanwhile, called the G20 the "most powerful economic and political club in the world," and China's hosting of it offered a great opportunity to demonstrate its climate leadership. "Climate change is the area in which China has shown perhaps the strongest international leadership. As China hosts the G20, we can expect energy and climate to be front and center," Lewis said in a signed article. "As the role of China in global multilateral financial institutions grows, there is room for it to help shape the use of public finance for green and low carbon investment and determine the rules for such investments around the world," she said. \</doc>

A new UN report said Friday that climate change is fast becoming one of the most significant risks for some 31 natural and cultural World Heritage sites in 29 countries, Farhan Haq, the deputy UN spokesman, told reporters here Friday. The report, jointly released by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that these World Heritage sites are vulnerable to climate change, highlighting the urgency to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius, Haq said at a daily news briefing here. The World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report documented climate impacts including increasing temperatures, melting glaciers, rising seas, intensifying weather events, worsening droughts and longer wildfire seasons, at iconic tourism sites such as Venice, Stonehenge and the Galapagos Islands. It also covered other World Heritage sites such as South Africa's Cape Floral Kingdom; the port city of Cartagena, Colombia, and Shiretoko National Park in Japan. The report included a complete list of World Heritage sites that are at risk. "World governments, the private sector and tourists all need to coordinate their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to protect the world's most treasured cultural and natural resources from the impact of tourism activities," said Elisa Tonda, head of UNEP's Responsible Industry and Value Chains Unit. "Policies to decouple tourism from natural resource impacts, carbon emissions and environmental harm will engage a responsible private sector and promote change in tourists' behaviour to realize the sectors' potential in some of the world's most visited places," she said. Because World Heritage sites must have "Outstanding Universal Value," the report recommended that the World Heritage Committee consider the risk of prospective sites becoming degraded by climate change before they add them to the list. In particular, the report underscored the urgent need to identify the World Heritage sites that are most vulnerable to climate change, and to implement policies and provide resources to increase resilience at those sites. Meanwhile, the report also urged increased global efforts to meet the Paris Agreement climate change pledges, in order to preserve World Heritage sites for future generations. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in the French capital sealed the Paris Agreement, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. Experts said that China helped resolve several thorny issues to bring about some key breakthroughs. On April 22, a total of 175 countries, including China, inked the Pairs Agreement on the first day of its opening for signature at UN Headquarters in New York, a new record in the United Nations' 70-year history. "Globally, we need to better understand, monitor and address climate change threats to World Heritage sites," said Mechtild Rossler, the director of UNESCO's World Heritage Centre. "As the report's findings underscore, achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius is vitally important to protecting our World Heritage for current and future generations." In addition, the report also recommended engaging the tourism sector in efforts to manage and protect vulnerable sites in the face of climate change, and to educate visitors about climate threats. "Climate change is affecting World Heritage sites across the globe," said Adam Markham, lead author of the report and deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. "Some Easter Island statues are at risk of being lost to the sea because of coastal erosion. Many of the world's most important coral reefs, including in the islands of New Caledonia in the western Pacific, have suffered unprecedented coral bleaching linked to climate change this year. Climate change could eventually even cause some World Heritage sites to lose their status," he added. \</doc>

MARRAKECH, Morocco - Donald Trump's win of the US presidential election on Wednesday has triggered concerns by experts attending the climate change conference here over the US possible pull-out from the Paris Agreement, with others still expecting the president-to-be would be more measured and responsible on the issue. Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), congratulated Donald Trump on his election, saying that the ongoing conference will continue to discuss and mobilize, in order to "pursue progress already made with all parties, particularly with the new American administration." He highlighted that climate change issue transcends politics and concerns the "preservation of our livelihood, dignity and the only planet on which we all live," saying that all parties will respect their commitments and stay the course in this collective effort. Trump has vowed in his presidential campaign to "cancel" the Paris Agreement once elected, calling global warming a "hoax," and to stop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs, which worried many after the agreement's entry into force on Nov 4. "Human-caused climate change is not a belief, a hoax, or a conspiracy. It is a physical reality," said an open letter released in September, signed by 375 members of the US National Academy of Sciences, including 30 Nobel laureates and renowned scientists such as Stephen Hawking. "Election results will impact tone of negotiations, but the task ahead remains the same. We need long-term vision, regardless of the US elections," said Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, senior director of international climate cooperation of World Wildlife Fund. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy from Union of Concerned Scientists, said that it remains to be seen whether Trump would be the same "as we saw in the campaign, or a more measured and responsible Trump we saw in his acceptance speech this morning," adding that courage and expectation are needed to view him as a responsible president. He said that Trump was "very conciliatory" in his acceptance speech on Wednesday, voicing hope to work with the United States as partners rather than adversaries. According to Li Shuo, Greenpeace's senior climate policy adviser, the US economy is "decarbonizing," and developing renewable energy resources is the general direction of US action dealing with climate changes. Segolene Royal, president of COP21, called it means of campaign that Trump advocated to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which is not worth concerning about, while Brazilian Minister of Environment Jose Sarney Filho said that dropping out the combat against climate change is unthinkable for any society in the face of the threatening issue. The Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 during COP21. Its 180 signatories committed themselves to maintaining global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. The United States remains outside a previous major climate agreement, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, since George W. Bush withdrew from the treaty in 2001, arguing that it might cripple the US economy. \</doc>

Shock Trump win as U.S. president on Wednesday has stirred chain responses in the Middle East in the outgoing week from Nov. 6- 12. Trump has been piled up with heaps of requests and heavily loaded with hard-nut questions. For decades, the U.S. Mideast policies have resulted in massive chaos in the region, so Trump has to pay back as much. For examples, Iran urges Trump to review U.S. Mideast policies, Turkey demands extradition of Gulen for "new page" in bilateral ties, Egypt calls for more regional stability, Palestinians want independent statehood, while Israel appeals for stronger alliance. Meanwhile, the Gulf states are pinning hopes on the upcoming U.S. administration to pump up sagging economy out of the spiraling recession due to oil price slump. Even conflicting parties in Syria are pinning hopes on Trump for achieving their respective objectives. The political landscape in the region has still been painted in gloomy colors in the week, as bloody and sticky battles are still rattling the war-torn Iraq and Syria, trapping civilians there in bloody abyss of despairs and misery. In addition, the evasive situation in Yemen, Turkey's military offensive in northern Syria as well as new ground offensive in Syria's Raqqa added to the woes and tore apart fresh bleeding scars in the region. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said Wednesday that the upcoming U.S. administration should review its policies in the Middle East. The U.S. interference in regional countries' domestic affairs is a key factor which increased violence and extremism in the Middle East, Qasemi was quoted as saying by official IRNA news agency. The unstable situation of the Persian Gulf region, the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, along with the threat of terrorism necessitates an urgent review of U.S. policies, he added. SYRIA'S CONFLICTING PARTIES PIN DIFFERENT HOPES ON TRUMP The Syrian government and various opposition parties have expressed different opinions over the winning of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, with each having different wishes from the new U.S. president. For the Syrian government, wishes were that the United States under Trump's administration could be an "effective member" in the battle on terrorism, as Damascus deems all armed insurgents and the political opposition supporting them as terrorists. Shaaban's cautious wishes came as several segments of the Syrian society, mainly those supporting President Assad, expressed relative reliefs with U.S. Republican Trump winning the U.S. presidential election. IRAN CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE NUKE DEAL VIOLATION Iranian officials have expressed concerns and anger over the remarks of the U.S. president-elect Donald Trump against Iran's nuclear deal during his campaign. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday urged the incoming administration of the United States to remain committed to the last year international agreement which put an end to Tehran's nuclear disputes. Zarif warned that Iran might consider "other options" in case any party involved in Iran's nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, fails to comply with its commitments. TRUMP'S WIN SPURS CONCERN OVER US WITHDRAWAL FROM CLIMATE DEAL Trump's win of the U.S. presidential election on Wednesday has triggered concerns by experts attending the climate change conference here over the U.S. possible pull-out from the Paris Agreement, with others still expecting the president-to-be would be more measured and responsible on the issue. Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), congratulated Donald Trump on his election, saying that the ongoing conference will continue to discuss and mobilize, in order to "pursue progress already made with all parties, particularly with the new American administration." He highlighted that climate change issue transcends politics and concerns the "preservation of our livelihood, dignity and the only planet on which we all live," saying that all parties will respect their commitments and stay the course in this collective effort. CHINA BACKS COOPERATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE WITH ALL PARTIES China expects to push forward the existing cooperation on climate changes together with all parties including the United States, said Gou Haibo, deputy chief of Chinese delegation to COP22 in Marrakech of Morocco on Wednesday. Gou told reporters that international mechanism like Paris Agreement is a fruit of the trend in which green and low-carbon development dominates, benefiting general interests of all countries and the international community. China will uphold a development concept highlighting innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, said Gou, underlining that China will act positively and forcefully in maintaining the international mechanism, promoting international cooperation, and combating climate change. He also voiced hope for China and the U.S. to work together in boosting China-U.S. relations so as to better benefit peoples around the world. WORLD NEEDS BINDING MEASURES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE Delegates from around the world are gathering in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh for the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference. The main goal of the Marrakesh conference is how to implement the landmark Paris Agreement which sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 Celsius degrees. This will require a delicate balancing act and significant funds. Developed countries, which are already industrialized, have the historical responsibility to provide assistance to developing nations in finding greener alternatives to industrialization and progress. WHO URGES FOCUS ON HEALTH TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Friday for giving health a central priority in the Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ), currently held in Morocco, and including it in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. According to a WHO statement, almost one quarter of the global burden of disease and approximately 12.6 million deaths each year are attributable to avoidable environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures and ultraviolet radiation. Health gains represent major social and economic benefits of environmental protection, and therefore should be put forward as key motivating forces for public support and political action, it said. IRAQI FORCES EXTEND GRIP IN IS STRONGHOLD IN MOSUL Iraqi security forces on Saturday extended their grip in Mosul after intense fighting with Islamic State (IS) group in several eastern districts of the city, a security source said. The army's armored vehicles and soldiers swept al-Salam district after fierce clashes with heavily armed small groups of IS militants. The commandos of the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) also seized the Arbajiyah district after intense street battles cleared the nearby district of Qadsiyah. The advance unleashed the most intense street battles against IS militants since the offensive to retake the city began more than three weeks ago. SYRIAN FORCES RECAPTURE KEY AREAS FROM IS IN ALEPPO The Syrian forces have fully recaptured two important areas fallen recently to the rebels during a wide-scale offensive in the country's northern province of Aleppo, state news agency SANA reported on Saturday. The Syrian forces backed by the Lebanese Hezbollah retook the suburbs of Dahyeit al-Assad and Menyan, which had been overrun by the rebels during a wide-scale offensive on government-controlled areas in western Aleppo late last month. With this achievement, the Syrian army has regained much of what it had lost to the rebels during their latest offensive. EGYPT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMY AFTER IMF LOAN APPROVAL There is an atmosphere of optimism about the Egyptian economy as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a 12 billion U.S. dollars loan to Egypt and Standard and Poor's has revised its sovereign credit outlook from "negative" to "stable," Egyptian prime minister said at an economic conference on Saturday. The country resorted to the IMF loan to finance the budget deficit through a strict economic reform program including cutting fuel and energy subsidies that burden the country's budget. UAE SAYS OIL COULD BE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN 2017 The energy minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said here Tuesday the world could face a shortage in oil supply in 2017. The UAE minister, Suhail Al-Mazrouei, said there could be a sudden spike in crude prices triggered by excess demand in 2017, as lower crude prices in the previous years led to reduction in oil and gas exploration projects. "We could soon be back to conditions like in 2013 when an excess demand affected the price of oil," Al-Mazrouei told panel discussion during the ongoing Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). EGYPT COURT CONFIRMS NULL ISLANDS TRANSFER TO SAUDI Egypt's Administrative Court on Tuesday confirmed null and void the transfer of the two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, official news agency MENA reported. The court ruled that the government should abide by its previous verdict not to place the two islands in the Saudi waters. The final verdict on the government's appeal will be announced on Dec. 5. On April 12, Egypt's Cabinet announced that the joint Egyptian-Saudi technical maritime border drawing showed that the islands of Tiran and Sanafir fall within the Saudi waters. Tuesday's court decision came while Saudi Arabia has informed Egypt on Monday that shipments of oil products of 23 billion U.S. aid deal have been halted indefinitely. THE WEEK AHEAD The climate conference in Morocco, expectations and responses over Trump's Mideast policies, battles in Mosul, Aleppo and Raqqa as well as Egypt's economic reform push, new government in Lebaon and situation in Yemen will remain focus of topics in the region in the week from Nov. 13-19. The main goal of the Marrakesh conference is how to implement the landmark Paris Agreement which sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change. Trump's win of the U.S. presidential election has triggered concerns by experts attending the climate change conference over the U.S. possible pull-out from the Paris Agreement. The Syrian forces backed by the Lebanese Hezbollah retook the suburbs of Dahyeit al-Assad and Menyan during a wide-scale offensive in western Aleppo. With this achievement, the Syrian army has regained much of what it had lost to the rebels during their latest offensive. More fierce battles will unfold in the coming week. Iraqi security forces have extended their grip in Mosul after intense fighting with Islamic State (IS) group in several eastern districts of the city, more gains will be achieved in the western districts of Mosul in the week. \</doc>

(People's Daily Online) 10:46, November 07, 2016 With the official enforcement of Paris Agreement on Climate Change, every country in the world now faces a test to fulfill their promisesin implementing the tasks, the People\' s Daily said in an editorial published on Friday, the day marking the official implementation of the pact. The following is the translation of the article: Paris Agreement officially entered into force on Friday, completing its last legal procedure after being concluded, signed and approved. As a comprehensive, balanced and ambitious treaty, the pact will bring the world new prospect of sustainable development by setting a new path for multilateral effort on climate change. The agreement did not come easily. When the Paris Conference was convened last December, the meeting was permeated with all kinds of setbacks, hardships, worries and concerns. Some even described it as  a challenge more complicated than any other human activity . Despite of the doubts inside and outside the conference, the "seemingly impossible agreement" was endorsed on December 12, 2015. What\' s more, the agreement came into effect in less than a year after its endorsement, creating a record around the world. With unprecedented support and implementation pace, the Paris Agreement has become a historic landmark. The Agreement not only reflects the world's determination to promote low-carbon transition and fight against climate change, but also serves as a reference and injects confidence for global governance in other fields. At the opening ceremony of the Paris Conference held last November, Chinese President Xi Jinpingcalled on the world to create a future of win-win cooperation, with each country making contribution to the best of its ability, a future of rule of law, fairness and justice, and a future of inclusiveness and mutual learning for common development, charting the course for global climate governance. China and the USalso sent a strong signal for early implementation of the agreement after Xi and his counterpart Barack Obama deposited their legal instruments for formally joining the pact to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon not long ago. Banalso hailed China on many occasions for its historic, fundamental, important and critical contribution to the success of Paris Agreement and Paris Conference.  To cope with climate change is the domestic demand of China for sustainable development, and also an obligation of a responsible major country, Xi\' s signaled to the world that guided by the innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development philosophy, China has incorporated climate treatment into its medium- and long-term strategy of national economic and social development. What China did also sets an example for the whole world. China managed to reduce its carbon intensity by 20 percent during 2011 to 2015, 3 percent more than the scheduled objective. It also optimizedthe resource structure by increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in 2015 to 12 percent, higher than the 11.4 percenttarget set by China\' s 12th Five-Year Plan. In addition, China's forest stocks have reached 15.137 billion cubic meters, the planned volume set for 2020. Such progress has proved China's resolution to combat climate change and told the world China's sincerity and ability to fulfill its obligation and make contribution. With the entry into force of the pact, every country in the world faces a test to fulfill their promises in implementing the tasks. The first multilateral UN conference on climate change after the implementation of the Paris Agreementwill be held in Marrakech, Morocco from November 7 to 18. During the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 12th session of the COP to the Kyoto Protocol, delegations from a total of 196 countries and regions will discuss on detailed technical plans for the implementation of the pact. It is expected that each party could give play to the spirit of win-win cooperation generated during the Paris Conference and meet each other halfway toward a global governance of maximum consensus and sincerity. \</doc>

G20 must address inequality and dissatisfaction By Kerry Brown | NO. 34 AUGUST 25, 2016 People rally in Dresden in Germany on October 19, 2015, to protest against the inflow of refugees (XINHUA) Since 2009, the G20 the international forum for economic cooperation has become one of the key means by which global leaders can get together and work out ways to cooperate and address common themes. This year, the G20 Leaders' Summit takes place in Hangzhou, China, in early September. With its membership spanning nations like China, India, Russia and the United States, as well as the EU, the group as a whole constitutes close to 85 percent of the global economy, and its decisions have potentially immense impact. The questions are, what can everyone agree on, and how can those decisions be carried forward? Off target The problem with the G20 in the past was that it often seemed to miss opportunities to address the most pressing issues at any one time. Discussion at the 2014 G20 Summit held in Brisbane, Australia, was restricted because of the unwillingness of the host nation's government to prioritize talk of climate change and the environment. This was a great pity because the United States and China, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference in Beijing a few weeks earlier, had just agreed to a major accord in which both sides would restrict their carbon emissions over the next two decades. The Brisbane summit also did little to prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris the following year, which resulted, to the surprise of many, in a meaningful international agreement. In that respect, the Brisbane event missed a big opportunity. The pressure on this year's G20 to deliver something is heightened due to the number of pressing issues facing the world and their complexity. The United States is experiencing what looks to be its most contentious presidential election in recent history, with Republican nominee Donald Trump standing on a vehemently anti-globalist, protectionist platform. In Europe, the UK's decision in June to exit the EU has been ascribed by most experts to similar anti-globalist public anger elsewhere in an era of trade deals and opening of markets that have resulted in as many losers and winners. In France, the radical right-wing National Front, under Marie Le Pen, currently enjoys its highest ever position in the polls. In Austria, a rerun for the presidency (a largely ceremonial but hugely symbolic role) is likely to result in another extreme right-wing success. The revolt against globalization has spread across political systems, resulting in more-nationalistic and more-divided electorates and communities. Predicting where all this might lead proves very difficult. One thing is certain, though. Given the levels of anger and frustration, complacency is not an option. A catch-22 situation This year's G20 Summit gives global leaders the chance, from the perspectives of their different economies and political systems, to think about the central paradox of the current age: People have never lived longer, enjoyed higher standards of living, or enjoyed better health than they do at present, yet levels of dissatisfaction are also sky-high. What can be done, however, when the very means to unlock more growth and stimulate more economic activity is also perceived by many as being the source of all their ills? Free Trade Agreements and trade deals are regarded with deeper and deeper suspicion, and protectionist sentiment is intensifying, despite the evidence from most economists that unless trade barriers are removed and access to markets is increased internationally, global GDP is likely to flatline. Such stasis would almost inevitably cause more unhappiness and dissatisfaction, thereby creating a vicious circle. So, what is the solution to this conundrum? Fear and loathing Common issues at the G20 will include inequity and inequality, issues that underlie the anti-globalization movement. Societies want to incentivize innovation; they want to encourage entrepreneurial individuals and to have dynamism in their economies and their companies. But studies from a famous one by French scholar Thomas Piketty to one by British economist Richard Wilkinson a decade earlier have shown that across the developed world, and now in the developing one, inequality has never been more severe. The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of economic inequality, with one representing complete inequality (one person having all the wealth, for example, and everyone else having nothing) and zero representing absolute equality, with everyone having exactly the same. According to this measure, the United States, China, and parts of Latin America, Africa and Europe are now highly unequal societies. While north European countries like Sweden, Denmark and Norway exhibit high levels of equality, with Gini coefficients of around 0.25, China comes in at 0.46, the United States at 0.45, and the UK at 0.32. Although the phenomenon of increasing inequality is recognized, how to deal with it remains undecided. Redistributive tax systems offer one method, but they have proved poor at coping with the upper levels of wealth, and in the case of corporations, they have largely failed. One of the great controversies in both the United States and the EU in recent years has been the ability of transnational companies to seek out benign tax regimes. In an era in which so much trade occurs online, the issue of the physical location where business actually happens and where taxes accrue has become more blurred and harder to manage. Outrage at how major companies like Amazon, Apple and Starbucks have been able to make huge profits yet pay limited amounts of tax is one of the factors contributing to public anger at globalization. Another is weariness with austerity measures. For large sections of society in the United States and the EU, wages have remained stagnant, and job security has been eroded. Many people in the UK blame immigration for their adverse economic circumstances, despite academic studies showing that it usually stimulates growth. Fear exists that openness to outside markets means greater insecurity at home. Almost a decade has passed since the financial crisis of 2008. Yet, its fallout continues, with public distrust and anger at banks, international finance and liberal market systems remaining high. The way forward The G20 members all share the issue of how to deal with the benefits and pains of globalization as well as the challenge of finding ways to preserve the good things offered by unimpeded access to other markets while protecting their home markets and core constituencies. While each nation has particularities in its issues with globalization, from China to the United States and Australia, the acknowledgement that inequality, unequal development and public uneasiness need to be addressed cannot be avoided. A new kind of global dialogue about globalization and its impacts needs to start. What was regarded by some as unambiguously positive over most of the last two decades is now looking more complex.

The New Zealand government Friday welcomed the historic Paris Agreement coming into force as environment campaigners lambasted the country's lack of a plan of to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement formalizes the legal framework for all countries to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New Zealand ratified on Oct. 5, helping the agreement cross the threshold for entry of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions. "This is the first time all nations have agreed to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a common legal footing," Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett said in a statement. "The speed at which the Paris Agreement has come into force is unprecedented and underlines the urgency needed to make significant and sustainable changes to reduce emissions. New Zealand's ratification guarantees we can participate in any decision-making under the Paris Agreement at the COP 22 meeting, to be held in Morocco this month." COP 22 Bennett said she would travel to the meeting in Marrakech, on Nov. 14 to deliver New Zealand's national statement to the COP and the CMA, the governing body of the Paris Agreement, which will meet for the first time on Nov. 15. Bennett would chair New Zealand-led events to push for the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and support development of international carbon markets. The opposition Green Party said the government needed "real evidence" of a plan to reduce New Zealand's emissions, which were up 19 percent since 2008. "Tackling climate change represents a huge opportunity for New Zealand. It's a chance to invest in electric public transport, build healthier, and more energy-efficient homes, and shift to more sustainable forms of agriculture," Green Party co-leader James Shaw said in a statement. The international campaign group, Greenpeace, called for a summer of action to highlight the government's plan on climate change. The government had committed to reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Kate Simcock said in a statement. But the country was forecast to meet 80 percent of the target by offsetting emissions in the international carbon market. "If every country behaved the way we did, we'd literally be dead in the water. It's not acceptable that we push the burden onto someone else so that we can keep polluting, it's utterly immoral as a global citizen," said Simcock. \</doc>

A bitter row over the fate of a key fund aiming to help developing countries cope with adverse effects of climate change may prevent the Marrakech climate talks from ending as scheduled, delegates here warned Friday. Informal consultations have been extended into the night, forcing Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), to postpone his plan to leave the southern Moroccan city. Speaking at a plenary session of the conference, Mezouar reiterated his appeal to all related parties to accelerate their talks so that the annual climate conference can conclude on Friday as scheduled. "The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to financing adaptation concrete projects," Honadia said. "We don't want this fund to disappear." Developing countries demand a change in the wording related to the fund in a draft decision to be adopted by the conference, Honadia revealed, adding that the document must make it clear that the Adaptation Fund "shall" serve the Paris Agreement. An explanatory note released earlier Friday by Mezouar says that the fund "should" serve the Paris deal. Developed countries and developing countries have also been in disagreement over when the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1) will resume and its agenda. Many developing countries which have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, such as Burkina Faso, demand that CAM1 be suspended so that they could attend it as a signatory instead of as an observer, Honadia said. The agenda under discussion mainly focuses on the implementation of nationally determined contributions and is thus in favor of developed countries, he added. "If the text is not well balanced, taking into consideration developed countries' positions and developing countries' positions, it will really be difficult," Honadia said. The two-week conference has brought together thousands of government officials as well as representatives from international organizations, the civil society and businesses. It aims to pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The next UN climate conference, COP23, will be hosted in Bonn, Germany, but presided over by Fiji. On Friday, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama reiterated his appeal for U.S. president Donald Trump to abandon the view that global warming was a 'hoax" and to take responsibility in combating climate change. "A global scientific consensus is that it (global warming) is very real," Bainimarama said. "We must act more decisively and avert catastrophe," he said, inviting the U.S. president-elect to visit Fiji and to see for himself the effects of climate change. "We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for its leadership and for its engagement and assistance on climate change," Bainimarama said. "As the second biggest carbon emitter on earth, the United States must take responsibility for contributing to our collective response to this crisis and show leadership at this critical stage," Bainimarama said. On his campaign trail, Trump had said he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stop funding international climate actions. \</doc>

The determination and joint leadership that China and the United States have demonstrated on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in fighting climate change have won widespread applause. At a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Barack Obama and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on the eve of the G20 Hangzhou summit, both China and the United States formally ratified the climate change agreement. In the eyes of some environmental experts, it is time for European countries as well as the European Union (EU) to follow suit. As a result, the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which was seen as an inconceivable task a short few months ago, is now close to reality, said Li Shuo, senior global policy advisor of Greenpeace East Asia. "The rhythm and durability of the new climate regime will be enhanced as a result of it," the expert said, adding: "The G20 outcome strengthens China's climate leadership." On Dec. 12, 2015, after hard and lengthy bargaining, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris sealed the climate change pact, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, urged other countries to endorse the Paris Agreement this year. "Countries now need to react to the strong call from the G20 to formally join and ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible, so that this Agreement can enter into force this year," the expert said. Meanwhile, on behalf of the Greenpeace, Morgan urged Germany, the G20's next president, to lead by example in the year before its G20 presidency to show the world that it is ready to transform its full economy to be zero carbon and shift the investments needed to do so. As the world's two largest economies, China and the United States together account for 39 percent of global emissions, while the Paris pact still lacks the support of 55 nations that account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Christoph Bals, policy director at Germanwatch said the ratification increased the pressure for all EU governments to follow suit if they don't want to be left out. Bals commended China for putting the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the greening of the financial system on the G20 agenda, adding that it is now up to the German presidency next year to deliver concrete implementation strategies on these issues. Celia Gautier, international and EU policy advisor at Climate Action Network, said France can play an active role in the coming months to convince other G20 countries to make climate-risk disclosure mandatory for all investments, and to introduce climate stress tests for companies. "France can rely on its own experience, since it made climate-risk disclosure and reporting mandatory in 2015. Secondly, France should join the U.S., China, Germany and others in the reform and peer review process of their public support to fossil fuels, and phase out its harmful subsidies by 2020," Gautier said. Ruth Davis, senior associate of the London-based organization Third Generation Environmentalism (E3G), said it is the perfect moment for Theresa May to show that Britain will not be left behind, economically or diplomatically, by this new reality. "As well prompt UK ratification of the Paris Agreement, top of her agenda should be confirming a date for phasing out the UK's remaining coal-fired power stations and setting out an ambitious industrial strategy that will enable UK firms to take advantage of rapidly expanding clean technology markets," Davis said. As a business leader, Jill Duggan, director of Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, said strong signals from the G20 governments are important for businesses to act. "With such a signal the private sector will respond and unlock the creative innovation needed to solve the climate crisis," the expert said. Duggan stressed that businesses and policymakers alike need to stop thinking incrementally, but focus on delivering the innovative solutions needed to lift the society into the next era. "The shift to a more sustainable global economy will be the most capital intensive transition in human history," said Ben Caldecott, director of the Sustainable Finance Programme at the University of Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. "The G20 is right to focus on how to mobilize the finance required, and we warmly welcome the work produced jointly by the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China on green finance. It is important that this work accelerates under the G20 in Germany," he added. \</doc>

Morocco launched on Thursday a "Climate Train" exhibition which seeks to raise awareness of climate change in the country. As part of the country's effort to prepare for the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) , slated for Nov. 7-18 in Marrakech, this travelling exhibition aims to give information and open a debate on climate all over Morocco. Started from the Rabat-Agdal train station, the train will stop in 12 Moroccan cities before reaching Marrakech where it will be open to the public during the 11-day COP22 . The compartments of the train, which provides an intelligent and interactive presentation on multimedia mediums, serves an educational and entertaining event on the causes and impact of climate change notably in Africa and Morocco. The eight-compartment train includes a scientific exhibition, a "village-innovation-partners" area, a conference zone and a reception. \</doc>

Climate officials from around the world returned to the negotiation table on Monday to write a "rule book" for the Paris Agreement, a historic pact they clinched at the end of last year in France to fight global warming. By adopting the Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to jointly take actions to limit global temperature rising well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to keep global warming under 1.5 degree Celsius. Details of how to implement the agreement, however, was left for further negotiations. "The whole world is united in its commitment to the global goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, as well as to the means by which to achieve them," said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at the opening plenary of the new round of talks in Bonn, Germany. "Now we must design the details of the path to the safe, prosperous, climate neutral future to which we all aspire," she said. When officials leave Bonn in May 26, they are expected to have in their mind clearer pictures of various issues, including regular reviews and "ratchet up" of countries' climate actions and transparency of developed countries' financial support to developing countries. Researches showed that even if all current climate action plans of countries were fully implemented, the world is on a path towards a temperature rising of about 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Figueres said she is confident that the pace of negotiations will be faster than in past years as countries now understand the threat of climate change and opportunities of transforming their economies. A proof is the record number of countries which have already signed and ratified the Paris Agreement. Currently, 177 nations have signed the pact, 16 among them have completed their domestic ratification procedures. However, analysts warned that old quarrels between the developed and developing countries might re-emerge despite an overall trend of collaboration. In a press conference later on Monday, the European Union's chief negotiator Elina Bardram reiterated that the EU will not revise its targets of reducing carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and at least 40 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, targets which some developing countries and environment activists said were too low as the bloc had already reduced its emissions by 19 percent by 2013. "The EU's 2030 climate and energy framework is a very very ambitious policy," she argued. Financial support to developing countries is another hot topic of the negotiations. "For our endeavors to be achieved, enhanced and adequate financial and technology support as well as capacity building must be provided to allow for effective action both pre-2020 and beyond," said "G77+China" in a joint statement. Salaheddine Mezouar, Morocco's Foreign Minister and incoming President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech told negotiators that he expected the annual climate summit in November to be an occasion when a road map for concrete and predictable provision of the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar would be prepared. "If COP21 is a COP of commitment, our ambition is to ensure that COP22 becomes a COP of action," he said. \</doc>

(People's Daily Online) 13:56, November 02, 2016 (A boy runs through the smoke of burning garbage near the Niger River in Bamako, Mali on December 9th, 2012. Photo: Courtesy of UNICEF) Almost one in seven of the world\' s children, 300 million, live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution Clear the Air for Children uses satellite imagery to show for the first time how many children are exposed to outdoor pollution that exceeds global guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO), and where they live across the globe. The findings come a week ahead of the COP 22 in Marrakesh, Morocco, where UNICEF is calling on world leaders to take urgent action to cut air pollution in their countries.  Air pollution is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 600,000 children under five every year The satellite imagery confirms that around 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution, caused by factors such as vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust and burning of waste, exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization. South Asia has the largest number of children living in these areas, at 620 million, with Africa following at 520 million children. The East Asia and Pacific region has 450 million children living in areas that exceed guideline limits. The study also examines the heavy toll of indoor pollution, commonly caused by use of fuels like coal and wood for cooking and heating, which mostly affects children in low-income, rural areas. Together, outdoor and indoor air pollution are directly linked to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health. Children are more susceptible than adults to both indoor and outdoor air pollution as their lungs, brains and immune systems are still developing and their respiratory tracks are more permeable. Young children also breathe faster than adults, and take in more air relative to their body weight. The most disadvantaged, who already tend to have poorer health and inadequate access to health services, are the most vulnerable to the illnesses caused by polluted air. UNICEF is asking world leaders attending COP 22 to take four urgent steps in their countries to protect children from air pollution. ? Reduce pollution: All countries should work to meet WHO global air quality guidelines to enhance the safety and wellbeing of children. To achieve this, governments should adopt such measures as cutting back on fossil fuel combustion and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. ? Increase children\' s access to healthcare: Investing in children\' s overall healthcare ? Minimize children\' s exposure: Sources of pollution such as factories should not be located within the vicinity of schools and playgrounds. Better waste management can reduce the amount of waste that is burned within communities. Cleaner cookstoves can help improve air quality within homes. Reducing air pollution overall can help lower children\' s exposure. ? Monitor air pollution: Better monitoring has been proven to help children, youth, families and communities to reduce their exposure to air pollution, become more informed about its causes, and advocate for changes that make the air safer to breathe.  We protect our children when we protect the quality of our air. Both are central to our future, Lake said. \</doc>

The Food and Agricultural Organziation (FAO) said Thursday that it will support six African island nations in their efforts to make their agriculture more resilient to climate shocks and boost economic development. The new FAO move came as a result of recognizing the disproportionate burden that climate change places on small island developing states (SIDS). The 1.5-million-U.S. dollar project -- funded through the Africa Solidarity Trust Fund -- will focus on a variety of activities to mitigate and adapt production to changing climate conditions, and make farming practices overall more efficient. Farmers in Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles will benefit from training and knowledge exchanges on climate-smart food production, as well as ways to create viable market opportunities for nutritious food, the UN agency said. Among these climate-smart agriculture practices are the use of a range of easy-to-grow crops of high nutritional value that will make production more resilient to adverse conditions. Other initiatives focus on innovative ways to increase food production. These include the introduction of fish aggregation devices -- also known as fish magnets -- to attract more fish to catch areas and increase the availability of nutritious seafood in local markets. On the marketing side, the project includes activities to help smallholders identify opportunities to enter high-value niche markets through Fair Trade or Organic labelling, to ensure the project is sustainable. The project will also work with local government to identify policy opportunities, including ways to stimulate healthy nutrition trough food-based dietary guidelines and nutrition education programming. In all, the project aims to increase the countries' capacities, from the farm-level to the policy level, to reduce the double burden of malnutrition: tackling persistent hunger, on one hand, and rising obesity, on the other. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco, the UN's global climate conference set to adopt action items that will bring to life last year's much-anticipated Paris Climate agreement. Among them are actions to counter the devastating impacts of climate change on agriculture and water. It's widely accepted that these impacts also pose a major threat to international efforts to end hunger and poverty. SIDS countries overall struggle with high levels of unemployment and poverty, and rely heavily of imports for their food. Because people's livelihoods in these island nations depend heavily on fisheries, tourism and crop production, climate change has the potential to aggravate these vulnerabilities and derail the development progress made over recent years. For this reason, FAO's continued support small-island nations in Africa focuses on interventions that address social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities, while boosting local production of nutritious food. The Africa Solidarity Trust Fund was launched in 2013 as a unique Africa-led initiative to improve agriculture and food security across the continent. It's doing so by assisting countries and regional organizations to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, eliminate rural poverty and sustainably manage natural resources. The fund draws on contributions from Equatorial Guinea (30 million U.S. dollars), Angola (10 million dollars) and a symbolic contribution by civil society organizations in the Republic of Congo. Since its inception, the Fund has provided financing for 16 projects in 38 countries including building resilience for conflict affected rural communities, reducing rural poverty through youth employment opportunities and building best practices to increase crop and livestock production. \</doc>

The FIA Formula E Championship, the world's first fully-electric racing series, has once again broken new ground by running one of its all-electric racing cars on the Arctic ice cap. With the planet experiencing the warmest year on record, more sea ice has broken away from the Arctic than ever before. To raise awareness of this crucial and pressing issue, Formula E joined forces with Julius Baer, Visa, DHL, Schaeffler, The Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and Mumm Champagne House to bring this spectacular event to life. The zero-emission racer was driven on the ice cap by adventurous race-winning Formula E driver, Lucas di Grassi. The Brazilian, who will be seeking to go one better than his runner-up position in the season two championship when the series returns with the HKT Hong Kong ePrix on Oct 9, performed a series of jaw-dropping runs on the ice cap, inside the Arctic circle to the north of Greenland. The stunning exhibition is a continuation of Formula E's commitment to showcasing how electric car technology can be a key part of a more sustainable future, and play a vital role in tackling climate change. Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag said: "I have four children and the future of the planet depends on how we can control the effect that human life is having on the environment and the climate. That is why I think climate change is very important to address, to control, to face, and everyone can do something. We do something for motorsport, other people can do something from whatever they do in their lives." Formula E vice-champion Lucas di Grassi said: "It was such a beautiful, peaceful place. To come here and see how huge the ice cap is and how the effect of global warming is changing it, melting it, gives me a completely different understanding of what we are doing with Formula E and the importance of driving electric cars." The event was only made possible by the cooperation of and assistance from the Greenland government and its desire to raise awareness of a need for action on climate change. In order to learn more about the effects of the melting ice cap, Formula E has teamed up with Southampton University in the UK, and during the trip a tracking beacon was placed upon an iceberg that had broken away from the ice sheet. This will help to advance research into the behavior of these ice sheets in the open ocean, and the tracking device will allow both climate scientists and the general public to understand more about the graceful journey they undertake as they return to the sea. HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco said: "I fully support the bold and ambitious activity that Formula E has undertaken as a way of raising awareness of the effect climate change is having on the ice cap in Greenland. My Foundation recognizes the role that electric vehicles can play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and believes that Formula E can inspire a new generation of motorists and potential motorists to 'drive electric' and help in the fight against global warming through high-profile activations (sic) like this." A special 48-minute documentary looking at every aspect of how the event was put together has been commissioned and will be premiered at the sustainable innovation forum COP22 , which will take place in Marrakesh, Morocco on Nov 13 this year. Formula E will also be in the North African country at the same time for the inaugural Marrakesh ePrix. Formula E breaks new ground by running a car on the Arctic ice cap to raise awareness of the role that electric car technology can play in tackling climate change.Will Gray / For China Daily (China Daily 09/16/2016 page11) HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/90/147408834171.jpg http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/90/147408834171.jpg 00221917e13e1945a3d048.jpg \</doc>

By Patricia Espinosa and Mario Molina | September 22, 2016, Thursday | PRINT EDITION Next month, signatories to the 1989 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer will convene in Kigali, Rwanda, to consider an amendment to the treaty that would gradually reduce, and eventually eliminate, the use of hydrofluorocarbons. HFCs, which are one of the six main greenhouse gases, are commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration systems worldwide. The amendment would be a boon for sustainable development, and could prevent the release of as much as 100-200 billion tons of climate-changing emissions by 2050. That would be enough to take the world a quarter of the way toward achieving the 2o Celsius global-warming target set by the December 2015 Paris climate agreement. The Montreal Protocol was established to repair the ozone layer, which protects all life on the planet from deadly levels of ultraviolet rays. So far, it has been a remarkable success, with nearly 100 ozone-destroying chemicals phased out over the past three decades. The ozone layer is healing and, according to the latest estimates, it could recover by 2065, saving trillions of dollars in global health-care and agriculture costs. Much of this improvement is thanks to HFCs, which are excellent ozone-friendly alternatives to older chlorofluorocarbons, which have been phased out. However, HFCs, some of which are 4,000 times more potent as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide, are a disaster for climate change, and their use is still increasing annually by 10 percent. It thus makes sense to focus on HFCs in taking action on climate change. For starters, reducing them can yield economic benefits, owing to the significant energy-efficiency improvements afforded by newer air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. Just phasing in more efficient air-conditioning systems would be the emissions equivalent of retiring 2,500 medium-size peak power plants (power plants that come on-stream during periods of high demand, such as during the summer). In China, switching to climate-friendly refrigerants and boosting the energy efficiency of air conditioning and refrigeration could lead to the equivalent in emissions savings of eight Three Gorges hydroelectric dams. In India, the switch could be equal to two more of the Indian government\' s current National Solar Mission. Many countries already recognize these far-reaching benefits and are taking unilateral action to phase out HFCs. A strong HFCs agreement in Kigali would add momentum to these efforts and provide financial support for developing countries that want to move to newer technologies but currently can\' t afford it. In the private sector, retail giants such as Walmart, Nestle, and Tesco have joined the Consumer Goods Forum, a cooperative climate initiative, and agreed to phase out products with HFCs. The Kigali meeting is set to yield a strong HFCs amendment. However, some countries in especially hot parts of the world heavily worry that climate-friendly alternatives for their essential air conditioning may not function as well. Any agreement can account for those concerns through a temporary exemption for those countries, while others move ahead with newer systems to demonstrate their effectiveness. A warming planet is already having a devastating impact on some of the world\' s most vulnerable populations, and it will only continue to do so. Ultimately, all countries will have to find a way forward on reducing HFCs and climate change generally, through national action plans and emissions reductions agreed to under the 2015 Paris agreement. Frameworks established by sister agreements like the Montreal Protocol can help to do this. HFCs will also be a central topic at the next major UN climate change conference, COP22 , which convenes in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November. We are confident that the governments preparing to meet in Kigali understand the need for a strong HFCs amendment, which would give momentum to other agenda items, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in Marrakesh. Patricia Espinosa is Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Morocco started on Friday enforcing a ban on plastic bags nationwide. Last October, the Moroccan parliament passed a landmark bill banning the production, import, sale and distribution of plastic bags across the North African kingdom. The bill, which became law on July 1, is part of a larger environmentally conscious effort across the country to go green. Having engaged in large-scale renewable energy projects, Morocco has launched the more challenging task of warning Moroccans against the use of plastic bags, which take hundreds of years to degrade. The law seems timely since the kingdom is ranked as the largest consumer of plastic bags in Africa and the second in the world after the United States. Green campaigners say the country's consumers may need years to fully comply with the new law, the Moroccan Minister of Industry, however, clarified in a statement that there was going to be several alternatives made available in the wake of the ban, citing the use of paper and fabric. Morocco ranks alongside Costa Rica, Bhutan and Ethiopia as one of the world's greenest countries, a fact partially due to its ambitious goals to crackdown on carbon emissions. The Moroccan city of Marrakesh is due to host the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in this November. \</doc>

Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources Minister Rafael Pacchiano, representing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, delivered the ratified Paris Agreement on climate change to the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday. The delivery took place during an official ceremony held as part of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly which is taking place in New York. Through a press release, Pacchiano said that ratifying the Paris Agreement "materializes years of work from people who are very committed to the environmental sector." "On Sept. 14, Mexico ratified the aforementioned agreement before the Senate," said Pacchiano. The Latin American country joins the other countries that have already ratified the agreement. China and the United States are the most notable countries among them. The Paris Agreement was adopted on Dec. 12, 2015 at the end of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. It seeks to reinforce the world's response to the threat of climate change. \</doc>

Item from Oct 21, 1981, in China Daily: China must continue to emphasize development of its coal and hydropower resources while exploring alternative forms of energy for the future, Vice-Premier Yu Qiuli told a government panel. China has made significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by boosting renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power. Under the country's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), coal will make way for new energy. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris last year, China pledged to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent from the 2005 levels within 15 years. To achieve these goals, China plans to add new installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts of nuclear power, 150 million kW of hydroelectric power, 300 million of kW of solar power and 400 million kW of wind power over the next five years. At the G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, last month, green finance and climate change were key topics of discussion.

Around 300 million children live in areas with severe air pollution, at least six times higher than international limits, the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said Monday. Air pollution, both outdoor and indoor, is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 600,000 children under five years old every year and threatens the health, lives and futures of millions more, UNICEF noted in a newly-released report. "Children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution, breathing faster than adults on average and taking in more air relative to their body weight," said UNICEF. According to the agency, children's lungs, brains and immune systems are still developing, which make them more susceptible to polluted air that could cause lifetime harm. South Asia has 620 million children, the largest number worldwide, living in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization, noted UNICEF. UNICEF said in the report that measures should be taken by all countries to monitor and reduce air pollution, minimize children's exposure to air pollution and increase their access to healthcare. The report entitled "Clear the air for children" was released ahead of the upcoming 22nd Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ). The meeting, slated for Nov. 7 to 18 in Morocco's Marrakesh, aims to urge all countries to take soonest actions to cut air pollution. \</doc>

Almost one in seven of the world's children, totalling 300 million, live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution -- six or more times higher than international guidelines, showed a new report issued by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Monday. The report, "Clear the Air for Children," uses satellite imagery to show for the first time how many children are exposed to outdoor pollution that exceeds global guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO), and where they live across the globe. The findings come a week ahead of the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakesh, Morocco, where UNICEF is calling on world leaders to take urgent action to cut air pollution in their countries. "Air pollution is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 600,000 children under five every year -- and it threatens the lives and futures of millions more every day," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. "Pollutants don't only harm children's developing lungs -- they can actually cross the blood-brain barrier and permanently damage their developing brains -- and, thus, their futures," Lake said. "No society can afford to ignore air pollution." The satellite imagery confirms that around 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution, caused by factors such as vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust and burning of waste, exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the WHO. South Asia has the largest number of children living in these areas, at 620 million, with Africa following at 520 million children. The East Asia and Pacific region has 450 million children living in areas that exceed guideline limits, said the report. Meanwhile, the study also examined the heavy toll of indoor pollution, commonly caused by use of fuels like coal and wood for cooking and heating, which mostly affects children in low-income, rural areas. Young children also breathe faster than adults, and take in more air relative to their body weight. The most disadvantaged, who already tend to have poorer health and inadequate access to health services, are the most vulnerable to the illnesses caused by polluted air. UNICEF, according to its press release issued here, is asking world leaders attending COP 22 to take four urgent steps in their countries to protect children from air pollution: -- Reduce pollution: All countries should work to meet WHO global air quality guidelines to enhance the safety and wellbeing of children. To achieve this, governments should adopt such measures as cutting back on fossil fuel combustion and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. -- Increase children's access to healthcare: Investing in children's overall healthcare, including immunisation campaigns and improving knowledge, community management and numbers seeking care for pneumonia (a leading killer of children under five), will improve their resilience to air pollution and their ability to recover from diseases and conditions linked to it. -- Minimize children's exposure: Sources of pollution such as factories should not be located within the vicinity of schools and playgrounds. Better waste management can reduce the amount of waste that is burned within communities. Cleaner cookstoves can help improve air quality within homes. Reducing air pollution overall can help lower children's exposure. -- Monitor air pollution: Better monitoring has been proven to help children, youth, families and communities to reduce their exposure to air pollution, become more informed about its causes, and advocate for changes that make the air safer to breathe. "We protect our children when we protect the quality of our air. Both are central to our future," Lake said. UNICEF is advocating for lower levels of air pollution, while also working on the ground to protect children from its effects. The UN agency backs the development, distribution and use of cleaner cookstoves in Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and other countries, and works through some of its country programmes to reduce the impact of outdoor air pollution on children's health. It also supports programmes to increase children's access to quality healthcare and to vaccinate them against conditions like pneumonia. \</doc>

France's climate change envoy said here on Tuesday that access to funding, especially for developing countries, remains key factor to combating climate change. Laurence Tubiana made the remarks following meeting with the Moroccan Minister for Environment Hakima El Haite. She said the acceleration of acquiring more access to funding, under Paris Agreement on climate change, will be one of the major challenges to the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), slated in November in Marrakech, Morocco. Around 10 billion U.S. dollars are already available out of the 100 billion dollars expected to be raised per year by 2020 under the framework of the Green Climate Fund, Tubiana said, adding that everyone is putting pressure on the release of the funding ahead of the COP22 . Tubiana said she is "very reassured" by the COP22 preparations, hailing the mobilization of the Moroccan government, businesses, local authorities and civil society. \</doc>

THE forces fighting global warming and battling to strengthen environmental protection must brace for heavy collateral damage as a result of Donald Trump\' s victory in the United States\' presidential election. Judging by Trump\' s campaign rhetoric, and by statements from his Republican allies, environmental protection in the US will be gutted in a frenzy of deregulation and inducements for domestic oil, coal, and gas producers. Environmentalists are assessing the potential damage and developing strategies to avoid an onslaught driven by the most extreme anti-sustainability forces that have ever controlled Capitol Hill. The list of possible victims is long and depressing. If worse comes to worst, America will become much less green, while dealing a crippling blow to international cooperation. At the recent climate conference meeting ( COP 22 ) in Marrakesh, attention focused on the various ways a Trump administration might kill the climate agreement reached at COP 21 in Paris last year. Death could come by assassination, with Trump tearing up the agreement. Or it could come by starvation, with the US refusing to do or pay its share. Or it could be tortured to death, with the US asking everyone else to do more.   inRead invented by Teads But the simple fact is that we don\' t know what Trump will do, because he doesn\' t know, either. His administration\' s environmental policy is not carved in stone; it\' s written in water, which always seeks the fastest route to the lowest point. How deep the zealots and the coal lobby will be able to make that point depends partly on the barriers built by the rest of us. Mobilizing forces That means concentrating on mobilizing the forces that can strengthen the case for America to remain part of the global move toward environmental sustainability. This will not convince diehards in the new administration, but it may sustain more moderate forces. So, who is this  we that must now take action? First,  we are US state governments and legislatures, nongovernmental organizations, local communities and corporations. All need to galvanize Americans\' support for protecting local environments and contributing to global solutions. Second,  we are the international community: the almost 200 members of the United Nations that in 2015 adopted the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement. It is critically important that all UN members, whether big or small, insist that these global agreements still direct the world\' s actions, regardless of what Trump does. It must be abundantly clear to the incoming administration that the combined economic and environmental interest in pursuing the sustainability agenda will continue to push countries and companies alike in that direction.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Morocco signed a partnership agreement Friday in terms of technical and financial support to cope with climate change. The agreement was signed by Moroccan minister in charge of the environment Hakima El Haite and FAO Representative in Morocco Michael George Hage. It aims to exchange experiences to implement projects intended to strengthen capacity to adapt to climate change, to facilitate access to financing and to support Morocco's efforts in organizing the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakech in November. Speaking on this occasion, El Haite said the agreement is an opportunity to take advantage of the FAO technical expertise to help Morocco develop and support projects related to adaptation to climate change.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday announced that the Paris Agreement on climate change will cross the second and final threshold needed for entry into force, and will enter into force on Nov. 4, 2016. "Global momentum for the Paris Agreement to enter into force in 2016 has been remarkable," Ban said in a statement issued here by his spokesman. "What once seemed unthinkable is now unstoppable." The Paris deal, adopted in December 2015, has been so far ratified by 72 countries accounting for more than 56 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions, said the website of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) earlier Wednesday. "Strong international support for the Paris Agreement entering into force is testament to the urgency for action, and reflects the consensus of governments that robust global cooperation is essential to meet the climate challenge," the secretary-general said. "Over the past decade, I have worked ceaselessly to bring countries together to accelerate the global response to climate change," he said. "I have visited communities on the climate frontlines, from the Arctic to the Amazon, and I have seen how climate impacts are already devastating lives, livelihoods and prospects for a better future." The UN chief urged all governments and all sectors of society to implement the Paris Agreement in full and to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen climate resilience, and support the most vulnerable in adapting to inevitable climate impacts. The Paris Agreement shall enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 percent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Depositary. The secretary-general extended his "warmest congratulations" to all signatories of the Paris Agreement, and encouraged all countries to "accelerate their domestic processes to ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible" before the next Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) on Nov. 7-18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. "The secretary-general has been very encouraged by the tremendous positive support from a broad coalition of countries -- from the largest emitters to the small island developing states -- to bring the Paris Agreement to life as soon as possible," Farhan Haq, the deputy UN spokesman, said at a daily news briefing here. "We will announce the names of those Parties that have deposited their ratification instruments by the end of the day," he said. "The UN recognizes that all Parties that deposit in a single day are considered collectively in meeting the legal threshold." "The secretary-general expresses his appreciation for all countries that have accelerated their domestic processes to ensure the Paris Agreement comes to life as soon as possible this year," he said. The much-anticipated Paris Agreement is the third international document on addressing climate change, following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. \</doc>

With the world's fight against global climate change gathering steam, pressure is growing on Japan, the world's fifth-largest emitter, which has not ratified the Paris climate change treaty that will formally come into force on Nov 4. As of Wednesday, 73 countries and the European Union, which account for more than 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, had ratified the accord, meeting the threshold for the pact to take effect. And on Wednesday, US President Barack Obama urged Japan and other nations that have not yet ratified the treaty to do so "as soon as possible". The ratification of the treaty by China and the United States, the world's top emitters, has been hailed by campaigners as a major step forward in the global efforts to tackle climate change. Yet Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not mention the issue in his policy speech on Sept 26 when the extraordinary Diet session began. Deliberations in the Japanese parliament are focused on the issues such as endorsement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord. The Japan Times has called on the Abe administration to promptly ratify the Paris treaty. The newspaper worries that Japan will be at a disadvantage if it delays ratification, as it would mean that Japan will not be able to sit at the negotiating table when the rules for the treaty's implementation are drawn up. The Paris agreement dictates that a signatory will not be given voting rights in the making of rules for its implementation until 30 days have passed after the submission of ratification documents to the secretariat. COP 22 conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco, on Nov 7-18. The Paris deal commits any country that ratifies it to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 C by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping the temperature rise below 1.5 C and for developed countries to give climate aid to their developing counterparts beyond 2020. Compared with the more than seven years it took before the Kyoto Protocol came into force, it is taking less than a year for the Paris Agreement to take effect. This highlights the greater sense of urgency on the part of leaders of the major powers. However, the Japan Times sees no such sense of urgency in Japan's lawmakers or the government, and the Mainichi Shimbun has criticized the Japanese government for being slow to go through the necessary procedures to ratify the Paris agreement. Meanwhile, the Asahi Shimbun said that: "Betting that the pact would take effect around 2018, the (Japanese) government apparently opted to wait and see the moves of big emitters before deciding on its response." A new study published in Nature Geoscience showed that the typhoons that have slammed into the coasts of East and Southeast Asia have become more violent, increasing in intensity by between 12 percent and 15 percent over the last four decades thanks to an overall warming of ocean surface waters in the Northwest Pacific. Researchers have repeatedly warned that Pacific tropical cyclones and Atlantic hurricanes are likely to become more destructive. They call for preparing for future typhoons and reducing carbon dioxide emissions to curb warming. Japan's ratification delay is clearly the wrong bet. \</doc>

An interview detailing China's emission reduction efforts NO. 46 NOVEMBER 17, 2016 COP21 President Segolene Royal (right) and Morocco's Foreign Affairs Minister Salaheddine Mezouar attend the opening ceremony of COP22 in Marrakech on November 7 (XINHUA) As the Marrakech climate change conference is being held in Morocco, Beijing Review reporter Deng Yaqing interviewed Zou Ji, Deputy Director of China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, on the implementation of the Paris agreement, China's emissions reduction efforts and what developed countries have done and will do to reduce emissions before 2020. Edited excerpts of the interview follow: Beijing Review: China's top climate change official, Xie Zhenhua, has referred to the Marrakech climate change conference as an opportunity to implement the Paris agreement and the pledges made by its signatories. What's your take on this? Zou Ji: I think implementation here has multiple meanings. First of all, countries should carry out the arrangements and the six factors mitigation, adaptation, capital, technology, nsparency and capacity building included in the Paris agreement. All contracting countries should respect and stick to the basic principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the equality principle and the respective capabilities principle. These form the cornerstone of the Paris agreement, and all countries deem them [to constitute] a political consensus. These principles infiltrate every aspect of the Paris agreement, including the six factors. To fully carry out the principles, a lot of details should be decided, which is a major task of the Marrakech conference and undoubtedly an arduous process. Second, before the commitment period of the Paris agreement begins in 2020, countries should continue to carry out pledges made in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and other arrangements under the UNFCCC, such as the Bali Roadmap, by 2020. Efforts in fighting climate change should be unremitting. More specifically, the focus is how developed countries party to the Kyoto Protocol will realize their promises. As we have seen, the European Union (EU), a major contracting party, has put its promises made for the period before 2020 into reality. That's to say, the EU has lowered its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels, and it has the strength to exceed its promise. However, it's reluctant to boost its emission reduction ambition and raise its target. I once suggested to EU negotiators that they issue a declaration to boost their ambition, but they didn't accept it. In my view, developed countries should play a leading role in the war against climate change and enhance mutual trust between countries. They should leave no stone unturned to reduce emissions, rather than standing by after achieving their set goals. I'm not condemning the EU because it has fulfilled its promises before 2020 and set a good example for other developed countries. I mean, if it can show the willingness to exhaust its mission reduction capability, developing countries such as China and India would be better stimulated to fulfill their promises and stronger momentum would be generated. This applies to the United States as well. Developed countries should respect the promise they made in Copenhagen that $100 billion will be provided annually from 2020 [to enable] developing countries to build their emission reduction capabilities and cope with climate change. According to calculations by some experts from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), more than $60 billion has been raised to date. But, what we need to know is the method of accounting and where the money will go. For instance, if developed countries label existing poverty leviation funds as financial support to developing countries in dealing with climate change, the negotiations during previous climate change conferences will make no sense. Developed countries should acknowledge the figure and avoid double counting or masquerading. Making related details clear will improve transparency and strengthen mutual political trust. In addition, a concrete roadmap and timetable regarding the funding should be put in place. In other words, developed countries should let developing countries know how the funds are collected and what they plan to do in the coming two or three years. Since the "concrete roadmap" has been written into the Paris agreement, negotiators will work out approaches to implement it. In short, issues related to funding including the accounting method, roadmap and where the money comes from and goes to should be made clear, and this is the focus of the negotiations during the Marrakech conference. Xie has made it clear on more than one occasion that China will not vie with other developing countries and small island countries for the $100 billion in the Green Climate Fund. But that's not to say that China doesn't have the right to use this money. How will the global stock take mechanism be started? A key mechanism of the Paris agreement the global stock take is another focus of discussions at this conference. While countries submitted their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to the UNFCCC, the global stock take was created at the Paris conference. As some global climate change experts estimate, all of the INDCs currently submitted by countries would result in an average global temperature increase of around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, falling short of the 2-degree-Celsius goal. To bridge the gap, countries have agreed to assess their implementation strategies and take stock of their efforts' results every five years. The assessments will start from 2023, and after that, countries will have to reinforce their actions every five years. A facilitating dialogue will be launched in 2017, and at the Marrakech conference, representatives are exchanging views on this front on informal occasions. Negotiations are fraught with arguments, conflicts and contradictions. We should know how to seek common ground and move forward. The United States has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, and Canada has withdrawn from, and Japan is reluctant to join, the second commitment period. Will these developed countries change their attitudes at this conference? Countries party to the Kyoto Protocol have to realize their promises made under the framework of the protocol, while countries that didn't sign it, such as the United States, have to do what they have promised under the Bali Roadmap. Refusing to join the Kyoto Protocol doesn't mean these countries don't have to cut emissions. As contracting countries of the UNFCCC, they have to perform their duties and carry out their promises made in the Cancun Accord under the Bali Roadmap. According to China's Policies and Actions on Climate Change (2016), China has accomplished the set goals in terms of energy consumption intensity, carbon intensity and forest stock ahead of time. Do you think China will also achieve its INDCs in advance? The report primarily relates the achievements China made last year and during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-15). INDCs are what a country will accomplish during the period from 2020 to 2030. The two are closely interrelated, because current performance will determine whether long-term goals can be smoothly achieved. How could China meet energy conservation and emission reduction targets in recent years? For one thing, the Chinese Government and people have devoted much attention and resources to improve the efficiency of energy consumption and cut coal use. For another, there's no denying that China's economy has entered a new normal in recent years, and declining economic growth in combination with overcapacity [reduction] has greatly alleviated the pressure on emission reduction. If we can manage to complete the goals set for the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), China will see its carbon dioxide intensity decrease at least 49 percent from its 2005 level. This means China will outperform its promise of 45-percent decrease in the Cancun Accord and step closer toward its goal of 60-65 percent decrease before 2030. However, we should also take note of the future trajectory of energy consumption in some sectors. For now, the manufacturing and industrial sectors are major energy consumers, while in the future, construction and transportation may catch up and their energy consumption will rise. Therefore, we should pay close attention to these sectors as well. Copyedited by Chris Surtees Comments to HYPERLINK mailto:dengyaqing@bjreview.com dengyaqing@bjreview.com \</doc>

History has been made in the Rwandan capital Kigali as the world witnessed the amendment of Montreal Protocol to curb global warming hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) gases in largest climate breakthrough since Paris. HFCs substances, which are used mainly in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, have a global warming effect up to 15,000 times greater than carbon dioxide and are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emission, according to climate change experts. A successful amendment to the protocol signifies the international community's commitment to practical action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement - limiting global warming to 2\'b0C, and the more ambitious target of 1.5\'b0C. After week-long intense negotiations, international leaders and ozone preservation and low carbon development experts from nearly 200 countries struck a landmark deal on Saturday. Rwanda hosted the high-level meeting of the 28th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol (MOP28) from October 8 to 14 at the Kigali Convention Centre with an aim of reaching a global agreement on an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. The agreement represents a significant step forward in implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will legally enter into force next month. Speaking to reporters shortly after passing the Montreal protocol deal, Erik Solheim, said the success in Kigali on HFCs is enormously important move in fight against climate change. "Last year in Paris, we promised to keep the world safe from the worst effects of climate change. Today, we are following through on that promise," said UN Environment chief Erik Solheim. "This is about much more than the ozone layer and HFCs. It is a clear statement by all world leaders that the green transformation started in Paris is irreversible and unstoppable. It shows the best investments are those in clean, efficient technologies," he said. Under the agreement, reached after the five-day long grueling negotiation, the developed countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and west European nations, will reduce HFC use first, followed by China along with a large number of other developing countries. Vincent Biruta, Rwanda minister of natural resources who was also the president of the meeting, said that the Kigali amendment is no longer a dream but a reality and it go down in history that a major climate deal was sealed in Rwanda. "Passing the Kigali Amendment is truly a success. It shows the world that meaningful action on climate change is possible and that we stand a real chance of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We have made history today and we should all be very proud," he noted. "Your commitment to a prosperous future and your willingness to come to the table in the spirit of collaboration is not only the hallmark of the Montreal Protocol, but also the best of humanity." The Kigali Amendment is the result of seven years of negotiation. Under the amendment, developed countries will start to phase down HFCs by 2019 while developing countries will freeze their levels of consumption in 2024, with some starting the freeze in 2028. The amendment comes just weeks before the 22nd Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in Marrakesh. The adoption of the Kigali Amendment builds momentum for even greater success in Morocco. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), HFC emissions are growing at a rate of about 7 percent annually. If the current mix of HFCs is unchanged, increasing demand could result in HFC emissions of up to 8.8 gigatons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2050. Montreal Protocol is regarded as the world's most effective environmental treaty. It was first signed on September 16, 1987, and is widely considered to be one of the most-effective multilateral environment treaties ever negotiated. It's the only treaty in the United Nations system to which every country is a signatory. \</doc>

The Paris climate deal is only a step forward in a long war with a distant end in sight By Deng Yaqing | NO. 45 NOVEMBER 10, 2016 A protester voices her aspirations for an improved global environment ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference in Vancouver, Canada, on November 29, 2015 (XINHUA) The possibly catastrophic consequences of a warming atmosphere motivate government officials from countries all over the world to gather together every year and negotiate over fighting global climate change. After a legally binding climate deal was reached in Paris among nearly 200 nations last year, the world is now on the way to making the agreement become reality. The 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), formally known as the COP22 , is taking place from November 7 to 18 in Marrakech, Morocco. "It's the first climate change conference after the Paris agreement came into force, [so] it is deemed as a chance to put the unprecedented deal into practice," said Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs. First of all, efforts will be made to intensify actions fighting climate change before 2020. "Although representatives struck a deal last year, the emissions targets laid out in the Kyoto Protocol Amendment have not yet been realized. While the Paris agreement prescribes actions that curb climate change after 2020, the Kyoto Protocol Amendment targets actions before 2020, and both of them are important," said Yang Fuqiang, a senior climate, energy and environment adviser to the China Program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a not-for-profit international environmental advocacy group. Besides that, representatives will make detailed arrangements and work out a timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the Paris agreement, gain knowledge about the status of all contracting countries' actions related to carrying out their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), and make plans to achieve green and low-carbon development. They will also confirm that the promises made by developed countries concerning necessary capital, technology and capacity-building support for developing countries will be realized. "At the Marrakech conference, it should be made clear how much money developed countries have provided to the Green Climate Fund, where the money has gone, and what results the spending has yielded," Xie said. The Green Climate Fund, created in 2010, is a financial mechanism within the framework of the UNFCCC to assist low-emission and climate-resilient development. Due to the limited time, a lot of topics weren't talked through in Paris, such as technology transfers, capacity building, mitigation and adaptation and financial support. In Marrakech, representatives will give more time to discussing these topics, according to Yang. An aerial photograph of a photovoltaic power plant in Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province (XINHUA) Aiming high The Chinese Government attaches great significance to tackling climate change, said Xie, noting that the nation takes the issue as a great opportunity to accelerate the transformation of its economic development model and carry out economic restructuring. According to statistics from China's Policies and Actions on Climate Change (2016) report released on November 1, the country's carbon intensity was reduced by 20 percent during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) period, outperforming the target of 17 percent; the share of non-fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption in 2015 reached 12 percent, above the target of 11.4 percent; and forest growing stock climbed to 15.14 billion square meters, surpassing the target to be achieved by 2020. Furthermore, in the first three quarters of 2016, China's energy consumption intensity and carbon intensity further dropped 5.2 percent and roughly 6 percent respectively, exceeding this year's annual targets of 3.4 percent and 3.9 percent. To score so highly in energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction, China has endeavored to optimize its industrial structure, enhance energy efficiency and improve its energy structure, Xie explained. According to the report, service industries now account for 52.8 percent of China's economy, up 1.6 percentage points year on year; the growth of hi-tech and strategic emerging industries outpaced that of industrial enterprises with principal business revenue of more than 20 million yuan ($2.95 million) a year by 4.6 and 4.8 percentage points respectively. "In energy conservation and energy efficiency improvement, the country has taken measures targeting the industrial sector, transportation and public facilities," Xie said. In addition to a series of projects featuring energy conservation and emissions reduction, China has also enhanced relevant economic policies such as improving the low-carbon pricing mechanism, finalizing the financial and taxation incentive mechanism, and developing green finance. "Considering the current strong momentum, the chance is strong for China to realize the pledges made in its INDCs for 2030. Most experts in the energy realm believe the country can even fulfill the targets in its INDCs in 2025 or earlier," Yang said. By September, a total of 120 million tons of carbon dioxide, worth more than 3.2 billion yuan ($473 million), had been traded in China's seven pilot carbon-trading markets. In addition, the Chinese Government had contributed 580 million yuan ($86 million) to provide small island states, least developed countries and some African nations with material assistance, launched 10 low-carbon demonstration areas and 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and trained 1,000 experts and officials from other developing countries in tackling climate change. "Predating the Paris agreement, China issued an array of joint announcements with the United States, France, the EU, India and Brazil, which allowed it to reach consensus with major countries on divergent points and find solutions," said Xie, who believes those efforts facilitated the birth of the historic agreement. "Compared to the 2009 Copenhagen conference, preparations for the Paris conference were sufficient, and China's efforts in strengthening coordination and communication laid a foundation for the conclusion of the Paris agreement," said Li Shuo, Senior Climate and Energy Policy Officer for Greenpeace East Asia. Implementing the agreement The Paris agreement comprises 29 items encompassing targets in finance and technology, capacity building, transparency, mitigation and adaptation. To shield the world from potential risks arising from climate change, the agreement requires countries to work together to limit the increase in average temperatures worldwide to levels no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. "All participants in the Paris agreement have shown great sincerity and made great efforts. At the Marrakech conference, the main theme is how to carry it out and how to assess and measure the implementation," Li said. "While the world's largest developing country can surely realize the promises it made for the period before 2020, some developed countries are reluctant to commit themselves to fight climate change before 2020. [This is demonstrated by] the United States' refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, as well as Canada's withdrawal and Japan's reluctance to join the protocol's second commitment period," Li said. At the 2009 Copenhagen conference, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 to the developing world. Despite continual urging by members of the international community, progress in keeping that promise has remained lackluster. According to a report released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the aggregate volume of public and private climate finance mobilized by developed countries for developing countries reached $62 billion in 2014, almost 20 percent more than the $52 billion provided in 2013. Developing countries need to decide whether this funding is in line with the UNFCCC requirements. At the same time, donor countries should make public how much they have given and to whom, while recipient states should declare from where they have received money and for what they will use it, Xie said, adding that a transparent mechanism needs to be established to track the funds. "Funding is a major pending issue. A straightforward map and timetable is what developing countries yearn for, and heated debates will revolve around this topic during the Marrakech conference," Li predicted. However, meeting all of the current national INDC targets would still result in an average global temperature increase of around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, falling short of the 2-degree-Celsius goal, according to a report released by the International Energy Agency, an inter-governmental organization established within the framework of the OECD. To bridge the gap, countries have agreed to assess their implementation strategies and take stock of their efforts' results every five years, starting from 2023. Following on from that, they will have to reinforce their actions every five years. "The declining coal use in China and the energy transformation in the United States have undoubtedly helped ... [the two nations toward] achieving their INDC targets, but the results are limited. Therefore, countries need to seek new solutions rather than depending entirely on administrative means. For example, the United States should speed up its legislation on fighting climate change," Li said. "It's arduous work to close the gap between existing INDC targets and the 2-degree-Celsius goal before 2100. Therefore, calling on countries to boost their ambitions will become a major topic in the 2018 climate change conference," Yang said.

Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Saturday signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change that was adopted in the French capital late last year, according to a presidential statement. Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra had already signed the agreement in New York on April 22. The agreement was ratified by the European Union on Oct. 5. So far, it has been signed by 74 countries out of 197, representing 58.82 percent of the global CO2, which allows the agreement to come into force as of Nov. 4, three days before the COP22 in Marrakesh in Morocco. The Paris Agreement plans to safeguard the increase in global temperature below two degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Algeria said at the Paris conference on climate (COP21) that it is committed to supporting the international community in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It should cut emissions by seven percent by 2030 using national resources through the process of energy transition and economic diversification. \</doc>

A new analysis published here Thursday showed that six G20 countries failed to take action in line with their Paris Agreement pledges. Argentina, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States have not been undertaking sufficient domestic efforts to match their pledged nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the agreement, according to the study presented on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). The report concludes that the six countries "lack overall framework legislation or regulation on climate change, and need to move from sectoral to economy-wide targets and extend the time frame of their targets to 2030." The six countries also are "either behind on meeting their 2020 targets or have not set any," it added. \</doc>

The European Union (EU) said on Monday it must scale up investment and support the world's cities and regions in an effort that will make or break the climate promises made in Paris during COP21 in December 2015. During the recent 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, the United Nations (UN) warned of the gap between National Determined Contributions (NDCs) -- governments' climate commitments -- and the objective to keep the global temperature rise well below 2.0 degrees Celsius. Markku Markkula, president of the European Committee of the Regions, the EU's assembly of local and regional representatives, called for the achievements by cities and regions to cut greenhouse gases to be integrated into the NDCs as soon as possible. During the climate talks in Marrakech, two initiatives were launched to increase cooperation between all levels of government and accelerate the delivery of climate measures: the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the 2050 Pathways Platform. \</doc>

Sustainable development in Africa is dependent on the promotion of renewable energy, Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar said Friday in the Moroccan city of Casablanca. Speaking at the opening session of the international conference, Climate Finance Day (CFD), Mezouar noted that sustainable development in Africa requires the integration of the private sector in public policies for sustainable development and the fight against climate change. In this regard, he called for the establishment of a legal framework facilitating green financing of small and medium enterprises, especially those related to renewable energy. Mezouar noted that the CFD, which coincides with the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, is an opportunity to examine the conditions for boosting green financing and the role of the private sector in the international climate agenda, particularly in Africa. Mezouar will also serve as the president of COP22 , the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, due in Nov. 7-18 in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. \</doc>

The United States and China have an "incredible working relationship" on climate, a U.S. diplomat said Saturday on the sidelines of COP22 held in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. "We have incredible working relationship on that. And I think it would portend well for leadership for the future," said Catherine Novelli, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment at the U.S. Department of State. "I think everybody acknowledges that the momentum for Paris was generated by the agreement between the U.S. and China," she added. The diplomat highlighted that the two countries pushed forward an agreement through the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in 2015 to designate the Ross Sea and Antarctica as a marine protected area. "It was really a partnership that actually pulls us together," said Novelli. "Our partnership on oceans has been a strong one, and our partnership on climate has also been strong." Over the doubts about the U.S. future climate policy after Donald Trump takes office next January, Novelli said her country would continue the existing cooperation with China. \</doc>

Morocco will produce 42 percent of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020, head of the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) said on Monday. Mustapha Bakkoury made the statement to the press following a working session on the energy sector chaired by King Mohammed VI. He added that the new laws on management of renewable energy and energy efficiency will help further increase the figure to 52 percent by 2030. Morocco launched Noor 1, the first phase of what will be the world's largest solar power production facility last February. This mega project is expected to generate 580 megawatts by 2020, and provide electricity to over a million homes. The country earned the classification of the world's greenest countries according to a study released as part of 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21), and its city of Marrakesh is due to host the COP 22 in November. \</doc>

Morocco has announced that it plans to launch 600 environmentally friendly mosques by 2019, local media reported on Wednesday. As a part of a large environmentally conscious effort across Morocco, the country aims to reduce power consumption in its mosques as well as to raise awareness of renewable energy, the Moroccan daily Akhbar Alyaoum said. The "green mosques" will use LED lighting, solar water heaters, and photovoltaic power systems, the report said. The effort is being largely funded by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, in partnership with the German government, which will help with upgrades, it said. Morocco ranks alongside Costa Rica, Bhutan and Ethiopia as one of the world's greenest countries, a fact partially due to its ambitious goals to crack down on carbon emissions. The Moroccan city of Marrakesh is due to host the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in this November. \</doc>

The Commonwealth will be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP24 be held in Katowice, Poland on 2-14 December 2018. Parties to the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) are set to adopt a rulebook for the Paris Agreement, which will outline the governing framework and mechanisms for full implementation of the global climate pact. COP24 provides opportunities for the Commonwealth to advocate on behalf of our member countries, especially for the concerns of small and other vulnerable states who are most threatened by climate change. This includes a commitment to pursue efforts to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while mitigating, adapting and building resilience to the negative impacts of climate change. The Commonwealths holistic, integrated approach encompasses youth, finance, gender, environment, oceans to support member countries to tackle the effects of climate change and apply a regenerative lens to building climate resilience. The Rt Hon Patricia Scotland QC, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth is expected to deliver a statement at the high-level segment of the conference outlining the Secretariats climate change initiatives such as the Climate Finance Access Hub, Commonwealth Blue Charter, Law and Climate Change Toolkit, Commonwealth Portal for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the newly-launched Toolkit for Youth Entrepreneurship in the Blue and Green Economies. The Secretary-General and the Secretariats climate change experts will also engage with Commonwealth member countries, regional and international bodies on strengthening international collaboration and partnerships, as guided by the rulebook that countries will seek to adopt at COP24 . \</doc>

Xylarium Bogoriense and Automatic Wood Identification Tool (AIKO) Development and Innovation Research Agency (BLI) appeared in a talkshow held in the Indonesian Pavilion at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, December 3, 2018. The talkshow drew a lot of attention from COP24 visitors, who specifically attended the C12 session themed Xylarium Bogoriense 1915: Variation in Carbon Storage Among Wood Species. This world number one xylarium is one of the pride of BLI Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK). Apart from being the main reference in wood identification, Xylarium Bogoriense also holds many strategic benefits, including supporting mitigation and storage of carbon stocks. "There is a very close relationship between wood species diversity and carbon sequestration. Therefore, this is an important topic that must be developed to support climate change mitigation actions," said BLI Head Agus Justianto when opening the talkshow. According to researcher Krisdianto's Center for Forest Products Research and Development (P3HH), Xylarium Bogoriense has strategic benefits for calculating carbon content in wood and wood products. "In fact, this Xylarium Bogoriense can be used to develop Indonesia's emission factors and predict the pattern of climate change going forward," explained Krisdianto. In addition, the talkshow also promoted AIKO which was developed using the Xylarium Bogoriense database. AIKO is a computer vision based automatic wood identification tool. The advantage, AIKO is able to cut wood identification time to a matter of seconds, which has been done manually and takes 1-2 weeks. AIKO is the result of research collaboration between the P3HH and the Research Center for Informatics (P2I) LIPI. "AIKO can support the improvement in the performance of business people and the timber industry, increase PNBP, and primarily help accelerate the process of enforcing environmental law and forestry, especially in resolving conflicts over the determination of wood species," said Ratih Damayanti, a P3HH researcher. Head of P3HH Dwi Sudharto, who was present at COP24 , hoped that Xylarium Bogoriense could continue to be developed and enriched with data and information. Thus the benefits will increase, and AIKO can be immediately applied widely. Xylarium Bogoriense, managed by P3HH-BLI, is currently the xylarium with the largest number of authentic specimens in the world (193,858 authentic specimens, 110 tribes, 785 genera and 3,667 species). This has been recognized internationally by the International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA). Therefore, the Xylarium Bogoriense database has great benefits as a source of scientific information on wood species, mapping of wood species, and the main reference material in timber identification for law enforcement, customs and excise institutions, practitioners and academics. \</doc>

Minister Mark Field visited Poland on 6-8 December to discuss Paris Agreement commitments and green innovation at the UN climate change conference. Foreign Office Minister with responsibility for Climate Change Mark Field attended the UNs major climate change conference COP24 in Poland on 6-8 December. COP24 brought together representatives from governments across the world along with experts from science, business and finance to advance work on tackling climate change. During his visit, the Minister met with senior Ministers and officials from a range of partner countries, including China, Germany, Indonesia, and Poland. He also hosted a series of events at the UK Pavilion, showcasing British expertise and green innovation, including an event to celebrate the UK-Poland Partnership on electro mobility and zero emission vehicles. The Minister highlighted the need for all countries to demonstrate higher ambition in their international commitments, and pushed for a robust set of rules to underpin the Paris Agreement. The UK is committed to sharing its expertise and help developing countries in the global challenge of tackling climate change. The government has committed at least 5.8 billion of funding between 2016 and 2020 to help developing countries reduce emissions, and mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The UK will use our role leading on Climate Resilience at the 2019 UN Climate Summit to advance this work. FCO Minister Mark Field said: This year marks 10 years since Britain enacted the worlds first comprehensive climate change law. It has been instrumental in our progress on climate change. Since then, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other country in the G20, and we are leading the way in the shift from coal to renewable energy. But the reality is that we all need to do more. COP24 has brought us together across government, civil society and business boundaries, to build on the Paris Agreement 2015. It is vital parties make good on their commitment to finalise a set of rules that apply to all and will ensure continuous improvement in the fight against climate change. The conference will continue for another week, with Ministers from BEIS and DEFRA in attendance, as well as the Foreign Secretarys Special Representative on Climate Change. \</doc>

India, Dec. 3 -- Patricia Espinosa said this to highlight how important it is for conference in Katowice to address climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions The annual United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 While talking about how important this conference is since it is happening in a year that saw a series of devastating climate disasters around the globe, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), says, "This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record. Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more - COP24 needs to make that happen." The guidelines are to provide clarity on implementation of the landmark agreement and strengthen international cooperation. A finalised set of implementation guidelines will unleash practical climate actions, like adapting to climate change impacts, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing financial and other support to developing countries. Six months after the 2015 Paris Summit, the negotiations on the implementation guidelines were launched and COP24 was set as the deadline. "The 2015 Paris Agreement entered into force faster than any other agreement of its kind. We are ready to work with all nations to ensure that we leave Katowice with a full set of implementation guidelines and with the knowledge that we have served the world and its people," said in-coming COP President, Michal Kurtyka. The conference is being held hot on the heels of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, as well as a cascade of UN and other reports on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions."All of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris Agreement's aims of limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5C," says Espinosa.

On the first day of United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, India told the world that it was well on course to meet its climate targets well ahead of the set deadline and asked the developed countries to fulfil their obligations as well to meet the overall target. Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said that New Delhi is doing much more than it was expected to do to fight the climate change menace. "We will achieve all our targets ahead of our schedule. There is no question about that," he said. He told the gathering that the Indian government is monitoring the progress at the highest level because climate it is not just a matter of technicalities but a moral issue as well. India is a signatory to the Paris accord in 2015 where countries agree to limit the global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius. As a part of the agreement, India had listed a series of actions it will take to fight climate change. Reducing emission of intensity by 33 to 35% by 2030 compared to 2005 baseline was among the important ones that New Delhi has promised. India had also said that it will take measures to make sure that 40% of total power generation is the country is done through renewable sources of energy by 2030. On carbon sink, India had promised to create addition 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes carbon sinks through afforestation. Environment Secretary CK Mishra said that the current progress of carbon sink would suggest that India was lagging behind but several effective initiatives have been taken on the afforestation sector and currently being unveiled. "So that the pace of progress would almost be doubled in the next few years. On our other two targets, we will obviously reach there quite soon," Mishra said. "We are quite conscious of our targets. We are doubly conscious that we are in a position to over-achieve them," he added. The first day of the conference coincides with a release of a report by US-based Institute of Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) that India was likely to attain the goal to generate 40% of its total electricity through renewable sources by 2020 instead of 2030. "IEEFA estimates India's thermal power capacity will be 226GW, or 63 per cent of India's total of 360GW, by March 2019. By the close of calendar 2019, India's non-fossil fuel capacity is set to exceed a 40 per cent share for the first time," IEEFA said in a statement. \</doc>

United Nations, Dec. 7 -- As the transportation sector continues to be a major culprit in the global rise in temperatures, the urgent need for clean solutions in particular, powered by electricity or "e-mobility" - is being highlighted at the two-week United Nations climate change conference ' COP24 ' in Katowice, Poland. The conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with the objective of adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the 2015 Paris Agreement, when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2degC - and as close as possible to 1.5deg- above pre-industrial levels. Globally, transport accounts for one quarter of total emissions - 8 gigatons per year, according to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). This figure is 70 per cent higher than 30 years ago. It is estimated that over 1 billion passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world today and, if we don't take urgent action, by 2040, the number of cars on the road could double. "This is unsustainable, unacceptable and not compatible with the Paris Agreement targets," said Jose Mendes, Chairman of the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance, a group of 20 countries, cities and companies committed to pushing for low-carbon transport. "The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs," said WHO's Dr Maria Neira, who presented the report to COP24 participants. The first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s. But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine. "Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, during a high-level electro-mobility event, held here at the conference in Katowice on Tuesday. There is one major caveat, he warned the hundreds in attendance: "The growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand - and this needs to be kept in mind," he said, explaining that "if not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times," and that e-transport that is dependent on electricity made from fossil fuel combustion, could end up adding to the problem, not alleviating it. To prevent this from happening, investments need to be made into creating electricity from renewable sources, not from fossil fuels, and ensuring a solid supply chain. "The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity," said the Secretary-General. "But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full." "The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility," said the UN chief during an event dedicated to electric transportation at COP24 . "Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport. A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility," he explained. At COP24 "If we get electric mobility right, then a decarbonised transport system will be part of the solution," he stated.

India, Dec. 12 -- The new proposal, which will be produced on December 12, will be based on Paris Agreement guidelines To set the agenda for the last three days of the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland, a draft negotiating text will be given to nations for consideration. COP 24 Presidency on the guidelines for the implementation of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) on December 12. COP24 President Michal Kurtyka, at a stocktake session in Katowice, says, "Current approach of technical negotiations had been exhausted." He added that on several matters, unresolved issues remained. The negotiations will now be carried out under the authority of the COP Presidency, Kurtyka says. The new draft texts will be presented and considered by parties in consultations with selected pairs of ministers who have been identified to work on "solving outstanding political issues" that could not be resolved at the technical level, the president adds. On December 8, Kurtyka had laid down plans for the negotiations to give time to technical negotiators to resolve issues till December 11. The clock is ticking away and unresolved issues still remain. If at all and how nations will reach a consensus remains to be seen in the remaining days of the climate talks. COP 24 Katowice cop24 katowice Paris 2015 Agreement Climate talks UN Framework .

New York, Dec 9 (IBNS): As hundreds of decision-makers are gathering in Marrakech to agree new standards for global migration, the United Nations climate change conference ' COP24 ' is looking at concrete ways to help countries tackle large-scale displacement caused by the impacts of climate change, including water scarcity, flooding, storms and rising sea levels. Changing weather, floods and droughts in many places increasingly threaten peoples safety and livelihoods. That is leading a lot of families to have to consider whether they can stay where they are, or try to live somewhere else, said Koko Warner, who leads on migration issues at the UN climate change convention (UNFCCC) secretariat. While it is very challenging to quantify the number of people who have been displaced by climate change, today, over 258 million people live outside their country of origin. Global warming is expected to increase this number as its impacts increasingly render some areas of the planet uninhabitable. For example, if youre a farmer and the rains fail you for several years in a row, you may all of a sudden lose not only your access to food, but your entire source of income, and the well-being of your entire family can become very precarious, explained Warner. Currently, four times more people in the world are displaced by extreme weather events than they are by conflict. To address this, a set of recommendations to help countries cope with climate-change-related displacement was presented here at COP24 , the key two-week meeting being held in Katowice, Poland, to define the way forward on the commitments made by all countries for climate action in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Weve come a long way. Climate change migration was more or less absent from discussions until 2010, in Cancn. In Paris, five years later, the countries asked for some recommendations on how to better prepare and respond to this phenomenon, and in Katowice, now, we are hoping they will adopt them, Warner explained. The various recommendations delivered to the 197 parties to the UN Climate Change Convention include proposals on contingency planning, consultation and data analysis, and cooperation among countries. The document was prepared by a Task Force on Displacement and presented on Saturday for endorsement by the technical delegates of the Member States. Next week, they will be presented for adoption at ministry-level. The goal is really to help countries understand the scale of what is coming and really prepare for it, UNFCCCs climate vulnerabilities expert noted. Its really about finding ways to reduce the suffering and ensure the safety, dignity of the people at risk of displacement in the face of climate change. These discussions are taking place just two days before the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration the first-ever UN global agreement for a common approach to international migration to be held in Marrakech, this coming Monday and Tuesday. The recommendations vary in size and their criticality will depend on contexts. On planning, for example, one of the recommendations includes suggestions like forecast based finance which would enable communities who are facing natural disasters to prepare adequately. Another recommendation made is to focus on data collection and risk analysis to better map and understand human mobility. The document insists on the need to include and ensure the participation of affected communities every step of the way, so they feel empowered and well-informed when making decisions about their lives. We are very pleased with how far this topic has moved in the discussions, and we hope the countries will use the recommendations, said Warner. The real impact, she noted, will only be measured through the steps countries take to avoid and minimize unnecessary suffering, and address the risks involved in climate-related displacement.

Blasting the efforts of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia to undermine climate science as a suicide mission and criminal enterprise, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. tonight implored the worlds leaders to wake up and take action now in a video message released ahead of the conclusion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland ( COP24 ). To the leaders gathered in Poland for the Conference of the Parties, this is a message from California: Wake up! The planet is burning up. Carbon emissions are growing this year has been one of the highest growth rates in recent decades. This is not a matter to be taken anything but very, very seriously. The United States, I am sorry to say, does not represent the people of the United States. California, Washington, New York, Vermont and many, many other states, representing tens of millions of people, believe in the science of climate change believe, and demand that we reduce our carbon emissions. In California, we have set a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2045. We have taken other measures: We are introducing electric vehicles, building restrictions, cap-and-trade, renewable energy requirements upon our electric utilities there is so much we can do. Im not saying weve gotten there our emissions per capita are entirely too high, but we are committed to do more. We recognize the science undergirding the knowledge we have today on climate change. If were going to stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade from the industrial period, we have to take action now. The actions and the behavior of the leaders of the United States and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Russia and other countries are not acceptable. This is a suicide mission upon which you have embarked. Pull back, the people of the world are asking you men, women and children. From California, I can tell you, people are dying because of climate change in fires, in mudslides, in floods and other parts of the country, in New York and North Carolina and Louisiana and Texas. This is serious stuff. You represent humanity over 7 billion people are counting on you. Dont resort to what will be condemned in future years as nothing less than a criminal enterprise. Wake up, do the right thing. Leaders in Poland, this is your chance, this is your time. The people of California, the people of the United States and the people of the world expect no less. Take action, take action now. \</doc>

India, Dec. 13 -- A strong language on increasing ambition in COP24 outcome is crucial in implementing the objective of the Talanoa Dialogue and the Paris Agreement The political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue ended at 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland, with a "call to action" issued jointly by Fijian (COP23) and the Polish Presidency. The Talanoa Dialogue was convened as part of the UN climate talks. Talanoa is the Fijian traditional way of holding conversations to tackle collective issues. The objective of the dialogue is two-fold: to take stock of the progress of climate action since Paris Agreement adoption and to inform the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with a view to raise climate ambition. The Talanoa platform was launched on January 10, 2018, and since then it received 473 inputs, 44 from parties and 429 from non?party stakeholders. Under the Talanoa process, stakeholders talked about the three agreed guiding questions on the climate crisis:  Where we are?  Where do we want to go?  How do we get there? Throughout the year, parties and non?party stakeholders cooperated in the organisation of regional and national events with more than 90 events having been associated with the Talanoa process to facilitate mutual exchanges. The dialogue continued at climate intersessions at Bonn and Bangkok this year where stakeholders shared their success stories and learnings in response to the three questions of the dialogue. The outcomes of the exchanges have been compiled by the Secretariat in the Synthesis Report also highlighting the inadequacy of current climate efforts. The Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Ch ange's (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5degC and the UN Emission Gap Report has also said the world is way short on restricting global warming to safer level of 1.5degC. The reports added that to stay within 1.5degC by the end of century, climate ambitions need to be increased five times. To the third question of "how do we get there", science has talked about technological options and scientific feasibility to stay within safe temperature levels. The Synthesis Report of Talanoa also focused on adherence to the convention and its principles, the delivery of action and support in the pre?2020 period including the entry into force of the Doha Amendment, the finalisation of the Paris Agreement Work Programme and the pursuit of synergy between climate action with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. At COP 24 COP24 outcome. The two-page "Talanoa Call to Action language" calls upon parties to work closely with non-party stakeholders to enhance global ambition by 2020 and to develop long-term, low-emission development strategies, government and international agencies to step up financial, technical and technological cooperation and private sector leaders to be agents of change. The declaration is more of a moral appeal and lacks any legal character. It would be relevant to see how the language in context of the outcome of Talanoa Dialogue is reflected in the final COP 24 outcome text. The outcome text, containing decision for parties to update and revise their climate target by 2020 and thereafter, would be crucial in implementing the ultimate objective of the Talanoa Dialogue and of the larger spirit of the Paris Agreement-to raise climate ambition.

New York, May 8 (IBNS): Poland's new law designed to address safety concerns during the United Nations climate change conference to be held there later this year could infringe on the privacy of environmentalists and curtail their rights to protest peacefully, UN human rights experts said Monday. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) will take place in the southern Polish city of Katowice from 26 November to 16 December. For the COP24 COP24 at a preparatory meeting being held in Bonn, Germany. All eyes are on the Polish Government to see how, as the host and the president of COP24 , it will honour its human rights obligations and uphold its responsibility to ensure free and unfettered access for broader participation, the experts said. Specifically, Article 17 of a new safety and security law appears to give sweeping surveillance powers to the police and secret services to collect and process personal data about all COP24 participants, and Article 22 appears to prevent spontaneous peaceful assemblies from taking place during the conference. The UN experts encouraged the Government to clarify how the law might would be put into effect. \</doc>

India, Dec. 5 -- A WHO report released at the Katowice conference says health benefits far outweigh the costs of meeting climate change goals in India A million lives in the world can be saved if countries cut air pollution levels as per the Paris Agreement by 2050, says a report released by the World Health Organization at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice on December 5. "The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. "The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health-clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter-and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We can't afford to delay action any further." If all goes fine, the value of health gains from climate action in India and China will be more than double the cost of mitigation measures. "When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost," says Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. The report adds that air pollution alone kills 7 million people in the world every year and costs welfare losses worth $5.11 trillion. The 15 countries, which emit the most amount of greenhouse gas, spend 4 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on health impacts of air pollution. This is when actions to meet the Paris goals cost around 1 per cent of global GDP. It's all linked What's driving climate change is exactly what is affecting people's health. For example, fossil fuel combustion is main contributor to climate change as well as air pollution. If the world switches to low-carbon energy sources, as prescribed in the Paris Agreement, it will not only improve air quality but also provide opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, cycling can help increase physical activity, which will protect people from diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart ailments. "The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself," adds Neira. The WHO report says that although countries are making an effort to protect their citizens from climate change, it's not at an adequate scale. It adds that only 0.5% of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation are allocated to health projects. Another example, Pacific Island countries contribute 0.03% of greenhouse gas emissions, but they are the most affected by its impacts. "We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change-from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind," said Joy St John, assistant director-general for Climate and Other Determinants of Health. For a healthier tomorrow The WHO suggests that countries should count health while doing a cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation. The UN health agency also proposes fiscal incentives be used motivate sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Engaging with the health community, civil society and health professionals will also help mobilise collectively to promote climate action and health co-benefits, recommends WHO. The participating nations should also promote the role of cities and sub-national governments in climate action and monitor it. Lastly, the WHO says that the fiscal policy must also include health implications of mitigation and adaptation measures. cop24 katowice Climate change and health United Nations . The World Health .

Katowice (Poland), Dec 12 -- Fifteen international organisations on Wednesday jointly announced a commitment to make their operations climate neutral at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in this Polish city They will measure their greenhouse gas emissions, reduce them as much as possible and compensate the currently unavoidable ones with credible carbon credits. Representing over two million tons of CO2 per year in emissions, and more than 50,000 staff, the aggregate action by these organisations sets an important example that can inspire all levels of society. While some participating organisations are only just starting their journey, others have already achieved full climate neutrality. The rest have already developed advanced sustainability strategies to step up their climate action by committing to reach climate neutrality. Through this commitment, organisations with more evolved plans will support those at earlier stages and share best practices. By joining this initiative, organisations not only demonstrate a clear commitment to climate action and to implementing the global climate neutrality goal contained in the Paris Agreement, but they also serve as models for others to follow suit. The international organisations that announced their commitment to climate neutrality include the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Secretariat Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa Secretariat, Eastern Africa Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank and World Travel & Tourism Council. By doing so, they have joined the United Nations agencies, which adopted a strategy and a roadmap in 2007 to reach climate neutrality by 2020. Over half of all UN system entities are now climate neutral, representing 39 per cent of the total UN emissions as per the 2018 Greening the Blue report. The UN Headquarters have reached climate neutrality for the first time in 2018. Some of the climate actions that these organisations are implementing to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions include the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, policies for reduction of air travel, upgrading of insulation and lighting systems in buildings, reduction of paper used at conferences, installation of efficient cooling systems and promotion of car-pooling schemes among employees.

Evidence of the government's commitment and consistency in the global agreement, displayed at the Indonesian Pavilion at the 24th Climate Change Conference (COP), Katowice, Poland from December 3-14, 2018. The person in charge of the Indonesian Pavilion, Agus Justianto, revealed that the Indonesian Pavilion at COP 24 was a reflection of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. For almost two weeks of COP 24 , the pavilion was filled with 52 discussion sessions, attended by 225 speakers, with an estimated total of 2,865 discussion participants from various countries participating in the conference. "Throughout the first week, the Indonesian Pavilion has presented 83 speakers in 21 sessions, attended by 1,265 participants," Agus said to the media on Monday (10/12). "Furthermore, in the second week, there will be 142 speakers in 31 sessions, and it is estimated that there will be around 1,600 participants," continued Agus Justianto. The Indonesian Pavilion is one of the favorites for conference attendees. Through various sessions presented, the Indonesian Pavilion became an 'information house' for delegations from countries in the world, about various mitigation, adaptation, policy, rules and implementation of climate change. Only on holidays, the atmosphere in this location is quiet. Even if there seems to be an activity because at the COP 24 this time the negotiation area and pavilion are one and not separated, so the negotiators pass by in the pavilion area or negotiators use their country's pavilions to conduct activities. While on weekdays, no less than 400-500 visitors can fill the Indonesian Pavilion every day. In one day it can even reach 8 sessions. The speakers started from representatives of the Indonesian government, representatives from the State parties, the Regional Government (Governors, Regents / Mayors), Academics, Ambassadors, Business World, and activists. "It can be said that the Indonesian Pavilion is almost never empty on weekdays, according to the schedule set, because of the enthusiasm of visitors and discussion participants," said Agus. The Indonesian Pavilion became part of Indonesia's "soft diplomacy" at COP24 , and has been going on for 4 consecutive years. The Indonesian Pavilion was active during the conference, and at the end of the week the delegates would use it to conduct work evaluations. In order to maximize the agenda, Agus ensured that his party had also coordinated long ago with the Ministries / Institutions present regarding the schedule of the Indonesian Pavilion. "Coordination has been carried out at least four meetings with the parties, including the relevant Ministries, long before COP24 began," said Agus. "In addition, all information related to the Indonesian Pavilion can also be accessed through the indonesiaunfccc.com website. "It can be seen clearly, how busy and crowded the Indonesian Pavilion is as a reference for the international community," Agus added. The Indonesian pavilion that appeared with distinctive regional nuances and other Indonesian wealth, has been prepared in such a way since 10 months ago with the cooperation of various parties. From this location, COP24 participants can see Indonesia's real work in the global climate change agenda. \</doc>

New Delhi, Jan. 3 -- The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave its ex post facto approval to India's negotiating stand at COP24 where it reiterated its commitment to Paris Agreement, but added that the actions of developing countries must be supported by developed nations. The Indian delegation to the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held at Katowice in Poland between December 2 and 15, was led by Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan. "The key focus of the meeting was to finalize guidelines for implementation of Paris Agreement in post-2020 period. India's approach was guided by principles and provisions of UNFCCC and Paris Agreement particularly the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability (CBPR-RC)," an official statement said. "India reiterated its commitment to Paris Agreement and highlighted its leadership during the COP-24 The government said the push for renewable energy leading to achieving about 74 gigawatt of installed renewable energy capacity, including about 24 gigawatt from solar, was an example of India's efforts. "It is, however, important to ensure that the actions of developing countries are supported by sustained and adequate means of implementation including finance, capacity building and technological support by developed countries," the government statement said. "The adopted guidance operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and requires developed countries to provide detailed information to bring clarity on projected levels of climate finance. "Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of $ 100 billion," it added. \</doc>

- The Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking and the European Investment Bank publish a second edition of the White Paper The Need for a Common Language in Green Finance" - Comparability and transparency are key to develop green finance as an engine driving the transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient economy - With the EU and China being two of the biggest green bond markets globally, developing compatibility between the two can set a precedent for harmonisation on a global scale The Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking (GFC) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) jointly released a second edition of the White Paper "The Need for a Common Language in Green Finance" during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. This is a further step towards a better understanding, at a global level, of the nature of investments in green projects and transparency for the international community. This increased transparency and comparability of criteria is a welcome news for capital markets and green project promoters alike, as more and more public and private issuers and investors internationally access the green bond space. Ma Jun, Chairman of GFC and Member of the PBOC Monetary Policy Committee pointed out that greening global capital markets requires a common language for green bonds and the underlying green activities. This is increasingly important from a Chinese perspective, since the maturing national green bond market is experiencing a rapid expansion of cross-border issuance and investing. As similar trends are observed across global markets, a greater compatibility of standards is essential for seamless international integration. With the EU and China being two of the biggest green bond markets globally, developing compatibility between the two can set a precedent for harmonisation on a global scale. Jonathan Taylor, Vice-President of the EIB, highlighted that the recent EU-China Leaders Statement on Climate Change and Clean Energy underlines the need for EU and China to cooperate in developing green finance to drive the transition to a low emission and climate resilient economy. The ongoing work in the series of white papers helps create the conditions for a clearer comparison and mutual compatibility between the EU and Chinese green bond standards as these standards are developed and updated in the future. This ultimately should facilitate European issuers launching green bonds in China, and vice versa. In September 2018, EIB launched its first Sustainability Awareness Bond (SAB), which, for the first time, links allocations with objectives rather than activities. It extends EIBs green bond accountability to areas of environmental and social sustainability other than climate, and foresees gradual expansion of eligibility to further objectives and activities in line with the developing EU legislation. The EIB plans to adopt an analogous open-ended approach also for its Climate Awareness Bonds; the new documentation could be tested with a landmark transaction - possibly EIBs first green panda bond in early 2019. The White Paper summarises the progress China and the European Union (EU) have accomplished in promoting green finance standardisation in the past year and indicates tangible steps on how to continue this work in the future. The first edition (or Phase I) was published at COP 23 in Bonn last year. The core recommendation of this second edition of the White Paper (Phase II) is, that the GFC-EIB joint research should now develop a clear translation framework (Phase III) between the soon-to-be-established China and EU green standards by the time of COP25 next year (in the area of Climate Change mitigation), while a possible EIB green panda bond issue could tie the standards together in practice. By doing so, Phase III of the GFC-EIB joint research and practice could provide the necessary clarity and demonstration effect required to internationalise the Chinese green bond market and establish a baseline for the further harmonisation of green bond and green finance standards on a global scale. Background information: The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union and is owned by the EU Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investment in order to contribute towards EU policy goals both in Europe and beyond. The European Investment Bank is active in around 160 countries. It is the worlds largest multilateral financier of climate-related investment with USD 100bn committed for climate action in the five years up to 2020 in support of the Paris Agreement. The EIB has committed at least 25% of its investments to climate change mitigation and adaptation, rising to 35% in developing countries by 2020. With EUR 19.4bn dedicated to climate action in 2017, the EIB exceeded its target for the eighth year running. At COP24 \</doc>

India, Dec. 13 -- At COP24 , developing countries agreed to report on climate actions on par with developed countries The Paris Agreement is not a set of targets, it is a set of reporting requirements. Countries are required to report their self-determined targets on mitigation, finance and adaptation. And, that's not it. They must also report on the actions they take to meet their self-determined targets. This is called the 'transparency framework' in Article 13 of the Agreement. There is much debate about whether this reporting requirement should be applied to all countries equally. Ongoing negotiations in 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland are nearly paralysed over this question. Article 13 specifically requires that "flexibility" shall be provided "to those developing country Parties that need it in the light of their capacities". The problem is developed countries do not want certain developing countries to take advantage of this flexibility. They argue that some developing countries have the capacity to report and should report on par with developed countries. In a promising development in Katowice, these developing countries agreed. In a joint press conference by negotiators from the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), there was an express acknowledgement that the BASIC countries had the capacity to report and were eager to be as transparent as possible. The South African negotiator said, "South Africa is already complying with reporting requirements, so we have the capacity [to report]." The Chinese representative reiterated, "BASIC countries are willing to be transparent, because transparency is the basis for mutual confidence. We have to act [because] only acting can save humankind." All the BASIC negotiators pointed out that there were differences in capacity within developing countries, which is why there is still a need for flexibility for those developing countries that need it. India, particularly, referenced the current state of reporting, noting that "very few developing countries have been able to" submit Biennial Update Reports (a reporting practice which predates the Paris Agreement). In terms of their own capacity to report, however, the BASIC position is that they are willing to take on the same burden as developed countries under the transparency framework. This proactive position by BASIC negotiators should propel negotiations forward. Flexibility, in terms of different reporting timelines or elements of information to report on, can now be reserved for those who most need it, such as Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. In addition, where developing countries lack capacity, support can be provided to enable them to report on the same basis as developed countries. The end-result would be a largely unified transparency framework, with carefully considered exceptions. This will help build a comprehensive picture of climate action, and enable apples-to-apples comparison of different countries' actions. In the long run, this will only help developing countries, such as India, to showcase the concrete actions they are taking to meet their targets and put pressure on developed countries to do the same. In the short-term, this statement of intent from the BASIC group is an important contribution to reaching a strong consensus in Katowice.

Peru was present at the "Leaders' Summit", meeting of Heads of State and Government that took place at the beginning of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - COP24 , in the city of Katowice, Poland. The Peruvian delegation was headed by the Ambassador of Peru in Poland, Ambassador Alberto Salas Barahona, who participated on behalf of the Hon. Mr. President of the Republic, Mr. Martn Vizcarra Cornejo, and integrated by Mrs. Laura Secada Daly, Director of Mitigation of the Ministry of the Environment, and the Councilor Carmen Arias Otrola, Sub Director of Global Environmental Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru. The Summit of Leaders aimed to express the commitments at the highest level, which will serve as a basis for the following negotiations to be held within the framework of COP24 . The focal point of the Leaders Summit was the follow-up to the Kyoto Conference, December 1997, in which the first agreement was reached on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that considered the asymmetry between developed and developing countries. Likewise, the achievements of COP 21 in Paris were reviewed, which in 2015 provided the framework for future actions and determined the basic assumptions of the global climate policy, introducing the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities". respective,. The main objective of the COP24 in Katowice is the successful conclusion of the Work Program of the Paris Agreement, a document that represents the set of procedures and guidelines to finalize the international commitments agreed in Paris for the protection of the environment and the reduction of risks of climate change. On this occasion, the "Silesian Declaration on Solidarity and Just Transition" was approved, in which it is reaffirmed that the social aspect of the transition to a low carbon economy is key to achieving a broad public acceptance of the imminent and unpostponable changes that are occurring. \</doc>

India, Dec. 14 -- These countries seem to be working towards a weak and non-ambitious Paris rulebook In the last leg of the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Katowice, Poland, here at Katowice, as negotiations continue to happen in non-transparent and non-inclusive manner, it is becoming increasingly clear that developed countries are working towards a weak and non-ambitious Paris rulebook. Also, they have been able to form successful coalitions with China and island states to push for their agenda. COP24 President Michal Kurtyka announced new texts proposals with regard to various agenda item. Even though there is massive push by the civil society to raise ambition, also with reference to Talanoa Dialogue, and recognise science as a crucial catalyst in deciding ambition, there is no mention of it in the decision texts till now. A High Ambition Coalition is re-established on the lines of the Paris Agreement by the European Union and other states but it seems unlikely that it would be able to push ambition in the final COP24 outcomes. For pre-2020, in the current texts, the developed countries are merely encouraged to step up their pre-2020 ambition. Developing countries have also lost the fight when it comes to equity in ex-ante provision and review of finance by developed countries. Now, developed countries will only communicate indicative financial provisions without subjecting it to the adequacy. The text is also silent on new financial goal post 2020 and recognises that more discussions need to happen on this front. Loss and damage has been the weakest element so far and clearly implies that developed countries have turned a blind eye to the most existential impacts of climate change on poor and vulnerable countries despite a significant push by the island states to recognise and give due spaces in the Paris rulebook. It is absent in provision and accounting of finance and is referred as a footnote in Global Stocktake under its overarching elements and as an option under sources of input. In a major loss for countries like India, which have been pushing for "flexibility for all" reporting for all developing countries, US, EU and China have succeeded in blurring equity with flexibility now only for least developed countries and island states. Developing countries have lost the fight for "flexibility to all" under reporting and the text is now on differentiation within developing countries, a clear victory for the US and the EU and China. It is still a long way to go to determine the finer details of the elements. Parties could not agree on indicators or metrics to track progress on climate action and support and as such the current text says that these would be self-determined. Much of the reporting issue on common timeframes, baselines etc would be discussed later. Equity is referred several times in Global Stocktake for assessing collective process but operationalisation is still contested and would be decided later. The role of non-party stakeholders is not inclusive and the language is fuzzy. Most of the elements under markets and non-market mechanisms remain to be fleshed out owing to the greater complexities and stark differences in stances on issues. As of now, the text refers to value of single tradeable unit in CO2 equivalent. It has no safeguards or limits on trading, leaving this up to future COP decisions. It also does not mandate that a portion of the units generated by a country should not be traded, which was proposed by some negotiators. These measures would have contributed to more stable and sustainable emissions reduction markets. There is no clear indication of "environmental additionality" and on "corresponding adjustments". It is also not clear whether and how would the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in Kyoto regime's transition be integrated into the new regime. As of now, options exist for and against it. How developing countries are going to react to the texts remains to be seen. As the COP24 is coming to the close, can developing countries unite and pose collective front to fight for the issues that matter to them? Can they push for higher collective ambition and due recognition to science? A Paris rulebook which is not balanced and is weak would not meet the climate goals, in any case.

India, Dec. 5 -- Nations participating in the conference discussed climate change impacts on agriculture at a workshop in Katowice Agricultural negotiations have often been contentious since differences exist between the developed and the developing countries on issues of finance and technology transfer. The first workshop scheduled under the roadmap of the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), which took place on December 3 at COP24 in Katowice, Poland, was agreed upon at COP23 in Bonn as a space for discussion on agricultural issues. The KJWA gives countries and different stakeholders an opportunity to present their views on different issues through workshops and expert meetings, including approaches to assessing adaptation, improving soil carbon, health and nutrient use, enhancing livestock management systems, and understanding the socioeconomic and food security dimensions of climate change in the agricultural sector. Workshops on each of these issues will be staggered over the course of the next two years. The aim of the first KJWA workshop at Katowice was to develop a set of modalities to implement the outcomes from five in-session workshops that were conducted before COP23. Constituted bodies, which include the Adaptation Committee, Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG), Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, Consultative Group of Experts, Paris Committee on Capacity-building etc, were asked to present ways in which they could support implementation and advance the parties' agricultural work now and in the future. Key concerns The discussions saw a number of African nations concerned with how to best make information and support from the KJWA accessible to the beneficiaries-the citizens, farmers and vulnerable groups-while also integrating their views in this process. Developing countries continued to press on creating guidelines and modalities that would enable what is most sought after by these nations-the transfer of technology, capacity building and finance for agriculture. With the Green Climate Fund (GCF) present in the workshop, many developing countries looked towards them for financial support to move ahead with their agricultural projects and suggested that GCF be involved in the KJWA process. There seemed to be a general agreement between parties that the work of the constituted bodies would be useful in enhancing their work on agriculture. For instance, parties such as the European Union (EU), Uruguay and the African Group proposed institutionalising the involvement of the constituted bodies within the KJWA process. Specific guidelines and modalities on incorporating the outcomes from previous workshops are yet to be fleshed out and this is expected to happen during informal consultations held over the coming two weeks. It has taken more than 10 years to come to a decision on creating a space to deal with climate change impacts on agriculture, therefore expecting any concrete outcomes at COP24 in terms of finance and technology transfer for agriculture are slim. But one can only hope that the renewed climate urgency prompted by the 1.5degC Special Report on global warming will spur parties to take the action needed on these pivotal issues that will help ensure food security and protect climate vulnerable populations.

Nordic Development Fund (NDF) participated in five events at COP 24 last week and we continue this week with more activities. It was an active week for NDF at COP24 in Katowice in Poland where we participated in a number of events focusing on building resilience to climate change impacts. The conclusion is that the type of climate finance NDF provides is both strategic, value-adding, and much needed. Program Manager Aage Jorgensen, representing NDF (1st week), participated in the African Development Banks (AfDB) event on The State of African Cities: Investing to Build Resilience. At the event, World Bank, UN-Habitat, Government of Morocco, AfDB and NDF discussed how to attract sustainable investments to African cities to build resilience. The conclusion is that upstream investments and partnerships are key building blocks. NDF was also part of the panel discussion in the Asian Development Banks (ADB) event Climate Change Impacts on Health and Climate Resilient Health Care in the Greater Mekong Subregion. This event with health officials from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, WHO, research institutions, ADB and NDF focused on the results of the NDF co-financed project: Strengthening Resilience to Climate Change in the Health Sector in Mekong. The discussion revealed that the project has a strong impact on the health sector in the three countries and helps transform the approach to tackle climate change and health. Earlier in the first week, NDF discussed how to Unlock commercial finance for small-scale renewable energy in Africa with representatives from AfDB, EU and SNV. At Transport Day 2018, NDF shared tools and experiences from our portfolio in the special session on transport sector adaptation. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) organised an event on Catalyzing Investments for Resilient Infrastructure in Africa that presented the NDF project: Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility (AFRI-RES). The panel with the African Union Commission, World Bank, African Development Bank, Africa Risk Capacity, World Resources Institute / New Climate Economy, International Hydropower Association and NDF discussed upstream preparation, tools and data for building resilience. The second week starts today, Monday 10 December. NDF organises a special Debate Game on innovation and climate finance tomorrow Tuesday 11th at 15:30 at the Nordic Pavilion. On Tuesday, NDF will also be part of the Innovative Finance to Build Climate Resilience event 11-12:00 at the Pacific and Koronivia Pavilion. Today, NDF is also part of the 3rd Annual Climate Resilience and Adaptation Investment Side Event. \</doc>

India, Dec. 18 -- The Green School Project, an initiative by Tata Steel in association with TERI to spread awareness about environment issues in school campuses, made its presence felt at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland. A case study on 'The Green School Project' was presented at the India Pavilion in Katowice, Poland, on December 13, 2018, during a session on 'Capacity Building for Climate Change' hosted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Pankaj Satija, chief, regulatory affairs, Tata Steel, highlighted environment and climate-related actions taken by the company. On the sidelines of COP24 , a pavilion was set-up to create awareness about India's positive climate actions in various sectors of the economy. The theme of this year's India Pavilion was 'One World One Sun One Grid.' India Pavilion was a platform for exchange of innovative ideas for the world to come together and act. Apart from the Indian government officials, the session was also attended by delegates from countries like Austria, Namibia, Germany, Poland, Indonesia and Zimbabwe. The 24th meeting of Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held at Katowice, Poland, from December 3-14, 2018. Under the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015, the countries that signed the UNFCCC agreed to an international agreement - Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) - whereby they would reduce their respective greenhouse emissions and thereby contribute individually to climate change mitigation. In order to tackle the issue of climate change at the national level, an important step would be to create awareness amongst citizens and enhance their understanding about the ways of implementing sustainable practices, at the individual and community levels, which reduce emissions. Since children will be the responsible citizens of tomorrow, it is required to emphasise on building their knowledge and skill sets along with helping them develop an attitude of conservation and efficient use of resources. Thus, to add to India's contribution towards INDCs, Tata Steel and TERI envisioned the Green School Project, with a sharp focus on augmenting the capacities of students through activity-based teaching programmes, which not only involve and connect them with nature but also train them to promote the message of climate change mitigation in the wider society.

India, Dec. 11 -- Sports for Climate Action Framework launched in Poland to raise awareness, rope in sports sector On Tuesday, at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland, the Sports for Climate Action Framework was launched to rally support from sports organizations, athletes and fans and raise awareness as well as push for climate-resilient action. The framework was launched with the aim to reduce emissions generated by the sports industry and raise awareness among sports fans. Sports organisations recognise, in the framework, the need to achieve net-zero emissions, and meet Paris Agreement goals including sustainable development goals. "You recognise that because you've built significant global trust and moral leadership, and because sports touches on every cross-section of society, you can drive positive change throughout the world. I'm here to encourage you to use your significant global leadership position to help us address the greatest challenge of our time: climate change," says UNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinosa. The event's founding signatories include the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA, International Sailing Federation, World Surfing League, Forest Green Rovers Football Club, the French Tennis Federation (Roland Garros), Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, and Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. "As countries here in Katowice prepare to turn their climate commitments into reality, we stand ready to leverage the power of sport to support their efforts," says HSH Prince Albert II, chair of the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission. The IOC also released 'Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games', which can help organising committees measure the carbon footprint of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. "Our commitment to protecting our climate remains unwavering. We recognise the critical need for everyone to help implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the change needed to reach greenhouse gas emission neutrality in the second half of the 21st century," says FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura. cop24 katowice FIFA international .

India, Dec. 4 -- Developed countries are not spending enough to mitigate the impact of climate change, the Indian ministry of finance submitted at the COP24 climate conference being held in Katowice, Poland. In a paper titled "3 Essential "S"s of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection" released on Tuesday on the sidelines of COP 24 , the ministry questioned climate finance values being reported by the developed countries as having been transferred by them to developing countries. The paper also said definitions of climate change finance used in various reports by developed countries were not consistent with the provisions of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This apart, the finance which has come through till now is far lower than that originally promised by the developed nations. The ministry quoted a recently released report of the standing committee on finance by UNFCCC, which assessed the total climate finance flows based on the biennial assessment reports of the developed countries. The total climate-specific finance flows from Annex II Parties (which includes the US, Australia and European Union) in 2016, according to this report, amounts to only around $ 38 billion which is less than 40% of the $100 billion target of climate finance. Around 90% of the funding has been through bilateral, regional and other channels while only around 10% of this was through multilateral funds. Developing nations and least developed countries have been demanding that developed nations, particularly the US, take historical and moral responsibility for being among the largest greenhouse gas emitters and for being historically responsible for accentuating climate change. The moral responsibility includes transfer of funds for adaptation to climate change and transfer of technology. That hasn't happened, the paper argues. "It needs to be noted that the growth in reported climate-specific finance actually slowed down from 24% between 2014 and 2015 to 14% between 2015 and 2016. ..The Paris Agreement has provided an opportunity to agree on new rules of accounting and reporting framework on climate finance," the paper states. The ministry paper also refers to an assessment by Oxfam (2018) of the $100 billion climate finance goal. The assessment states that the value of loans is being over-reported. In conclusion, the paper said that there is need to establish more credible, accurate and verifiable numbers on the exact size of the climate finance flows from developed to developing nations. "The global community displayed an unprecedented speed in ratifying the Paris Agreement. Meeting the climate finance obligations also deserves the same momentum," it said.

The fight against climate change and gender equality are priorities for the Government of Canada. Women play an important role in fighting climate change and advancing clean growth. That is why the Government of Canada is following through with this commitment by holding, with France, a training workshop on climate negotiations for 15 francophone negotiators from the sub-Saharan African regionin Dakar, Senegalfrom October 22 to 25, 2018. The workshop, which will be offered in French for the first time, aims to help participants develop the personal skills, competencies, and knowledge they need for international negotiations, decision making, and the development of climate change policies. These skills will be especially useful ahead of the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), which will be hosted in Poland, in December 2018. The project follows the launch of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, in April 2018. This partnership includes several Franco-Canadian cooperation actions for 20182019, such as including climate in development assistance actions. In addition to supporting the Franco-Canadian participation in climate issues, this workshop encourages a diversity of voices at the negotiation table, by supporting the participation of francophone women. Developed and funded by Canada and France, the workshop is also a partnership with the Institut de la Francophonie pour le dveloppement durable and the Womens Environment & Development Organization. \</doc>

In light of todays 3rd anniversary of the Paris Agreement and recognising the latest scientific urgency to achieve net-zero carbon emissions rapidly the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) re-emphasizes its long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality in its corporate practices. The IDB joined 14 other organisations, including all 68 agencies of the United Nations, in Katowice, Poland, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), to launch a multi-organization effort at walking the talk. As part of this, the IDB outlined its existing and planned efforts to measure, reduce and offset its unavoidable carbon emissions. The science is increasingly clear that the world needs to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and were proud to have the IDB already meeting this goal internally, said Amal-Lee Amin, Chief of the IDBs Climate Division, and head of the IDB delegation at COP24 . Some of the IBDs significant steps to reduce its carbon emissions have come from lowering energy use in its offices by upgrading mechanical equipment, replacing inefficient lighting with LED bulbs, and renovating more than 100,000 square feet of office space to open layouts that take advantage of natural light. In addition, on-site solar power systems have been installed in IDBs offices in Bahamas, Brazil, Haiti, and Jamaica as part of a plan to accelerate use of renewable energy (renewable energy credits already cover 100% of electricity use at IDB headquarters). The Bank plans to expand its roster of LEED-certified buildings. Currently, six offices are certified, two in Washington DC and four in the region (Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru and Panama). The IDB is pursuing LEED certification in Jamaica and will also do so for an office under construction in the Dominican Republic. The Banks main challenge is addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel. To mitigate these and other unavoidable emissions, the IDB has a robust program to invest in carbon offsets, recently supporting reforestation, clean cookstove distribution, and wind energy projects in the region. \</doc>

Chancellery participates in the second week of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), during which the High Level Segment takes place, in which the Minister of Environment is also participating and Sustainable Development of Colombia, Ricardo Lozano. During this week the negotiation of the technical components that make up the set of norms and rules known as the Work Program of the Paris Agreement (PAWP) that will allow the implementation of the Agreement must be completed. Likewise, it is expected that with the leadership of the Ministers, the political divergences that will make possible agreements for the adoption of the PAWP will be resolved. It is not yet clear that this result will be achieved at COP24 due to the complexity of the discussions. For its part, Colombia and the negotiating group of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, makes enormous efforts to achieve in record time reach the pending consensus. Likewise, the political event of the Talanoa Dialogue was held to advance a decision that promotes the strengthening of current climate change commitments. The adoption of the Work Program of the Paris Agreement and the Talanoa Dialogue will be the main deliverables of the negotiation session. The Colombian delegation is actively participating in issues of transparency, mitigation, carbon markets, adaptation, financing and global balance. \</doc>

India, Dec. 11 -- Centre for Science and Environment suggests that developed countries should commit resources to support adaptation planning in developing countries Countries need to be more pro-active and follow a support-focused approach to define a global goal on adaptation, says the Centre for Science and Environment in its paper that will be launched on December 11, 2018 in Katowice, Poland. The paper titled The Global Goal on Adaptation: Some Proposals for Progress will be launched at a side event alongside the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement establishes a global goal on adaptation in Article 7. The goal is to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. This is a qualitative aspiration, which has to be converted into concrete targets. The effort to define the goal is currently stalled. As a consequence, the Paris commitment of $50 billion from developed countries for adaptation in developing countries has not been delivered. The CSE's paper analyses the reasons for the stall in defining the goal, and proposes some shifts in thinking to enable progress on this front. The event on 'The Global Adaptation Goal and the Importance of Gender Transformative Resilience Finance' will be co-hosted by CSE and CARE International. It will explore opportunities to scale-up efforts to close the global adaptation funding gap while helping women and girls devote more time to activities-such as education, paid work, political and public participation-to fulfil development priorities. It will also provide an opportunity to share lessons from emerging partnerships, mechanisms and approaches for supporting women and their communities in the race for resilience. At this COP, the issue of global goal for adaptation is being indirectly addressed through two avenues. First, the negotiations on rules and guidelines for Adaptation Communications (ACs), which are the main adaptation-related reporting requirement in the Paris Agreement and second, negotiations on the rules and guidelines for financial reporting under Article 9 of the Agreement. While negotiations on ACs currently reflect the need for scaled up support for adaptation, the draft decision text on finance puts the onus of raising finance on developing countries and the private sector. The paper suggests that it is possible and necessary for developed countries to commit resources to support adaptation planning in developing countries. The New Delhi-based non-profit believes that in the long term, this process should ideally lead to clear quantified targets to support adaptation planning and climate-related development gaps in the world's most vulnerable communities. cop24 katowice Developing Countries Global Warming Developed Countries Centre for Science .

Costa Rica welcomed the achievements during the negotiations at the United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP24 ) that took place in Katowice, Poland from December 3 to 14, 2018. These agreements will strengthen the inclusion of gender issues within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As part of the agreed progress, the Secretariat of the Convention will carry out the revision of the Lima Gender Work Program (LWPG) and the Gender Action Plan (GAP for its acronym in English). The Parties will present reports in order to strengthen and improve both instruments in the next sessions in 2019. In addition, Costa Rica worked closely together with other partners in the promotion and inclusion of relevant language and achieved the inclusion of eight gender references in the text of the Work Plan of the Paris Agreement. One of the most important achievements was to recognize the participation of social actors, including indigenous peoples, with a gender-responsive approach, in the nationally determined contributions planning section (NDCs). The commitment of the members of the Costa Rican delegation was shown in the negotiations where they continuously aspired to improve and retain the mentions of gender in the negotiated texts. Also, COP 24 officially presented the Costa Rican initiative "For All Coalition", in Spanish, "Coalicin para Todos y Todas", as has been done in the framework of the 73rd General Assembly of the United Nations, and COP14 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. With this initiative, Costa Rica highlights the importance of harmonizing and articulating the languages ??and messages that promote gender equality, the empowerment of women and human rights in the Multilateral Environmental Agreements. The official launch of the initiative took place on Tuesday, December 11, with the participation of the Minister of Environment and Energy, Carlos Manuel Rodrguez, the Vice-Secretary of the Convention Secretariat, as well as representatives of the Coalition's member governments. , UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In addition, the "Declaration on gender equality and climate change", promoted by Peru and Costa Rica, was supported by Belgium, Chile, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. The Declaration recognizes the leadership and fundamental work of women, and seeks to include the gender equality approach in climate action in a comprehensive manner. \</doc>

MANGALURU: A panel of energy experts have highlighted the important role nuclear energy has to play in combating climate change and have called on negotiators to enable all low carbon technologies to fulfill their full potential.Agneta Rising, Director General, World Nuclear Association said, "The future decarbonization of the electricity sector is central to tackling climate change. We have the solutions, but we are lacking the decisions. Those decision makers here at COP24 have the most immediate goal to achieve, to ensure the Paris Agreement rulebook encourage and enables all low carbon technologies, including nuclear energy."Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director, International Energy Agency (IEA) told the COP 24 delegates via video link that "We need a secure and sustainable energy supply and I believe nuclear has an important role to play."Cosmin Ghita, CEO, Nuclear Electrica spoke about Romania's success in decarbonizing its generation mix using nuclear energy - "Romania's energy mix should include clean sources, which nuclear delivers on. We don't see our targets being achieved without the use of nuclear power".Delegates were also told of Poland's plans to make greater use of nuclear energy. "Poland's first power plant will be built by 2033 with five more by 2043. Nuclear power will be the main tool for energy supply." said Dr Jzef Sobolewski, on behalf of Polish Minister of Energy Krzysztof Tchrzewski.These comments were made at an event on the new Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) NICE Future initiative, which looks at how nuclear and renewables can be combined to enable both forms of technologies.Dr Jill Engel-Cox, NICE Future Operating Agent, Program Director, US National Renewable Energy Laboratory said that "Together, nuclear and renewable energy could reduce emissions of carbon and help meet this century's global low-emission energy goals"Sarah Lennon, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, US Department of Energy said that "The NICE Future initiative puts nuclear at the heart of the discussions about a clean energy future."

Colombia, which currently holds the Presidency, hosted the annual meeting of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), a negotiating group under the Climate Change Convention of which it is a member along with Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. This meeting was preceded by a dialogue on climate finance, a central issue on the agenda of the negotiations. The meetings sought to consolidate the technical positions, as well as the group's negotiation strategy for the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to be held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14. At this COP, the adoption of the set of rules and guidelines that will allow the implementation of the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is expected. The importance of the COP24 for the credibility of the multilateral climate change regime was stressed, as well as the need not only to adopt the rules of the treaty, but also to mobilize the political will to redouble efforts and build alliances to accelerate all global actions in the face of climate change. The foregoing, in line with the urgent call of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, for its acronym in English) on the importance of avoiding an increase in the temperature of the planet above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Colombia, as the current Chair of AILAC, invited the group to continue to exercise a constructive role in the negotiations to achieve the expected results of the COP24 and move towards the fulfillment of the goals of the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec. 3 -- At a time when the latest IPCC report calls for urgent action to fight climate change, Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, is accelerating its contribution to meeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. To mark the occasion of COP24 in Katowice (Poland), from December 3 to 14, 2018, Schneider Electric is strengthening its commitments to become carbon neutral by 2030 using solutions that will help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy. Carbon neutral by 2030 "The climate emergency is growing, and new players are emerging to tackle the issue. The Paris Agreement signed three years ago provides us with a much clearer understanding of what is at stake. We're now at a tipping point in limiting global warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels to avoid a major ecological disaster", says Gilles Vermot Desroches, Sustainability Senior VP at Schneider Electric. In November 2015, on the eve of COP21, Schneider Electric announced its plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. To mark the occasion of COP24 , Schneider Electric is stepping up its ambition and strengthening its commitments to fighting climate change, based on three complementary initiatives: 1. Before 2020: meet the 21 new commitments of the 2018-2020 Schneider Sustainability Impact barometer, outline a specific trajectory based on the assumption that Earth will breach the 2C warming limit by 2050 and validate it through the Science Based Targets initiative, signed by the Group in 2016. 2. Achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 at its plants and sites, in a cohesive industry ecosystem encompassing both suppliers and clients. To that aim, the Group will  quantify carbon emissions saved by its customers thanks to its EcoStruxure offers  switch to 100% renewable electricity, use 100% recyclable or reusable packaging, and recover 100% of its industrial waste  and double its energy productivity against a 2005 baseline. Building a sustainable future together, thanks to energy efficiency "The decisions we make today are critical to ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future. At Schneider Electric, we believe that sustainability and innovation is technologically possible today. COP24 , in Poland this year, is an opportunity for us to demonstrate our contribution through solutions that are a genuine remedy for climate change and to show how we can help meet the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals", said Gilles Vermot Desroches. What is good for the climate is good for the economy. Schneider Electric's solutions help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy offering numerous opportunities, from sustainable growth to job creation, improved public health and more. A number of Schneider Electric projects in Poland demonstrate this:  Schneider Electric completed an electrical distribution modernization of the Saint Gobain glass factory in Dabrowa Gornicza in 2017. The replacement and optimization of transformers, thanks to EcoSruxure Power Consulting Services, led to a 16% drop in energy losses (OPEX) in 2018 as well as a 30% drop in capital expenditure.  Schneider Electric has also equipped the International Conference Center of Katowice, where COP24 Addressing energy poverty and the climate emergency COP 24 , the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Foundation de France, together with social entrepreneurship organization Ashoka, will pursue this commitment to tackling fuel poverty in Europe by launching a new call for projects for 2019. Climate change is another key issue, as many people have already been forced to leave their homes due to extreme natural disasters. Those situations call for mobile, clean, reliable and affordable energy access solutions. At COP24 , Schneider Electric will launch its Villaya Emergency solution for easier access to energy in emergency situations. This solar microgrid solution is ready to use in any situation thanks to a system combining Schneider Electric technologies and the expertise of innovative start-ups. The entire solution is fitted into a standard shipping container for fast, easy transportation or relocation to anywhere worldwide. Schneider Electric at COP24 COP24 will bring together around 20,000 participants (political leaders and representatives from NGOs, business and science and research) from more than 190 countries, all working to accelerate the implementation of solutions by 2020. Schneider Electric's experts and executives will participate in a series of events and round tables.

New Delhi, Dec. 17 -- As many as 195 countries evolved and adopted a set of guidelines - the Paris Rulebook - for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to climate change late on Saturday evening in Poland's Katowice. The rulebook was adopted after two weeks of negotiations to resolve major differences between developed, developing and a coalition of least developed countries at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ). Equity would mean that the developed countries take the lead while developing and least developed countries also take action to combat climate change in accordance with their capacities. Later, the ministry issued a statement on Sunday saying India welcomed the rulebook as its concerns have been addressed in the final version. "India considers the outcome of COP 24 a positive one which addresses concerns of all parties and sets us on the path towards successful implementation of the Paris Agreement." Civil society groups and the least developed countries have expressed their concerns about how effective the rulebook or the Katowice Climate Package. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhibased advocacy organisation, said the countries are pretty much on their own to mitigate, adapt and pay for climate impacts. "The UNFCCC [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] is now a platform to collect and synthesise information and provide a forum to discuss and debate. It does not have the tools to drive global collective action to combat climate change. In such a situation, one needs to seriously question the raison d'etre of the UNFCCC," said CSE deputy director general Chandra Bhushan. According to the CSE, the developed countries have the choice to include all kinds of financial instruments as climate finance including loans. It said the reporting of financial grants by developed countries and review of whether it is adequate has also been weakened. In the global stocktake section to measure global progress and identify how countries are adapting to or mitigating climate change, there is now no provision on addressing these issues, the CSE added. "The result is that a lot of technical information will be collected without any clear recommendation to increase ambition on mitigation or finance," the CSE said in a statement. The negotiations were extended for a day after the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) expressed concerns over the draft rulebook. LDCs and AOSIS said it was weak on addressing 'loss and damage', which refers to irreversible climate impacts certain vulnerable parts of the world face, and on saving the world from breaching the 1.5-degree celsius warming over pre-industrial levels. In the final text, 'loss and damage' has got more attention. But the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 1.5-degree global warming report have not been taken on board. The successful completion of the report has been welcomed. "The 1.5 report, loss and damage and other small island priorities are reflected in the compromise text. But it must be said that addressing climate change is ultimately a political challenge, not a technical one. Unless world leaders treat climate change as the global emergency it is... it may slip beyond our control," said AOSIS chairperson Hussain Rasheed Hassan. The environment ministry said the guidance on finance provisions operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and recognises the need for climate finance to be new and additional and climate specific. "Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of USD 100 billion." COP24 president Michal Kurtyka said all nations have worked tirelessly and showed their commitment. The UNFCCC said the Katowice package sets out how countries will provide information about their nationally determined contributions that describe their domestic climate actions. This information will include mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. COP24 was extended till late on Sunday because countries disagreed over the details of the carbon market mechanism (trading in emissions between countries). Currently, many technical issues of the market mechanism have been shifted to 2019 for further discussions. "High-level talks have disappointed us over and over, but we know that the real solutions lie in local movements and communities that use their votes and voices to hold their governments accountable for solving the climate crisis," said ActionAid International's climate change global lead Harjeet Singh.

India, Dec. 10 -- India manages to climb three spots and is ranked 11th in this year's Climate Change Performance Index At a time when carbon dioxide emissions have started to rise after three years of stability, there is a "lack of political will" in most nations to phase out fossil fuels with the necessary speed, according to a report released at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2019, released December 10, 2018 by Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute, shows that only few countries have started working towards limiting global warming below 2degC or even at 1.5degC. Neither is any of the 56 countries or the European Union on the 2degC pathway, nor is their ambition or the level of implementation high enough to reach the target. Niklas Hohne, co-author of the CCPI from NewClimate Institute, says, "There are bright spots in all categories, but no country performs well in all categories. If all countries would follow the leaders, we would come a long way towards a well below 2degC pathway." India, although, has managed to increase its standing in the index by three places to 11. The index takes into account every country's aggregated performance in 14 indicators under four categories-greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy. Renewable energy has helped India improve its performance and join the group of medium performers. But, experts in the country still argue that plans to build new coal-fired power plants spell trouble for the positive developments in the renewable energy sector. What led to India's high ranking in the emissions category were low levels of per capita GHG emissions and an ambitious mitigation target for 2030. Sweden leads this ranking, followed by Morocco and Lithuania. The bottom five are Saudi Arabia, the United States, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei with all of them scoring low or very low in almost all categories. China ranks 33 and is too in the group of medium-performing countries. Jan Burck, co-author of the CCPI at Germanwatch, says, "Based on techno-economic developments in the last years, delay in implementation of low-carbon solutions can hardly be justified. While the G20 summit has shown strong support of 19 countries to support the Paris Agreement, the political will of those governments to set the right frameworks and incentives for its national implementation is not yet reflected in these words." The index highlights that the gap between current emission levels and what is needed to put the world on track for a well-below-2degC or even 1.5degC pathway is widening every day. cop24 katowice UN Framework .

Dec. 3 -- Transport is a major global emitter of greenhouse gases and, as living standards and population rises, the number of miles travelled is expected to increase. This presents a challenge: how can we transform the energy sector to help meet the Paris Agreement goals? Is electrification the only answer? Even for trucks, planes and ships? Or do we need a broader range of solutions?

KOLKATA, Dec. 15 -- SINCE I last addressed the COP in 2009, I've been deposed in a coup, thrown into jail, and forced into exile. But almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed," said Mohammad Nasheed, former President of the Maldives, adding: "We are still using the same old, dinosaur language." He is now back again to for the negotiations at COP24 and started exploring more effective, urgent and enhanced ambitious targets. Nsheed's statements, in short, summed up where the climate change negotiations are going at COP24 - with just a day to go to conclude the talk. Nasheed was just short of repeating what Einstein famously said: "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." Even the usual optimism in such meetings had familiar and archaic language: "Window of opportunity to keep temperature rise below 1.5 C, as revealed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is closing fast. But we still have time and we can do it". That was the official tone of the conference. But unofficial tone was of talk, talk and more talk. A special report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did energise the negotiations by adding the edge to the demands of the developing countries for developed countries to move fast on their own commitment for reducing GHG emissions and fulfilling the promise of financial assistance to the developing countries. But Nasheed wondered if the developing countries should now change the narrative of their demands and instead push the developed countries to enhance their own investments in the clean renewable energy so that technology improves and the prices come down. That, as per Nasheed, would benefit the developing countries more than just asking for new and additional finances. But even there, the developed countries are unwilling to budge. The huge wolf in the herd of the sheep was Poland itself. A day after delivering the inaugural speech at COP24 , Polish President Andrzej Duda made a surprise address to coal miners in the country's south, during their annual festival. He said that as long as he is in office, he "won't allow for anyone to murder Polish mining". Duda contended that under the garb of global warming, one cannot neglect the welfare of the coal miners and ignore their needs. Poland needs coal and it would continue mining it for the sustainable development of its people, was his narrative. That must have been a shock to EU delegation to which coal king Poland belongs. EU has often been very proactive in raising the ambitions for reducing the emissions in line with the IPCC 1.5C report. One of the Polish students in the conference stated that coal miners in reality can have a better quality life if they start working on the clean energy. Poland is quite skilled in making turbines for windmills and even exports them. But it does not invest in windmills in the country. "In reality, not only coal miners but even average citizen would lead a better life in Poland if we engage ourselves in clean and renewable energy," he stated. Many houses in the cities and in rural areas still burn dirty coal to heat the houses and pollute the air which, in turn, harms the lives of the present and future generations. But Duda has to please the Solidarity union of the coal miners, who are literally kept in dark about the clean energy. How can Nasheed's suggestion on enhanced investment by the developed countries in renewables would materialize in such a political scenario? In reality, the options before the present negotiations are limited. The fragmentation of the multilateralism is destabilising the negotiations. The oil kings -- the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait -- have formed another block of countries to complicate the negotiations. Even the facilitative role of United Nations Secretary General, who dashed back into the meeting after the inauguration on December 3, 2018 is unlikely to halt the fragmentation and destabilisation of the negotiations. The final days of the negotiations have also revealed that the basic tenets of environmental diplomacy are being conveniently (or deliberately) forgotten. As early as the 1992 Rio conference on Environment and Development, the singlemost tenet of environmental diplomacy has been the principle of the common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This basis of negotiations of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements is in jeopardy at COP 24 . The rule book to operationalise the Paris Climate Agreement depends much on this tenet. In words of Nasheed, carbon emissions keep "rising, and rising, and rising. And all we seem to be doing is talking and talking and talking".

Dec. 1 -- Beginning on Monday (3 December), Brazil begins its participation in the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which will be held in Katowice, Poland, until December 14. The event will bring together representatives from more than 190 countries and serve as an important stage for the discussion of multilateral environmental issues, with emphasis on debates related to the Paris Agreement, approved in 2015. During COP24 , the signatory countries of the agreement will take stock of collective efforts towards progress towards the regulatory targets set by the treaty. In addition, during COP24 , the Brazilian government will set up Espaco Brasil ("Brazil Space"), a themed area that will host debates and presentations on the results of national environmental policies featuring representatives of the public and private sectors, scientific fields and civil society. Cooperation Agreement Under the Paris Agreement - created during the COP21 held in France - Brazil undertook to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 37% by 2025. Currently, Brazil already has 43.5% of its energy mix supplied from renewable sources. It is also very close to achieving its commitment to reach a 45% share of renewables by 2030. For comparative purposes, that same rate is of less than 10% among the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In 2016 and 2017 alone, Brazil reduced CO emissions by around 2.6 billion tons, with actions that include an intensified fight against deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado, better management of protected areas and the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR). This reduction is equivalent to the total emission of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain, the five largest European economies.

Brussels, Dec. 5 -- Following is the fact-sheet of the UN climate change conference -- COP24 -- from 2-14 December in Katowice, Poland. 1. What will happen at COP24 ? This year's annual conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be a crucial moment for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, as Parties are aiming to finalise a detailed set of rules and guidelines - the so-called Paris 'work programme' or 'rule book' - which will enable the landmark accord to be put into practice all around the world. The conference, will take place from 2-14 December in Katowice, Poland, and will be presided over by the Government of Poland. It is officially the UNFCCC's 24th Conference of the Parties which is where it gets its name ' COP24 ' from; the Kyoto Protocol's 14th Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 14) and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1.3). The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5degC. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. 195 UNFCCC Parties have signed the Agreement and 184 have now ratified it. 2. What are the EU's expectations for COP24 ? In December 2015, Parties to the Paris Agreement agreed to finalise a detailed set of rules and guidelines - a 'work programme' or 'rulebook' - for implementing the accord by the end of 2018. Adopting a clear and comprehensive work programme consistent with what was agreed in Paris is necessary for putting the Agreement into practice. It will enable and encourage climate action at all levels worldwide and will demonstrate the global commitment to ambition. Adopting a strong Paris work programme, with clear provisions on all key issues including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation, is the EU's top priority for COP24 . The outcome must preserve the spirit of the Paris Agreement, be applicable to all Parties, take into account different national circumstances and reflect the highest possible ambition over time. Clear rules and guidelines will also serve Parties' own policy-making, by providing a robust underpinning for policies and reflection on enhancing ambition over time. In the build-up to the conference, EU Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete has conducted extensive outreach with global counterparts in order to ensure a successful outcome in Katowice. This includes the second Ministerial on Climate Action in Brussels co-hosted with counterparts from China and Canada, the Global Climate Action Summit in California, and a recent visit to Beijing where climate priorities were discussed with Chinese authorities. Additionally, the EU has also undertaken wide outreach at officials level with a view to moving towards landing zones on the key political issues related to the Paris rulebook. Party groupings reached out to include progressive developed and developing countries, the G77 and major economies including South Africa. The political phase of the Talanoa dialogue should send a strong message to the world, in support of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to spur momentum for action. The EU expects all Parties to share evidence of their action and progress on their nationally determined contribution (NDC), as part of a collective global conversation on how to enhance ambition. Ahead of COP24 Alongside the formal negotiations, COP24 will have a strong focus on keeping up the political momentum for continued climate action by a wide range of stakeholders before 2020. It will provide a space for all relevant stakeholders to showcase their action, share information, foster new cooperation and raise awareness on climate change and the solutions available. The EU has a rich programme of side events at COP24 - it will host more than 100 events over the two weeks, at the EU Pavilion in the conference centre. 3. What is the EU doing to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions? The EU's NDC for Paris is to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. This target is part of a wider EU climate and energy framework for 2030 and builds on the 2020 target to cut emissions by 20pc, which the EU is well on course to exceed. The EU has worked intensely to establish an economy-wide framework of legislation and initiatives that will allow the bloc to meet its 2030 target and drive the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society. All key legislation for 2030 has already been adopted, including a modernisation of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and new energy efficiency and renewable energy targets to ensure the power sector and energy-intensive industries deliver the necessary emissions cuts, and new 2030 targets for all Member States to reduce emissions in non-ETS sectors including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. New legislation will also ensure that emissions from land use and forestry will be balanced out by removals. Ambitious proposals to reduce EU road transport emissions are also on the table and still being negotiated by member states and the European Parliament. Fully implemented these measures could lead to an EU GHG emissions reduction of around 45pc in 2030. However, EU ambition and vision goes far beyond 2030. In March this year, following a similar request from the European Parliament, EU leaders called on the Commission to present a proposal for a strategy for long-term EU GHG emissions reduction, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following broad stakeholder consultation and taking into account the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5degC, the Commission this week presented a strategic vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral EU economy in 2050. It is an ambitious vision in line with the Paris Agreement goals providing sustainable growth and jobs and improving the quality of life of all EU citizens. The strategic vision will be followed by a broad debate among EU decision-makers and all stakeholders, which should allow the EU to adopt a long-term strategy and submit it to the UNFCCC by 2020, as requested under the Paris Agreement. The Commission will present its strategic vision to all global partners at COP24 , hoping it can inspire others to prepare their own long-term strategies. 4. How does the Paris Agreement ensure countries deliver on their commitments? In 2015, countries agreed to set up an enhanced transparency framework for action and support to build mutual trust and confidence and to promote effective implementation of the Paris commitments. The key task is to make this framework a reality by adopting a strong set of detailed rules. The enhanced transparency framework will help not only the understanding of progress made individually by Parties in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, but is also critical for providing robust data to support the global stocktakes and assess the progress towards the long-term goals. Solid multilateral transparency and accountability guidelines would help countries to design good policies at home. They should provide an incentive to build and maintain domestic institutions, data collection and tracking systems that policymakers need to make the right decisions. The transparency, accountability and compliance system under the Paris Agreement is not punitive, but it is meant to identify when Parties are off track and help them to get back on track if they are not delivering. Underpinning this system are new and comprehensive requirements and procedures applicable to all Parties to track and facilitate their performance. These include technical expert reviews, a multilateral peer review process, and a standing committee on implementation and compliance. Together, these will maintain a focus on both technical and political aspects of performance. 5. What does the Paris Agreement mean for the EU's contribution to climate finance for developing countries before 2020? At the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries collectively committed to contribute USD 100 billion of climate finance per year by 2020, from both public and private sources, for meaningful mitigation action and transparency of implementation. In Paris in 2015, the EU and other developed countries committed to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries tackle climate change. Together, the EU, its Member States and the European Investment Bank are the biggest donor of climate finance to developing countries. We have progressively raised our contribution in recent years, providing EUR 20.4 billion in 2017 alone. The EU is delivering its fair share of the overall USD 100 billion commitment. The Paris Agreement called for a "concrete roadmap" to achieve the USD 100 billion goal, with a Climate Finance Roadmap prepared by the donor community in 2016 indicating that they are on track to meet the ambitious goal. 6. How does the Paris Agreement address adaptation and loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change? The Paris Agreement put adaptation on an equal footing with mitigation and established the first global goal on adaptation, namely to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The global stocktake will review the overall progress towards this goal. Adaptation is a key element of EU policy and planning. National, regional and local adaptation strategies are gaining ground since the adoption of the EU Adaptation Strategy in 2013. Today, 25 Member States have a strategy or plan and over 1,500 cities and municipalities have committed to developing one, in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. The Commission published an evaluation of the Adaptation Strategy earlier this month - highlighting successes achieved and actions needed to further reduce Europe's vulnerability to climate impacts. The evaluation also concluded that adapting EU regions and economic sectors to the impacts of climate change is now more urgent than forecast when the strategy was adopted in 2013. In addition, the EU is highly committed to supporting partner countries to take climate action, including adaptation efforts. The percentage of EU climate finance targeted at adaptation is increasing, with particular focus on action in the most vulnerable countries. In 2017, roughly 50% of climate finance from the EU budget (excludes Member State funds) was dedicated to adaptation projects. The Paris Agreement recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change, including extreme weather events, such as floods, landslides, storms and forest fires, and slow onset events such as the loss of fresh water aquifers and glaciers. These concerns were addressed when the Paris Agreement was adopted by giving the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage the role of promoting cooperation on these issues. This includes further work on emergency response and insurance issues and a task force to develop recommendations on approaches to address displacement due to climate change, which delivered comprehensive recommendations on the subject. 7. What is the role for business and other non-state actors and how can the Global Climate Action Agenda be strengthened? The Paris Agreement recognises the key role of businesses, local governments, cities and other organisations in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient world. The private sector will ultimately need to bring about the economic transformation, turning challenges into business opportunities. The sharing of experience from the private sector side, on the conditions to achieve sustainability in practice, is therefore extremely valuable. Actions showcased through the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) - also known as the Marrakesh Partnership on Global Climate Action - are helping to build on the growing momentum. The GCAA has the potential to deliver transformative impacts on the ground, enhance ambition pre-2020 and contribute to implementing national climate plans and the long-term Paris goals. While measuring the impact and identifying what is additional to national climate pledges remains difficult, data indicates that the aggregated impact of the initiatives is in the order of a few gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2030 beyond the current NDCs - a potentially significant contribution to closing the gap (UNEP Gap Report 2016). The EU and its Member States have been proactive in promoting and sponsoring specific GCAA initiatives. Flagship initiatives include the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and Mission Innovation. COP24 will be excellent opportunities to reflect on progress made under existing initiatives, as well as for announcements on new transformative initiatives.

United Nations, Dec. 5 -- With thousands gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the ' COP24 ' meeting to chart the way forward for climate action, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres presented his longer-term vision for the 2019 Climate Change Summit. "The Summit will focus on delivering three key outcomes including raising real ambition, transformative action in the real economy and an unprecedented citizen and youth mobilisation," said the UN Secretary-General, speaking to a room full of reporters and change-makers attending the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). Scheduled for 23 September 2019 at UN headquarters in New York, the event aims to galvanise support for urgent climate action at the highest political levels. "We are holding the event during the high-level week of the UN General Assembly to ensure we have as many heads of State and Heads of Government as possible in attendance," he explained. The UN General Assembly usually attracts well over 100 national leaders to discuss and set the global agenda for the following year. "The outcomes of the summit will be your outcomes," stressed Mr Guterres who invited "all governments, businesses, sources of finance, public and private and civil society organisations to join in the preparatory process." Asked by a reporter, if the UN was planning to engage in dialogue with fossil fuel producers in the oil, gas and coal industry, he noted that interactions have already started and although "the dialogue with the industry is sometimes difficult and complex," these businesses were increasingly recognising the need to switch and develop renewable energy strategies. The Summit will focus on driving action in six areas including transition to renewable energy, funding of climate action and carbon pricing, reducing emissions from industry, using nature as a solution, sustainable cities and local action, and climate change resilience. Last month, in order to lead the way to the Summit, the UN chief appointed Luis Alfonso de Alba as his Special Envoy. Also present in Katowice for COP24 , he explained that one of his highest priorities in the coming months will be strong and deep engagement with each and every party to the UN Climate Change Convention, as well as other stakeholders, to raise ambition. "The intention is not to have a negotiated outcome, but rather to incentivise highest level participation, to be very selective in what goes to the Summit in terms of ambition and innovation. and then have a summary of the discussions during the meeting itself," said Ambassador de Alba. Paving the way, a special session of the UN General Assembly will take place in March. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. The latest estimates from leading experts also indicate that the value of health gains from climate action would be approximately double the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is even higher in countries such as China and India. A WHO report launched today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around 1% of global GDP. The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health - clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter - and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We cant afford to delay action any further. The same human activities that are destabilizing the Earths climate also contribute directly to poor health. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution. The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself, says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost. Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. WHOs COP-24 It describes how countries around the world are now taking action to protect lives from the impacts of climate change but that the scale of support remains woefully inadequate, particularly for the small island developing states, and least developed countries. Only approximately 0.5% of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation have been allocated to health projects. Pacific Island countries contribute 0.03% of greenhouse gas emissions, but they are among the most profoundly affected by its impacts. For the Pacific Island countries, urgent action to address climate change including the outcome of COP24 this week is crucial to the health of their people and their very existence. We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind, said Dr Joy St John, Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health. The report calls for countries to account for health in all cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation. It also recommends that countries use fiscal incentives such as carbon pricing and energy subsidies to incentivize sectors to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. It further encourages Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to remove existing barriers to supporting climate-resilient health systems. WHO is working with countries to: Assess the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from the more ambitious action required to meet the goals of limiting global warming to 2oC or 1.5oC. Ensure climate-resilient health systems, especially in the most vulnerable countries such as small island developing states (SIDS); and to promote climate change mitigation actions that maximize immediate and long-term health benefits, under a special initiative on climate change and health in SIDS, launched in partnership with the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Fijian Presidency of COP-23 and operationalized by the Pacific Islands Action Plan on Climate Change and Health. Track national progress in protecting health from climate change and gaining the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures, through the WHO/UNFCCC Climate and Health country profiles, currently covering 45 countries, with 90 due for completion by the end of 2019. WHOs COP24 Recommendations Parties to the UNFCCC could advance climate, health and development objectives by: Identifying and promoting actions that both cut carbon emissions and reduce air pollution, and by including specific commitments to cut emissions of Short Climate Pollutants in their National Determined Contributions. Ensuring that the commitments to assess and safeguard health in the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement are reflected in the operational mechanisms at national and global levels. \</doc>

The EU climate ministers are due to agree on the EUs negotiating mandate for the next international climate negotiations. Sweden considers that the EU must work for an ambitious, robust and dynamic framework to implement the Paris Agreement. At the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 COP24 , the Talanoa Dialogue will offer the first opportunity since the 2015 Paris climate conference for countries to evaluate how global climate action corresponds to the 1.5 degree Celsius goal and how ambitions can be raised. At the meeting of the Environment Council on 9 October, the EU climate ministers will adopt council conclusions on the EUs negotiating mandate for COP24 . Sweden considers that the draft council conclusions offer a good basis for a proactive EU stance at COP24 \</doc>

Ministers of Health from MERCOSUR and Associated States have signed a declaration to place health at the front and center of national climate change adaptation plans. This aims to ensure that health systems become climate resilient, and that health prevention and promotion are fully integrated with climate services, as per recommendations from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The declaration was signed at the XLIII Meeting of Health Ministers of MERCOSUR and Associated States, which took place on 23 November in Montevideo, Oriental Republic of Uruguay. It comes at a time when leaders from all over the world are gathering at the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. There, countries will discuss the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to coordinate informational efforts to reduce global warming. Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas. Climate change has been deemed the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. Indeed, climate and weather impact health in a variety of ways, including via extreme weather and disasters, heatwaves, food and water contamination, and an increase in vector-borne diseases. Climate and weather changes also impact socioeconomic systems which can affect public health, including through food and water insecurity, resource scarcity and forced displacements. Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas, said Dr. Marcos Espinal, Director of Communicable Diseases and Environmental Determinants of Health at PAHO. It is vital that countries in the Region commit to fully integrating health into all their climate change adaptation plans. The Mercosur declaration is a great example of this commitment. Impacts of climate change on health are already being felt throughout the Americas. Rising temperatures can provoke heat stroke, particularly in the elderly, and increase the duration of droughts and the risk of wildfires. Over the past two years alone, more than 200,000 people in the Americas were displaced as a result of forest fires, and millions of dollars incurred in structural damages. Rising temperatures also increase the number of intense tropical storms and floods hitting the Region, with 335 climate-related disasters occurring between 2005 and 2014, a 14% increase from the previous decade. In 2017, more than 625,000 people were affected by intense rains in Peru, and over 270 deaths were registered in Colombia due to mudslides. Climate change is also likely to expand the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases. PAHO is working to support regional initiatives and actions on climate change and health, including through the provision of capacity building and technical support for multi-hazard early warning systems, and on the preparation of Health National Adaptation Plans to Climate Change (N-NAPs). PAHO is also supporting the health sector to lead by example, through sustainable procurement and the implementation of Smart health care facilities, which aim to increase their resilience to disasters while reducing their environmental impact. The Mercosur declaration The Mercosur declaration commits Ministries of Health of member countries to lead the development of health strategies as essential elements of National Climate Change Adaptation Plans (H-NAPs). These strategies focus on recognizing health vulnerabilities relating to climate change and propose ways to increase health system resilience and reduce inequalities. The declaration also commits countries to generate evidence on health and climate change in order to develop indicators, facilitate information exchange and inform decision-making. Health and climate change at COP24 COP24 is taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 3-14 December 2018. The primary aim of the Conference is to come to a consensus on how countries should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. On 5 December, the World Health Organization launched its report COP 24 Special Report: Health and Climate Change. This Report highlighted that while there has been positive progress in tackling health and climate change issues, there is still a long way to go. The report provides a series of recommendations for governments on how to maximize the health benefits of tackling climate change and avoid the worst health impacts of this global challenge. \</doc>

UNFCCC COP 24 in Katowice, Poland which took place from 3 - 14 December 2018 has entered its second week. The main target in this international level climate dialogue event is to guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement including the implementation of Nationally Determined Contribution. Patricia Expinosa as the UN Climate Chief at the COP opening said that the final implementation guide would allow practical cimate-related actions relating to all targets and objectives of the Paris Agreeement, including adapting to the impacts of climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing funding and support others for developing countries. On Monday (10/12), the concluding draft of the co-chairs was presented to the President of the COP and prepared as material for the ministerial meeting. Nur Masripatin, as Chair of the Negotiating Team of the Indonesian Delegation and the Indonesian National Focal Point for the UNFCCC, said that although Conclusion for the Paris Agreement Work Program had been created which would become the forerunner of Katowice Outcome, the Paris Agreement was implemented. However, according to Nur, to this day there are also discussed several differences of opinion, especially for modalities, procedures and guidelines for NDCs, Adaptation Communication guidelines (including mobilization of funding support) and transparency frameworks. "Basically, our interests in preparing for the implementation of the Paris Agreement have been accommodated in the drafts that will be submitted to the ministerial level which takes place on this second Sunday," Nur Masripatin said in Katowice, Tuesday afternoon (11/12/2012) local time. Nur Masripatin added that Indonesia expressed concern about the structure of the COP's decision at the consultation of the COP President with the Head of Delegation represented by the Chief Negotiator of each country. In consultation about possible elements about the form and content of Decision 1 from COP24 , Indonesia delivered input so that the decision structure was better for one decision with the agreed elements through this consultation. "Indonesia also provides input regarding the substance of each of these elements," continued Nur. The Director General of Climate Change Control at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, said that what the Indonesian Delegation at the negotiating table struggled to do was very much in line with the development of efforts to control climate change in the country, even more advanced. "For example, the transparency framework mainly talks about action and support, we already have a national registry system that has been launched by the Minister of LHK on November 1, 2016," Ruandha explained. HYPERLINK www.ditjenppi.kemenlhk.go.id The Indonesian delegation in the second week scattered to follow the COP's presidency agenda which was still completing draft conclusions which were still deadlocked, some fulfilling the Side Event invitations at Pavilliun Indonesia and some at Pavilliun in other countries. "We continue to monitor these differences and secure the interests of Indonesia. If there is anything that we need to inform the Minister as the Head of Delegation, we will immediately convey it to be a consideration for him at the high-level meeting with the COP President," Nur concluded. \</doc>

15 December was the last day of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which adopted the Katowice Climate Package. The set of guidelines that implement the Paris Agreement is a 133-page document, which introduces the same rules for every country regarding the implementation of the Agreement and combatting climate change, and which also accounts for the development level and specific conditions of the respective countries. The conference has succeeded in carrying out all the planned high-level events the Talanoa Dialogue, the ministerial dialogue on climate finance and the dialogue on pre-2020 climate actions, as well as a number of events under the global climate action agenda. The Leaders Summit, which took place on 3 December 2018, was an important event during the COP24 . It brought together delegations from all over the world and addressed a theme of solidarity and just transition proposed by the Polish President. The only area where no measurable progress was made is the chapter dedicated to market mechanisms (Art. 6 of the Paris Agreement). Work on this matter will be continued during the next COP25 session in Chile next year. \</doc>

Representatives from countries around the world are meeting in Poland in a further attempt to steer decisive climate action. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the avenue through which global climate policy is negotiated. This 24th meeting ofthe parties ( COP 24 ) is focussing on the follow up and implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Political discussions will therefore also focus on climate finance, emission targets, and the role of large states. After successful lobbying by Environment Ministers to the UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs) the UK Government, it was agreed thatfor the first time ever the UKOTs would be directly represented and form part of the official UK delegation attending COP 24 . The Environment Ministers Council of the UKOTs nominated Dr Kedrick Pickering, Deputy Premier of the British Virgin Islands as the political representative from the territories to attend the conference. Dr Liesl Mesilio, CEO and Chief Scientist of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Climate Change at Her Majestys Government of Gibraltar was then nominated as the scientist representing the OTs and providing technical support for Dr Pickering. Together they make up the OT delegation. As part of the conference, they will be meeting the Hon Nick Bridge, the UK Special Representative on Climate Change as well as the Hon Dr Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform. Dr Pickering, Deputy Premier of the British Virgin Islands and head of the OT delegation said It is important for us as the OTs to continue to make our voices heard on all the devastating effects of climate change on us as small island development states. We will lobby forcefully for whatever financial help can be had from the Green Climate Fund. The aims of the OT delegation are to ensure that due consideration is given to the OTs in their ability and efforts to combat the effects of climate change. Raising international awareness on this is a key part of their agenda. Climate change adaptation and mitigation is also high on their list of priorities. With this in mind, their focus will be to network internationally and create opportunities for the OTs to attract green inward investment, displaying them as critical centres for research and development in the fields of renewable energy deployment, smart cities and sustainable development. Dr Roseanna Cunningham, Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform in Scotland said The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report is clear that we all need to act if we are to keep global temperature rise within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. The UK Overseas Territories are home to unique biodiversity and ecosystems and are on the front line of climate change as weve seen with recent hurricanes and extreme weather events. It is essential that we are all able to contribute in a meaningful way to addressing this crucial issue. Scotland is a nation of islands and I look forward to sharing our expertise and experience and working together with the OTs on what is without doubt the defining issue of our time. The urgency to reach the key milestones set out in the Paris Agreement and deal with climate change places very high expectations on COP24 . There are still many challenges of international climate cooperation but the atmosphere in Poland is positive and optimistic as countries strive to deliver on this critical agenda. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- Is humanity at stake due to climate change? The much-publicised underwater cabinet meeting of Maldives in 2009, just about two months before the 15th UN Conference on Climate Change , called COP 15, was deemed to have already responded to that question, albeit symbolically. Maldivian ministers led by then President Mohamed Nasheed went literally down in the shallow waters off the island of Girifushi, one of the nearly 1000 islands that makes Maldives most vulnerable to climate change. They then got down to the business of governing the Maldives under water by communicating with each other through hand gestures. Some critics dismissed that under-water meeting as a publicity stunt. Many in the diplomatic world, however, judged it as a remarkable and bold gesture. It was considered as a clarion call to global consciousness on issues that must be hammered out at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. The most intense climate campaigner among the then Heads of State, Dr Nasheed wanted to create awareness not just about the plight of the small-island countries in the wake of the sea- level rise but the plight of the humanity leading to even extinction of life on Earth as hinted in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that went on to win the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Come 2018, the United Nations Climate Conference, COP 24 , three years after Paris Climate Agreement, is now being held, literally, on top of one of Poland's deep coal mines. It is yet not clear if it is another bold experiment by Poland's young President Andrzej Duda to draw the attention of the international community to the darker side of the long and fatally flawed international efforts in addressing one of the deadly sources of climate change. The conference is being held from December 2-14 in the region south of Poland, called Upper Silesian Basin, known for the deep mines of lignite, hard and dirty coal. These are not just Poland's largest operating coal mines, but the mine workers there are the key deciding factors in Polish politics. The city of Katowice, venue of the climate conference, not far from Krakow where President Duda comes from, is amidst busy mining area with strong political clout, The region is the home for European Union's largest coal producers. Needless to emphasise that ownership of these coal mines is not just Polish but other European countries as well. So the roots of the mining are not only deep but, in a globalised world, have spread far and wide. As if to broadcast the 'reality-show' and to make green movement extremely anxious, many of the events in the margins of COP24 are financed by the coal-mining companies. Until the affordable access to alternate fuel that provides similar employment and prosperity to Polish workers, sticking with the coal is the only option for the Polish government. To hammer home the point, the government has recently announced that it is planning to invest in the construction of a new coal mine in the same region called Silesia where COP 24 is taking place. By selecting it as venue for COP24 , Poland is making audacious efforts to raise global consciousness and awareness on the stark ground reality of the global war in tackling one of the most challenges of our times. A positive message from Katowice and Upper Silesian basin is taht the world needs to eliminate coal through techno-political-social solutions and not just through 'clean coal' like soft technological options. Phasing out the 'Coal is the Goal' should be the positive message from Katowice. What is the stark and dark reality? Nearly 80 percent of the electricity in Poland is derived from coal. Globally, coal is the single largest contributor to the Green House Gases ( GHGs) emissions when burnt to produce carbon dioxide. The coal on weight by weight basis produces 30 per cent more GHGs than oil and 50 per cent more than natural gas. It is also the major contributor to air pollution that is now life-threatening menace in the urbanised world. Coal mining is also a significant source of emission of methane which has even more global-warming potential than carbon dioxide. Widespread use of lower quality coal to heat homes, especially in the colder months, has led to smog and respiratory illnesses in Poland's southern cities, as in many emerging economies like India and China. So this black gold is now called as dirty and anti-environment in all its characters. But historically coal has been serving humanity for ages for heating, cooking, steaming, lighting, manufacturing and electrifying. It has been instrumental in triggering and spreading industrial revolution that started with steam engines in the mid-18th century and has provided direct and indirect employment to billions. To be fair, Poland is not the only country that uses major part of coal to meet its energy needs. Globally 40 percent of the energy is produced by burning coal. China, India, USA are the three largest emitters of GHGs, most of which come from coal. In the US the fracking revolution has in recent years reduced the use of coal for electricity to 30 percent. So will delegates from all over the world to COP24 get the symbolic message of President Duda in hosting the Climate Conference of world leaders on top of a coal mine?

After extended hours of negotiations, the COP 24 The rule book for implementing the Paris Agreement is an important milestone in the 'global' quest to address climate change in accordance with the principle of equity and common, but with differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities. Dodging the skepticism rooted in the hard negotiations and slow progress in the run up to COP 24 , an agreement, even if with rued nods from many parties, is a positive step. However, the unfolding of the negotiations warrants that developing countries invest in greater scrutiny of the implementation as well as subsequent discussions at COPs. For over a decade now, the meaning of 'global' quest is being, subtly, pushed towards, what may be called, Third World's burden irrespective of respective capabilities and responsibilities. Many influential thought leaders from the developed world, while revealing their helplessness with, and discounting the withdrawal of the USA from the Paris Agreement by citing the commitments from the various state governments and cities, urge the developing countries, particularly China and India, to take on greater commitments without taking into account their own roles and responsibilities. This convolution of differentiation was obvious at least in four instances during proceedings of the COP24 : First, the unwillingness of industrialized countries to include providing credible and verifiable information on financial flows in the Global Stock Take process was in clear defiance of the objective of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement aims to ensure financial flows consistent with the requirements of the climate resilient low-carbon development pathways. After doing away with the distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, providing climate finance to developing countries is the most significant substantive parameter of ensuring equity. The diplomatic keenness of France to protect the Paris Agreement, by announcing annual replenishment to GCF, when the finance agenda was to become a point of deadlock explains the centrality of finance to successful climate negotiations, as well as 'global' climate action. Second, the opposition to the use of accumulated credits from the market mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol in the new market mechanism under the Paris Agreement by many developed countries is equivalent of arguing for quantified emission reduction targets for developing countries, post-facto, when the relevant global agreement did not require them to have any. The argument that the new rules are stricter, leading to the issues of environmental integrity, is not merely a technical point. It is symptomatic of political cunningness of trickery by rules. Doubts over environmental integrity of certain Clean Development Projects (CDM) had been discussed in great detail during the reform debates and many proposals were made, including the use of a discount rate. These options are valid for new market mechanism as well. Discarding a celebrated market mechanism's legacy in its next avatar and putting developing countries in a disadvantageous position must be understood as the reflection of the core political design of industrialized countries. Third, the opposition by developed countries to the flexibilities given to developing countries in complying with the reporting requirements, along with the demands for greater details, leaves the process of Global Stock Take far from being congenially resolved. The proposal to divide the rule-book into multiple agreements, which was rightly opposed by developing countries, was a clever attempt by developed countries at keeping the developing country parties under undue pressure of 'global' (read Northern) scrutiny. Finally, as has been much debated, the unwillingness of some of the developed countries to 'welcome' the 1.5 degrees report from the IPCC - despite having asked for this assessment - is a clear indication of their unwillingness to adopt stricter mitigation measures today, even though this may result in significantly larger impacts in the world and on those that have greater vulnerabilities and lower adaptive capacities. We are once again proving that we are not able to deal with the science truly, in face of political compulsions. To sum up,as noted by India in her formal reservation statement, implementation of the principle of equity and differentiation is constantly being undermined. Having done away with the top-down distinction between industrialized and developing countries, now the attempt is to erase it, if not reverse it, through the details of implementation of the Paris Agreement.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 14 -- A draft text of the Paris rulebook - guidelines on how the historic 2015 Paris agreement will be operationalised - is ready, marking a key milestone in the implementation of the accord. Michal Kurtyka, president of the COP 24 climate conference being held in Katowice, Poland, on Thursday said that the text in its current form will be released for political leaders to discuss, and that facilitation on certain matters may be possible even after the draft is published. Differences on key issues persisted even on Thursday, the day before COP 24 closes. The Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries representing about 920 million people sent a letter to Kurtyka raising several concerns about the conference's seeming lack of ambition and a failure to recognise climate science. At a stocktaking plenary held on Thursday, country representatives responsible for facilitation of discussions on various aspects of the rulebook such as climate finance, transparency in reporting, adaptation to and mitigation of climate change held talks in an effort to move ahead. On finance, there is still a "package of issues" which need to be resolved but they have been sent to the COP president for his views, said ministers from Germany and Egypt who were responsible for the discussions on finance. On transparency in reporting of actions being taken by countries, the coordinators from South Africa and Spain said there were "lots of differences" and they were "trying very hard to find a middle ground." Coordinators also said the issue of "loss and damage" continues to be open because of differences among parties. Loss and damage refers to irreversible impact of climate change being faced by certain vulnerable parts of the world. It aims to find a mechanism to address these losses. But developed countries have remained hesitant about this clause. Even on the issue of "equity"-a principle that means developed countries take the lead in curbing emissions while developing and least developed countries take action in accordance to their capacities -- major differences persisted. Coordinators said "more options have to be rediscussed and efforts made to resolve diverging views." Another issue that remains unresolved is on how the rulebook will recognise the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC's) 1.5 degree report. "How should we recognise the 1.5 degree special report? There are very strong opinions, but there is a strong will to find language to recognise climate science. We have just started to draft language," said a coordinator during the stocktaking at 4 pm in Katowice. The impact and cost of global temperatures rising by 1.5 degree will be far greater than previously estimated, IPCC warned in an October report. "I can hear constructive engagement. We can achieve some success in Katowice. Climate change will not wait for us so please make this happen. I will prepare a proposal with language that will be accepted by all. You can continue facilitating on issues even after the text is published," said Kurtyka. "We are deeply concerned over the direction in which the outcomes of COP 24 are heading. The rulebook should fully incorporate 'Loss and Damage' into the relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, including in the transparency framework, finance and the global stocktake," AOSIS and least developed countries said in their letter. India on behalf of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) Wednesday said "climate finance" and "equity" are most important aspects the nations want incorporated in Paris rulebook. BASIC nations said current climate finance available for developing and least developed nations is extremely inadequate. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

At the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland, the global community fleshed out the rules to govern the Paris Agreement. Rules necessary to ensure the most vulnerable communities are not left alone to deal with the adverse effects in a world in which global warming has risen above 1.5C. The effects of global warming are already affecting countries and regions around the world. This is especially the case for Small Developing Island Nations (SIDS) like the Seychelles. The Republic of the Seychelles is one of the island nations that could completely disappear fom the earth due to sea level rise. So what can a country with one of the smallest GDPs in the world do to prevent the global catastrophe lapping at its shores? Although we are challenged due to our small size and isolation from other nations, the Seychelles is incorporating the sustainable development goals into its businesses and communities, to make its economy more resilient and to help protect the people of our global community, explained Wallace Cosgrow, Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change of the Republic of the Seychelles, during a side event at COP24 . The SIDS have historically lagged behind with in the transition to sustainable energy sources; they have been highly dependent on coal. But we are driving the change by going 100% renewable, Minister Cosgrow added. The Republic of Mauritius has traditionally shown a progressive stance on climate policy within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of the Climate Vulnerable Group (CVF), a group of countries vulnerable to climate impacts and known for pushing for higher climate ambition and leading by example within the UN climate talks. Despite their high ambitions, several SIDS have to deal with barriers to access concessional finance for their mitigation and adaptation plans; most are considered middle-income countries due to their small population size. Davinah Milenge Uwella from the African Development Bank highlighted the range of financial institutions and mechanisms that the Bank has deployed to support Regional Member Countries including Seychelles and Mauritius, to transition to green growth. These include financial facilities such as the Facility for Energy Inclusion (FEI); and the green mini-grid programme under the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. To make this shift to 100% renewable energy generation and use, investments and integrated policy are crucial, adds Stefan Wehner from the Thinktank greenwerk: If we want these countries to succeed, we need to provide integrated energy roadmaps, investments infrastructure, technology and policy creation. \</doc>

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, began her first day at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. Canada was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Agreement in 2015 and continues to promote global climate action at COP24 . COP24 is the result of three years of work toward finalizing the most important climate agreement the global community has ever reachedthe Paris Agreement. Canada is working diligently at the negotiating table to finalize the set of rules that will put the Paris Agreement into action. The Paris Agreement rulebook will outline how countries will commit to fighting climate change and how each country will report on its progress. The rules will enable countries to see progress on climate action and identify areas requiring increased ambition. A recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that developed countriesincluding Canadaare on track to meeting climate finance commitments and that climate finance continues to increase. Canada is proud to be providing $2.65 billion over five years to advance international climate change objectives. During the first week of COP24 , Canadas negotiating team played a leading role in identifying solutions and addressing obstacles in the final push toward consensus on the Paris Agreement rulebook. \</doc>

India, Dec. 12 -- All nations must make efficient use of the few days left of the Katowice conference since till now theyhave been struggling to come to a consensus onsetting up carbon markets Negotiations on the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement-the Article concerned with the setting up of carbon markets-moved at snail's pace over the first week of the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Katowice, Poland. With just a few days left to agree on the terms for carbon markets, parties have been struggling to come to a consensus on certain elements of Article 6. Some progress has been made regarding sub-article 6.2, which is concerned with cooperative approaches and internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). But, many elements of sub-articles 6.4 (Sustainable Development Mechanism) and 6.8 (non-market approaches) have been pushed over to be further developed under the guidance of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and then considered in COP25 in 2019. One of the main issues under contention within Article 6 discussions is the element of Overall Mitigation of Global Emissions (OMGE), which is stipulated under sub-article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. This provision was made with an aim to deliver emission reductions that go beyond solely offsetting. The need to establish OMGE resulted from having learned from the experiences of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)-a mechanism that is known to have increased emissions by replacing domestic emission reductions. Essentially, these emission reductions would be attributed to the benefit of the atmosphere and no other entity. The only difference between these two options relates to which entity is responsible for making the cancellation-the registry or the host party before the emission reductions transfer. Parties that are pushing for this ambitious option are those that are the most vulnerable and affected by climate change, namely the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) as they strive to ensure that the market mechanisms actually drive global emission reductions. Voluntary cancellation, which refers to voluntarily taking certain emission reductions out of circulation to prevent further use, can be a good way to achieve emission reduction domestically and meeting NDC targets. However, it may not necessarily create additional emission reductions to achieve OMGE. Accepting the SDM as it is as an option of creating OMGE would beg the question of how the SDM would be better in reducing emissions compared to the CDM-it would render the SDM as a CDM 2.0. Moreover, there would be no guarantee of countries taking any additional mitigation action with the savings that they may have gained from engaging in carbon markets. Besides the usual fossil fuel culprits-the Arab Group-it was surprising to see parties that tout themselves to be climate leaders like the European Union and New Zealand push for the less ambitious OMGE options. Doing so will, for the first time, acknowledge the Earth as an entity that is party to the overall outcome of carbon markets, while also drive down global emissions. Parties need to make the most efficient use of the few days that are left of this COP to draw a consensus on OMGE and Article 6, if the world is to make climate action progress. cop24 katowice UN Framework .

, Days after the US President Donald Trump called Paris Agreement  fatally flawed , his administration signalled its support for 'dirty fuels' backing a side event at the ongoing UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) promoting fossil fuels including coal, oil and natural gas. Though the event, showcasing  ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently as possible, was marked by protests and short disruptions from civil society members, representatives of the Trump administration argued that the coal and other fossil fuels would remain in high demand across much of the developing world, and even in some developed countries throughout the century. They also emphasised that a rapid transition to 100% renewables is not yet feasible.  All energy sources are important and will be utilised unapologetically, said Wells Griffith, international energy and climate adviser to the Trump administration. He argued that it was important to know how to utilise them in the most clean and efficient way, noting that the US has been doing a lot on carbon capture R&D and efficiency measures. A large number of civil society members started chanting  shame on you and  keep it (fossil fuels) in the ground the moment Griffith mentioned that   fossil fuels will continue to play a leading role in eradicating poverty Griffith earlier emphasised that  Alarmist should not silence realism ...We are here today to share our balanced approach . As civil society members were raising slogans, the US representative smiled at them saying it was an example of  how we can't have an open and honest discussion about the realities .  The theme of COP24 is just transition  a transition towards low carbon economy without disrupting livelihoods of those dependent on fossil fuels. In context of this conference, the US event on promotion of coal was completely out of place and disruptive. It was akin to promoting tobacco in a conference on lung cancer, said Chandra Bhushan, climate change expert of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \</doc>

India, Dec. 15 -- Key issues that render the environmental integrity of the Paris carbon markets questionable are the Overall Mitigation of Global Emissions provision and transition of the Kyoto Protocol As the 24 th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Katowice, Poland, comes to a close, the carbon market negotiations on the rules for implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement have spiraled to an all time low. Textual proposals from the ministerial consultations on Article 6 during the second week of COP24 were released on December 13. It illustrated which of the preivously bracketed options under the different Article 6 elements had been agreed upon or left for further negotiation. The results are unfortunately grim. It was shocking to see how years of progress on drafting the carbon market rules have taken to the worse in a matter of few days. Fine-tuning of some of the technical aspects under sub-article 6.2 (concerned with cooperative approaches and internationally transferred mitigation outcomes or ITMOs), and sub-article 6.4 (Sustainable Development Mechanism or SDM) has been left for COP25 in 2019, and will be based on the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice's (SBSTA's) recommendations and guidance. Similarly, sub-article 6.8 (non-market approaches) has also been relegated to the SBSTA for guidance, which unlike the other sub-articles, largely lacks content. Some of the key issues that render the environmental integrity of the Paris carbon markets questionable are that of the Overall Mitigation of Global Emissions (OMGE) provision and the transition of the Kyoto Protocol. Parties have instead settled down with the option of a voluntary cancellation of emission credits. While it may be a way to achieve NDC targets through domestic emission reductions, it is unlikely to generate any additional global emission reductions. The transition of emission credits from the Kyoto protocol is still on the table. Albeit bracketed, parties have asked the SBSTA to provide recommendations and undertake further work during 2019 on the provisions of transitioning the Kyoto Protocol to SDM - specifically in terms of the conditions necessary to accept Kyoto credits in the new mechanism and the transition of the Kyoto methodologies and accreditation standards to SDM. The Kyoto mechanism saw an array of environmentally detrimental problems, including cheap credits, outsourcing of emission credits, corruption and non-additional projects, which subsequently left the overall emission reductions of the mechanism to doubt. Including projects from the Kyoto Protocol would stifle any progress towards achieving overall global emission reductions and the Paris goals, and deem the SDM as environmentally destructive. With countries like India pressing on a Kyoto Protocol transition to please the likes of the private sector rather than bringing actual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, carbon markets like the proposed SDM are surely doomed to fail. With just hours left to decide the fate of humanity, the only hope left is for high ambition parties, such as the Least Developed Countries, the EU and island nations to continue pushing for higher ambition and to salvage the draft text by helping other countries realize that the current carbon market provisions will lead to a repeat of the Kyoto Protocol experience.

Dec. 20 -- The 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recently concluded in Katowice, Poland. While scheduled to run from 2 to 14 December, negotiations finally extended to the evening of Saturday 15 December. Over the course of the two weeks of the COP, several issues relevant to climate change were up for discussion. These included: financing for climate action; financial support from industrialised nations to developing countries; national climate plans by 2020 (with self-determined goals and targets); ecosystems' protection; carbon policies, and the role of forests in capturing CO2. This edition of the COP had a clear mandate: to agree on the so-called 'Rulebook' - the operational framework required for the Paris Agreement to achieve its objectives. When the Paris Agreement enters into force in 2020, this Rulebook will be its operational manual. When the Paris Agreement was concluded back in 2015, all signatory countries agreed that COP24 would be the deadline by which they needed to collectively agree on the content of the Rulebook. The completion of the Rulebook was the EU's top objective in these negotiations. The EU's nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. De facto, the Commission believes that the EU's 2030 targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency could lead to an EU GHG emissions cut of some 45% by 2030. The context of these discussions is of even more urgency than might have been anticipated in 2015. Back then, governments agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, with a stretch target to limit the increase to 1.5C. Since then, however, scientists have been investigating the meaning of this 0.5C difference. The resulting IPCC Special Report 1.5 shows that a 1.5C temperature raise is the only possible target. Every fraction of a degree beyond that threshold would produce irreversible negative effects for our planet, drastically changing the conditions in which we now live. For this reason, this IPCC report was another key element of the COP24 discussions. Some countries were in favour of setting a more ambitious goal, reflecting this willingness by officially and unanimously welcoming the conclusions of the Report. But a blocking minority made of the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait did not want that. Further discussions are now postponed to 2019. In response to lacklustre response to the urgency of the IPCC report, EU Commissioner for Climate Miguel Arias Canete re-established the High Ambition Coalition, a group of developed and developing countries pushing for the highest ambition in the climate negotiations at COP24 . The Coalition published a statement calling for 1.5 as the sole possible target. WindEurope participated in several debates, in week one and week 2 of the COP. In particular, we welcomed the EU's 2050 Roadmap's finding that says that wind energy will produce more than 50% of the total EU electricity in 2050.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 30 -- At the COP24 climate talks, countries successfully agreed on the rules that will turn the Paris Agreement on climate change into real action. The decision was a compromise which maintains a delicate balance between views of different countries. But the Paris Agreement rulebook gives governments the clarity they need to move forward on climate action. Current emissions reduction pledges under the Paris Agreement are not enough to meet its goal of preventing the most dangerous levels of global temperature rise. Additionally, global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have grown by 2.7% in 2018 after three years of holding steady. We need to be moving in the opposite direction. The good news is that The Marshall Islands has already submitted its second, more ambitious, climate commitment. And others, including Costa Rica, Chile, Ukraine, Vietnam, Norway, have indicated that they will re-evaluate their commitments by 2020. I'm very happy to note that India remains on track to overachieve its national climate pledge for 2020, in large part thanks to the ambitious National Electricity Plan released in April 2018. If we go further yet by seizing the opportunities of our growing and cost-competitive solar industry and clean energy, India, too, could be counted as a global climate leader. Increasing ambition on climate is not only the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. Acting decisively to reduce emissions in the most efficient ways could yield US$26 trillion in economic benefits through to 2030, according to the New Climate Economy's 2018 report. New research released during the conference echoes this finding. The World Health Organization found that meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save one million lives per year by 2050 due to reduced air pollution, far outweighing the costs of mitigation. The health gains would be particularly high in China and India. Despite the mounting evidence base, there are still some strong cross-currents coming from a small group of countries. This was made evident at COP24 when the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait refused to welcome the findings of the newest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which paints a sobering picture of the impacts of climate change on development and economic prospects around the world. But for most, this report by the world's leading scientists demonstrated the urgency of stepping up climate action. Even some of the most intransigent countries are making progress. President Donald Trump may have signalled that he plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but US cities, states, and businesses are still working towards reducing emissions. Coalitions backing the Paris Agreement account for more than half of the US population. Recent research has found that, with additional action by these sub-national players, the US could get within striking distance of its current Paris Agreement commitment. There were also some very promising developments around climate finance at COP24 . The World Bank announced that it will double its investments in climate action to US$200 billion for 2021-2025. Some of that money will be used to help the world's poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. Nine big development banks agreed to align their work to support implementation of the Paris Agreement. And a number of countries came forward with new commitments for climate finance. In the climate finance deliberations where I participated, it was evident that the finance sector has woken up to the realities of climate change. More than 500 companies and organisations with combined market capitalisation of over US$7.9 trillion, are committing to ensuring transparency and disclosure of climate-related financial risks. The economy of the future should be built on a sustainable foundation. Over 10 million people already have jobs in renewable energy, including almost half a million in India. Solar and wind are becoming economic mainstays. China has more electric vehicles on the roads than any other country and has just introduced new requirements for automakers that will ensure an even higher percentage of low emission car sales in 2019. Other countries should be trying to catch up in this sector. Next September, the UN SecretaryGeneral is holding a Climate Leader's Summit. Now that the Paris rulebook is decided, leaders around the world should already be thinking ahead about how they can step up their country's ambition at that summit to meet this challenge and reap the benefits of a sustainable and vibrant economy. Standing on this side of COP24 , the reality is that leaders have the rules, the science, and the incentives. Now they need to find the political will to step up action.

The LHK Minister, Siti Nurbaya at the Communication Meeting on the UNFCCC COP24 Outreach Outreach in Jakarta (28/12), explained several things that need to be followed up after the UNFCCC COP24 Katowice, Poland. The international climate change conference held from 2 to 15 December 2018 has produced the Katowice Cilmate Package. Katowice The Climate Package is a notebook for the implementation of Paris Agreement. With the trial being so tough that it was extended for 1 day until finally Katowice Climate Pakcage could be approved. "If we already have a basis to move, then the state party needs to do things as a follow-up," explained Siti Nurbaya. According to him, the first follow-up is further elaboration on Indonesian NDC. Minister Siti believes that it is necessary to prepare the second NDC. This is possible because there are rules. Therefore, Minister Siti asked to review the progress of the first NDC results. Based on efforts made by various parties, the government, the community and the business world in reducing emissions, Minister Siti assessed that it was good. He then asked for an identification study, whether Indonesia could move from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees in preventing global temperature rise. Subsequent follow-up, according to Minister Siti, needs to be carried out by the National Registry System (SRN) dissemination. The system that can record efforts to control climate change from various parties is expected to be well understood by the wider community. Then in order to renew the contribution of Indonesia's NDC, it is necessary to develop a long-term plan for reducing emissions until 2050. Therefore, the form of cooperation with other countries needs to be adjusted. Minister Siti also saw that with the Rulebook it was necessary to collaborate with other parties in future negotiations such as the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection (PPPA) on gender issues. The Ministry of Agriculture, BPPT, BMKG and the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration will also be invited to speak out in negotiations according to their respective fields. No less important in the future according to Minister Siti is strengthening REDD + in the steps of work, activities and institutionalization. Regarding efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Minister Siti expects a number of things. The first is to strengthen the International Tropical Peatland Center (ITPC). This is considering that peatland is a significant source of emissions. "Collect all of Indonesia's strengths and expertise by inviting international experts, and intensifying it with academic discussions, toritik and best practices", requested Minister Siti. He also requested that he follow up on cooperation, support for governance and exchange of information on peatland management. Minister Siti said that in Indonesia, Indonesia recognized its best practices in peatland management. "We must guard this position well and it must be proven," explained Minister Siti. Besides ITPC, Minister Siti also touched on the matter of managing waste and marine waste. Future perspectives, technology and community participation in waste management are very important to follow up. \</doc>

United Nations, Dec. 8 -- Noting some progress in greening the global construction industry, the United Nations environment agency (UNEP) co-released a report at the COP24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, sounding the alarm on the need for "dramatic action" to reduce the sector's greenhouse gas emissions. "It's critical we have a big change over the next couple of years in how we do buildings and construction", said Joyce Msuya, Deputy Executive Director of UNEP. "We only need to look at the current norms and quality of many buildings to see that we can do so much better," she said, emphasising that "we need to raise the bar in energy-efficient, green buildings and far better practice in construction." Currently, buildings account for close to 40 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and 36 per cent of all energy consumption. In the report, which was co-authored by the International Energy Agency (IEA), UNEP warned that "dramatic action will be needed by governments, cities and business if the global buildings and construction sector is to cut its carbon footprint in line with international agreements." Titled 'Towards a Zero-Emission, Efficient and Resilient Buildings and Construction Sector', the report was presented against the backdrop of ongoing COP24 negotiations on how to move ahead with the implementation of the climate action agreement adopted in Paris, in 2015, when 197 parties committed to limiting global warming to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. The development of new techniques, tools, products and technologies, such as heat pumps, better windows, stronger insulation, energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy and smarter design - has enabled emissions to stabilise over the past few years. There are other encouraging signs. Several property, construction, cement and steel-manufacturing firms are among the 500 companies (representing trillions of dollars in revenue) which have aligned their emission reduction targets with the Paris Agreement; and the 71-member private sector network, the World Green Building Council non-profit organisation, is advocating for all buildings to emit zero net emissions by 2050. There is huge potential to reduce the current level of emissions, but action has been too slow, environmentalists say. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, hosted by UNEP, is targeting a 30 per cent energy use improvement in the buildings and construction sector.

The opening day of COP24 Leaders Summit was marked by the celebration of Africa Day which focused on how the implementation of Africas Nationally Determined Contributions for a healthy environment can accelerate development on the continent. Africa Day, a joint initiative of the African Development Bank, African Union Commission UN Economic Commission for Africa and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), was organized, this year, around the theme, "The Africa Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Hub: Going further and faster with NDC implementation in support of Agenda 2063." Four Pan-African institutions along with the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Republic of Gabon. The Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and the African Risk Capacity (ARC) co-organized the day. Africa Day 2018 focused on how to ensure that all development partners deepen their partnerships and commitments to deliver concrete actions and resources for African countries to deliver their NDC targets and enable the imlpementation of the Paris Agreement. Highlights of the event included a high-level statement by Gabons Minister of Foreign affairs, Regis Immongault, on behalf of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, Coordinator of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). Josefa Sacko, African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture represented the chair Person of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat. A high level Ministerial panel and a Parliamentary dialogue provided a platform for detailed discussions on this years theme and Africas position at COP24 . The last segment of the Africa Day was an expert panel discussion from various technical institutions on the theme of the day. Foreign Minister Immongault noted that the outcomes of COP 24 should facilitate development in Africa. He emphasised the need to develop strong partnerships to implement the NDCs in Africa. I also extend appreciation to the Africa NDC Hub for reaching out to Partners to support Africa. In this regard, I wish to urge more Partners to come on board to support African countries in the implementation of the NDCs for the achievement of Africas commitment to the Paris Agreement, he added. Africa Union Commissioner Sacko stated that African countries remain committed to tackling climate change and its impacts. Countries in Africa continue to suffer from the adverse impacts of climate change with the costs of climate change threatening the realization of the aspirations of Agenda 2063 the Africa we want. Climate change is also partially to blame for increased migration of African youths to Europe through the deadly Mediterranean Sea due to shrinking livelihood opportunities. She further highlighted the link between climate change and conflicts in Africa as demonstrated by the Boko Haram insurgency in Western and Central Africa partly as a result of the shrinking of Lake Chad. As Parliamentarians we carry the hopes, aspirations and concerns of the peoples of Africa. The Africa Day accords us an opportunty to emphasize the need for parties to adopt concrete actions towards effective and adequate implementation of the Paris Agreement, especially in the context of the African Climate Legislation Initiative (ACLI), said Kone Dognon, Chairperson of the Pan-African Parliament Committee for Rural Economy, Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment. Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth, representing the President of the African Development Bank Group said, African countries require significant resources to meet their commitments to the Paris Agreement.. The Africa NDC Hub hosted at the African Development Bank, represents a concerted effort by development partner institutions to leverage each others comparative advantage in mobilizing resources necessary for Africa to embark on a low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathway. In a statement read on her behalf by James Murombedzi, the Officer in Charge of the African Climate Policy Centre and Executive Secretary of UNECA, Vera Songwe said: The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is implementing organizational reforms which will deepen engagement with the public and private sectors and ensure that public policy provides incentives for the private sector to contribute to the implementation of the NDCs and to take advantage of the investment opportunities offered by the transition to carbon neutral development pathways. African Heads of State and Government instituted Africa Day during COP17 in Durban. \</doc>

The Government of Canada is committed to leading on climate change action both at home and on the international stage. The Honourable Joyce Murray, Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government, shared Canadas progress at the UN Climate Change Conference COP24 where representatives from around the world are working to finalize the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement. Canada is on track to reach goals set in its Greening Government Strategy. As of March 2018, Canada had reduced emissions from its federal operations by 32% relative to 2005 levels, a 4% improvement from last years report. Canadas Greening Government Strategy was introduced in 2017. The strategy established climate and sustainability commitments for the governments operations, including a target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from federal facilities and fleets by 40% by 2030 (or earlier) and 80% by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. While in Poland, Ms. Murray met with officials from France as a follow-up on the France-Canada Climate and Environment Partnership established last April. She also met with representatives of Finland, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to discuss ways our countries can collaborate to achieve the Paris Agreements targets. \</doc>

United States, Dec. 12 -- In light of today&#8217;s 3rd anniversary of the Paris Agreement &#8211; and recognising the latest scientific urgency to achieve net-zero carbon emissions rapidly &#8211; the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) re-emphasizes its long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality in its corporate practices. The IDB joined 14 other organisations, including all 68 agencies of the United Nations, in Katowice, Poland, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), to launch a multi-organization effort at &#8220;walking the talk.&#8221; As part of this, the IDB outlined its existing and planned efforts to measure, reduce and offset its unavoidable carbon emissions. Since the IDB&#8217;s initial neutrality commitment in 2006, covering just its annual meeting at the time, the Bank&#8217;s efforts have expanded to cover its entire corporate greenhouse gas footprint &#8211; including all of its headquarters buildings in Washington, DC, 26 country offices in Latin America and the Caribbean, and two special offices in Japan and Spain. Some of the IBD&#8217;s significant steps to reduce its carbon emissions have come from lowering energy use in its offices by upgrading mechanical equipment, replacing inefficient lighting with LED bulbs, and renovating more than 100,000 square feet of office space to open layouts that take advantage of natural light. In addition, on-site solar power systems have been installed in IDB&#8217;s offices in Bahamas, Brazil, Haiti, and Jamaica as part of a plan to accelerate use of renewable energy (renewable energy credits already cover 100% of electricity use at IDB headquarters). The Bank plans to expand its roster of LEED-certified buildings. Currently, six offices are certified, two in Washington DC and four in the region (Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru and Panama). The IDB is pursuing LEED certification in Jamaica and will also do so for an office under construction in the Dominican Republic. The Bank&#8217;s main challenge is addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel. To mitigate these and other unavoidable emissions, the IDB has a robust program to invest in carbon offsets, recently supporting reforestation, clean cookstove distribution, and wind energy projects in the region.

GORD participated in COP24 to follow the progress on development of Paris Agreement Implementation Rulebook (Paris Rulebook) that took place in Katowice, Poland on 4 Dec 2018. Kishor Rajhansa (Head of Climate Change) at Global Carbon Trust (GCT), introduced to global stakeholders GORDs Voluntary Carbon Offsetting Program, the first and only of its kind in MENA region. GCT received good attention from various audiences who visited GCT stand at the Business Hub of International Emissions Trading Association (IETA). Several stakeholders wished and hoped that this initiative may possibly become prime catalyst of climate actions in MENA region, helping to raise its climate mitigation ambition to meet 1.5 deg target under Paris Agreement. GORD was the part of UNFCCCs Climate Dialogue for Sports sector in 2018 and was invited for the Sports Climate Action Launch event that took place with involvement of international sports organisations, international sports personalities, dignitaries and various stakeholders. Through a Special Report in October 2018, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has clearly given the direst warning about the catastrophic impact of Climate Change in near future. The report states that we have only 12 years in hand to take decisive action on Climate Mitigation before situation is out of our hands, and that the world must be net carbon neutral by 2050. At 24th UNFCCC Conference of Parties at Katowice, Poland the overwhelming majority of parties took extremely seriously the messages of this IPCC special report. UN Environments 2018 report on emissions gap that needs to be covered in next 12 years paints a dismal picture of where we are heading to and how much emissions world needs to reduce to meet 1.5 deg target set by Paris Agreement. Following picture shows gap between what collective Nationally Determined Contribution efforts can achieve and what is needed for 1.5 deg C target. After Paris in 2015, Conference of Parties to UNFCCC (COP) continued to prepare the package of Rules and Modalities for Paris Agreement implementation. The main objective of COP24 that took place during 4 to 14 Dec 2018 was to deliver the Paris Rulebook. The COP delivered it with an agreement of almost 200 Parties with diverse interests and contexts. With rulebook, no Party can now say that it does not know what is expected from it and use that as an excuse not to implement its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Every party and relevant stakeholder (e.g. key industry sector) must now move to decide and implement its sizable contribution for 1.5 deg goal. If these rules incorporated in Rulebook had been weak, they would have undermined the Paris Agreement, but they are not. Rules provide clarity on what is expected and will make it hard for parties to avoid their responsibilities. There are no penalties for non-compliance, but the system will ensure to what parties have done and have not done. See the L documents of Paris Rulebook here. HYPERLINK https://lnkd.in/dXjV7Ph https://lnkd.in/dXjV7Ph Whilst there is always the risk that some parties may not want to implement their responsibilities, the greater challenge will be those that find it difficult to do so and need assistance to overcome their challenges, including through capacity building. The need and processes of capacity building is clearly recognized in the Katowice package. Finance and support were key goals for developing countries and the Katowice Rulebook addresses these needs. There are provisions for analyzing the need of finance and support for the adaptation, technology transfer, capacity building, loss and damage, and response measures. All these areas are well addressed in the Katowice outcome. Overall, the mood and spirit of collaboration among Parties was positive that resulted in substantial outcome. The text adopted does not meet all the expectations of everyone, but everyone got something important for them. The outcome hints at moderate success of COP as still there are some key matters such as use of Carbon Markets into achievement of NDCs is to be decided and the Parties are required to set high level of ambition to ensure that the world is on track to meet 1.5-degree target. COP24 saw the gathering of more than 30000 people including environmental activists, non-governmental organisations, governments, industries/businesses, scientists, academics and many so many other stakeholders of diverse groups debating and conclusion on challenges and solutions lying ahead. COP24 conference center, a site of old coal mine in Katowice, was symbolic to the low-carbon future that can be built upon the burial grounds of fossil fuel. Based on GORDs understanding of core issues around the draft negotiated text on article 6 of Paris Rulebook, released during # COP24 , its team has developed a position paper.

Katowice (Poland), Dec 10 -- With four big oil and gas producers blocking 193 countries from "welcoming" an influential climate science report, five crucial days were left starting Monday to ensure that the ongoing for COP 24 UN climate talks respond to the urgency highlighted by the report that says temperatures could rise 1.5 degrees as early as 2030 - with devastating impact To do that, in addition to delivering the Paris rulebook, they'll need to send a signal they are committed to collectively raise their ambition on climate change and united on a path forward to achieve that goal, say climate negotiators. It means by December 14 there must be a clear and unambiguous outcome to that effect, a negotiator at the UN Conference of the Parties-24 ( COP-24 ) told IANS. The four big oil and gas producers -- the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait - on Saturday night had faced off against every other country in this Polish city who wanted to formally "welcome" in the UN text the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that talks about urgency and also scaled up ambition by the world. The US had even rejected the science itself, standing alone among all the world's countries in refusing to endorse the findings of the report. It was a fight over a word, but an important fight that will set the tone for this week's discussions. "What signal does it send the world if we are not able to accept the best available science," asked a delegate from a small island state late Saturday. Still, there is a ray of hope of good news. Yet concerns persist that the Paris rulebook looks too weak, especially on transparency and reporting requirements from countries, said a climate expert. The date where all countries will follow the same rulebook, with flexibility for those with limited government resources, is also a sticking point, he added. From Monday the UN says 124 ministers will descend on the conference centre this week. Their job will be to unlock these talks on crunch issues such as differentiation, finance, and enhanced ambition, reaching the political compromises needed to get the package of decisions the world needs by the end of the week. Some, like Canada's Catherine McKenna and Spain's Teresa Ribera will be expected to lead complex working groups on some of the outstanding issues to be resolved. This is a week that expects the voices of climate vulnerable countries to get progressively louder. Spain, Canada, Norway, New Zealand and perhaps Britain could also emerge as governments from developed countries pushing for a more ambitious outcome. China and India have privately indicated they could push for an ambitious outcome this week. Mayors allied to the C40 (Cities Climate Leadership Group) and business leaders from Coca Cola, IKEA, Maersk and Target will also be audible, experts believe. Good news also came during the first week of COP-24 . France and China together with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared to "cooperate closely to make this summit a defining moment to accelerate action, increase ambition and mobilize the required resources to achieve an ecological transition". The World Bank announced it will double investments in climate action to about $200 billion from 2021-2025. India's Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan signaled that the country is ready to update its nationally determined contributions or NDCs if other countries do the same, followed by the Canadian environment minister on Wednesday. The world's largest container shipping company Maersk pledged zero emissions by 2050. Volkswagen also announced that it will sell no more combustion cars after 2040 and will put the last fossil-fuel based models on the market in 2032. A WHO report says the health benefits of meeting the Paris goals outweigh costs by far. And New Zealand released a defence policy statement, identifying climate change as the country's most significant security threat.

Katowise, Poland, December 12, 2018. Central America is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world in the face of the effects of climate change. The Central American Integration System (SICA), made up of eight countries, unified a high-level political message to call for strengthening "Climate Action" in the region, strengthening the means of implementation and making financing mechanisms more flexible. adaptation and mitigation to climate change, which are easily accessible to the most vulnerable countries. The message was read in Poland, during COP 24 , by Jos Antonio Galdames Fuentes, Secretary of State, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment MiAmbiente + of Honduras, on behalf of SICA, who highlighted that it is the first time that the eight countries SICA members issue a joint statement to the COP, which emphasizes that the commitments made and the nationally determined contributions present for the Paris Agreement are not sufficient and, therefore, work together on sustainable development plans more ambitious Given the rapid increase in the temperature of the planet, the extreme effects of climate change severely affect the livelihoods of a large majority of the population in Central America and the Caribbean. It also highlights the need to "stimulate the role of non-state actors to advance climate action, with the continuous promotion of renewable energies and clean technologies in industry and transport in general, advancing to production and consumption models more that contribute to achieving the goals and indicators established in the Sustainable Development Goals (Agenda 2030) ". Likewise, they recognized the convening of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, to hold an upcoming Climate Summit in September 2019 in New York, the host city of the UN, where the commitments made in Paris will be reviewed and designed "more ambitious" sustainable development plans. It is estimated that the loss of crops due to floods and drought has left more than 3.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Central America. The loss of infrastructure, housing and productive areas represent a profound damage to the economies of the region, with high recovery and reconstruction costs, but above all because these resources should be oriented towards integral rural development and the offer of opportunities for well-being. of the population. \</doc>

Dec. 11 -- On 11 December 2018, the European Commission hosted the 6th EU Energy Day within the margins of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. As part of the programme, an in-depth discussion was held on the Coal Regions in Transition Initiative. Launched in 2016 under the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, its aim is to address the specific social and economic concerns of regions relying on coal mining as the main source of economic activity and employment. Speakers included Miguel Arias Canete, European Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action, Jerzy Buzek, Chair of European Parliament ITRE Committee, Members of the European Parliament Maria Spyraki and Florent Marcellesi, Markku Markkula, First Vice-President of the EU Committee of the Regions, Grzegorz Tobiszowski, Deputy Minister of Energy of Poland, Izabela Domagala, Member of the Board of Silesia Voivodship and other participants. Commissioner Arias Canete said: The transition to a more sustainable future has to be fair and should leave no region and no citizen behind. All Europeans should benefit. Our coal regions in transition initiative helps European countries, regions, communities and workers to the take on the challenge of the required economic diversification of the clean energy transition. We will support them with EU funds but it is also necessary for private money and new investors to come to coal regions to be part of this transition. That is why the EU is also mobilizing international business and finance leaders, including international financial institutions, to support coal regions. Discussions focused on progress made on the EU Coal regions in transition project launched by the European Commission. Over the past 18 months, 6 Country Teams have been launched bringing together experts in energy and climate policy, regional policy, employment, research and development and in structural reforms in order to work with pilot coal regions in Slovakia, Poland, Greece, Romania, Czechia and Spain. The multi-stakeholder Platform set up last year to manage the project has brought almost 300 stakeholders to each of its meetings to discuss transition strategies, projects and best practices. 13 coal regions are already benefiting from direct support and tailor-made assistance to ensure they can maximise the use of EU funds and support tools available in the process of transition. In addition, the EU's Cohesion Policy is also helping regions achieve economic transformation by building on their competitive strengths, embracing innovation and achieving decarbonisation.

Between October 22 and 24, Colombia participated in the Preparatory Meeting (PreCOP) of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ). The PreCOP is a space in which high-level representatives of governments participate to identify solutions to the most complex technical and political issues of the climate change negotiations ahead of the next COP, which will take place in December in Katowice, Poland. The meeting focused on the expected results of the COP24 : the adoption of the Paris Agreement regulation and the political commitment of the countries to improve their current commitments on climate change, as a result of the Talanoa Dialogue. The challenge of reaching an agreement in the COP with the little remaining time of negotiation and the divergences that persist between some negotiation groups was evident. Colombia, as president pro tempore of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (Ailac), actively participated in the discussions, positioning the group's views and presented proposals that could bring positions from different countries. The PreCOP was also a key space to explore strategies and points of agreement with negotiators from other regional groups. This meeting is held two weeks after the publication of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the implications of the increase in global temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. Consequently, one of the messages reiterated in the session was the need to materialize the unprecedented transformation in the development model that science demands to prevent the planet from reaching a point of no return. The results of the COP24 will be fundamental for Colombia, as a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, for which mitigation and adaptation represents an opportunity for environmental, economic and social well-being. \</doc>

When ministers concluded negotiations on Sunday morning, 30 hours beyond the allotted time frame, a final deal on climate action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in Katowice, Poland, was to some extent achieved. The Katowice Climate Package is the name given to the basket of issues that have been negotiated and agreed upon. Together this makes up the majority of the rulebook by which the Paris Agreement can be implemented by countries around the world. The key elements that were agreed upon include how countries will both define and provide information on national climate action under the Paris Agreement, how to measure cumulative global efforts by 2023, as well as a process to mobilize financing to support this action. Yet several issues remained contentious, such as rules for carbon markets and trading, referred to under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which have been deferred until next year. Some were also critical that the text was not forceful enough in demanding more urgent and ambitious action. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres returned in the final days of the conference, reinforcing the message that climate change is the number one priority for the United Nations. In his speech he said We must beat climate change before it beats us. It is a race we can win. It is a race we must win. Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary General and Director of UNDPs Policy and Programme Bureau, highlighted how UNDPs work is driving the climate action agenda through the support it provides across 140 countries: At UNDP we focus on the alignment between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that climate change not only threatens development outcomes but ambitious climate action can provide opportunities to unlock economic and social gains. Throughout the two weeks of negotiations, UNDP shared its country-level programming experiences through numerous events, all aimed at advocating for three key ingredients needed to scale up countries action to meet their national pledges, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This is necessary in order to ensure the urgency and ambition needed to implement the Paris Agreement. Some of the highlights were as follows: First, foster public-private partnership to scale up finance. With estimates suggesting 85 to 90 percent of Paris Agreement funding needs to come from the private sector, UNDP demonstrated ways to use limited public funds to unlock private investments. For example, together with the World Bank, UNDP developed and implemented the first ever Investment COP, convening investors and public sector actors to identify country-level business opportunities that advance climate action. In addition, initiatives such as Indonesias green sukuk the first of its kind sovereign Islamic green bond provided a prime example of how to bring additional, private finance into the climate change sphere. Second, enhance adaptation. The recent IPCC report indicating the catastrophic impacts of our warming world put pressure on negotiators to not only take urgent mitigation action, but also to prioritize adaptation. UNDP engaged in over 15 adaptation related events throughout the two weeks of COP, often with other UN agencies such as FAO and UN Environment. Two flagship adaptation reports were launched, reflecting on years of country experiences in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Africa. Third, leverage nature-based solutions. UNDP celebrated the 10th anniversary of the UN-REDD initiative, and advocated the need to engage non-state actors, particularly indigenous peoples, to leverage the benefits of forest and land use management, more broadly known, along with other approaches, as nature-based solutions. In this regard, a key outcome of the conference was the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, putting in place a formal channel for indigenous peoples views and interests to be communicated to the UNFCCC process. The outcomes of COP24 are lauded as an impressive achievement, given the scale of work negotiators were tasked with over these two weeks; yet, the work has just begun. With this new rulebook in place, it is now the responsibility of countries, with support from organizations like UNDP, to turn their pledges into concrete adaptation and mitigation action. This includes revisiting their national climate pledges by 2020 with the aim to increase ambition in order to meet the Paris goals. This will require mobilizing political will and leadership, becoming the focus of the SGs Summit in September 2019. UNDP welcomes the progress made thus far, and welcomes the challenge and opportunity to deliver on Paris and Katowice, now and well into the future. \</doc>

India, Dec. 9 -- Extremely tough to have a complete and robust, fair and ambitious rulebook within the stipulated time, Parties also need to revise their NDCs by 2020. The first week of the twenty-fourth meeting of the Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended with slow progress on all agenda items and disagreement on a number of issues. Parties have the mandate of completing the rule-book for implementation of Paris Agreement, which kicks off in 2020. The agenda items relate to differentiation across rulebook, provision and review of financial sources, guidance on clarity on nationally determined contributions (NDCs), stock-take of collective progress of climate actions (Global Stocktake), reporting on climate action and support in the form of Enhanced Transparency framework, new market mechanisms, anchoring of loss and damage, finance on adaptation, technology and capacity building. Even though there is a sense of urgency seen among various Parties to finish the rule-book, the wide disagreement on the form, modalities and procedures of the agenda items has disrupted the positive momentum set out by COP President Micha? Kurtyka and other dignitaries in the opening ceremony of COP24 . This implies that the ministers in the coming week would require superior diplomatic capabilities and spirit of compromise to discuss landing zones and convergence areas for final outcomes to be adopted. The greater challenge is to create not only an outcome document but a rule-book that is robust and fair and sets in motion ambitious climate action from 2020 onwards. Till now, there has been little discussion on raising ambition and setting timelines for it. Contested Issues Finance: It is the decider for make-or-break outcomes of COP 24 . Article 9.5 mandates developed countries to biennially communicate ex-ante information on the projected levels of public financial resources to developing countries. Developed countries, including the United States, European Union, Norway and Canada opposed any review of the information, only encouraged discussions around when and where the information be made available and have instead pushed the developing countries for their information and review of contribution of finance. Developed countries also refused to discuss process for setting a new collective goal on finance from a floor of $100 billion per year by 2025 (as under the Paris Agreement) offering to delay the discussion on this issue. Equity and Differentiation: The Umbrella Group comprising the developed countries including the US have opposed bifurcated understanding of equity in developed and developing. This they have particularly opposed in the context of ex-ante provision of information related to NDCs. Developed countries have also pushed for mitigation, as a necessary scope of NDCs. In the issue of Global Stocktake (which under Paris Agreement talks of taking science and equity into consideration), while G-77 and China have proposed the indicator approach (indicators such as historical responsibility, carbon space) for operationalisation of equity, developed countries have opposed the process.' Reporting on NDCs: The current set of NDCs are vastly heterogenous. There is need for clarity and guidance on standards to make the NDCs standardised for easier assessment and comparability. However agreeing on common time frames, baselines, scope of NDCs, technical duration of NDCs, are issues of disagreements. Flexibility in transparency: While developed countries have pushed for flexibility (less stringent requirements) in reporting of climate action and support in relation to least developed countries and island states, developing countries including India and China have staunchly opposed categorisation within countries and have pushed for flexibility for all developing countries. Adaptation and Loss and Damage: Developed countries have opposed provision of finance in implementation of adaptation communications while developing countries have sought parity of mitigation and adaptation finance. Pre-2020 actions: At the session on the technical part of the stocktake on the pre-2020 implementation and ambition, India, China, and Brazil expressed concerns over the pre-2020 ambition gap of developed countries, both in terms of emissions reductions needed and over the finance gap. EU while stressed on the need for good reporting practices for all countries for better review. IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degree C: Even though Parties themselves decided on the need for a special report on global warming of 1.5 degree C and requested IPCC to come out with this report, how should the IPCC's Report be reflected in the COP 24 outcome has emerged as another contested issue. In the first week, many countries stated they want to change 'welcome' the IPCC report instead of 'noting' it.'' The work on other agenda items such as market mechanisms have been even slower owing to range of technical elements such as corresponding adjustments, share of proceeds, relation between mitigation outcomes and sustainable development mechanism (as described under Paris Agreement. In the coming week, more of substantive discussions rather than conceptual propositions and reiteration of positions need to happen. Additionally, in the light of scientific evidence and the inadequacy of climate actions, COP 24 decision must also require Parties to update their NDCs by 2020. On a welcome note, Canada, Vietnam and Jamaica have pledged to increase climate ambition by 2020. Other countries must also follow suit.

NEW DELHI: Forging a common ground ahead of the UN climate conference, negotiators of BASIC (comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China) group on first day of their meet on Monday listed their priorities under the Paris Agreement Work Programme which will ensure implementation of the global climate deal after 2020.The programme is expected to be adopted at the UN conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland next month."Stand of developing countries will reflect in the BASIC ministerial joint statement on Tuesday, highlighting the position of the Group on the way forward for Paris Agreement Work Programme and COP24 ," said an official.The negotiations will be focused on finalising rules or modalities and guidelines for various elements of Paris Agreement including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), adaptation, transparency framework, global stock-take (GST), compliance mechanism, climate finance, technology framework and capacity building at COP24 (December 2-14).A note circulated during the BASIC meeting on Monday reflected the developing countries' stand on all these key issues.Referring to individual agenda items under the Paris Agreement Work Programme, the negotiators underlined that the adaptation efforts under it should be given sufficient attention reflecting the "adaptation-mitigation parity" that the nations reached under the global deal three years ago."Adaptation plays a crucial role in helping developing countries deal with the significant additional burden borne from dealing with the repercussions of historical GHG emissions," said the official.On global stock-take, he said, "Equity is an important component for preserving the collective and facilitative nature of the GST. Therefore, a commonly agreed guidance to operationalise 'equity' needs to be designed in the GST. The tool will develop guidelines for a negotiating text."The BASIC group, formed in 2009, has been playing a proactive and constructive role in international climate change negotiations.

India, Dec. 14 -- The draft negotiating text needs to acknowledge that budgetary processes in developed countries are proving to be problematic The question of finance has always been the major sticking point in climate negotiations. It is usually the last item to be resolved before any consensus decision is adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. At Paris, developed countries agreed to provide US $100 billion of new and additional finance each year, by 2020, to developing countries. Ongoing negotiations in Katowice at the 24 th COP offer an opportunity to review progress towards this goal and set new ones. Last week, the Standing Committee of Finance submitted a report to the negotiators that estimated that $55 billion in climate finance was raised by developed countries in 2016. Not only is this short of where we need to be overall, the report also noted that only around a quarter of this amount went towards adaptation. The Paris decision called for a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of finance-this call is not being taken seriously thus far. This week in Katowice, draft negotiating text emerged on the question of "long-term climate finance". In theory, this should set new targets for climate finance beyond 2020. Since the estimates of the costs of climate action in developing countries are well beyond $100 billion a year (the cost of adaptation along is estimated at $140-300 billion annually), the new target would ideally be significantly scaled up. Disappointingly, the text has no mention of any such new target. It confines itself to noting "progress" on the $100 billion target and urges developed countries to meet this goal. It does urge more public funds for adaptation, which is promising, but this is about as far as it goes in recognising the serious issues at the heart of financial debates. The text's 'solution' to the shortfall is to decide that there will be more technical workshops and ministerial consultations on long-term finance, without acknowledging that previous such efforts have not seen enough progress. The text also makes reference to the need for countries to strengthen their 'domestic enabling environments' and 'policy frameworks' to attract climate finance. This is part of a long-standing trend suggesting that the barrier to more climate finance is the lack of adequate policy frameworks in developing countries. What is needed in this text is an acknowledgement that the primary problem is the budgetary processes in developed countries. Politicians and bureaucrats in developed countries are not able to adequately convey to their domestic stakeholders the importance of earmarking climate finance to meet their Paris promises. This is why, during the recent debate within the Board of the Green Climate Fund regarding replenishing the Fund's resources, there were repeated references to the concerns of tax-payers in developed countries. The same policy-makers have so far been unable to create robust institutions which guarantee a predictable amount of finance for climate action in developing countries. Hence, a $3 billion promise on climate finance made under the Obama administration has been summarily broken by the Trump administration. If negotiators want to take an indirect approach to scaling up finance, they should focus any future technical work or political consultation on the question of "strengthening budgetary processes and domestic enabling environments and policy frameworks in developed countries to raise new and additional climate finance to enable climate action in developing countries." This should be allied to a new quantified goal for long-term finance. Text on the other critical finance-related element of the 'Katowice package' - the rules regarding reporting on finance-is still awaited. The shortfalls have been covered in previous versions of the negotiating text. Resolving these will be crucial to determining how finance is accounted for-to prevent re-branding of pre-existing development finance as 'climate finance' and to properly distinguish between different financing instruments such as loans and grants, among other issues. Discussions last week in Katowice were mostly conducted by technical domain experts. Over the past two days, there has been a transition to ministerial-level discussions, especially on the tough issues such as finance. It remains to be seen whether this infusion of political presence will result in the accumulation of enough political capital to find consensus on this stubbornly irresolvable issue.

India, Dec. 14 -- With the final Katowice decision yet to come, it is unlikely that longer term issues will be addressed here With some 36 hours to go to the end of the 24 th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland, it is the endgame of the push towards a Paris Rulebook. At the stocktaking plenary chaired by the Polish President of the COP, Michael Kurtyka, negotiators reported on the state of various elements of a potential Katowice decision. In the words of one negotiator, "Talks have progressed. issues have crystallised. Posturing goes on, but progress has to be eventually made." A final draft of the Katowice decision is expected soon. It is likely to provide detailed rules, modalities and guidance for the reporting requirements created in the Paris Agreement-commonly referred to as the Paris Rulebook. Importantly, the draft will have some decision text on all elements of the Rulebook - mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, transparency, and the global stocktake. The fear that rules on some items, such as finance (which is very important to developing countries), would be permanently postponed, has not come to pass. However, some sticking points on longer term issues are unlikely to be addressed here, and will be pushed for resolution to next year's conference. Key among these is the issue of what to do with the Special Report on 1.5degC prepared by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change-a report that the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait were reluctant to "welcome". It is now clearer that the debate around whether to 'welcome' or 'note' the report was largely about optics - there seem to be nations other than the four named above who are uncomfortable with the significant emissions reductions that the IPCC recommends. This reluctance to take the IPCC seriously also means that the decision text on 'pre-2020 ambition' is unlikely to be particularly strong. The phrase refers to the mounting demand for all countries to update their self-determined emissions targets as soon as possible, instead of waiting for 2020 (which the Paris Agreement allows). Instead, the decision is expected to have some inoffensive language that does not block the possibility of countries raising their ambition, while failing to actively urge countries to do so. The text is anticipated to be a little stronger on the question of finance, particularly by urging developed countries to deliver on their promise in Paris to raise $100 billion of climate finance each year by 2020. This is a much-needed push-the Standing Committee of Finance estimates that the total amount raised in 2016 was just $55 billion. However, the draft decision is unlikely to call for increased finance after 2020. Considering that the costs of climate action in developing countries are already well beyond $100 billion a year, it is disappointing that the process to update the long-term finance goal will not begin this year. Despite not reaching consensus on a long-term vision, negotiators seemed to have ironed out the essentials of the reporting requirements under the Paris Agreement. There is likely to be consensus on what information is to be reported, how often, by whom, and what flexibility or support will be made available to enable countries to report. Achieving this consensus is no small thing, which is probably why one negotiator declared that they would be happy to formalise the text as it stands today. This is, of course, unlikely to happen.

United Nations, Dec. 4 -- During the UN COP24 Climate Change Conference grand opening, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told over 150 world leaders gathered for climate action that 'we are in deep trouble' and asked decision-makers to focus on four key things, stepping up climate action, according to a solid plan, with more funding, as a smart investment in the future of the planet. The two-week 24th conference in Katowice, Poland, of the parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), on Monday saw the high-level grand opening. It marks the deadline for the 197 parties that signed the Convention, to adopt guidelines for the implementation of the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. In the French capital, three years ago, countries collectively agreed to keep global temperature rises to no more than 2degC above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, to limit the rise to 1.5degC. Now, in Poland, they have to agree on how they will achieve this collectively. "We cannot fail in Katowice," said UN chief Guterres. Kicking off the event, along with several other high-level representatives, he highlighted four key messages for the thousands of representatives of the world's nations, non-profit organisations, UN agencies, and private sector companies gathered in Katowice, that included, "We need more action and more ambition, Implementation guidelines are essential to build trust among nations, Adequate funding of climate action will be 'central' and Climate action makes social and economic sense."

France welcomes the adoption of the implementing rules of the Paris Agreement as well as the conclusions of the Talanoa dialogue, which called for bringing commitments and objectives closer together at COP24 in Katowice. These rules make the Agreement fully operational, adopted in Paris in 2015 by 195 countries. "I salute the agreement reached tonight. It is indispensable for the concrete, and irreversible, implementation of the Paris Agreement: but the essential is not what shines, but what lasts. This agreement is a key step in achieving the objectives set at COP 21. It is obviously not a success, but it sets a course. From now on, the fear of going back is erased. We are lucid, much remains to be done. But we are determined: in a difficult context, while some did not hide their skepticism, we stood firm; in this, this agreement constitutes a victory of multilateralism over isolationism; more than anything, we reminded that in the face of the climate emergency, we will never falter. Said Franois de Rugy. "Our action must continue at national, European and international level, but the three essential elements for reaching a satisfactory agreement have been achieved: trust, solidarity and ambition. The Paris Agreement is our road map, our social contract for the 21st century. Without implementing rules agreed by all parties, he was threatened. The spirit of the Agreement is now preserved and enforcement tools are adopted. We must now continue to act and put the ecological transition truly at the heart of public policy. Reacted Brown Poirson. The objectives set by France are achieved: The finalization of the rules of application of the Paris Agreement allowing its full and immediate implementation: these universal rules, solidarity and ambitiously respect the spirit of the agreement to the letter from Paris. The mobilization of financing supporting climate action. The call for upward revision of the ambition for nationally determined contributions by 2020, thanks to the results of the Talanoa dialogue: this revision is necessary to halt the rise in temperatures to + 1.5 C as recalled in the latest IPCC report. These objectives were based on three pillars: trust, solidarity, ambition. 1st pillar: Trust The adopted implementing rules guarantee trust between parties: The reduction of CO2 emissions: the adopted guidelines are universal and apply to each country. Adaptation to climate change: a system gathering information on the vulnerability of countries, their priorities for action, and the efforts made, will be put in place. The enhanced transparency framework: the greenhouse gas emissions inventory, the biennial climate reports and their review will be done in a format common to both developed and developing countries. 2nd pillar: solidarity The result achieved improves the predictability of support to developing countries. At the end of 2020, it foresees the definition of the future financial objective that will replace 100M after 2025. It sends a strong signal concerning the reorientation of financial flows, beyond public funding alone. In addition, the developed countries continued to mobilize, with new financial announcements. France contributed to this effort with a contribution of 35 million to two funds targeting adaptation in the most vulnerable countries. 3rd pillar: ambition COP24 recognizes the IPCC special report of 1.5 C. It reaffirms the role of science and the IPCC, the finalization of the special report, and the follow-up to the work of the UNFCCC. The Talanoa dialogue was an opportunity to take stock of the implementation of the commitments of the countries. The conclusions of the dialogue call on countries to raise the ambition of their commitments to be aligned with the 1.5 C target. France fully played its role of guarantor of the spirit of the Paris agreement through the strong governmental mobilization (with three trips by the Minister of State and the Secretary of State Brune Poirson to Poland to participate in the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Segment and the Ministerial on Financing) as well as that of the French delegation. France notably took the initiative of a declaration, published on December 12, launching a strong call at the end of this COP to raise the ambition of the commitments of the countries. She led the consultations on behalf of the EU with Turkey, notably through Secretary of State Brune Poirson. It has partly solved the issue of mobilizing public funding. The adoption of the rules of the Paris agreement at this COP24 will now allow to focus on the action and on the levers to be always more ambitious. France will continue to be very mobilized throughout 2019 to amplify its action and cooperation with its partners through the next edition of One Planet Summit, March 14 in Nairobi, the French presidency of the G7, which will begin January 1, 2019, and the UN Secretary-General's Summit on Climate Change, in September 2019: in this framework, the mission entrusted by Antonio Guterres to the President of the Republic, as well as to the Jamaican Prime Minister, will allow France continue to mobilize public and private funding for climate action. \</doc>

Non-state and subnational actors have so far played a decisive role in action on climate, but they often face unsurmountable obstacles. At the COP 24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, on 2-14 December 2018, the president of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), Luca Jahier, stressed how urgent it was to tackle climate change and underlined the fact that Europe needed to embrace a new mechanism for sustainability that included multi-stakeholder governance. "When we look at where we are today," said Mr Jahier, "seeing how strong the disconnect is between the absolute urgency to act now and the slow pace in which the governments are moving or even regressing in some cases, we understand how important it is for others to assume leadership and demonstrate the strong determination and huge potential from the bottom-up movement." Sending a clear message at COP 24 , the EESC president highlighted the absolute necessity of urgent climate action: "We either invest in concrete action against climate change or we will have to bear serious consequences. It will be too late to save our planet and our future generations. We need to involve civil society. We have to act now and we have to do it quickly!" It is essential to embrace a new EU governance structure on climate action and sustainability by adopting a coordinated and multi?stakeholder approach. "Europe must be sustainable or it will simply cease to be," declared Mr Jahier, adding that only by combining efforts from local communities, non?governmental and civil society organisations, businesses, researchers and multi-level governments would it be possible to spur robust climate action and effect positive change and thus speed up both low-carbon development and sustainable development. "Climate action must become the new 'business as usual' and must involve all actors in the transformation," Mr Jahier went on to note. "Nobody must be left behind. We cannot develop solutions without including the voices of those who are most impacted and vulnerable." The EESC delegation at COP 24 also included EESC vice-president for communication Isabel Cao and EESC members Stefan Back, Rudy De Leeuw, Tellervo Kyl-Harakka-Ruonala, Cillian Lohan and Mindaugas Maciulevi?ius. They discussed the vital contribution of bottom-up initiatives and how to fund climate action with representatives of civil society and other organisations from all over the world. Permanent involvement of grass-roots organisations These non-state and subnational actors face many difficulties when it comes to stepping up climate action. For this reason, the EESC has called for a "European Dialogue on Non-State Climate Action" to strengthen such climate action by European non-state organisations. Multi-stakeholder dialogue, policy instruments and toolkits, for instance through the International Climate Governance Coalition (ICGC), could help their climate action to take place worldwide. Funding a sustainable Europe In order to guarantee the appropriate funding needed to achieve the transition to a zero-carbon economy and a sustainable Europe by 2050, we need to support projects that can unite Europe's strengths in the interests of workers, businesses and all Europeans. The EESC has recently proposed a finance-climate pact for high-quality jobs. The aim is to redirect the money that could otherwise bring about a new financial bubble towards the fight against climate change and the real economy, providing a new roadmap and an integrated plan. In the words of Mr De Leeuw, author of the EESC opinion: "40% of the EU budget should be devoted to the fight against climate change and its consequences from the environmental, economic and social perspective." It is important not only to provide financial support, but also to make existing financing mechanisms accessible for non-state climate actors. "We need to unlock more and better climate action by shifting the approach to climate finance access," said Mr Lohan, who drafted the EESC opinion that will be put to the vote at this week's plenary session. He went on to conclude: "It is crucial to develop and adapt financial mechanisms, provide access to information and knowledge sharing on sources of finance, adapt finance allocation criteria to the specific needs of local actors and, finally, propose a strategy for financing micro-projects." \</doc>

United Nations, Dec. 11 -- Businesses across the world should no longer be viewed solely as greenhouse gas emissions culprits, but more as indispensable partners for climate action, who stand to increase profits from "going green". That was the key message as the United Nations COP24 climate change conference went into its second week in Katowice, Poland. For years, sectors such as construction, transport, farming and retailing, have had the finger pointed at them for being major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally and for putting profit ahead of environmental protection. But increasingly, new technologies and models are transforming the private sector so that business leaders no longer have to choose between making money and taking better care of the planet. This is one of the key issues being discussed here at the COP24 conference, where negotiations are continuing on the implementation of the climate action agreement adopted in Paris, in 2015, when 197 parties committed to try and limit global warming to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. "We are calling on all companies across sectors and regions, to set their science-based targets to a new level of ambition, one that aligns with the 1.5degC target," said Lise Kingo, who heads the UN Global Compact, a network of 9,500 small and large private companies which have committed to invest more in sustainable development. Speaking at a press conference at COP24 , along with the heads of Maersk - the Danish global shipping company - as well as US confectionary giant Mars, and the French-based water and waste management conglomerate, Suez, she stressed that "this is the only way we can reach the ambition of the Paris Agreement and the UN sustainable goals by 2030". According to the Global Compact, nearly half of the Fortune 500 list of leading US corporations, have set clear energy targets or greenhouse gas reduction goals. Moreover, in 2016, 190 of those companies captured a total of US$3.7 billion in savings thanks to their emissions reduction measures. 1000 solutions to protect the planet while making money To make it easier for the private sector to adopt environmentally-friendly solutions while also boosting profits, one NGO - the Solar Impulse Foundation - has endeavoured to gather together 1,000 solutions already in operation, and vet them for their positive environmental impact and their profitability before presenting them to governments and the private sector at large. "This is where can make a big difference for the protection of the environment. showing that it is profitable, that people can create jobs and make money with it," said the founder of the foundation, Bertrand Piccard, who was also the first person ever to complete a round-the-world flight powered only by solar energy, in 2016. Seeking to "bridge the gap between ecology and economy", the 1,000 efficient solutions initiative was launched over a year ago and, so far, more than 1,500 companies have joined, with over 600 projects in the pipeline. So far, 58 solutions having already received the Solar Impulse Efficient Label on sustainability and profitability. "The point I'm trying to make is that the biggest industrial market and financial opportunity of the century is in transforming the old devices, systems and infrastructures which are inefficient and polluting, into efficient and clean and much more profitable industrial processes, devices, systems, technologies and solutions," Mr. Piccard told UN News in an interview at COP24 . "Energy - if they make it locally with sun, with wind, with biomass, with waves, with hydroelectricity on a small river - would allow them to develop their wealth, their social stability and peace. They would not need to fight for energy, as they would produce it themselves," he explained, acknowledging that such a shift would require an initial investment by an external entity willing to share the profits with the communities. "Today we are seeing that the most profitable solutions need a little bit more upfront investment, and afterwards, they bring much more money back," noted Mr. Piccard. "Take electric buses: an electric bus is just a little bit more expensive to buy than a diesel bus, but over ten years, which is the usual lifespan of a bus, if it's electric, it brings about $400,000 in savings." Along with the construction and buildings sector, as well as fossil-fuel energy producers, the fashion industry is often criticized for wasteful, polluting and highly unsustainable practices. To course-correct, on Monday, at COP24 , dozens of leading companies in the fashion industry - including Adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap, Hugo Boss, H&#38;M, Levi Strauss &#38; Co., Puma, Inditex - which owns brands like Zara and Bershka, as well as retailer Target, signed the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, under the auspices of the UN Climate Change Convention secretariat, UNFCCC. "The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action," said UNFCCC chief Patricia Espinosa. The document, open for others to join, and aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, presents a vision for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues to be addressed every step of the way in the life of fashion products, including: the use of environmentally sustainable materials, low-carbon transport; consumer awareness-raising; 'scalable' solutions through resource and political mobilisation; and exploring ways to extend the life expectancy of fashion products as well as recycling possibilities. "I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow," noted Ms Espinosa.

The IPCC special report issued last October has once again alerted us to the climate emergency: it is still possible to limit the rise in global warming, but this implies immediate transformations in all sectors of society and around the world. It is in this context that the 24th Climate Conference ( COP24 ) was opened in Katowice, Poland, as a key step for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and for the enhancement of the States' ambition. now until 2020. "The Paris agreement set the goal of keeping global warming below 2 C, or even 1.5 C, compared to the pre-industrial level. The latest IPCC report sounds the alarm: the current commitments of the signatory countries of the agreement lead to an overall global warming of more than 3 C by 2010 compared to 1990. It is therefore urgent to act, and this is the challenge of COP24 that has just opened today, "said Franois de Rugy. "There are not two planets and two worlds. The commitments made in Katowice will give rise to concrete decisions in France to achieve ecological transition because we are already experiencing the damage of climate change. France therefore intends to mobilize all its partners to collectively meet the objectives of the Paris agreement and give them the means to achieve them "added Brune Poirson. Objective 1: Adopt the rules of application of the Paris Agreement COP24 must indeed allow the adoption of the rules of application of the Paris Agreement which will guide the national action and the international cooperation of the Parties to the agreement (currently 183 countries and the European Union). These application rules include: the development of tools to assess the effectiveness of emission reduction and climate change adaptation efforts, their coherence with the objectives of the agreement, possibly correcting them; climate finance; the developed countries pledged at COP 21 to financially support the ecological transition in developing countries. Objective 2: Enhance the commitments of signatory countries Initiated at COP21 and organized by the Fiji Islands Presidency, the Talanoa Dialogue brings together States and members of civil society to discuss good practices to achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement. This high-level dialogue time at COP24 aims to: to collectively assess progress made in implementing the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement based on the latest IPCC report; lay the groundwork for an upward revision of state commitments, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), by 2020. \</doc>

United Nations, Dec. 13 -- With roadblocks continuing at the COP24 climate change conference over how to implement the historic 2015 Paris Agreement, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres returned to Poland, to challenge the more than 100 Government leaders gathered in Katowice to find consensus and 'finish the job.' "In my opening statement to this conference one week ago...I warned that climate change is running faster than we are and that Katowice must - in no uncertain terms - be a success, as a necessary platform to reverse this trend," said Secretary-General Guterres. Since 2 December, the conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with one key objective, adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the 2015 Paris Agreement, when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2 degreeC - and as close as possible to 1.5 degree - above pre-industrial levels. With only three days left at the conference for the negotiations, the UN chief regretted that "despite progress in the negotiating texts, much remains to be done". On Wednesday, given the complex state of discussions, the Polish Presidency of COP24 proposed a text to act as a "new basis for negotiations". "Key political issues remain unresolved," said Mr Guterres. "This is not surprising-we recognise the complexity of this work. But we are running out of time," he warned, referring to the alarming special report on global warming issued in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "Over the last 10 days", he said, addressing the country delegations which are locked in negotiations, "many of you have worked long, hard hours and I want to acknowledge your efforts. But we need to accelerate those efforts to reach consensus, if we want to follow-up on the commitments made in Paris." He called on negotiators to boost their ambition, with regards to "predictable and accessible financial flows for the economic transition towards a low-emission and climate-resilient world." The Secretary-General reminded the audience that developed countries had a financial obligation to support the efforts of developing countries, as established by the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), under which the Paris Agreement falls, and which was signed in 1992, more than 25 years ago. "It's very difficult to explain to those suffering from the effects of climate change that we have not managed to find predictable support for the actions that must be taken," he remarked. Mr Guterres hailed various financial announcements made since the beginning of COP24 , including by the World Bank, multilateral development banks, and the private sector. However, he urged developed nations to "scale up their contributions to jointly mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020", as laid out three years ago in Paris.

Katowice (Poland): Climate finance is emanating to be the bone of contention in the developed versus developing scrimmage at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) being held here. On Saturday, the last day of the technical phase of negotiations, discussions on climate finance came to a standstill, with countries "not being able to reach consensus" on various aspects.An analysis of the draft negotiation texts, released by the ad hoc working group on the Paris Agreement (APA) on Saturday, reflects a disagreement on both article 9.5 and 9.7 of the agreement. While article 9.5 makes it mandatory for developed countries to biennially communicate finances it will shell out to assist developing countries like India, the latter focuses on subsequent accounting of the finance provided to developing countries.The draft text on 9.7 indicates that the developed countries are expecting the developing nations to do the same, which do not seem to agree. "Instead of agreeing to submit information on how much money will provide, the developed world is demanding developing countries to put money on the table. Developed countries are also blocking progress on how to transparently count the money they are obligated to give," says Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change at ActionAid International.The draft reveals a dissent on developing world's demand on reporting 'the grant equivalent value' which refers to the exact amount of money stays in a country for climate action. There have been instances when some donor countries "double-counted" the value of a development project which frustrated India and other 134 developing nations which constitute the G77 negotiating group.What the developing countries want from COP24 is the reassurance that they will receive the money developed countries committed to provide, in order to implement the Paris Agreement at home. Says Eddy Perez, international policy analyst at Climate Action Network, Canada, " More grants are needed in developing countries. In the case of loans, the recipients want to know the exact information on what part of the loan is grant equivalent. This information is crucial for them to design their nationally determined contributions."Taking the old stance of the United Nations, the developed nations are denying to acknowledge 'loss and damage' as a stand-alone pillar of climate action. In every draft text of the negotiations, the developed world has refused to broach the subject.The fifth assessment report of the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change's (IPCC) warns of more climate-related catastrophe, like deadly heatwaves for India and Pakistan. Four months ago, Kerala witnessed heavy floods which killed over 400 people. At such times, having an indicative financial support from rich nations for loss and damage becomes imperative. Adds Singh, "Helping the victims of climate change is the need of the hour but once again, the issue continues to be pushed back." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

The Ask The Expert series features the leading specialists who work at the Commonwealth Secretariat or on key Commonwealth programmes. In this edition, Bilal Anwar, General Manager of the Climate Finance Access Hub shares insights on how the Commonwealth is delivering climate finance to help communities tackle the impacts of climate change. He spoke from the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. What is the Climate Finance Access Hub (CFAH) and how does it help Commonwealth countries achieve their climate ambitions? The CFAH is the initiative by the Commonwealth to support the climatically-vulnerable countries of the Commonwealth in building their technical capacities and improving the flow of finance for projects to address climate change. Under its long-term technical assistance programme, experts are embedded in national ministries, assisting them to translate their climate ambitions into actions, and mobilise the climate finance required to implement projects. What makes CFAH unique innovative is that at it is country-driven, and the technical assistance we provide helps to fill the capacity gaps and strengthen national institutions, along with development and structuring of mitigation and adaptation projects. And that's why in the short period of its operational life, the demand for CFAH services is high and we have been able make some remarkable progress. The CFAH has an active technical assistance programme in eight countries and already mobilised 4.1 million with another 207 million in the pipeline. \</doc>

Four banks joined ING in pledging to align their loan portfolios with global climate goals. This milestone pledge came as the worlds biggest gathering on climate, known as COP24 , starts in Poland this week. Together, ING and BBVA, BNP Paribas, Socit Gnrale and Standard Chartered have a combined loan book of 2.4 trillion. From Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi, the banks have joined ING in committing to measure the climate alignment of our lending portfolios. The aim is to steer them towards the well-below two-degree goal of the Paris Agreement. ING initiated this in September when we announced the Terra approach, which were co-creating with the 2? Investing Initiative. Weve intensified our dialogue with other banks since then, as we believe that an industry-wide standard will increase transparency and will make the industry much more effective at fighting climate change. Todays news is the next step. Im really proud that ING has led the way in starting this movement and that we found other banks ready and willing to join us, said CEO Ralph Hamers. Well continue to work on adding more names to the list, as we believe that banks have an important role to play in scaling and accelerating the transition toward a climate-resilient world. The banks pledge to start by focusing on the most carbon-intense sectors, developing an approach per sector, and engaging with companies rather than simply excluding them. Well all look at clients future investments to support their shift to low-carbon assets in line with science-based scenarios. \</doc>

Dec. 3 -- The core business of climate negotiations officially opened today, Monday 3 December, in the heart of the Silesia region of southern Poland. At the Katowice Conference Centre, more than 20,000 people all over the world are expected to gather to push for effective climate deal Symbolically, the climate summit was officially launched on 2 December by Frank Bainimarama, former Prime Minister of Fiji and Chair of COP23, MichaKurtyka, Secretary of State in the Polish Ministry of Energy and Chair-Designate of COP24 , and Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). There is a remarkable level of expectation at COP24 . Stakeholders expect this year's climate talks to rekindle the momentum around climate finance and commitment to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.It is a case, no less, of agreeing on the ways and means to give the Paris Agreement real force (interview with SeyniNafo here), so that the commitments made do not remain a forlorn hope. The day started with the "high-level segment" attended by Heads of State and Government as well as plenary sessions If this COP resonates less with the general public than, for example, COP21 in Paris, which led to the historic signing of the Paris Agreement, this is because it is much more technical, or even technocratic.And this is why it is so crucial. Developed countries have pledged to increase climate finaning for developing countries to $100 billion by 2020. Developing countries, including the 54 African countries, are expecting clearer commitments on this financing promise from the advanced countries. And yet, only about 30 Heads of State and Government, essentially from Africa, the European Union and Small Island States made the journey to Katowice for the opening of COP24 .The presidents of Nigeria, Benin, Senegal, Botswana, Mauritania and Congo, for example, are present in this climate talks. On the other hand, none of the leaders of the G20 member states, who are responsible for 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, seem to have listed Katowice as a priority on its diplomatic agenda General feeling of climate emergency The world is at a crossroads. The reality of climate change is clear and its impact increasingly being felt in various ways. . In early October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published an alarming report, which reveals that at the current rate of warming, the 1.5 C threshold will be breached between 2030 and 2052. In mid-November, a study published in Nature Climate Change modelled the extreme concurrent disasters to which humanity will be exposed by 2100, if we fail to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the eve of the opening of COP24 , the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reiterated that"if current trends in the concentration of greenhouse gases continue, the average surface temperature of the globe is set to increase by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century". Such scenarios do not bode well for Africa, which is bearing thebrunt of the effects of climate change. In other words, Africa needs to unite all its advocacy efforts and strength to fight climate change and counter its effects. Africa Day: African momentum intensies around action against climate The first day of COP24 marks the holding of Africa Day, a joint initiative of the African Development Bank (AfDB), The African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). This year's Africa Day theme is: "The Africa NDC Hub: Going further and faster with NDC implementation in support of Agenda 2063". Currently about 90% of African countries - 49 out of 54 - have ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This affirms the continent's awareness and increasing commitment to the fight against climate change. The urgency of climate risk, particularly to Africa's transformation, points to another urgent matter: taking action and quickly. This is fundamental to building an Africa that is resilient, green and prosperous. \</doc>

India, Dec. 3 -- At Katowice, United Nations chief warns of catastrophicchanges toclimate if Paris Agreement terms not implemented "Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his address at the second day of 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. Stating that "majority of countries most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are behind in their efforts to meet their Paris pledges", the UN Chief warned of the devastating impact a 1.5 degree rise in temperature will have on ecosystems. As reported by the Down To Earth, the coming two weeks will see discussions on the terms of how different elements of the agreement will be implemented from 2020. The first week of COP24 will involve parties negotiating to arrive at a consensus for the finalised Rule Book, followed by its adoption in the second week and statements. "Last year, I visited Barbuda and Dominica, which were devastated by hurricanes. The destruction and suffering I saw was heart-breaking. That story is repeated almost daily somewhere in the world. These emergencies are preventable," said Guterres. He called for "a complete transformation of global energy economy, better management of land and forest resources with a focus on low-carbon, climate-resilient sustainable development". "Emissions must decline by 45 per cent by 2030 and be net zero by 2050. Renewable energy will need to supply half to two-thirds of the world's primary energy by 2050. And coal must provide less than 7 per cent of global energy, from current levels of approximately one-third of all energy used worldwide," he said. The UN chief warned that "we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption". Guterres outlined four objectives to negate a catastrophic future. First was the need for an "ambitious response" towards the growing threat of global warming, on which numerous scientific reports have been put in the public domain. "According to the World Meteorological Organization, the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years. The concentration of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been in three million years. The current Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement will reportedly lead to global warming of about 3 degrees by the end of the century." Hence, the second objective is to urgently implement actions under the Paris Agreement, he said. "We have no time for limitless negotiations." The third and one of the most crucial objectives is to mobilise resources and investment. According to Guterres, "we need transformative climate action in five key economic areas - energy, cities, land use, water and industry." Highlighting that about 75 per cent of the infrastructure needed by 2050 is still to come up, the UN chief said that the course of action countries chose to take will determine the future. He suggested that countries not only need to invest in clean fuel and technologies, but also ensure safeguards for those at risk of unemployment due to the transition as well as assistance for the most vulnerable communities and countries. "Making clear progress to mobilise the pledged $100 billion dollars a year will provide a much-needed positive political signal. I also urge Member States to swiftly implement the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund," he said. Finally, the UN chief, in the fourth objective, raked up the significance and benefits from sustained global climate action. He quoted the New Climate Economy report to state that "ambitious climate action could yield 65 million jobs and a direct economic gain of $26 trillion dollars over the next 12 years". Guterres stressed on how meeting the Paris Argreement guidelines would help save millions of lives every year, which are lost to pollution and growing natural disasters. He urged increased participation from the younger generation, and an urgent need to transition to a low-carbon economy. "Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey... If we fail, the Arctic and Antarctic will continue to melt, corals will die, the oceans will rise, more people will die from air pollution, water scarcity will plague a significant proportion of humanity, and the cost of disasters will skyrocket." cop24 katowice Antonio Guterres Global Warming Paris 2015 Agreement Coal global economy Climate Change India Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

United Nations, Dec. 3 -- COP24 , the two-week 24th conference of the parties of the United Nations Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), started in Katowice, Poland, with a special focus on carbon neutrality and gender equality. Days after the UN sounded the alarm on the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, the world is gathering to define how the 2015 Paris Agreement will be implemented and moved forward by its 197 parties, United Nations reported. Under the agreement, all countries have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the global average rise in temperature to well below 2degC, and as close as possible to 1.5degC. Kicking off the two-week event in Katowice on Sunday, a historically mining town in the south of Poland, a team of cyclists on electric bikes arrived from Vienna, having biked 600 km to demonstrate the value of renewable energy in reducing emissions. The expedition was supported by the UN Global Compact, a group of private sector companies committed to sustainable development. "I commend the cyclists involved in this bike tour for inspiring the world to move in the right direction to fulfil the promise of the Paris Agreement," said UN Climate Change Deputy Executive Secretary, Ovais Sarmad. "This is the most important COP since the signing of the agreement, and we need initiatives like yours to testify that governments, the private sector and individuals can work together to tackle climate change by committing to multilateralism." To limit COP24 The conference will also enforce a strict waste management policy, distinct recycling bins will be available in all meeting rooms, the packaging of electronic equipment has been saved and will be reused after the conference is over, the packaging of catering products is environmentally friendly, single-use plastic products are limited across the space and overall, the conference is paper light, with official documents available only in digital versions. To limit greenhouse emissions due to transportation, virtual participation is encouraged and supported through live webcasts of the main events. Unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions due to the event will be tracked through a rigorous calculation by the organisers based on international standards. It is anticipated that COP24 will generate approximately 55,000 tons of CO2. To offset this, the Polish Government has committed to planting more than 6 million trees, capable of absorbing the equivalent of the conference's emissions in the next 20 years. Adopted at the previous COP, the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan (GAP) promotes the mainstreaming of gender into climate policy and action at all levels. Half-way into the implementation of the GAP, parties, observers and the Convention Secretariat will showcase the measures they have taken to date. Regarding the gender representation in the conference itself, the UNFCCC Secretariat has been monitoring since 2013 gender balance in technical and decision-making bodies established under the Convention. For the first time this year, more than half of these bodies have female representation of 38 per cent or more. Furthermore, there is a record number of female delegates elected to the position of Chair or Co-Chair of these bodies - nine out of a possible 28 positions. Though these improvements represent steps in the right direction to achieve the goal of gender balance, much remains to be done.

Spain, Dec. 5 -- A total of 184 countries (96% of the total) have ratified the Agreement and presented specific emission reduction targets; however, together they fail to meet the joint goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Therefore, it is necessary to review and step up the national commitments, which requires the ongoing Talanoa Dialogue process to be completed. Stepping up the goals also means standardising procedures in order to be able to measure commitments, assess achievements and guide countries that were not bound by the previous benchmarks under the Kyoto Protocol. COP24 will articulate guidelines for their development and will define rules for their implementation - the "Paris Rulebook", which must be completed at the Katowice meeting. Apart from political ambition and commitment, ACCIONA considers it vital that non-governmental agencies become implicated in decarbonising the economy. Companies, NGOs and other civil society players must take on an active role in combating climate change. ACCIONA is a member of the world's main private-sector forums to drive effective measures against climate change. When the Paris Agreement was adopted, ACCIONA made the commitment to become a carbon-neutral company - it achieved this goal in 2016. In line with the decarbonisation roadmap for the economy that was set out in the Paris Agreement, the company established science-based emission reduction goals vetted by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI), specifically a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from the 2017 baseline. Through the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, under the auspices of the World Economic Forum, ACCIONA signed three leading private-sector petitions for COP24 : implementation of effective carbon pricing mechanisms worldwide; allocation of funding and investment to low carbon activities; and development of political tools to promote citizen education and demand for low carbon solutions. The companies in the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, which have cut their CO2 emissions by 9% since 2015, are anchoring their climate goals to scientific criteria and are extending them to their supply chain, having defined rules for transparency with regard to climate risks in their reports.

The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) and the Youth Climate Lab (YCL), an international organization dedicated to creating collaborative youth projects to advance climate action, hosted a Youth Dialogue titled Climate Mentorship for Youth. The session ran on the sidelines of the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Katowice, Poland. The side event highlighted the progress of the UAEs Youth Climate Mentorship Program, launched at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. The Program seeks to bolster youth engagement in international climate negotiations and national climate change policy development processes, as well as increase youth contribution to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The session allowed the young participants to interact with ministers and other high-level attendees, and discuss issues related to climate change and mentorship. It also explored opportunities to increase youth participation in UN climate negotiations and national policy processes. Meanwhile, the UAE delegation to COP24 participated in Global Climate Action Energy Day, held under the theme Enabling Change through Energy Transition. The event brought together policy makers, corporations, innovators and other energy stakeholders for a frank exchange of opinions on the ways to accelerate progress in the sector to meet the development and climate objectives under Goal 7 and the Paris Agreement. Energy Day examined diverse geographical, economic and social factors to provide insight into long-term planning and innovation in energy transformation. The delegates presented an overview of the UAEs experience in adopting energy transition plans and deploying clean and renewable energy on a mega scale. Furthermore, they outlined the countrys ambitious clean energy targets of 27 percent by 2021 and 50 percent by 2050, and the role of public-private partnerships in achieving these targets, using the experience of the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) in deploying renewable energy solutions at home and abroad as a case in point. \</doc>

Botswana, just like the whole world has compiled its report for submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change when countries meet for the 24th conference ( COP 24 ) in Katowice, Poland in a few weeks. Under its mitigation measures, Botswana highlights that though solar geysers have been in existence for over 50 years in the country, the absorption rate is extremely low. 'According to household survey only 0.14 percent of the households were using solar for heating by 2011 while BPC estimated that only three percent of the high income household are using solar geysers. Using a figure of 0.14 percent, it is estimated that 750 households use solar energy for heating. This translates into 0.07 Gg of CO2 emissions reduction which is projected to increase to 8 Gg of CO2 emissions reduction by 2030. . Figure 11 depicts projected households with solar geysers by 2030,'explains the report. Assuming that conventional electric geysers are switched for three hours per day with a capacity of 300 watts, one geyser consumes approximately 328.5 kWh per year. Therefore, one solar geyser has the potential to reduce approximately 0.00011 Gg of CO2 emissions, which is approximately 110 kg of CO2 eq. while the cost of one unit is approximately P20 000.00. The report indicates that another mitigating measure is methane capture and usage as energy source. 'This is a mitigation project that is currently being undertaken at Glen Valley wastewater treatment where methane is captured and flared to heat up oxidation ponds. Methane as an energy gas can be captured and used for generating, electricity, for heating up the ponds to speed up anaerobic processes or as cooking gas. Capturing methane reduces GHG emissions by 53 Gg of CO2 eq. and projected to increase to 400 Gg of CO2 eq. by 2030,' states the report. There is a significantly large scale proposed biogas project in Lobatse; which will involve establishing and operating a biogas plant and gas upgrading plant which will generate methane from effluent disposed into an open pond water treatment plant and cow dung collected from Botswana Meat Commission and feedlots. It is envisaged that the gas will be used to generate electricity for the national grid system and for cooking gas to replace Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). The plant capacity is estimated at 2.5-3 MW and constructed at a cost of BWP 100 million. Another biogas project is the Mmamashia Biogas Project; with a capacity of approximately 1 MW. The electricity will be generated from agro-waste (chicken and cattle manure) and municipal waste. The proposed plant will be constructed at an estimated cost of BWP 250 million. Mabesekwa Biogas plant is another biogas plant that is a CDM project that is proposed as both a climate change mitigation action and also to increase the country's main objective of increasing renewable energy in the energy mix. The project will involve construction and operation of a 200 m3 biogas plant which will provide cooking gas for 400 students on daily basis and a gas-generator to supply 100 households and power 20 streetlights in the village. It is envisaged that success of the biogas plant will be replicated to 3 villages at a rate of one village per year for 4 years. Similar to other biogas projects, the emissions reduction will be two-ways. Firstly, capture of produced CH4 in the atmosphere and secondly, avoided emissions from the use of paraffin and fuel wood as a source of energy. Furthermore, there are household biogases plants which are mini biogas plants with an average capacity of 6 m3 that are operated at the household level to generate methane for cooking, heating and lighting. This is one of the most feasible, economic and cost-effective climate mitigation options for the country, particularly at the rural population. The initial planning target is to construct 1500 household biogas plants and expand them into future. The cost of construction and installation of the biogas plant including biogas stove is estimated at approximately BWP 15 000.00 Estimating the emissions reduction of the household biogas plants was based on fuel wood consumption displacement at the household level. According to FOSA study, fuel wood per capita in the country is 0.58 tons year. Assuming a household size of four as per population census, fuel wood consumption in the country is estimated at 25-50 kg per day per household. Therefore, this figure was used to estimate emission reductions from the household biogas plants. Another measure is the efficient lighting introduced initiative that was implemented through BPC aimed at improving electricity saving by giving households CFL bulbs for free and replacing the incandescent light bulbs. It is estimated that CFL save up to 60 percent of electricity relative to the incandescent light bulbs. This mitigation action was implemented in 2012 and it contributed to GHG emissions reduction of about 145 Gg CO2 eq. in 2012 and projected to achieve 300 Gg CO2 eq. by 2030. Farmers in the country are also voluntarily switching from diesel powered pumps to solar powered borehole influenced mainly by their cost-effectiveness. Similar to other solar appliances, solar powered boreholes replace use of fossil fuel and petroleum products and thus reduce GHG emissions. Currently, it is estimate that there are about 537 solar power boreholes with emission reduction potential of 0.55 Gg CO2 eq. and projected to increase to 169 Gg of CO2 eq. by 2030. \</doc>

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet - highest decision-making body of government - on Wednesday gave its ex-post facto approval to the negotiating stand of India at recently held UN climate conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland where the country had strongly flagged its reservations on a key point while constructively participating in the global meet to ensure its final outcome.Though India considered the outcome of COP24 a "positive one" which protected the country's long-term interests, it noted on record its reservations on the issue of Global Stocktake (GST) - a process of assessing collective progress of countries on their climate actions as per their pledges under the Paris Agreement to check global warming through reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.India felt that the aspect of 'equity' was not factored in properly on the GST decision in the COP24 outcome and therefore the matter needs to be discussed in the subsequent meeting. The UN climate conference had ended on December 15 after adopting a rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change post-2020. The countries had therealso agreed to initiate the work on setting up new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of US$ 100 billion.The government's statement, issued after Cabinet meeting, noted India's concerns. It said the country had expressed its reservation on the GST decision regarding the need for considerations of equity in output of the stocktake process.The country noted that the 'equity' is an important part of GST process as per the mandate of the Paris Agreement to ensure that "vulnerabilities, problems and challenges of the poor and marginalised are addressed".In fact, all developing countries including India have been insisting operationalising 'equity' in the periodic GST, arguing that their cumulative historical and per capita emissions are relatively quite low and they need to share equitably the remaining carbon space to meet their development needs.India's approach at COP24 was guided by principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement particularly the principles of 'equity' and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability (CBDR-RC).India, therefore, argued that the actions of developing countries need to be supported by sustained and adequate means of implementation including finance, capacity building and technological support by developed countries."The adopted guidance operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and requires developed countries to provide detailed information to bring clarity on projected levels of climate finance," said the government in the statement.

The UN Climate Change Conference COP24 has commenced in earnest in Katowice, Poland. A team of motivated volunteers arrived at the conference venue on e-bikes, having cycled more than 600 kilometers from Vienna, Austria to Katowice in Poland. Under the banner Moving for Climate NOW, a diverse group of about 40 people demonstrated the value of cycling and e-mobility to reducing emissions. The cycling team brought a Moving for Climate NOW Manifesto to Katowice as its contribution to the climate talks. This years climate talks bring together organizations committed to building up global forces and mobilizing society to tackle climate change. Astrid Manroth, Director Delivery and Impact at the African Development Bank, was one of the cyclists that arrived at the climate talks by bike. I decided to join the Moving for Climate NOW initiative as I wanted to contribute to raising awareness that climate change is an existential challenge for all of us that cannot wait we need to take decisive action now, she said. The actions of individuals outside these conference halls matter as much as the political process at COP24 , stated Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as he welcomed the cyclists upon arrival. "This is the most important COP since the signing of the Paris agreement, and we need initiatives like yours to testify that governments, private sector and individuals can work together to tackle climate change by committing to multilateralism, Mr. Sarmad added. The transition to low-carbon transport needs to come from both individuals and institutions, Astrid reflected upon arrival. Unfortunately, in Africa, public transport is still underdeveloped in many cities. As African Development Bank, we should help our client countries and cities to develop low-carbon sustainable public transport solutions. \</doc>

India, Dec. 15 -- Climate change negotiations must move from being a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game As I was attending the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change-to create a rulebook to operationalise the Paris Agreement-in Katowice, Poland, it dawned on me, like never before, that the negotiations were taking place in a make-believe world. There was a stark disconnect between what is required to contain the impacts of climate change and what representatives of 197 parties were trying to achieve. The world is reeling under the effects of climate disasters. From Kerala to California, extreme weather events are killing people, destroying properties and businesses. This, when the global temperature has only increased by 1.0degC from preindustrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5degC makes it clear that the impacts are going to be substantially higher at 1.5degC warming and catastrophic at 2.0degC. The worst part is that most countries, including the US and the European Union, are not even on track to meet their meagre commitments to curb emissions. So why is it that three years after the "historic" Paris Agreement was signed, the global collective effort is in tatters? The reason is the architecture of the Paris Agreement itself. The Paris Agreement is a voluntary agreement in which countries are free to choose their own climate targets, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Developed countries and rich developing countries were expected to take higher emission reduction targets than poor developing countries. But if a rich country doesn't commit to a higher emissions cut, no one can demand a revision of targets. Worse, if a country fails to meet its NDCs, there is no penalty. The agreement, therefore, based on the goodwill of countries. Herein lies the catch. Since the beginning, climate negotiations have been viewed as an economic negotiation and not as an environmental negotiation. So, instead of cooperation, competition is the foundation of these negotiations. Worst still, the negotiations are viewed as a zero-sum game. For instance, Donald Trump believes that reducing emissions will hurt the US economy and benefit China, so he has walked out of the Paris Agreement. China too believes in this viewpoint, and despite being the world's largest polluter today, it has not yet committed to any absolute emissions cut. The fact is every country is looking for its own narrow interest and not the larger interest of the whole world. They are, therefore, committing to as little climate targets as possible. This is the Achilles heel of the Paris Agreement. This is the reason why the Paris Agreement will not be able meet its own goal of limiting global warming well below 2degC. The negotiations, however, are devoid of this realisation. We need to understand that the interest of countries and the interest of the world are two sides of the same coin. Climate change demands countries cooperate and work together to reduce emissions. But this can only happen if the climate change negotiations move from being a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game. Today, it is possible to make this changeover because reducing emissions and increasing economic growth are no more incompatible to each other. Costs of technologies such as batteries, super-efficient appliances and smart grids are falling so rapidly that they are already competitive with fossil fuel technologies. So the reason for countries to compete with each other for carbon budget is becoming immaterial. If countries cooperate, the cost of low and no-carbon technologies can be reduced at a much faster pace, which will benefit everyone. The bottom line is negotiations cannot continue in a business-as-usual fashion. The time has come to devise new mechanisms for a meaningful international collaboration to fight climate change.

The main advances and results of the management of climate change in the country were presented in different sessions during the development of the COP24 by the Minister of the Environment, Fabiola Muoz. During her participation in the most important climate summit in the world, the Minister of the Environment (Minam) fulfilled a busy work agenda. Thus, the first day he met with his peers who are part of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC). Accompanied by the Environment Ministers of Chile, Mara Schmidt; Colombia, Ricardo Lozano; Honduras, Jorge Galdamez; the deputy minister of Guatemala, Carlos Ramos; and the representatives of the delegations of Costa Rica and Paraguay, Minister Muoz Dodero said that Peru is committed to compliance with the Paris Agreement, through its NDCs in terms of mitigation and adaptation, which reflects the collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the morning of Tuesday, December 11, he met with his Indonesian counterpart, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, to address the scope of the World Peat Initiative. As is known, Andean peat bogs have 100 times more carbon than all the tropical forests in the world, and the wetlands of the Pastaza River, located in the Loreto region, extend approximately 3.2 million hectares. In the afternoon, he spoke with the director of the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) of Switzerland, Marc Chardonnens, to reaffirm the interest of both countries in developing pilot projects to reduce emissions that contribute to accelerate action in the face of climate change . During her last day at COP24 , the Minister of the Environment met with the Ministers of the Member States of the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Colombia and Mexico), in her capacity as President Pro Tempore, to reaffirm the conviction on the importance of developing and implement national and regional policies, strategies and programs, integrated to sustainable consumption and production initiatives, to promote responsible consumption of plastic and prevent contamination by microplastics. Then, he participated in the meeting with the Peruvian delegation at the COP24 , made up of representatives of civil society (public and private sector, indigenous peoples, NGOs, youth groups, academia) to share the progress of the negotiations with a view to implementation of the Paris Agreement and how this process is directly related to the internal environmental agenda. Subsequently, Minister Muoz Dodero attended the anniversary event of the NDC Partnership, which has contributed directly to the participatory process for the design of the NDC of Peru, through "Dialoguemos", as well as the process of participatory construction of the Regulation of the Framework Law on Climate Change. \</doc>

India, Dec. 5 -- Carpooling, making up for CO2 emissions among measures taken by UNFCCC and Poland environment ministry To make the 24 th Conference of Parties, being held at Katowice in Poland, sustainable, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Polish Ministry of Environment have undertaken various measures. The event organizers aim to avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as much as possible. "To reduce the overall climate footprint of the event, a series of measures have been arranged in areas such as waste management and paper reduction", says Agnieszka Tomaszewska, counsellor to the Minister and Head of the Ozone Layer Protection Team, Plenipotentiary for Environmental Management in Poland's Ministry of Environment. The measures include arranging for sustainable transportation for participants to travel from their hotels to the conference venue. Public transportation in Katowice and the surroundings areas was made free to the participants. The staff was encouraged to use car-sharing services to further limit the use of private vehicles. The GHG emissions made despite the measures is being documented through a carbon footprint report prepared by the host country. The emissions will be estimated as per the accepted international standards, and any emission above the accepted levels will be compensated by removing the equivalent amount of Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) through an afforestation project of the Polish State Forests agency. Organisations, companies and individuals have the option of purchasing UN-certified offsets (or certified emission reduction credits) to compensate for the carbon footprint generated by their personal activities. Another important measure is waste-management. According to UNFCCC's lead for UN climate change conferences, Dennis Winkler, "Waste management includes reusing, sorting and recycling materials that would otherwise be disposed of, for instance at a landfill site or through incineration, as well as avoiding or limiting the use of disposable products." Also, most of the conference venue will be set up using reusable materials. Part of the measures is also a reduction in paper usage. For this, all official documents were made available in a digital format. "To further limit the use of paper, the number of pages for printing in a single session and the number of sessions available to any given user at the computer centres will be limited, with double-sided printing as the default option," added Tomaszewska.

Poland, Nov. 29 -- The EBRD will call for urgent action to step up the global fight against climate change at the COP24 international conference beginning on Monday in Poland. It will be the first major climate gathering since October's stark warning by UN scientists that time was running out for efforts to curb global warming. The two-week talks in Katowice, Poland, are the "rulebook COP". The aim is determine the rules of implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to keep the average global temperature rise at "well below" 2C above pre-industrial temperatures, and to "pursue efforts towards 1.5C". The report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in October, called for "unprecedented" efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C, which would require "rapid and drastic reductions" to reach net zero emissions by 2050. If global temperatures continue to rise at the present rate, the report forecast that the earth's average temperature could rise 1.5C as soon as 2030 and 3C by the end of the century, causing irreversible damage to the environment. In 2015, the EBRD pledged to increase the volume of its green financing to 40 per cent by 2020. Its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach puts investments that bring climate and environmental benefits at the heart of its mandate. In 2017 it reached a record 43 per cent. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an important player in adaptation to climate change. In Katowice - where COP24 will bring together over 25,000 environment and climate change specialists from nearly 200 countries - the EBRD will report on progress in several areas in delivering its climate finance objectives. EBRD programmes that contribute towards Paris alignment include: &#194;&#183; EBRD Green Cities, a programme that identifies, prioritises and connects cities' environmental challenges with sustainable infrastructure investments and policy measures. Cities already account for 70 per cent of energy use and 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and are major drivers of climate impacts; &#194;&#183; Green Economy Finance facilities (GEFFs), providing credit lines to financial institutions for on-lending to clients making green technology and energy efficiency investments; &#194;&#183; Work with individual countries on setting post-2020 climate action plans, known as as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs. The EBRD works with the NDC Partnership in delivering such assistance; &#194;&#183; Technology transfer mechanisms to increase the market penetration of climate technologies, such as the EBRD's Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change and Technology selector. As global thinking develops on how to meet the Paris requirements, the EBRD's experience supporting the reshaping of economies in carbon-intensive regions and its long-term emphasis on working with the private sector makes it a natural leader in several emerging areas of activity. The EBRD works closely with other MDBs in areas such as GHG accounting standards and climate finance tracking. As well as the EBRD's focus on energy efficiency, renewables and green cities, the Bank is now putting additional focus on climate adaptation. As the leading MDB for providing adaptation finance to the private sector, the Bank has a portfolio of more than 200 signed GET climate resilience investments. The EBRD is using its expertise in mobilising large volumes of private sector finance to boost green investment in climate mitigation and adaption. Working with multilateral donors - including the European Union, Climate Investment Funds, Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility - the EBRD has thus far raised over &#38;#8364;1.5 billion in public financing, and leveraged this with over &#38;#8364;18 billion in private financing.

Dec. 3 -- Agneta Rising, World Nuclear Association Director General, will be speaking on 6 December at a COP24 side-event organised by the Nuclear Innovation: Clean Energy Future initiative, which was established in 2018 at the ninth Clean Energy Ministerial meeting. Ms Rising will be presenting the case that achieving the nuclear industry's Harmony goal of supplying 25% of the world's electricity from nuclear energy by 2050 as part of a decarbonized generation mix is a vital element of a credible response to climate change. To achieve this will require the construction of 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity to work together with other low-carbon technologies. The future decarbonization of the electricity sector is central to tackling climate change: global electricity production accounts for 40% of total emissions and coal and gas still dominate generation, producing 63% of the world's electricity. Nuclear power is a low-carbon source of energy. The median lifecycle emissions from nuclear are 12g/kWh, similar to wind energy. Thanks to nuclear displacing fossil fuels, more than 60 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions have been avoided globally since 1970. Decarbonizing the electricity sector is a considerable challenge. Despite massive investments, renewable energies alone will not be enough to achieve the decarbonization required. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that the cost of decarbonizing electricity is much lower when the mix includes substantial amounts of nuclear together with renewables. Abundant low-carbon electricity will not only be needed for today's uses of electricity. Greater use of clean electricity is the preferred tool for achieving deep decarbonization in other sectors, such as transport. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report, detailing what would be needed to limit global warming to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels, notes that the 'scalability and speed of scaling of nuclear plants have been high in many nations' - highlighting the case of France, which successfully decarbonised much of its electricity mix in under 20 years by establishing a generation mix predominantly supplied by nuclear power. Global nuclear generation exceeded 2500 TWh for the first time in five years in 2017, with nuclear supplying 10.5% of the world's electricity needs. Nine nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 10.4GWe have started up so far this year, the highest amount since 1990. Next year 14 reactors with a total capacity of nearly 15 GWe are due to start operations. Poland, COP24 These developments are vital to achieving the nuclear industry's Harmony goal. But to accelerate this progress will require governments to bring about policy change to allow nuclear energy to make its full contribution. Only by decarbonizing electricity generation, with nuclear energy playing a major role, can we deliver on the Paris agreement commitments. World Nuclear Association is the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry. Its mission is to promote a wider understanding of nuclear energy among key international influencers by producing authoritative information, developing common industry positions, and contributing to the energy debate, as well as to pave the way for expanding nuclear business.

India, Dec. 3 -- The conference in Katowice will see parties negotiate to arrive at a consensus on the finalrules and guidelines that would operationalise the Paris agreement December 2 marked the first day of the 24 th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) at Katowice, Poland where parties have convened to continue the ongoing negotiations to formulate and adopt the final text of the Paris Rulebook-the rules and guidelines that would operationalise the Paris agreement. In the coming two weeks, parties will decide on the terms of how different elements of the agreement, including finance, market mechanisms, accounting of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Global Stocktake (collective global progress made towards achieving NDC targets), transparency and support, will be implemented from 2020. The first week of COP24 will involve the parties negotiating to arrive at a consensus on the final text of the rulebook, followed by its adoption in the second week and high-level statements from different parties. COP President Michal Kurtyka, who is also the state secretary of the Polish Ministry of Energy, opened this year's climate session asserting the need for parties to show "creativity and flexibility, and to use the time available wisely to deliver the results we are all aiming for". It is imperative that countries adroitly and efficiently negotiate the rules this week, as establishing a robust, just and balanced rulebook will be critical in setting the tone for enabling the global climate action needed in the coming years to achieve the Paris goal of limiting global warming to well below 2degC and pursuing efforts towards 1.5degC. Many parties reflected their keenness in creating an effective and robust rulebook in their statements on the opening day. Developing country parties, including BASIC, the African Group, Like Minded Developing Countries, asserted the need for striking a balance between adaptation and mitigation, for embedding equity, and for developed countries to provide support (financially, technologically and in terms of capacity building) to establish a just rulebook. The EU has suggested the possibility of addressing some of these concerns in their statement, particularly in the realm of finance (Germany announced last week that it will provide EUR 1.5 billion for the Green Climate Fund replenishment) and balancing mitigation and adaptation efforts, to achieve a robust rulebook outcome. Whether these issues and commitments will be aptly reflected, will finally be based on how the rulebook negotiations ensue this week. In the wake of numerous watershed climate reports released in the last few months that starkly present the projected deleterious impacts of climate change and the meagre global progress made on addressing the issue (i.e. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5degC, WWF's The Living Planet Report 2018, The United Nations Environmental Programme Emissions Gap Report, World Meteorological Organization's(WMO) State of the Global Climate), there is pressure on Parties to signal increased climate ambition pre-2020 at Katowice. The latest climate science has brought a sense of global urgency and parties must make use of the opportunities present during negotiations this week to take these findings into consideration and raise ambition. In fact, oil dependent Saudi Arabia seemed threatened by the IOs scientific statements on climate impacts at the plenary and objected to their reporting at the SBSTA session, arguing that their voice was not being heard in this party driven process. However, their opposition was politely shut down by the French SBSTA presidency, who requested for the IOs' statements to still be heard. One of the avenues through which parties can indicate their actions in line with the latest climate science is within one of the agenda items scheduled for this week - the pre-2020 actions that are to be taken. Given that the current Paris pledges set the world on a 3degC warming track, as the IPCC Special Report states, the hope is that Parties will take the scientific findings into consideration to raise ambition through this agenda item and limit warming in line with the Paris goal. Another avenue for countries to signal their ambition would be through the Talanoa Dialogue, an informal and transparent process structured around having a stocktake of current climate action. Creating a balanced Rulebook should also involve taking due consideration of the latest scientific climate change findings. It is integral that countries take corresponding action through opportunities present at Katowice, or risk facing the consequences of doing nothing. There is no better time than now for countries to step up.

India, March 19 -- Many of us are acquainted with the name Greta Thunberg, and those who are not, here is a brief introduction of this young girl. Greta Thunberg is a 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, who came into the spotlight in August 2018 when she started skipping school on Fridays and protested outside the parliament of Sweden. Her demand was to take initiatives to control the rise in global temperature. At the World Economic Forum, she delivered a speech titled "Our house is on fire". In her speech, Thunberg blamed the world political leaders for not paying any heed to the climate crisis. The teenager also gave a ferocious speech at the United Nations ' climate change conference COP24 . Following Greta Thunberg, students all over the world are observing #FridaysForFuture movement. The movement is solely aimed to serve the needs of the climate and reducing the emission of gases that promote the greenhouse effect. On March 15, 2019 students all over the world organized a mass bunk and took to the streets and demanded the enactment of serious laws that can control the rising global temperature. Indian students also observed the movement and went on a strike on March 15. Their demand was the same, "action against the rising global temperature". Our mother nature is not as healthy as it used to be. Emission of harmful gases from vehicles and factories are dreadfully impacting the whole ecosystem. Marine life is being affected and many aquatic animals are on the verge of extinction. The air quality is depleting day by day. Also read: Students Protesting Against Climate Change Can Form A Strong Base For A Revolution Who is to be blamed for all this? Homosapiens are the most advanced creation of God and this divine creation is taking every possible step to destruct the planet. All the world powers and economies are only worried about their nuclear weapons and political power. No serious and practical step to safeguard the environment has been taken so far. Children all over the world are demanding the respective governments to control climate change and act accordingly. These children do not seem to give up. They are objecting and questioning the adults' ways of tackling the precarious conditions of our climate. Every year, the global temperature increases and this leads to the rise in sea level. What are we doing to contain this aggravating situation? "We can no longer save the world by playing by the rules. It's time to rebel to save the future." - Greta Thunberg A hint of rage can be sensed from these words by Thunberg. She is upset with those in power for being so irresponsible and ignorant towards the climate. It is questionable that even teenagers understand the plight of our nature, but the adults have failed tremendously to fix the depleting air quality, rising global temperature and various other problems concerning nature.

The international platform and series of conferences created by Danfoss aimed at inspiring innovative thinking and developing solutions on climate and energy issues called #ETtalks has received the Golden Clip in the Business-to-Business PR category the communication Oscar in Poland. Engineering Tomorrow talks (#ETtalks) brings together top speakers and visionaries to inspire the world of engineering to design today in a way that doesnt compromise tomorrow. Danfoss are bringing energy and climate topics to installers, construction engineers and city planners. The very people that turn talk into action. The project began in April this year with a series of conferences in Warsaw and in Kiev with the participation of eminent experts who are frequent speakers at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Climate Summit, NYC Climate Week or TEDx. This initiative shows how to build a bridge between visionary policy makers and business to truly engineer a better tomorrow. By combining the technology know-how of the industry with bold climate ambitions we can turn talk into action, says Kenth Krhg, Senior Vice President, Group Communication, Danfoss. In December, the #ETtalks project is continued during the COP24 climate summit in Katowice. This time, key experts on climate talks will provide short video interviews in the form of carpool. They are run by Ralph Talmont, TEDx curator in Eastern Europe, riding the #ETtalksDRIVE red Tesla on the streets of Katowice bringing conference participants from A to B. We will be able to hear Rachel Kyte, CEO of the Sustainable Energy for All and Special Representative of the UN Secretary General; Marcene Mitchell, Global Head of Strategy International Finance Corporation; Jean Pascal van Ypersele, former IPCC President; Monica Frassoni, President European Alliance to Save Energy, Micha? Kurtyka, Secretary of State in the Ministry of the Environment, Jerzy Buzek, chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy at the European Parliament. According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we have only twelve years to make bold decisions and stop climate change. We do not have time to conduct climate discussions behind closed doors. It is Danfoss ambition to involve the widest possible group in the climate debate. \</doc>

International Standards help to mainstream climate change actions in transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future, according to leading sustainability experts who will speak at an ISO side event at the COP24 in Katowice, Poland. ISO is holding a side event as part of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24 ) taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 2-14 December 2018. Organized by the ISO Climate Change Coordination Task Force (TF7), in conjunction with the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), the ISO event will feature talks and discussions about the use of International Standards for driving action, performance and transition on climate change. The Task Force works with experts from across ISO committees, guiding them to address critical aspects of climate change in ISO standards. The opportunities that International Standards bring to the global challenges of climate change will be discussed, such as mainstreaming climate action, supporting measurement and monitoring techniques, facilitating technology and non-technology innovation, and promoting behavioural changes and climate change adaptation. ISO standards can also contribute to the progress of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction that sets the pace for disaster mitigation by 2030. Nick Blyth, Vice Chair of the ISO TF7, said that International Standards are fundamental in helping organizations advance climate change actions, whether they be management system standards that shape organizational culture and processes or new ISO technical standards. ISO standards are built on international collaboration and consensus, by some of the worlds leading experts in the field, he said. They are relevant and powerful tools to help organizations not only measure their impact on climate change, but take strategic actions to transition towards the zero-carbon future and prepare for the inevitable challenges that result from our changing climate. The latest ISO standards and guidance related to climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions will be presented and discussed, including ISO 14064-1 for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and ISO 14067 for quantifying the carbon footprint of products. The event will also introduce new standards in development for adaptation to climate change (ISO 14090); impacts, vulnerability and risk assessment (ISO 14091); and green bonds for environmental performance of projects and assets (ISO 14030). In addition, the ISO mapping exercise carried out in 2018, which links hundreds of ISO International Standards to the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, will be profiled. \</doc>

NEW DELHI, Dec. 16 -- A near final text on the Paris rulebook -guidelines for implementing the historic 2015 Paris Agreement - is now ready. After climate activists raised several concerns with the draft Paris rulebook text released by the Polish Presidency (host of climate negotiations - COP24 ) on Friday evening and countries disagreed on several key issues till late on Friday night, Poland extended the talks for a day and came out with another draft text on Saturday evening. The new document, which runs into 156 pages, is marginally stronger than the previous draft and has managed to incorporate some crucial issues related to 'loss and damage,' 'climate finance' and 'differentiation.' But most vulnerable countries - the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), least developed countries (LDCs) and civil society organisations said the text could have been much more ambitious and factored in the urgency of climate change effectively. There are some bright spots in the text, though. It talks about setting a new collective finance goal post 2020, higher than the current goal of 100 billion USD per year. The text also urges developed country parties to channel more grant based resources for adaptation to climate change as against loans. "Each interested Party may provide, as appropriate, information related to enhancing understanding, action and support, on a cooperative and facilitative basis, to avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts," the text states. There is also some smart wording introduced in the new draft which says it "welcomes the timely completion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5 degree C" but doesn't state that the findings of the report is welcomed. This is a blow for the AOSIS and LDCs who had requested for the report and will be worst affected by 1.5 degree warming of pre-industrial levels. Experts said the text says developedcountriesareexpected to voluntarily inform the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and developing nations about the finance that will come in for adaptation which is a weak link. They are also not expected to share how much of the finance will be in grants or in loans. The text only urges developed countries to channel the substantial part of funds through grant based funding. Civil society organisations were expecting 'loss and damage' to be incorporated in most of the text which didn't happen. "Our governments have failed us. Some of the most powerful countries in the world are led by reactionary climate deniers... Rich countries have a moral and a legal responsibility... Instead of taking this seriously, they pushed through a rulebook riddled with loopholes allowing them to avoid this responsibility," said Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for Action Aid International. He added that "You have to understand that with the current agreement we are set for 3 degree warming." Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said "There are differences on a range of issues still. LDCs have put their foot down on finance and loss and damage. So ministers are working on breaking deadlock. We will have a clearer picture on Sunday." NH Ravindranath, climate scientist from the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) who has authored several IPCC reports, said, "IPCC's findings are based on science. Extreme climate change is a fact. The governments have to recognise the findings, and reduce global emissions by 45% by 2030. This is the biggest challenge which is not acceptable by petroleum exporting countries and coal based economies..." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Dec. 21 -- Both the seasonal snow and the Paris Agreement rule-book arrived late in Katowice. Luminaries such as Sir David Attenborough, Bertrand Piccard of Solar Impulse and Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations, added to the impetus from the IPCC Special report SR1.5 to push delegates into a last minute agreement. Key areas, such as common timeframes and transparency in the monitoring and reporting of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the signatory Parties were agreed, but Article 6 on market mechanisms has reverted to the subsidiary and technical bodies for more work next year on the detailed guidance. The Talanoa Dialogue was brought to a formal close after much positive and inspiring storytelling but without a clear path forward toward increasing the ambition of the NDCs in the run-up to COP26 in 2020. Parties also noted the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration, which recognizes the need to consider the imperatives of just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs. During COP24 The offer of Chile to host COP25 was accepted. Prior to that, the UN Secretary General will convene a climate summit in September 2019 in New York, USA. Source: IPIECA \</doc>

Sweden, Dec. 5 -- Scania's Executive Vice President for Commercial Operations, Mathias Carlbaum, has confirmed the company's commitment to the Paris Agreement terms to curb global warming. Speaking at the Electromobility Day at the UN's COP24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, Carlbaum said: "Climate change cannot wait, and we need to take action now. We can start to bend the emission curve here and now." Scania welcomes EU's vision of climate-neutral economy In keeping with its view of pathways to sustainable transport, Scania welcomes the European Commission's strategic long-term vision for a climate neutral economy by 2050. As noted by the Commission, Europe must accelerate the transition towards zero-emission mobility. Transport must become more energy-efficient and society needs to reduce its dependence on oil until its use is eventually phased out altogether, in favour of exclusively fossil-free fuels. Therefore, the Commission argues, the European Union needs a comprehensive regulatory framework comprising action on clean technologies through improved emission standards, and the deployment of low-carbon fuels. In the coming decade, heavy vehicles will increasingly be electrified, initially as hybrids. Meanwhile, e-highways offer a highly promising carbon-reduction pathway. Scania is involved in projects in Sweden, Germany and Italy. "The technology is already here and tested. They improve efficiency in the use of electric vehicles and need for batteries. Connecting the main road network between the three largest Swedish cities with an electrical road network would, for example, decrease carbon emissions from road freight by half." Scania vehicles compatible with all biofuels However, it is not expected that electrified heavy transports will be fully technically and commercially viable for another ten years. Therefore, to succeed in fulfilling the Paris Agreement climate goals, sustainable biofuels must increasingly be utilised. "In combination with electrification, this gives the fastest carbon emission abatement." Scania's vehicles can operate on all commercially available renewable biofuels, which means carbon emission reductions of up 90 percent. "The widespread proliferation of bioenergy is realistic and has a significant potential," Carlbaum told the conference. "Ethanol, biogas and biodiesel all have the advantage of contributing to a regional circular economy, reducing CO2emissions, increasing energy security and creating local jobs." Partnerships are vital The Electromobility Day is just one of the many events in which Scania will be participating throughout the COP24 conference, to underline the company's commitment to achieving sustainable transport. The conference runs until 14 December. HYPERLINK contentservices@htlive.com \</doc>

The Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 was by far the most ambitious effort yet made to strengthen the global response to the increasingly urgent challenges of climate change, with headline commitments to limiting global warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to make efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C. However, the agreement went far wider and deeper then these headlines. It also introduced nationally determined contributions (NDCs), to be submitted regularly to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), for a binding international review of progress made. In Article 6, the Convention provided for international and direct bilateral cooperation and new market-based mechanisms, as well as methods of promoting mitigation and sustainable development. The Agreement also called on countries to increase their ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change without threatening food production, and to make finance flows consistent with a pathway to low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. The Paris Agreement was a memorable diplomatic achievement but it needs substantial extra work to clarify and agree the guidance, rules, modalities, and procedures of the Agreement to succeed in practice. This work is ongoing, and the intention is to adopt the Paris rulebook at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) in Katowice, Poland by the end of 2018. Article 6 encourages international cooperation and allows countries with higher emissions or higher ambition to acquire emission reductions (Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes, or ITMOs, Article 6.2) or other kinds of mitigation outcomes (Article 6.4) from transferring countries. This can help to mobilise climate finance and technology from one country to another and any such financial transfers will help towards the Parties commitment to mobilise $100 billion per annum by 2020. Articles 6.2 and 6.4 require the quantification of emission reductions, the avoidance of double counting, net mitigation, environmental integrity and a calculation of the reductions achieved against targets set Nationally Determined Contributions. The African Development Bank is also leading efforts to develop a non-market mechanism under Article 6.8 called the Adaptation Benefit Mechanism. This is designed to channel private sector finance into adaptation projects. These and other mechanisms demonstrate innovative ways in which African countries can attract climate finance. So far, there is limited clarity on issues such as scope, governance and infrastructure for the implementing provisions under Article 6. Informal documents are still being discussed and a significant amount of work remains to resolve and agree upon the options as well as their corresponding intricacies. The Article 6 rules are potentially complex and may be harder to apply in countries with lower capacity. It is important to note that the Paris Agreement makes provisions and special conditions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (Africa is home to 33 out of 47 LDCs) which could help these countries to compete on climate finance with countries such as Brazil, China and India. It is up to the African negotiators and African civil society and stakeholders to ensure that African countries get a fair chance in the ongoing discussions on the Article 6 mechanisms. Complicated as these discussions may be, they hold the key to ensuring that Africa gets a fair deal on climate finance. \</doc>

New York, Dec. 1 -- During press briefings at the beginning of the G20 meeting of industrialized nations in Buenos Aires, UN Secretary Ant Guterres described the event as an essential forum, citing a lack of confidence and high level of confrontation within the international community. As well as mistrust between nations, and the risk of confrontation and escalation, Mr, Guterres said that there was a lack of trust between peoples in general and institutions everywhere, both at a national level in the form of governments and parliaments and internationally; because globalization has divided the world into winners and losers. Those left out, he said, feel angry, that feel frustrated, that many timesthere was not enough effort from their government, or from international organizations like the UN, in order to attend their problems, to attend their difficulties in the rustbelts of this world. I think it is very important to come together, the different countries around the world, and to have a common strategy for a fair globalization, which means a globalization that leaves no one behind. For this reason, the worlds largest economies, such as the G20 group, must support the UNs 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, said the UN chief, which was developed precisely to ensure a fair globalization and aims to eradicate poverty and address a wide range of governance problems worldwide. Katowice must succeed Mr. Guterres also pointed out that this years G20 meeting is important because it precedes the COP24 climate change conference taking place in Katowice, Poland from 3 December, at which the Work Programme or rule book of the 2015 Paris Agreement when practically all countries signed up to a pledge to ensure global temperatures do not rise by more than 2 degrees before the end of this century is expected to be agreed. Addressing the media on Friday, the Secretary-General said that Katowice must succeed. We need to build in Katowice the momentum that is necessary for an increased ambition to be shown by the international communitywhen in 2020 the commitments made in Paris will be renewed in order to make sure that we are able to bring the increase of temperature in the world until the end of the century to clearly below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Political will is lacking, said the UN chief. That is why its so important to come here and to express to political leaders how important it is for everybody to understand that this is a make it or break it moment in relation to guaranteeing that the Paris Agreement is implemented.

The United States participated in COP24 to protect U.S. interests, advance a level playing field for U.S. business, and promote the U.S. balanced approach to economic growth, energy security, and environmental protection. Judith Garber, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) at the U.S. Department of State, served as head of the U.S. delegation and delivered the U.S. National Statement. The United States expresses its appreciation to Poland for its hospitality, excellent preparation, and leadership at COP24 , which concluded in Katowice on December 15, 2018. The Administrations position on the Paris Agreement remains unchanged. On June 1, 2017, the President announced the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement absent terms more favorable to the American people. During COP24 U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions have fallen by 14 percent since 2005, even as the U.S. economy has grown by 19.4 percent. This world-leading achievement and a diverse energy portfolio is possible thanks to early stage research and development and private sector finance and innovation. As U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said, In America w eve unleashed our energy companies to innovate and compete. And our carbon emissions have declined dramatically. The United States takes note of the negotiated outcome and appreciates the hard work of our negotiators. The outcome took a significant step toward holding our economic competitors accountable for reporting their emissions in a manner consistent with standards the United States has met since 1992. The United States is not taking on any burdens or financial pledges in support of the Paris Agreement and will not allow climate agreements to be used as a vehicle to redistribute wealth. We will work with our many partner countries to innovate and deploy a broad array of technologies that promote economic growth, improve energy security, and protect the environment. \</doc>

To kick-start Polands hosting of the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) this December in Katowice and to create greater awareness about the United Nations sponsored storybook Fairy Tales for a Fairer World, The Bridge Foundation unveiled #GlobalReadingOnGlobalChallenges on 05 November 2018 at the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The event, which was graced by Ambassador to Poland Patricia Ann V. Paez, focused on the topic of climate change, environment protection, and the UNs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through the foundations Education is a Window to the World program, 400 high school students from 20 Polish schools have been exploring global economic, environmental and social challenges at the Faculty of Management of the University of Warsaw. One unique approach of this project is the use of story-telling. The students translated into Polish the Fairytales for a Fairer World - a storybook initiative of the UN Director General to promote the SDGs, Bridge Foundation founder Adam Koniuszewshi said. A chapter was turned into a theatrical play by students from the bilingual Polish-French Zmicowska High School in cooperation with the National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw. The play was premiered during the event. \</doc>

Several days after the conclusion of the COP24 climate conference in Poland, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), joined other Democrats on the Senate floor yesterday to discuss the urgent need for decisive action to fight climate change. In his remarks, Senator Carper also highlighted the agreements reached at COP24 , the Trump Administrations ignorance of this issue and the economic, environmental and public health consequences of inaction. Following the conclusion of COP24 , Senator Carper on Saturday released a statement responding to the multilateral agreement reached to implement the Paris Climate Accord. This agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade, said Senator Carper. Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every dayYet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies. Senator Carper continued, We dont have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up and get going. Thats why, as the senior Democrat and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Im anxious to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future. If were honest with our children and grandchildren, we dont have any other choice Todays speech can be viewed by clicking HERE. Below are Senator Carpers full remarks, as prepared for delivery: Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that concluded this past weekend in Poland. This important conference, which is better known as COP24 , met there for the past two weeks as leaders from nearly 200 countries worked to reach agreement on how the world will actually implement the Paris Climate Agreement. The stakes could not be higher. The future of our planet and the futures of our children and grandchildren hang in the balance. It was a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally beginning to implement the Paris Agreement into practice. Having said that, however, this agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade. The entire world must be doing even more to address this problem. That includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable. But reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor and that includes saving our planet. Unfortunately, our President along with many of those within his Administration continues to reject climate science and deny the reality of the problems we are facing. Well, Mr. President, heres the reality. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced 16 extreme weather-related disasters that exceeded $1 billion in 2017. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes and droughts a new record! Thirteen of our nations leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that, if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions, todays extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead. In the future, we can continue to expect rainfalls where precipitation is measured by the foot, not in inches. We can continue to expect more wildfires out West burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware. And we can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate small communities like Ellicott City Maryland, which has been hit by two 1,000-year-floods in the past two years alone. Think about that! Two in the past two years alone! Mr. President, one of the most memorable lyrics from singer-songwriter Stephen Stills goes something like this, Somethings happening here. Just what it is aint exactly clear. Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and it IS exactly clear. Whats also clear is that theres still time to do something about it and actually foster economic growth in the USA and beyond our borders. Climate science isnt part of some grand hoax. This isnt an alarmist prediction. It doesnt come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesnt come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nations leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world. Let me also remind my colleagues that the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction or whim of any one person or administration. It was Congress that passed a law mandating that the National Climate Assessment be presented every four years. That law was called the Global Change Research Act of 1990. It passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush a Republican. \</doc>

New York, Nov 24 (IBNS): To bring the voice of the people to the upcoming Climate Change Conference in Poland (known by the shorthand ' COP 24 ', from 2 to 14 December), the United Nations has launched the 'People's Seat' initiative, calling millions of change advocates worldwide to submit messages for an address that will be delivered to leaders attending the conference, by renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough. This is an opportunity for people from across the globe, regardless of their nationality or circumstances, to be part of the most important discussion of this century; the unprecedented action needed to reach the Paris Agreement targets, said Sir David Attenborough. I encourage everyone to take their seats and to add their voice so that the Peoples Address truly represents a mix of voices from across the world, he added. The Peoples Seat initiative, launched by the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), calls for inputs for the address to be delivered during the opening plenary session of the COP24 , by Mr. Attenborough, on 3 December. Everyone and anyone who wants to add their message to voice the urgent need for action, can do so by using the hashtag #TakeYourSeat on Twitter. Michal Kurtyka, Secretary of State of Poland and incoming COP24 President, hailed the initiative, stressing that the conference wants to encourage openness, listening and the full participation of civil society in global efforts to tackle climate change. The call for global advocacy comes weeks after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a reportshowing how urgent and possible it still is to limit global warming to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. The report warned that if no action is taken, the world is headed towards a warming of over 3C. The aim of the COP 24 is to agree on a collective implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement, and raise ambitions to achieve its goals. The Peoples Address will also trigger the launch of another initiative to engage global citizens: the ActNow Bot via the United Nations Facebook Messenger account, recommending everyday actions like taking public transport and eating less meat and tracking the number of actions taken to highlight the impact that collective action can make on such a critical issue.

India, Dec. 29 -- The global climate change negotiation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is held periodically under the aegis of the Conference of Parties (CoP). The 24th CoP to the UNFCCC, COP24 , was held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14. After the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, the Katowice meet was the most significant. It was supposed to lay down the contours for climate change action plans. This year marked the deadline, as agreed by signatories of the Paris Agreement, to adopt a "work programme for the implementation" of commitments that were made in 2015. An analysis of the decision taken in CoP24 clearly indicates that the shadow of the US' withdrawal from the climate change talk is over. A new global leadership has emerged and India is leading from the front. Thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's leadership, his actions, determination and dynamism ensured that the commitments made at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21, reached the ultimate goal despite the many problems faced by our country, most important of them pertaining to the growth in population. The second most important leader in the global climate leadership is French President Emmanuel Macron, who readily agreed to Prime Minister Modi's proposal for setting up the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which was signed by both leaders earlier this year. More than 120 countries have become signatories to the ISA. In October 2018, more than 48 countries along with 25 heads of states attended the ISA conference that was hosted by India. Another reason for the progress of climate-related talks is the trust factor. Most low and middle income countries bestowed faith in Prime Minister Modi's capability to steer the climate change proceedings due to his stature as a global leader. The only other country that holds similar potential is China. But then, it suffers from trust deficit. It would be worthwhile to discuss some of the takeaways from the CoP24 and India's role in the successful conclusion of the climate change conference. Prior to this, we saw the then Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Jairam Ramesh, registering similar impact on India's idea of climate diplomacy. Ramesh also espoused the cause of the developing world. Global rules are necessary to ensure that every percentage of the emission released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be measured accurately. Currently, climate actions of rich nations for the pre-2020 period are being guided by the Kyoto Protocol. The UN climate change conference adopted a rulebook for the implementation of the Paris Agreement only after protracted negotiations. This deal is meant for climate action by all countries across the globe. Its success was explained by Michal Kurtyka, CoP24 president: "We have worked on this (Katowice) package for three years. With 200 countries in the room, it is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. But under these circumstances, every single step forward is a big achievement." The Katowice climate package includes guidelines that will operationalise the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. With this, countries can chalk out a roadmap for the implementation of the Paris Accord that covers the period from now till 2020. The Katowice package also includes guidelines for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow on from the current target of mobilising $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries. The other guidelines include how to conduct the global stock-taking of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023 and how to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology by the developed nations. The guidelines, known as the Paris rulebook, will promote trust among nations that all countries are playing their part in addressing the challenge of climate change. The word 'trust' signifies the most positive outcome of the Katowice Conference. However, issues that still have to be taken into account circle the use of cooperative approaches as well as the sustainable development mechanism, as contained in the Paris Agreement's Article 6. These would allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals through the use of so-called 'market mechanisms.' On this matter, the Paris Agreement recognises the need for global rules to safeguard the integrity of efforts of all countries. It is hoped that this issue will be decided in future meetings, and India is expected to play a key role. The Indian delegation reiterated its stand with overwhelming support that the Paris Climate Agreement was "non-negotiable" and there could be no compromise on the basic principles such as equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It effectively countered the attempts of rich countries, led by the US and the European Union, to dilute this provision. India stressed the need for using scientific findings on climate change and welcomed the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report, which said that human activities are estimated to have caused approximately one degrees celsius of global warming above the pre-industrial levels and are currently increasing at 0.2 degrees celsius per decade. India in its statement stood for the poor, marginalised and vulnerable communities as they are worst-hit by the vagaries of climate change. On the first day of CoP24 , India made it clear to the world that it was well on course to achieve all its climate targets much ahead of the deadline it set for itself. It asked its developed counterparts to meet their obligations, including those relating to providing financial and technological help to the developing countries. The Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a US-based organisation that conducts research and analysis on financial and economic issues related to energy and environment, showed that India was likely to attain the goal of having 40 per cent of its electricity generation coming from renewable sources by the year 2020, instead of the original target of 2030. It said that by the year 2027, renewable energies like solar, wind and biomass would generate about 275 GW of electricity, comprising 44 per cent of India's total power generation of 619 GW. Hydro and nuclear energy, which are also considered as clean sources of energy, would contribute another 80 GW or about 13 per cent. The Government, however, needs to take some more pro-active action, especially in tackling the landscape. This (because India is a tropical nation facing the vagaries of climate change) has already started affecting its landscape and consequently the livelihoods of the poor. It has caused uncertainty in agriculture and disturbed hydrological cycles. The Himalayan glaciers are receding and the flow of rivers originating from these glaciers is making the whole living scenario precarious. There is a need to adopt a holistic approach for the overall developmental process in which climate change mitigation and adaptation should be a collateral benefit. Otherwise, it will jeopardise the goals of sustainable development in the long run. Also, joint forest management must be made the central theme of the entire mitigation and adaptation procedure. It is to be hoped that the Government takes action on the suggested lines. (The writer is a Retired Civil Servant Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Dec. 4 -- Natural gas as a low-emission fuel for sustainable development and the advantages of gas in the light of the obligations under the Paris Agreement and the need to improve air quality are some of the topics that Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo will address during the COP24 climate summit held in Katowice. The company is an official partner of the conference. On December 10th, on the premises of the Polish Pavilion, it will host two debates attended by international experts. The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 "During this year's conference we would like to focus on using natural gas as a source of electricity and heat for industry and households and as a raw material for the industrial sector. Natural gas is a low-emission fuel that can become one of the most important and easily available solutions for quick improvement of air quality in towns and cities. It is for this reason that, as a partner of the event, we suggested that this issue be debated on during the COP24 climate summit," said Piotr Wozniak, President of the PGNIG Management Board. "Natural gas can also be used as a feedstock in the production of fuel for the transport sector. CNG used as a fuel for passenger cars may help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 23% compared with vehicles with gasoline engines. In the case of buses, lorries and maritime transport, we can cut carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 25%," added Piotr Wozniak. The debate on "Using natural gas to improve air quality" will be held at 2:00 pm on December 10th. The event will be hosted by Francois-Regis Mouton, EU Affairs Director at the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP). The list of speakers includes Piotr Wozniak, PGNiG's CEO, and Fatih Birol, Executive Director at the International Energy Agency. During the meeting, industry representatives will present solutions for improving air quality in the transport, heating and electricity generation sectors, while local government authorities will talk about the initiatives they take to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, designed to improve the quality of life for members of local communities. The second debate, entitled "Natural gas from conventional and unconventional sources as a low-emission fuel for the green economy" will also be held on December 10th, between 10:15 and 11:45 am. The debate, to be hosted by Scott Foster, Director of UNECE's Sustainable Energy Division, will be attended by Piotr Wozniak as well as experts from all over the world, including from the US, Norway, China and Australia, representing business circles, international organisations and academic communities. "During such an important event as the climate summit, we would also like to draw attention to other greenhouse gases, including methane, which is much more harmful than carbon dioxide. At the debate, we will demonstrate that controlled obtaining of methane prevents methane emissions, thus helping pursue the global climate policy," said Piotr Wozniak. The panellists will present the best practices for effective monitoring and management of methane emissions from the gas industry. The debate participants will adopt a broad approach to the subject and will discuss unconventional gas sources, which have considerable economic potential. "We will also talk about what the upstream sectors actually does to reduce methane emissions. We will show that the gas sector can operate effectively and with due consideration for the natural environment," added Piotr Wozniak. Source: PGNiG \</doc>

India, Dec. 6 -- UN estimates that cost of adaptation in developing countries will rise to $140-300 billion each year by 2030 Having delayed action on climate change well past advisable deadlines, our species is already under pressure to adapt to its impacts. Since we are on track to exceed the dangerous threshold of 1.5degC of warming, potentially as early as 2030, the need to adapt is only growing. This need is felt most by those who have contributed the least to the problem of climate change - the poor and vulnerable in developing countries. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated that by 2030, the cost of adaptation in developing countries will rise to $140-300 billion per year. In international negotiations, as in domestic policy, adaptation has to vie with mitigation for attention and resources. The Paris Agreement has a dedicated Article on the subject-Article 7-which requires countries to engage in domestic adaptation planning, and communicate their "priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and actions" to the international community. This reporting requirement is known as the Adaptation Communication (AC), and the Paris Agreement leaves it up to countries to agree on how regularly these ACs are to be submitted, and what they must contain. COP24 ), currently underway in Katowice, Poland. The draft Rulebook text currently contains sections on the Principles and Purposes of the AC, as well as an Annex which lists the information that the AC could contain. The list includes items such as 'National circumstances, including population, levels of development, legal frameworks and institutional arrangements', 'Expected impacts, risks and vulnerability assessments, and adaptive capacity', 'Adaptation priorities, policies, plans, actions, strategies, programmes, resilience-building activities','national goals related to adaptation, and expected results'. Most crucially, the list includes the following two elements  Implementation and adaptation support needs of developing country Parties, including the costs of meeting those adaptation needs  Indicative projected levels of public financial resources to be provided by developed country Parties to developing country Parties, including finance, technology and capacity building. These two elements are critical to establish a focused adaptation planning process. When national planners prepare reports, the instinct is to focus on what exists rather than systematically assess what is missing. When reporting on mitigation, the focus should naturally be on what each country is doing. With adaptation, however, we are currently operating in a situation of deep uncertainty. National planners know that adaptation to climate change is needed, but lack the capacity, resources or technology to identify and tackle specific adaptation needs. This has been referred to, by the UNEP among others, as the £daptation gap'. The purpose of the AC is to progressively identify and quantify this gap. The gaps at the national level need to be communicated at the international level, and developed countries are bound by the Paris Agreement to provide support to address them. The first element thus ensures that national planners focus on communicating needs. The second element is critical because developed countries would be reporting, in advance, how much support for adaptation they intend to commit. This enables planners in developing countries to anticipate and program their national adaptation actions. Negotiators in Katowice seem to be close to finding consensus on these elements of information to be reported in ACs. There is, however, more disagreement about the Principles section of the AC. The principles section contains a specific reference to 'common but differentiated responsibility' (CBDR), which some countries would like to see replaced by a general reference to the various foundational principles of the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. This is part of a long-standing move since the Paris Agreement to limit the number of references to CBDR in any decisions or negotiated documents. The long-term impact of this enforced silence on CBDR is difficult to ascertain. However, in a general sense, the aim of the Paris reporting requirements is to take climate policy beyond international negotiations and embed it in the routines of national planning. At present, national planners in developed countries are not adequately sensitized to the differentiated responsibility between nations for climate change. They are primarily concerned with domestic needs and politics. This new reporting requirement should push such planners to think about the risks facing vulnerable populations in developing countries, along with their own nation's role in contributing to those risks. Only then will the reporting requirement fulfil its purpose- to instigate enlightened domestic policy-making and action. If CBDR is not front-and-centre on the planners' list of principles to consider when preparing their reports, we will live in a world where climate change is a purely national problem, with occasional international meetings. The reality is that climate adaptation is very much a global collective action problem, with demands for equity and fairness at its core. It is hence not surprising that the section on Principles (and Purposes, which we analysed previously ) of ACs is drawing more debate than the section on actual information required. The challenge of 'operationalizing' the Paris Agreement while preserving its ethical core is alive and well in Katowice, for nine more days at least. Climate Adaptation cop24 katowice UN Framework .

United Nations, Dec. 12 -- Close to 100 Government ministers are negotiating a final deal on moving forward with climate action here at the United Nations COP24 conference in Poland. So, what is the goal? To agree a concrete plan to implement the historic 2015 Paris climate deal by mid-century. The stakes are high with numerous different pressure points. "We cannot fail in Katowice," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in the opening ceremony, on 3 December. A sentiment echoed by the President of COP24 , Micha Kurtyka, who stated: "Without success in Katowice, there is no success in Paris." In the French capital, three years ago, countries agreed to do everything they could to keep global temperature rises to well under 2degC above pre-industrial levels, and as close as possible to 1.5degC. Now, in Katowice, Poland - with 2018 chosen by the parties themselves as the deadline for the adoption of implementation guidelines or a "work programme" to move forward with - the 197 parties of the UN Climate Chance Convention (UNFCCC) are gathered to agree on how they will achieve the Paris commitments collectively, build trust among each nation, and bring the 2015 agreement to life. "Some might say that it will be a difficult negotiation. I know it is not easy. It requires a firm political will for compromise," said Mr Guterres during the opening ceremony. "But, for me, what is really difficult is to be a fisherman in Kiribati seeing his country at risk of disappearing, or a farmer or herder in the Sahel losing livelihoods and losing peace. Or being a woman in Dominica or any other Caribbean nation, enduring hurricane after hurricane destroying everything in its path." Historically, multilateral climate negotiations have been difficult, as countries often attempt to protect their national interests, including economic ones. That is why the commitments made in Paris were hailed as groundbreaking in many ways. In addition to the 2degC/1.5degC target, the deal included commitments to: ramp up financing for climate action, including financial support from industrialised nations to developing countries; develop national climate plans by 2020, with self-determined goals and targets; protect ecosystems, including forests; strengthen adaptation and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Agreeing on how to make all of the above happen, is a politically and technically complex matter that sometimes conflicts with a variety of local realities, country categorisations, scientific questions, money issues, and ultimately, brings into question the ever-so complicated notion of trust among nations. The first point of tension here is that some countries feel the need for global action more acutely than others. Take the plight of small island nations, for example, and areas of extreme weather activity such as the Sahel or the Polar regions. In addition, industrialised countries are considered to have benefitted for decades from an economy that had no limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, they should take the biggest responsibility when it comes to the global effort to reverse the trend. But then again, others contend that some currently developing nations, now have record emissions and that climate action responsibility should lie with them to a greater extent. The Paris Agreement achieved a delicate balance to bring all countries together. All countries, to varying degrees, have recognized that climate change is a global problem that requires a global response, and they have all showed the will to contribute to collective climate action efforts, as evidenced by the fact that 181 national climate action plans with self-determined targets have been submitted to the UN to date. However, as countries face different realities, with various levels of economic and social development, the actions and obligations of the 197 parties need to be differentiated accordingly, especially when it comes to the financing of climate action - these are known as "common but differentiated responsibilities". At COP24 , a lot of the discussion centres around how to accommodate and handle these different realities fairly for all parties, while ensuring that the greatest and most ambitious climate action possible, can be undertaken. The Climate Change Convention, adopted in 1992, divides its 197 parties into two main groups: the industrialized group of 43 nations, and the developing group of 154, including 49 "least developed countries". Because the two groups were established more than 25 years ago, and taking into account that national socio-economic situations have evolved over time, some parties feel that the composition of these groups should be reassessed as we look to implement the Paris commitments. However, there is no process to change this grouping - and none is planned or anticipated - another complex point for this COP. To facilitate the political discussions and ground them in fact, various scientific reports are being considered at COP24 . One of them is last October's landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C, prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), drawn up by hundreds of scientists from around the world. The report, commissioned as part of the Paris Agreement, states that limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5degC by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial era, remains possible, but will require an "unprecedented" shift in every aspect of our societies. While all countries acknowledge the need to tackle climate change, one of the debates here at the COP is whether the IPCC report should be officially "welcomed" or merely "noted." This seemingly small language technicality raises a critical question: to what degree should policy be based on science? It also signals a difference on how urgently and intensely various countries want to engage in climate action moving forward. Climate action - which requires new technology, infrastructure and skills - represents a cost that some nations, especially the least developed and most vulnerable, cannot carry alone. In Paris, donor nations committed to mobilising $100 billion every year to fund climate action in developing countries, starting in 2020. This figure would include public and private contributions, which renders the reporting quite complex. Countries are arguing on how close we are to meeting that target and whether it will be met by 2020. Another burning issue is the lack of clarity over what constitutes "climate finance", as many countries report some of their "development aid" as "climate action aid". This lack of clarity complicates the discussions considerably, and questions regarding reporting, transparency and accountability are on the table. All the countries recognize the need for guidelines to be in place, so they can move on to implementing the Paris Agreement, and they are all mindful of the 2018 deadline. However, if we are to course-correct fast and well, efforts and investments are required - including in economic transition, ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, technology exchange and knowledge-sharing. What it all comes down to, is the ephemeral trust among nations, an important element that can only be realized if tangible transparency measures are in place. "We have no time for limitless negotiations," said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. "A completed work programme will unleash the potential of the Paris Agreement. It will build trust and make clear that countries are serious about addressing climate change," he stressed. The conversations on reporting and evaluation, with the potential set-up of peer review systems, are very challenging. The negotiations on all of these issues are meant to last until the end of the week. "Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome," said the head of the UNFCCC secretariat, Patricia Espinosa, as she launched the high-level segment on Tuesday. "But I believe it's within our grasp to finish the job," she stated confidently to the dozens of decision-makers gathered together in the conference hall.

New York, Dec. 13 -- Major organizations from the world of sport are joining an increasing number of private sector businesses in the race to beat global warming. At the United Nations COP24 conference in Poland on Wednesday, 17 major players representing sporting bodies, athletes and fans, added their names to the collective scoreboard, with the launch of the Sports Climate Action Framework. COP24 is a two-week conference that has brought together the 197 parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), as well as activists, non-profits organisations, and the private sector, to define the guidelines to implement the historic 2015 Paris climate action agreement, aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2C compared to pre-industrial levels. The 17 the represent the starting line-up of the Sports Climate Action Framework, include major players like the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Other signatories include the French tennis federation, Roland Garros, Formula E, the International Sailing Federation, organizers of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, the Rugby League World Cup 2021, and the World Surf League. With its global reach, universal appeal and the power to inspire and influence millions of people around the globe, sport is uniquely placed to drive global climate action and encourage crowds to join in, said Prince Albert II of Monaco, who chairs the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission, during the launch event in Katowice. As countries here in Katowice prepare to turn their climate commitments into reality, we stand ready to leverage the power of sport to support their efforts, he stressed. The sports industry bears responsibility for extensive carbon emissions on several fronts; including through travel, overall energy use, venue construction, and catering. With this initiative, it recognizes the need to unite behind a set of principles to get on track for a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. We recognize the critical need for everyone to help implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the change needed to reach greenhouse gas emission neutrality in the second half of the 21st century, said FIFA Secretary-General Fatma Samoura. The sentiment is echoed by UEFAs President Aleksander ?eferin: Climate change is the biggest challenge facing the planet. UEFA firmly believes that football, with its strong and ever-growing environmental conscience, in particular in areas such as sustainable event management, has a duty to play a role in addressing this issue. The result of a collaboration between the representatives of various sports organisations and the UN, the Framework not only aims to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emission stemming from sports operations, it also calls for leveraging the popularity of sporting role-models, and the passion of many fans, to help change public opinion about the dangers of irreversible climate change. You know playing in five different World Cups for my country, its one of those things. But at some point, as an athlete, you start to see the platform that you have, and you see your voice is for a reason, and the power of using it, former football goalkeeper and UNICEF Ambassador, Karina LeBlanc, told UN News. Whether you have a reach of Cristiano Ronaldo with 360 million followers or youre a teacher who has a classroom of kids, its about starting the conversation, on how we can all impact change And the idea of being in a race, with everybody being in the same team, I think thats what inspires me, she explained. Some concrete initiatives have already seen the light of day. The IOC, in collaboration with the UNFCCC secretariat, has produced two guides: Sustainability Essentials: Sports for Climate Action and Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, meant to provide essential climate action guidance to sports federations and others. In early 2019, the adopters of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be invited to form working groups to plan, pursue and enhance work under 16 principles laid out in the Framework.

The 24th annual UN Climate Negotiations ( COP24 ) concluded. During the talks, countries met to hash out the details of the Paris Agreement rulebook, which will provide guidance for the implementation of the landmark climate deal. To date, Donald Trump is still the only world leader to announce his intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016, has been signed by every nation on earth. The earliest Trump will be able to complete his withdrawal from the deal is November 4, 2020, one day after the next U.S. Presidential election. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: Theres simply no debate; fossil fuels have no place in a liveable future. While Donald Trump may seek to further isolate the U.S. on the world stage, leaders from across the globe continue to work together to tackle the climate crisis. At a time when science makes it clear that we have only 12 years to deeply cut carbon pollution to avoid climate chaos, the climate negotiations have continued to bring the world together to move towards a sustainable climate and healthy communities. Following yet another year of devastating and historic hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts, it has been the unstoppable power of people that has continued to drive climate progress, from retiring more than half of the U.S. coal fleet to moving cities to 100 percent clean energy. The American people are joined by the rest of the world in signaling that they will not tolerate any more of Trumps shameful blustering and inaction, and they have taken up the mantle of climate action while Trump abdicates any semblance of global leadership. The Sierra Club is proud to continue to join with allies in the movement driving that progress and ensure the transition to clean energy leaves no one behind. \</doc>

Dec. 19 -- The UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland, concluded this weekend with agreement by 196 countries on plans for a common rulebook for bringing the Paris Agreement into force by 2020. The rulebook outlines how governments should report their greenhouse gas emissions and contributions to climate finance, as well as rules about voluntary market mechanisms such as carbon trading. Governments also agreed to revise and enhance their climate action commitments, as described in so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), before 2020. Representatives of IHA and its member organisations led discussions about hydropower's contribution to climate change solutions, the highlight of which was the launch by Itaipu Binacional and the United Nations of a new Global Network of Sustainable Water and Energy Solutions. "For the sake of our future generations, the time to act is now," said IHA Chief Executive Richard Taylor, a member of the Global Network's steering committee, as he commended the Brazilian-Paraguayan hydropower operator and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs for the new initiative. Jose Alberto Alderete Rodriguez, Itaipu's Paraguayan Director-General, called on more organisations to be engaged to "combat climate change". "It is time to act, to move from commitment to practice, and this is the vision we have," he said. "Itaipu works for the border region of Brazil and Paraguay, and for the world, especially to improve capacities in water and energy management, which is fundamental to promote sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 2030," added Marcos Stamm, the organisation's Brazilian Director General. As a member of the International Renewable Energy Alliance (REN Alliance), IHA also participated in a joint side event on 11 December looking at the changes required to the global power sector if governments are to deliver the Paris Agreement. "The energy transition means a fundamental transformation of the way we, as a global society, use, supply, buy and sell electricity," said IHA Senior Analyst Mathis, as he outlined hydropower's contribution in enabling countries such as Portugal and Costa Rica to achieve 100 per cent renewable electricity in 2018. Pumped storage, floating photovoltaics and innovative co-location projects are all supporting growth in variable renewables, Mr Rogner noted, with hydropower continuing to innovate with digitalisation supporting new "smart" grids. "This will help hydropower evolve and do a better job of balancing variable renewables," he added. During the conference, IHA and the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Council, a coalition of industry, civil society, governments and financial institutions, also launched new Hydropower Sustainability Guidelines on Good International Industry Practice. The 26 guidelines define expected sustainability performance around a range of environmental, social, technical and governance topics relevant to hydropower.

Money has been central to many a fight at the climate negotiations. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the mother agreement of 1992 under which climate talks have been taking place, requires a group of rich and developed countries to, apart from other things, provide financial assistance to developing nations to deal with climate change, because it was the (now) rich world's emissions over the last 150 years that caused the climate problem in the first place. For many years, the fight was to get the developed countries to commit themselves, in writing, to providing this money. That happened, after a lot of struggle, at the 2015 climate meeting in Paris - even though the $100 billion figure, which the developed countries agreed to "mobilise" for the developing nations every year from 2020, was not mentioned in the Paris Agreement itself, but was part of other decisions taken at the meeting. But the written commitment has not ended the fight, and has not assured developing countries a steady supply of at least $100 billion from 2020. The fight is playing out in various ways - and it is among the most contentious issues at the ongoing meeting in Katowice, where countries are trying to agree on the rules that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Transparency Framing the rulebook means agreeing on such things as common standards to measure emissions, processes for monitoring, reporting and verification ('MRV' in climate jargon) of the various actions being taken by individual countries, and guidelines and institutions to facilitate diffusion of appropriate technologies to countries and regions that need them. It also means putting in place clear and transparent accounting mechanisms to measure and verify flows of climate finance. How to agree on processes that will ensure transparency, especially on the issues of finance, is a subject of major discussion here, and a significant faultline. Developed and developing nations have been arguing over what can constitute adequate levels of transparency, and how much information about finance flows needs to be mandatorily reported. The Paris Agreement makes it incumbent upon developed countries to communicate every two years, in advance, "indicative quantitative and qualitative information" on the money they would provide to the developing countries. It also makes it mandatory to provide "transparent and consistent information" every two years on money finally delivered. Poor track record The track record of the developed countries in fulfilling their finance commitments has been disappointing. They have often been accused by developing countries of double-counting, inflating claims, re-packaging existing aid money as climate finance, and ignoring the requirements of adaptation activities. Developing countries insist that climate finance must be "new and additional" and must be provided for mitigation as well as adaptation efforts as mentioned in the Paris Agreement. Developed countries have at various times made optimistic claims about the money that has already started to flow in. A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) claimed in 2015 that nearly $62 billion in climate finance had flown in until the previous year. In response, India had put out a discussion paper saying a more credible figure was just $2.2 billion. Another OECD report, which came out last month, said money flowing from developed to developing countries, just from government sources, had increased from $37.9 billion in 2013 to $54.5 billion in 2017 - 44% over five years. However, the UNFCCC's Standing Committee on Finance has said in a recent report that the total climate finance - not just from government sources - was $33 billion in 2015 and $38 billion in 2016, and that the rate of year-on-year increase had actually declined from 24% in 2015 to 14% in 2016. The report did not provide figures for 2017. Money flows through multilateral institutions like the Green Climate Fund have also stagnated. Even the initial offer of $10 billion has not been fulfilled because of the decision of the US to walk out of the Paris Agreement. The promised replenishments are still to materialise. A recent discussion paper by the Indian government noted that only about 12% of the total pledges to multilateral climate funds had actually materialised into disbursements. Scaling up While even the promised money is not coming through, developing countries have been pointing out that the $100 billion amount was woefully inadequate to meet climate challenges, and have been asking that this be increased significantly. The $100 billion figure was not reached as a result of any careful analysis of requirements. It came in the form of an ad hoc announcement from then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and seemed intended more to infuse confidence in the system after the near-collapse of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009. Several estimates after that have variously assessed the requirements to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars to trillions of dollars per year. The recent Indian discussion paper notes that just adding up the requirements of countries, as mentioned in their climate action plans submitted to the UN climate body, came to around $4.4 trillion. "... This goal of USD 100 billion is a meagre amount in size in contrast to the actual needs assessed for developing countries in trillions of dollars," the Indian discussion paper says. What is more, the term "mobilise" means that developed countries actually have to provide only a fraction of the $100 billion from their own resources. Every dollar that they actually provide "mobilises" some money, often more than a dollar, from the host country, either in the form of government collaboration or as private investment. But the entire money is said to have been "mobilised" by the developed countries. New At The Climate Summit: Katowice Commitment COP24 summit. "We, five international banks with a combined loan book of over E2.4 trillion, believe banks have an important role to play in scaling and accelerating the transition toward a climate-resilient world. From Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi we commit to measure the climate alignment of our lending portfolio, and to explore ways to progressively steer financial flows through our core lending towards the goals of the Paris Agreement," said an 'Open letter from global banks to world leaders, heads of government and the international community at COP24 '. The Katowice Commitment is "Co-created", "Impact-driven", "Engagement-focused", "Sector-specific", "Forward-looking", and "Science-based". Besides ING, the Commitment was made by the Spanish group BBVA, French groups Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, and London-headquartered Standard Chartered. New At The Climate Summit: Electromobility partnership Recognising that the transport sector is already responsible for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and in view of the projected challenges from rapid urbanisation around the world, progressive globalisation, and increased movement of people and freight, the Polish presidency of COP24 on Wednesday proposed a policy push towards electromobility and zero-emission transport. Poland and the UK jointly presented Driving Change Together - Katowice Partnership for Electromobility, "one of the concrete dimensions of implementation of the Paris Agreement and fulfilment of the Global Climate Action objectives". The Declaration has been signed by 40 countries including, besides Poland and the UK, China, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, France, and Germany. India is not among the signatory countries. Thirteen international and nongovernmental organisations, including the World Bank and The Climate Group, are also among the signatories. The Partnership was established in the main Plenary Hall. The Declaration endorsed several steps to accelerate the transition to low emission vehicles, including "driving demand through consumer initiatives" and "collaborating internationally to promote the deployment of ZEVs (zero-emission vehicles) on a global scale", and to enable the growth of the market by "building a smart infrastructure network, planning for the cities of the future today, embedding zero-emission infrastructure into the fabric of our urban and rural communities", and "driving up air quality standards in our towns and cities". It underlined support to "zero-emission R&D, investing to improve and develop new zero emission technologies", and the promotion of a "sustainable, circular economy to drive down emissions over the long term". \</doc>

How nuclear power can be part of an integrated solution to provide low carbon energy for growing urban centres was the focus of a side event held at the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice. Hosted by several United Nations agencies, the side event Clean and Affordable Energy for Sustainable Urbanization and Development underscored how reliable access to energy in smart and mega cities requires transition to cost-effective, low-carbon ways of electricity generation. Participants discussed the connection between two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Goal 7 (ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) and Goal 11 (making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and debated lessons learned in responding to urban energy challenges. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCC) 1.5 Celsius Special Report, released in October, highlighted that limiting the temperature increase from pre-industrial times to 1.5 C will require immediate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Both the report and the event underlined that achieving rapid decarbonization of the global electricity sector will require, at first, the deployment of proven large capacity power technologies, such as nuclear power. To meet the 1.5 C target, the four emission model pathways highlighted in the Summary for Policymakers project an increase in nuclear power generation between 98% and 501% by 2050, relative to 2010. With electricity demand expected to rise sharply in the coming years, this is undoubtedly where nuclear can come into play, noted IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov. The 2015 Paris Agreement and the recent IPCC Report, underlines the immediate need for scaling up all clean, low-carbon technologies such as nuclear power. If nuclear power deployment doesnt expand in line with this scenario, the other technologies may not fill the gap and Member States may not meet their climate targets. To date, various IAEA conferences and publications have stated that nuclear power can make a vital contribution to meeting growing energy demand needed for development, while also helping meeting climate change targets. Without nuclear power, it will be difficult to meet global climate goals, concluded scientists, economists and policymakers at the IAEAs Scientific Forum on the topic in September. With the global urban population expected to grow by around 1 billion by 2030, and an increasing proportion living in dense mega cities, the share of greenhouse gas emissions from such urban centres is expected to rise. Developing effective national energy strategies is crucial to meet a countrys expanding and/or shifting energy needs. The IAEA is committed to helping Member States with practical solutions for their energy planning needs. \</doc>

Womens voice is critical, from local to the national, in planning and implementation. We must ensure women are given the skills tools and finance to address the climate change challenge, Mafalda Duarte, Head of the Climate Investment Funds, urged attendees Monday, at a side-event at the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ). COP24 taking place in Katowice, Poland. As the continents premier development partner, the Bank is helping African countries fast track green, inclusive and sustainable development and deliver on their goals for climate action. Several interventions have been implemented to increase inclusivity and ensure sustainable development in line with the Ten-Year Strategy, High 5 Priority Areas, Gender Strategy and Second Climate Change Action Plan. The side event brought together stakeholders to dialogue on progress made, opportunities and challenges faced when integrating gender considerations into African NDCs. Participants shared best practices on how gender-responsive climate policy and actions that can enhance climate resilience and provide economic benefits to communities - especially for the most disadvantaged, women and girls. Entry points and best approaches for integrating gender equality into NDCs and other relevant national planning and budgeting processes were explored. The event provided an opportunity to identify partnership opportunities with other development partners for investment and technical assistance and best approaches for implementing gender sensitive actions to enhance climate resilience and provide socio-economic benefits to communities. Many African countries are grappling with the process of gender mainstreaming, and lack guidance at the national level on how to do so. This a challenge for Africa, and must be addressed through policy dialogue so that NDCs and other climate actions are designed and implemented in a gender-responsive process. Effective implementation of gender-responsive climate change initiatives rests on an inclusive approach taking into account the needs, interests and vulnerabilities of women, men and youth from the conceptual phase, through to program design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In 2015, the international community adopted two major Agendas: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement. Gender equality and womens concerns are embedded in both agreements. A multi-pronged approach is required for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs in order to achieve transformational change in countries - and low-emission, climate resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development. George Wamukoya of African Working Group on Gender and Climate Change (AWGGCC) suggested the year 2020 provides ample opportunity for African countries to update their NDCs and mainstream gender. The side-event was organized by the African Development Bank Gender, Women and Civil Society Department, in partnership with: African Working Group on Gender and Climate Change (AWGGCC); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Other co-organisers included Women in Global Science and Technology (WISAT); World University Service of Canada (WUSC); International Development Research Centre (IDRC); and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Gender Office (GGO). \</doc>

New York, Dec 16 (IBNS): After two weeks of crunch negotiations - with overtime - the almost 200 parties gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the United Nations COP24 two-week climate change conference, adopted on Saturday a "robust" set of implementing guidelines for the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, aimed at keeping global warming well below 2C compared to pre-industrial levels. Following several sleepless nights, cheers and applause welcomed the COP24 President, Michal Kurtyka, as he opened the conferences closing plenary meeting, which had been postponed close to a dozen times. He thanked the hundreds of delegates in the room for their patience, noting that the last night was a long night. General laughter followed when the rooms big screens showed a delegate yawning whole-heartedly; the meeting had been set to wrap up on Friday. Katowice has shown once more the resilience of the Paris Agreement our solid roadmap for climate action, said Patricia Espinosa, who heads the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat and who was speaking on behalf of Antnio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. Guterres, who has made addressing the impacts of climate change one of the top priorities of his term as UN Secretary-General, came three times to Katowice in the past two weeks to support the negotiations but, given the repeated delays, was forced to leave before the closing plenary, due to prior engagements. The adopted guidelines package, called the rulebook by some, is designed to encourage greater climate action ambition and benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. Trust and climate action financing One of the key components of the Katowice package is a detailed transparency framework, meant to promote trust among nations regarding the fact that they are all doing their part in addressing climate change. It sets out how countries will provide information about their national action plans, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures. An agreement was reached on how to uniformly count greenhouse gas emissions and if poorer countries feel they cannot meet the standards set, they can explain why and present a plan to build up their capacity in that regard. On the thorny question of financing from developed countries in support of climate action in developing countries, the document sets a way to decide on new, more ambitious targets from 2025 onwards, from the current commitment to mobilize US$100 billion per year as of 2020. Another notable achievement of these negotiations is that nations agreed on how to collectively assess the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to monitor and report progress on the development and transfer of technology. The guidelines that delegations have been working on day and night are balanced and clearly reflect how responsibilities are distributed amongst the worlds nations, said Ms. Espinosa in a press statement. They incorporate the fact that countries have different capabilities and economic and social realities at home, while providing the foundation for ever increasing ambition. While some details will need to be finalised and improved over time, the system is to the largest part place, she added. Ultimately, the negotiations tripped on one key issue which will be back on the table at the next UN climate change conference, COP25, set to take place in Chile. This is the matter known in specialized circles as Article 6, regarding the so-called market mechanisms which allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals. This is done for example through carbon markets or carbon trading, which enables countries to trade their emissions allowances. The Paris Agreement recognizes the need for global rules on this matter to safeguard the integrity of all countries efforts and ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. Other key COP24 achievementsFrom the beginning of the COP, it very quickly became clear that this was one area that still required much work and that the details to operationalize this part of the Paris Agreement had not yet been sufficiently explored, explained Ms. Espinosa, noting that the majority of countries were willing to agree and include the guidelines on market mechanisms but that unfortunately, in the end, the differences could not be overcome. In addition to the political negotiations among Member States on the Paris guidelines, over the past two weeks, the hallways of COP24 buzzed with close to 28,000 participants having lively exchanges, sharing innovative ideas, attending cultural events, and building partnerships for cross-sectoral and collaborative efforts. Many encouraging announcements, especially on financial commitments for climate action, were made: Germany and Norway pledged that they would double their contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established to enable developing countries to act; the World Bank also announced it would increase its commitment to climate action after 2021 to $200 billion; the climate Adaptation Fund received a total of $129 million. The private sector overall, showed strong engagement. Among the highlights of this COP, two major industries the sports and the fashion worlds joined the movement to align their business practices with the goals of the Paris Agreement, through the launch of the Sports for Climate Action Framework, and the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Many more commitments were made, and concrete, inspiring actions were taken. From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition, said Patricia Espinosa on behalf of UN chief Antnio Guterres at the closing planery. Ambition in mitigation. Ambition in adaptation. Ambition in finance. Ambition in technical cooperation and capacity building. Ambition in technological innovation. To achieve this, the UN Secretary-General is convening a Climate Summit on 23 September, at UN Headquarters in New York, to engage Governments at the highest levels. \</doc>

The EBRD will call for urgent action to step up the global fight against climate change at the COP24 international conference beginning on Monday in Poland. It will be the first major climate gathering since Octobers stark warning by UN scientists that time was running out for efforts to curb global warming. The two-week talks in Katowice, Poland, are the rulebook COP. The aim is determine the rules of implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to keep the average global temperature rise at well below 2C above pre-industrial temperatures, and to pursue efforts towards 1.5C. The report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in October, called for unprecedented efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C, which would require rapid and drastic reductions to reach net zero emissions by 2050. If global temperatures continue to rise at the present rate, the report forecast that the earths average temperature could rise 1.5C as soon as 2030 and 3C by the end of the century, causing irreversible damage to the environment. The IPCC special report brings a new sense of urgency to act decisively both in terms of scale and timing, said Josu Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change. In Katowice, the international community needs to reflect this by accelerating climate action, and to ensure that the Paris goals become reality. The EBRD is on track with its climate finance commitments made in Paris in 2015, and together with other MDBs (Multilateral Development Banks) we are working on shaping a future in line with the Paris Agreement. This work, and the results it brings, are more acutely needed than ever, he added. In 2015, the EBRD pledged to increase the volume of its green financing to 40 per cent by 2020. Its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach puts investments that bring climate and environmental benefits at the heart of its mandate. In 2017 it reached a record 43 per cent. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an important player in adaptation to climate change. In Katowice - where COP24 will bring together over 25,000 environment and climate change specialists from nearly 200 countries - the EBRD will report on progress in several areas in delivering its climate finance objectives. EBRD programmes that contribute towards Paris alignment include: EBRD Green Cities, a programme that identifies, prioritises and connects cities environmental challenges with sustainable infrastructure investments and policy measures. Cities already account for 70 per cent of energy use and 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and are major drivers of climate impacts; Green Economy Finance facilities (GEFFs), providing credit lines to financial institutions for on-lending to clients making green technology and energy efficiency investments; Work with individual countries on setting post-2020 climate action plans, known as as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs. The EBRD works with the NDC Partnership in delivering such assistance; Technology transfer mechanisms to increase the market penetration of climate technologies, such as the EBRDs Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change and Technology selector. As global thinking develops on how to meet the Paris requirements, the EBRDs experience supporting the reshaping of economies in carbon-intensive regions and its long-term emphasis on working with the private sector makes it a natural leader in several emerging areas of activity. The EBRD works closely with other MDBs in areas such as GHG accounting standards and climate finance tracking. As well as the EBRDs focus on energy efficiency, renewables and green cities, the Bank is now putting additional focus on climate adaptation. As the leading MDB for providing adaptation finance to the private sector, the Bank has a portfolio of more than 200 signed GET climate resilience investments. The EBRD is using its expertise in mobilising large volumes of private sector finance to boost green investment in climate mitigation and adaption. Working with multilateral donors including the European Union, Climate Investment Funds, Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility the EBRD has thus far raised over 1.5 billion in public financing, and leveraged this with over 18 billion in private financing. It has also been working with a range of partner organisations to advance thinking on measuring and disclosing climate-related financial disclosures. Technical sessions led by the EBRD at Katowice will discuss: scaling-up technology transfer; handling climate finance risk disclosure; new horizons for climate finance; supporting both potential winners and losers in the transition to the green economy; implementing green finance in COP24s host country Poland; supporting individual countries with NDCs; leveraging the private sector in cooperation with the Climate Funds (GCF, GEF and CTF); and good governance for Corporate Climate Disclosure. Since 2006, the EBRD has invested more than 28 billion in almost 1,600 projects leading to reductions in CO2 emission of more than 93 million tonnes per year. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 03 -- Delegates from nearly 200 nations began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important United Nations meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels. Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama declared the UN climate summit open yesterday and handed over the presidency of the talks to Michal Kurtyka, Poland's deputy environment minister. The COP24 climate summit will see nations try to agree on ways of implementing the promises they made in the 2015 Paris treaty to limit temperature rises to avert runaway global warming. Environment Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan is leading the Indian delegation at the conference. The government has said that the conference is crucial for India and the country is committed to fighting climate change constructively. Talking to AIR, Environment Secretary CK Mishra said, The CoP-24 is extremely important for us and also for the world. We will also expect that our concern of climate justice which our Prime Minister has been reiterating is taken care of. In our negotiations, we will try and touch on issues of differentiation, which is our concern, on issues of finance, on issues of adaptation and loss and damages. But we will play a very constructive role in trying to see that the world comes to an agreement at CoP-24 at Katowice. \</doc>

TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 6 -- Delta, a global provider of power and thermal management solutions, organized an official side event today, at the Katowice COP24 Climate Change Conference in Poland, to reflect on the role of distributed energy resources in advancing the energy resilience of cities. Delta's perspective as a technology provider was complemented in the event by the contributions of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and the Japan-based Renewable Energy Institute (REI). The executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, Mrs. Shan-Shan Guo, highlighted practical cases in which Delta has enabled distributed energy solutions capable of sustaining energy resilience. More than a hundred influential opinion leaders and policy makers from around the world offered valuable views during the event. While addressing the audience, Mrs. Shan-Shan Guo said, "The main benefits of distributed energy resources technology include demand response, peak shaving and load shifting. Delta's smart green solutions cover energy storage, building energy management and vehicle-to-home/vehicle-to-grid (V2H/V2G) EV charging that together can enable distributed energy applications to not only enhance the energy resilience of cities, but also to contribute to the net-zero emissions by 2055 target indicated in the latest IPCC Report." One of the practical cases of distributed energy resources enabled by Delta and currently enhancing the energy resilience of communities is the green campus of the Namasia Minchuan Elementary School in southern Taiwan. This eco-friendly facility integrates Delta's solar PV system, energy storage technology and energy management platform to allow for smooth demand response and peak shaving functions, thus, optimizing the benefits of the green power generated. During natural disasters, which commonly cause power blackouts in the area, the Namasia green campus can be powered by its energy storage system to serve as a shelter for the community, with more than an accumulated total of 5,000 people sheltered since its inauguration. The Namasia green campus and its underlying systems for distributed energy resources are being featured at Delta's exhibition booth at COP24 from December 3 to 7. Attaining the aforementioned net-zero emission target requires close cooperation between multiple stakeholders. On this occasion, Delta has set the agenda with its side event at COP24 , inviting world-class institutions to share their views on energy transition. Ms. Yuko Nishida, manager of the REI's Climate Change Group, echoed the significant contribution of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and distributed energy in cities. The ACEEE underscored its close teamwork with Delta in issuing a report that explains how to define policies that foster low-carbon transportation and buildings in certain cities in the U.S.A. In addition, the USGBC emphasized the value of net-zero energy building standards and the role of distributed energy resources therein. Lastly, C40 offered the audience cases in which cities across the globe have successfully taken substantial climate action. Delta has participated in the UN Climate Change Conference for twelve consecutive years. In its 2015 edition, COP21, held in Paris, France, Delta held its Green Building Exhibition at the Grand Palais, while its CEO, Mr. Ping Cheng, and its chief brand officer, Mrs. Shan-Shan Guo, joined world renowned experts in a roundtable event in the German Pavilion. In 2017, ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability), invited the Delta Electronics Foundation to share its experience in carbon reduction initiatives. This year, Delta Electronics Foundation led again the organization of an official side event to highlight how technology fosters lower carbon emissions. Source: Delta Group \</doc>

April 22 -- Polo Ralph Lauren on Thursday launched a version of its iconic polo shirt made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and dyed through a process that uses zero water. David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement that the new shirt is part of a broader strategy of fresh environmental goals throughout the manufacturing process. "Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference," Lauren said. The Polo isn't the first of its kind. Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average 12 bottles. The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture. The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos. Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it's putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June. "At the moment we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability," she said. Among the company's other goals: the use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100% recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year. Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment. Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP24 , in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action. As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is "much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean." The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said. "There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities," he said. "Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem? I think we're creating solutions, or at least trying to find solutions." \</doc>

The 24th annual conference of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 , opens on Monday, 3 December 2018, in Katowice, Poland. The Bank at the forefront of Climate Change and ready to ensure the voice of 54 African countries is heard. At the forefront of the fight against climate change in Africa, the African Development Bank, strongly represented in previous COP summits is, once again, present in Katowice to ensure that the voice of Africa is heard loud and clear in global climate negotiations. The Bank, representing Africas 54 nations, stands ready to defend the continent's interests on the international arena. At COP24 To this end, Amadou Hott, the Bank's Vice President for power, energy, climate change and green growth, will lead a delegation of climate change experts in various fields (water and sanitation, transport, urbanization and sustainable cities ...), able to shed light on the diversity and complexity of the issues raised by climate change. The Bank also has its own Pavilion, branded in its colors. An intense program, several conferences and daily round tables will be featured in the Pavilion, throughout the two weeks of the event. Africa, on the front line of climate change impact The degree of urgency is especially acute in the case of Africa, one of the regions of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as evidenced again by the terrible drought in East Africa in 2017 and the drought endured by South Africa in 2018. In the 10-year period from 1995 to 2015, the African continent has suffered 136 episodes of drought, 77 of which have been in East Africa alone. Drought, flood, rising sea levels, extreme weather events that threaten people's food security, "climate migrants" the list goes on, and the "bill" for climate change proves a high one for the African continent, despite its contributing less than 4% of world greenhouse gas emissions. Of the 10 countries in the world considered most threatened by climate change, 7 are in Africa: Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. And climate change is even responsible for shaving off 1.4 points of GDP in Africa every year. As the president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has repeatedly said, it is urgent to act. At stake: the future of the continent - and its development and most importantly, the survival of the entire planet. With climate change there are no winners and no losers. Either we all win together, or we all lose together, Adesina often says. COP24 will take place from 3 to 14 December 2018, in Katowice, Poland. \</doc>

As the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) begins, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to express grave concerns regarding his recent public comments with respect to the Trump Administrations release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPAs views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administrations response to its own report. If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating, wrote Senator Carper. This isnt an alarmist prediction. It doesnt come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesnt come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nations leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec. 10 -- White House representatives are arriving at climate talks in Poland on Monday to promote coal and other fossil fuels. It's expected that President Donald Trump's energy adviser, Wells Griffith, will take part in the COP24 The controversial meeting occurs as investors managing $32tn (&#38;#163;25tn) in assets call for an end to coal as a source of energy. Meanwhile, ministers from around 130 countries arrive here to try and steer the talks to a successful conclusion. Just as at last year's gathering in Bonn, the Trump White House is keen to show strong support for fossil fuels. According to a statement from the US State Department, the event will "showcase ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently as possible, as well as the use of emission-free nuclear energy". Last year's event was disrupted by singing protesters keen to point out that the pro-coal and gas lobby were not welcome at the UN event. This year's meeting has environmentalists questioning its relevance. "The event is going to further undermine the credibility of the US as a party in these talks," said Lou Leonard with WWF. The White House-endorsed event does indeed seem to be out of step with the wider conference, where green campaigners are likely be cheered by the news that 415 investors with around $32tn of assets under management are calling for greater action on climate change and an end to coal as a source of energy. Released here in Katowice, the global investor statement is said to be the largest intervention by investors on the issue of rising temperatures, and represents some of the world's biggest funds including Schroders plc, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Aberdeen Standard Investments and UBS Asset Management. "Despite the misguided policies of the Trump administration, global efforts to address the very real threat climate risk presents to the economy, financial markets and investment returns are ongoing," said Thomas P DiNapoli, the New York State Comptroller who oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund, responsible for a $207bn pension fund. "We are still in and remain committed to supporting the Paris Agreement's climate goals." Meanwhile ministers from around 130 countries are arriving in Katowice with significant challenges ahead to ensure a successful outcome. A serious row over science erupted at the weekend and has soured relationships between some delegates here. Negotiators from the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait refused to "welcome" the IPCC report on 1.5C that a huge majority of countries wanted to put at the heart of the talks. Researchers and campaigners were angered by the move. "The IPCC 1.5C report is the most important climate assessment of the 21st Century," said Prof Johan Rockstrom, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. "Yet four nations refused to 'welcome' this reality. This is wilfully ignorant and grossly negligent. As ministers meet this week for UN climate talks in Poland, they must push for this report to be at the heart of the conference." The view was echoed by other observers. "There's a huge amount of frustration," said Camilla Born, from environmental think tank E3G. "The world saw the IPCC report launched, and they understood that we need to do more, to act faster and harder and faster now. Its not going to go down well if we fail to welcome that science." The ministers will try and agree the outstanding issues on the rulebook for the Paris agreement - but there is also a sense that they need to go beyond that, to deliver more ambition to tackle the issue.

Dec. 13 -- High level political negotiations are ongoing at COP24 in Katowice, with countries struggling to reach agreement on the key elements of the Paris Agreement. In particular, the debate now centres on questions about the operational framework (the so-called 'rulebook') and level of ambition to be deployed by EU Member States in the effort to combat climate change. Speaking during a panel discussion in Katowice on EU Energy Day, WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson stressed the need for ambition in both investments and collaboration in Europe. The panel discussion aimed at addressing how the EU can keep its leading role in renewable energy in light of the significant growth in global competition. Dickson reminded the COP audience that wind is a free, reliable and local source of green electricity that contributes to energy security and independence while boosting the EU economy as it creates jobs and growth. He also noted the widespread consensus that wind energy is set to grow exponentially throughout Europe. The 173 GW of installed wind energy in the EU now satisfies 12% of the total EU power demand. But according to WindEurope's latest market outlook report, by 2022 there will be 253 GW of wind energy installed in Europe. And the IEA's most recent report says that wind energy will be Europe's number one power generation technology by 2027. Not only this, but the European Commission's 2050 Roadmap for decarbonisation says that wind energy will account for more than 50% of the EU's total power production in all EU decarbonisation scenarios. This makes wind "clearly the dominant technology" for EU energy by 2050. But this, Dickson warned, is no reason for complacency. With technological innovation and economies of scale, costs of wind energy are sharply decreasing. And this rapid cost reduction is putting pressure on the entire wind energy supply chain. The industry is importing more and more components from China and other economies while outsourcing ever more of the production of key elements - such as gearboxes - to emerging economies. To make sure the EU stays at the forefront globally and is a true leader in renewables, we need to support the wind industry in the EU with the right volumes and a clearly visible pipeline for future installations. This is where the upcoming National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) play a key role. We must avoid 'stop-and-go' scenarios in wind energy deployment to ensure the supply chain can develop smoothly. Dickson was also clear on the need to support R&D activities in sectors and processes that are important to an economy-wide decarbonisation such as storage and electrification. Balancing a system dominated by variable renewables will require increasing amounts of storage. Power-to-X via electrolysis, for example, has enormous potential but requires EU investment. Dickson's calls for ambition - indeed the entirety of the COP24 debates - stand in a highly charged context: the recent IPCC Special Report has warned of irremediable damages to our planet and our society with a mere 0.5 difference in global warming. Calls for ambition have been echoed by EU Commissioner for Climate Action, Miguel Arias Canete, together with several EU and non-EU governments. In the form of a 'High Ambition Coalition' - an initiative initiated in Paris - Canete is now asking all countries to raise their ambition to fight against global warming and climate change and to acknowledge 1.5C as the new target.

The curtain has fallen on COP24 , this years global climate summit held in Katowice, Poland. However, negotiations continued throughout the weekend to reach agreement on specific parts of the 'rulebook' to be applied from 2020 by the 197 signatories of the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming to 2C-1.5C relative to pre-industrial levels. Intense negotiations, modest progress, determined African negotiators For two years, the 50 African countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement focused on the need to construct a specific, transparent framework for climate finance. African negotiators including the AGN, supported by the Bank have also been negotiating to have developed countries, largely responsible for gloabal warming, to implement their commitments. Developed countries are required to help developing countries conduct their ecological transition in line with the Paris Agreement made in December 2015. The Bank fulfils its role as Africas spokesperson and leader During the two weeks of the conference, the African Development Bank assumed its role as primary champion of African interests and a steadfast supporter of African negotiators. Iin addition to its role as purveyor of knowledge, experience and expertise, it organised 50 panel discussions and conferences at its Pavilion, which bubbled with a wealth of views shared by 30 experts who led discussions across the subject of climate change in all its dimensions: water and sanitation, agriculture and forestry, transport and urban development. The gender dimension, the role of civil society and the private sector, meteorology and related technologies, renewable energy and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions, were other topics discussed. COP24 activity with Africa Day, organized in collaboration with the African Union, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and NEPAD. And it closed its Pavilions doors on the last day of the Summit with an equally symbolic event a debate that brought together young leaders from the continent and elsewhere, journalists, experts and activists, all actors in the fight against climate change. The Bank is more resolved than ever to continue its work to combat climate change in Africa and its advocacy work to defend the continent's interests. Combating climate change: never give up "We see women who are losing their livelihoods; we see hungry children; we see communities reduced to dust by tornadoes and hurricanes. That's what motivates us, that drives us, that makes us redouble our efforts to work to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on our communities," said Anthony Nyong, Director of the Bank's Climate Change and Green Growth Department at COP24 . Because the urgency is right there... the final decision of the COP 'insists on the urgency of greater ambition', but it does not lay down any time span and this does not bode well for developing countries in general or for African countries in particular, since they are among the most affected in the world by climate change. So, COP25, to be held in Chile, is already in our diaries. For the African Development Bank, the 'fight' continues and the Bank is determined to stay on the front line - allways defending the interests of its 54 Member States and their people. \</doc>

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in Poland, 15 international organizations jointly announced a commitment to make their operations climate neutral. The organizations will measure their greenhouse gas emissions, reduce them as much as possible and compensate the currently unavoidable ones with credible carbon credits. With over 2 million tons of CO2 per year in emissions, and more than 50,000 staff, the aggregate action by this organizations represents an important example that may be taken at all levels of society. Some of the participating organizations have already achieved climate neutrality, while others are getting started in this journey. Still others were advanced in their sustainability strategy and are now going further by committing to go all the way to climate neutrality. Through this commitment, it is expected that organizations with more experience will support those that are at the early stages and that best practices will be shared. This initiative demonstrates the commitment of the participating organizations to climate action, while serving as inspiration for others to follow suit and contribute to the goal to achieve global climate neutrality before the end of this century, as established in the Paris Agreement. The international organizations that announced their commitment to climate neutrality are: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Secretariat Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa Secretariat (COMESA) Eastern Africa Development Bank (EADB) Western Africa Development Bank (BOAD) Asian Development Bank (ADB) Pacific Community ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability European Investment Bank (EIB) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) These organizations join agencies throughout the United Nations (UN) system which in 2007 adopted a strategy and a roadmap to reach climate neutrality by 2020. Over half of all UN system entities are now climate neutral, representing 39% of total UN emissions as featured in the 2018 Greening the Blue report. The UN Headquarters is also becoming climate neutral for the first time in 2018. Some of the actions that these organizations are implementing to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions include the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, policies for reduction of air travel, upgrading of insulation and lighting systems in buildings, reduction of the amount of paper used at conferences, installation of efficient cooling systems, promotion of car-pooling schemes among employees, establishment of sustainable procurement policies, and enhanced collection and recycling of waste, among many others. The ambition is that other international organizations will join this commitment in the near future, helping multiply the message of the importance of taking immediate action at all levels of society to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. \</doc>

Deltas smart green solutions cover energy storage, building energy management and vehicle-to-home/vehicle-to-grid (V2H/V2G) EV charging that together can enable distributed energy applications to not only enhance the energy resilience of cities, but also to contribute to the net-zero emissions by 2055 target indicated in the latest IPCC Report. One of the practical cases of distributed energy resources enabled by Delta and currently enhancing the energy resilience of communities is the green campus of the Namasia Minchuan Elementary School in southern Taiwan. This eco-friendly facility integrates Deltas solar PV system, energy storage technology and energy management platform to allow for smooth demand response and peak shaving functions, thus, optimizing the benefits of the green power generated. During natural disasters, which commonly cause power blackouts in the area, the Namasia green campus can be powered by its energy storage system to serve as a shelter for the community, with more than an accumulated total of 5,000 people sheltered since its inauguration. The Namasia green campus and its underlying systems for distributed energy resources are being featured at Deltas exhibition booth at COP24 from December 3 to 7. Attaining the aforementioned net-zero emission target requires close cooperation between multiple stakeholders. On this occasion, Delta has set the agenda with its side event at COP24 , inviting world-class institutions to share their views on energy transition. Ms. Yuko Nishida, manager of the REIs Climate Change Group, echoed the significant contribution of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and distributed energy in cities. The ACEEE underscored its close teamwork with Delta in issuing a report that explains how to define policies that foster low-carbon transportation and buildings in certain cities in the U.S.A. In addition, the USGBC emphasized the value of net-zero energy building standards and the role of distributed energy resources therein. Lastly, C40 offered the audience cases in which cities across the globe have successfully taken substantial climate action. Delta has participated in the UN Climate Change Conference for twelve consecutive years. In its 2015 edition, COP21, held in Paris, France, Delta held its Green Building Exhibition at the Grand Palais, while its CEO, Mr. Ping Cheng, and its chief brand officer, Mrs. Shan-Shan Guo, joined world renowned experts in a roundtable event in the German Pavilion. In 2017, ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability), invited the Delta Electronics Foundation to share its experience in carbon reduction initiatives. This year, Delta Electronics Foundation led again the organization of an official side event to highlight how technology fosters lower carbon emissions. \</doc>

Luxembourg, Dec. 14 -- During COP24 taking place in Katowice, Poland, Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP) officially signed an investment of EUR 5 million to the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to support the fund&#8217;s lending for energy efficiency, resource efficiency and renewable energy measures in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Serving as a risk cushion, this investment helped the fund to attract further private investors, thus enhancing its outreach and impact. This operation was first committed at a ceremony held during COP 23, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Since then, GGF&#8217;s outstanding portfolio in the MENA region has grown stronger to over EUR 110 million spread across 14 partner institutions and has generated cumulative sub-loans of over EUR 60 million. This existing portfolio is yielding estimated annual primary energy savings of 460,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of around 90,000 metric tons. Part of the portfolio has been developed thanks to the planned Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform support, and it already exceeds the targets set at the time of the initial announcement in Bonn. Founded in late 2016, the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform aims to fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits, thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The platform contributes to Luxembourg&#8217;s international commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and is in line with the EIB&#8217;s Climate Strategy.

New York, Dec 15 (IBNS): Africa is at a "tipping point" as global warming increases, and urgent action needs to be taken across the continent now, to mitigate risks and safeguard a decade of social and economic gains, according to a new report launched on Thursday by the United Nations Development Agency (UNDP) at the COP24 climate conference, in Katowice, Poland. For two weeks, the conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with one key objective: adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the 2015 Paris Agreement, when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels. Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of UNDPs Africa Bureau made the tipping point analogy, while noting that despite major structural inequalities, nations across the continent have achieved impressive economic, political and social growth in recent decades. But she argues that climate change, droughts, floods, changing rainfall patterns and conflict have the potential to unravel efforts to reduce hunger and achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The UNDP study shows that, should the world fail to limit global warming to less than 2C, families will find it harder and harder to feed themselves, and the risk of famine and increased poverty will rise along with temperatures. Higher levels of poverty would further limit the capacity of communities to manage climate-related risks, according to the report, placing further stress on already overstretched coping mechanisms, and could translate into more risky migration patterns, serious epidemics such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak across West Africa, and greater political instability. Drawing on years of data from projects geared to enabling communities to adapt to a changing climate and build resilience, the report shows that as emissions continue going up, support for climate adaptation initiatives must be increased urgently and accelerated across the continent, especially across the 34 African least developed countries. They are among the most vulnerable to climate change, yet the least able to adapt. In many cases, they lack the technical, financial and institutional capacity to identify the best ways to build resilience, said Gustavo Fonseca, from Global Environment Facility, an institution that has been funding many climate adaptation projects in Africa. Hunger rising along with temperatures According to recent estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), for the first time in over a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting 11 per cent of the global population. This is in part due to extreme droughts induced by an abnormally strong El Nio cycle, which led close to 40 million people in Africa to be in need of humanitarian assistance. Taking reactive approaches to food security and disaster recovery costs the people of Africa billions of dollars in lost GDP, and syphons off government resources that should be dedicated to education, social programmes, healthcare, business development and employment, said UNDPs Ahunna Eziakonwa. It cannot be an afterthought. For me the critical component is knowledge and capacity-building, said Rohini Kohli, who leads Adaptation Planning at UNDP. However, measures to enable communities to adapt to the changing climate is a costly matter that will require creative financial mechanisms and substantial engagement with the private sector to meet. It will require developed nations to make good on their 2015 Paris Agreement commitments to dedicate $100 billion annually to supporting climate action in developing nations. The report analyses a number of noteworthy successes in climate change adaptation in Africa over the past decade, including projects aimed at improving food security in Benin, Mali, Niger and Sudan; supporting governments in having improved climate information and early warning systems to save lives from fast-acting storms; and empowering women to be effective climate action champions.

United Nations, Dec. 6 -- Taking bold climate action, could help save a million lives and a lot of money by the middle of the century, said the World Health Organisation (WHO), launching a special report as part of the ongoing COP24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland. As the world is coming together to define ways to move forward on climate action and the realisation of the objectives defined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, WHO stressed that it's not just the planet that would benefit - an estimated one million lives could be saved through reductions in air pollution alone, United Nations news reported. "The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. "The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health, clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter and will undermine decades of progress in global health." The report also shows that the economic benefits of improved health would be twice as high as the economic cost of mitigating global warming, and fighting air pollution. The return on investment is even higher in countries key to tackling global emissions, such as China and India. Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that have the highest greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4 per cent of GDP. By contrast, actions to meet the Paris commitment of keeping warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, would cost around 1 per cent of global GDP, said WHO. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution, and an important cause of poor health worldwide. When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost - Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health "The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself," says Dr Maria Neira, Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health for WHO. "When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost." Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The report includes recommendations for decision-makers on how to tackle climate action and public health issues at the same time, including policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and air pollution, the mobilisation of mayors to effect local change, investment in "climate-smart" health facilities and the leveraging of the health community as powerful public advocates for climate action. "We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change - from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind," said Dr Joy St John, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health.

It has been confirmed at the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 15, that the Republic of Korea will serve as member of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board for the third term of Board membership, member of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), and member of the Advisory Board of the Climate Technology Center and Network (CTCN). (GCF) The Director General of the Development Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Islamic Republic of Iran will serve as board member and alternate board member for the third term of Board membership (2019-2021) in turn. The ROK will serve as alternate board member for Iran for two years (2019-2020), and board member in 2021 (Iran will serve as alternate board member for the ROK). The ROKs re-election to the GCF Board and first-ever election as board member are expected to further increase the ROKs voice and influence within the GCF, and thereby help the country take the lead in responding to climate change issues in the international community. (SCF) Following its membership on the Standing Committee on Finance this year, the ROK will continue to serve as its member in 2019. As member of the SCF this year, the ROK hosted its forum in the ROK, and has actively participated in the processes to make reports on climate finance, and to develop operational guidelines for the GCF. (CTCN) The head of the R&D Policy Bureau of the Ministry of Science and ICT will serve on the Advisory Board of the CTCN for two years (2019-2020). During COP24 , the ROK delegation, consisting of officials from the Foreign Ministry (Ambassador for Climate Change), the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Ministry of Science and ICT, took part in three official meetings on elections and a number of unofficial meetings on elections attended by 58 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the meetings, the ROK delegation actively explained the ROKs roles and how it would contribute, as well as why the ROK should serve as member of the GCF Board, the CTCN Advisory Board, and the SCF. In particular, as member of the secretariat of the Asia-Pacific Regional Group, the ROK, along with Iran and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, coordinated the Groups overall election activities, contributing to enhancing the ROKs status in international negotiations on climate change. Meanwhile, the Parties to the UNFCCC failed to adopt the conclusion of the IPCC special report on 1.5C at the session of subsidiary bodies held during the first week of the Conference due to oppositions from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States, but the ROK delegations active negotiation activities led to its inclusion in the Decision of the Conference at the closing session. \</doc>

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. met with Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sanchez in Sacramento, where the two leaders discussed further bilateral trade and climate cooperation and action between California and Spain. California and Spain share common history and a common commitment to climate action. We will get it done together, said Governor Brown. The moment is now. We are the last generation that can stop the consequences of climate change, said Prime Minister Snchez. Todays meeting between Governor Brown and Prime Minister Snchez included Spains Ambassador to the United States Santiago Cabanas, Secretary General of International Affairs Jos Manuel Albares and Director General of Economic Affairs Manuel De La Rocha and builds on this weeks events and meetings in New York with world leaders at Climate Week NYC and the World Economic Forums Sustainable Development Impact Summit. Californias Leadership on Climate Change Reaffirming Californias global climate leadership, Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit earlier this month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this years United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ). This month, the Governor also signed legislation setting a 100 percent clean electricity goal for the state, and issued an executive order establishing a new target to achieve carbon neutrality both by 2045. Additionally, the Governor signed bills to block new federal offshore oil drilling along Californias coast, announced the states opposition to the federal governments plan to expand oil drilling on public lands in California and committed to developing and eventually launching a satellite that will track climate change-causing pollutants with unprecedented precision and help the world dramatically reduce these destructive emissions. Earlier this year Governor Brown issued executive orders to improve the health of the states forests and help mitigate the threat and impacts of wildfire, and get 5 million zero-emission vehicles onto Californias roads by 2030. Last year, the Governor signed landmark legislation to extend and strengthen the states cap-and-trade program and create a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. Under Governor Brown, California has established the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nations toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; and will reduce fossil fuel consumption up to 50 percent and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings by 2030. The state has met its 2020 target four years early, reducing emissions 13 percent while growing the economy 26 percent. From 2015 to 2016 alone, emissions reductions were roughly equal to taking 2.4 million cars off the road, saving 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Governor Brown has helped establish and expand coalitions of partners across the nation and globe committed to curbing carbon pollution, including the Under2 Coalition, an international pact of 222 cities, states, regions and countries on 6 continents committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. Coalition members collectively represent more than 1.3 billion people and $34 trillion in GDP equivalent to 17 percent of the global population and 43 percent of the global economy. This includes the regions of Andalusia, Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarra in Spain. Governor Brown also partnered with Michael Bloomberg to launch Americas Pledge, an initiative to quantify non-federal action in the U.S. to drive down emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and helped form the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance which now includes 17 U.S. states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. California and 17 other states collectively representing more than 40 percent of the U.S. car market sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to preserve the nations uniform vehicle emission standards that save drivers money at the pump, cut oil consumption, reduce air pollution and curb greenhouse gases. \</doc>

Dec. 12 -- "We want the customers that have access to coal to have access to gas as well. The golden era of this commodity is ahead of us," said Piotr Wozniak, President of PGNiG, during the COP24 climate conference in Katowice. "Our aim is to ensure that by 2022 90% of households in Poland have access to natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel. The environmental benefits of using gas as a fuel are undeniable. Natural gas is our chance for cleaner air," said Piotr Wozniak during the debate on 'Using natural gas to improve air quality', organised by the PGNiG Group. During the debate, Piotr Wozniak pointed out that the PGNiG Group undertakes numerous initiatives to improve air quality in Poland. First of all, the Group is implementing an ambitious programme to develop the gas distribution network. By 2020, the Group's capex on the programme will amount to nearly PLN 8bn. The Group also offers grants of up to PLN 3,000 to finance replacement of old heating boilers with gas-fired ones. Henryk Mucha, President of PGNiG Obrot Detaliczny, the Group's retail trading arm, added: "Using natural gas is an effective tool to improve air quality. A good example here is our pilot scheme as part of which we offer grants to households wishing to replace their solid fuel-fired boilers with more environmentally-friendly gas-fired ones. The project is continuing, but owing to the change of heating sources we have already reduced dust emissions by about 50 tonnes and CO2 emissions by about 200 tonnes." Participants of the debate also discussed the use of natural gas in transport, putting particular emphasis on public transport in cities. Both Andrzej Kowol, President of the Management Board of municipal transport company Przedsiebiorstwo Komunikacji Miejskiej in Tychy, and Marek Ustrobinski, Deputy Mayor of Rzeszow, stressed that running municipal transport vehicles on natural gas brings not only environmental but also economic benefits. The cost of driving 100 km in a bus fuelled with natural gas is currently 10% lower than in a bus running on diesel. In the coming years, savings could grow by a further 20% as a result of the planned lifting of excise duties on CNG and LNG used for propulsion purposes, which is awaiting approval by the European Commission. "The problem we are currently facing is the limited number of LNG and CNG filling stations. However, a law has been adopted which provides for a rapid construction of 70 such stations," said Marcin Szczudo, Vice President of PGNiG Obrot Detaliczny. "There are currently about 400 gas-fuelled buses running in Poland. By the end of next year, there will be 600 such buses, so we believe that the trend will be growing. Kielce and Warsaw are cases in point - this year these two cities decided to opt for CNG-fuelled buses. The larger the urban area, the greater the impact of transport on smog, and this is why we support green solutions in transport," added Vice President Szczudo. The debate on the use of natural gas to improve air quality was led by Francois-Regis Mouton, EU Affairs Director at the International Oil and Gas Producers Association (IOGP). Speeches were also delivered by, among others, Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Maria Andrzejewska, Director of the UNEP/GRID-Warsaw Centre, and Marek Ustrobinski, Deputy Mayor of Rzeszow. Reduction of methane emissions During the COP24 climate summit in Katowice, the PGNiG Group also organised a panel discussion on reduction of methane emissions. During the debate devoted to natural gas from conventional and unconventional sources as a low-carbon fuel supporting the green economy, Piotr Wozniak stressed: "PGNiG is implementing an ambitious coalbed methane recovery project with a view to using the methane as a source of energy. The project will not only contribute to improving the energy security of our country, but will also help reduce emissions of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, as well as improve the safety of miners." "Based on the most recent information it is clear that global carbon emissions have increased. The mining industry should take responsibility also for methane emissions from coal mines. All new projects in this sector should rely on state-of-the-art low emissions technologies, including technologies for carbon capture and storage," added Raymond Pilcher, Chair of the Group of Experts on Coal Mine Methane. Scot Foster, Director of the Sustainable Energy Department at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, pointed out: "Natural gas can make important contributions to a sustainable future in the areas of mobility, power generation, improving urban air quality, and providing quality energy access in unserved areas. On the other hand, the energy industry must enhance its sustainability credentials significantly by addressing both methane losses and CO2 emissions. Placing a real price on emissions and trusting in markets would be key steps." The session moderated by Director Scot Foster was attended by experts from all over the world, including the US, Norway, China and Australia, representing business, international organisations and the academic communities.

London, Nov. 29 -- "People believe there is a role for everyone in tackling climate change; whether that is all of us in our everyday lives, how businesses manufacture and distribute goods or with cities and national governments taking the lead across communities.There are many ways we can make those changes and where E.ON is helping its customers to do so: from switching away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, replacing petrol and diesel vehicles with low carbon electric alternatives, offering clean energy tariffs, or improving the energy efficiency of homes so they are more comfortable as well as easier to heat." Michael Lewis, Chief Executive of E.ON UK Climate change and pollution are two of the biggest challenges facing society today, say a quarter of UK residents (27% and 25% respectively), with those issues surpassed only by poverty (35%) in the findings of a pan-European survey[1] carried out by E.ON. More than half (54%) of Britons believe we, as a nation, are not doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle our impact on the planet, compared to two thirds (65%) of people across seven European nations taking part in the E.ON survey. The fresh research polled more than 7,000 people across the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary ahead of the COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, beginning next week. It found:  Half of Brits (49%) and four in ten (40%) Europeans believe it is everyone's responsibility - including government, industry and consumers - to tackle the challenge of climate change and pollution.  Providing a difference between different age groups, around two-thirds (61%) of 18-30 year olds believe we aren't doing enough to tackle greenhouse gases, compared to less than half (48%) of those aged 51 and over.  To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, three-quarters (77%, 80% in Europe) believe we should support cleaner energy, a third (32%) supported increased taxes or levies on the most carbon heavy fossil fuels and 23% feeling we should do both. When it comes to making changes to reduce their own impact on the planet, more than two thirds (67%) of UK residents (71% across Europe) have already started taking action, changing or committing to change their behaviour to act in a more environmentally friendly way. And among consumers, more than two thirds (70% UK, 80% in Europe) said they would be willing to pay more if the manufacturer of a product was making sustained efforts to act in a climate-friendly way. Alternately, almost a third of people (30%) said this would not affect their behaviour. Commenting on the survey findings, Michael Lewis, E.ON UK CEO, said: "Climate change is not just a problem affecting distant countries; problems like pollution affect us in our cities and streets and through the air we breathe, which is why we all need to commit to make changes to tread more lightly on the planet. "What is interesting in these statistics is that people believe there is a role for everyone in tackling climate change; whether that is all of us in our everyday lives, how businesses manufacture and distribute goods or with cities and national governments taking the lead across communities. "There are many ways we can make those changes and where E.ON is helping its customers to do so: from switching away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, replacing petrol and diesel vehicles with low carbon electric alternatives, offering clean energy tariffs, or improving the energy efficiency of homes so they are more comfortable as well as easier to heat."

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement today on a new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finding that the world must take unprecedented action to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius. The report was prepared by 91 authors and editors from 40 countries in response to an invitation from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change when it adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015. This IPCC report makes unmistakably clear that the world must radically change. It must decarbonize and establish a totally renewable basis for all economic activity. The big powers the United States, China, India and the European Union must show the way. We can do it but only if the deniers, the skeptics and the comfortable wake up to what the scientists are telling us. Californias Leadership on Climate Change Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit last month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this years United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ).

Governor Brown also partnered with Michael Bloomberg to launch Americas Pledge, an initiative toquantify non-federal action in the U.S. to drive down emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and helped form the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance which now includes 17 U.S. states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. California and 17 other states collectively representing more than 40 percent of the U.S. car market sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to preserve the nations uniform vehicle emission standards that save drivers money at the pump, cut oil consumption, reduce air pollution and curb greenhouse gases. \</doc>

United Kingdom, Dec. 10 -- The EBRD presented its plans for a &#38;#8364;250 million direct investment framework for Green and Sustainability Bonds targeted at financial institutions at an event during international climate talks in Katowice, Poland. Over the next three years, the EBRD framework, approved in September, is expected to mobilise private sector capital investments of a further &#38;#8364;1 billion, and aims to double the supply of Green and Sustainability Bonds issued by financial institutions across the regions where the bank invests. Green Bonds - whose proceeds exclusively go to projects with clear environmental benefits - have gained global recognition for enabling debt issuers to finance projects that transition their business towards greater environmental stability. They are also seen as a key part of efforts in supplying a pledged US$ 100 billion in annual climate funding, due from 2020, which helped convince developing countries to sign up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. With the approval in September 2018 of the EBRD's direct investment framework targeted at financial institutions, the Bank may support Green and Sustainability Bond issuance in its regions. The objective of the EBRD Investment Framework is to incentivise transparency and adherence to high green standards with its financial institution clients and to report on the underlying projects' quantitative and qualitative environmental benefits and impacts. The EBRD has issued Green Bonds since 2010 to finance its green project portfolio, which includes more than 380 projects in EBRD regions from Morocco to Mongolia and from Estonia to Egypt.Turkey accounts for 34 per cent of this green portfolio, which is in excess of &#38;#8364;4 billion, and Poland 15 per cent. At the COP24 international climate conference in Katowice, Poland, the EBRD set out the latest expansion of its green bond operations - as an investor - at a side event on 10 December on "Extending Green Bonds to New Frontiers". While the global market for Green Bonds has grown rapidly in recent years, exceeding US$ 155 billion of issuance in 2017, large regional gaps remain with just under two per cent of global issuance volume coming from the EBRD regions. The Bank has been leading efforts to increase the market's scale and notes increasing calls from potential issuers for EBRD's involvement as investor and technical assistance provider for pilot issuance. In March 2018, the Bank completed a US$ 68.5 million investment in Amundi Planet - Emerging Green One, the world's biggest Green Bond fund and the first dedicated to emerging markets, including the EBRD regions. In parallel with this investment, the EBRD launched a dedicated Green Bond Technical Cooperation Programme across its regions to help increase the issuance of green bonds to finance environmentally friendly projects. Together with other multilateral development banks, the EBRD seeks to establish harmonised best practices for this market, including for emerging Green Bond issuance, through its participation in the executive committee of the Green Bond Principles, which provide voluntary process guidelines developed by a broad forum of market participants under the secretariat of the International Capital Market Association. Since 2010, the EBRD has issued more than 70 Green Bonds totalling &#38;#8364;2.6 billion equivalent. The EBRD is also a leading international financial institution in terms of renewable energy and energy efficiency financing. It is the largest financier of renewable energy projects in its markets; 43 per cent of the Bank's 2017 investment was made in Green Economy Transition (GET) projects, achieving the initial target under the flagship initiative two years ahead of schedule.

On Tuesday, the second day of the UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) the African Development Bank held a session on energy efficiency in Africa in its Pavilion, where panellists reflected on the lessons of the many energy-efficiency initiatives that have emerged in Africa. Funding, regulation and awareness The first observation was that the African energy-efficiency market is in great need of funding and technical support, including in terms of institutional strengthening, development of dedicated policies and reinforcement of skills. These needs have been flagged for quality analysis and research to better define the market. Several panellists highlighted the sector's financing needs. Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, Climate and Green Growth Manager at the Bank, emphasised the multisectoral dimension of energy efficiency in the African context, noting that energy efficiency in Africa does not depend solely on funding. Upstream, there is a need to establish a stable, enabling environment for the development of energy efficiency. Thereafter arises the need to build the technical capacity of all relevant actors and stakeholders. Then comes the needs of the market that requires greater regulation, communication and awareness raising to £waken' collective consciousness on the importance of energy efficiency in African countries, with a view to identify energy that is efficient, sustainable and less expensive. "If these three conditions are met, it will be easy to mobilise funding and project implementation will be more effective," he emphasised. Risks and transition Energy efficiency is also a key issue in the fight against climate change because of the need to implement a transition that is as 'fair' and 'equitable' as possible, by balancing all options. Green energy sector is certainly a promising market to explore. It is however important to note that In Africa, 60% of the population has no access to electricity. Therefore, green energy sector is not yet a priority in Africa, due to the many other constraints and economic, human and social development priorities. lack of financial resources and political will are preponderant issues to contend with. Energy-efficiency projects are so difficult to implement in Africa because of the sum of all these factors. This is a contingency that really is not conducive to the growth and stability of a market which remains promising natural resources abound in Africa be it energy efficiency or the definitive transition to renewables. In Madagascar, for instance, the new energy policy established in 2015 has not yet been effectively implemented. However, in some countries such as Morocco and especially Tunisia, energy efficiency is a priority and they have created an enabling environment by defining clear policies and establishing appropriate institutional frameworks. Even so, as with any change, energy transition is something that is traded and that is why energy efficiency is viewed as a profitable commitment for the countries concerned, particularly the most industrialized and those that produce oil or are dependent on fossil fuels. Despite its potential and opportunities, the energy-efficiency market involves risk, especially for the private sector. This point was made by Mark Radka, of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). "Donors see the energy-efficiency market as a risk sector and they do not want to inject money into it in too great a quantity or at too high a speed." Financial institutions represented at the session called for more facilities and financial support from commercial banks in particular. The private sector certainly does have an important role to play in the promotion of energy efficiency. In a study conducted in Africa by the Climate Technology Center and Network (CTCN), the operational arm of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, which was invited to the panel, energy efficiency was top on the list of needs expressed (33.3%), ahead of the other priority areas of agriculture and forestry. Energy efficiency is a key sector, in a position to help the African continent to deal with the effects of climate change, because it makes it possible to implement both adaptation and mitigation mechanisms. These are needed by the African continent, home to many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. \</doc>

Nov. 27 -- Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa, upon agreement with the Minister of the Environment, has become the first official partner of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 24 ). This is UN's most important international conference. JSW's partnership supports Polish Presidency, guaranteeing the company's active participation in the event and the possibility to promote environment-friendly changes in the mining sector. The annual sessions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are the most important events in the international climate negotiations process, offering a meeting forum for the representatives of all Parties to the Convention (196 states and the EU). During the conference, decisions are made on further actions for climate protection and the operation of the Convention itself. This year's session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be held on 2-14 December in Katowice. During the COP 24 summit, adoption of a full package implementing the Paris Agreement is planned. This is the first in history international agreement which obligates all states in the world to take climate protection actions. The implementation package will make it possible to perform the Paris Agreement in practice. Consequently, it will define the global climate and energy policy for the years to come. During the climate summit, Poland wants to focus the attention of all the states to three messages - nature, man and technology. According to Polish Presidency, a solidary and fair social and economic transformation is required, combined with simultaneous attainment of climate neutrality, among others thanks to absorption of carbon dioxide by forests.  We are honored to be able to support Polish COP 24 Presidency. We hope that our participation in the summit attended by nearly 30 thousand delegates from across the globe, including heads of states and ministers of the environment and industry, will contribute to promotion of JSW as an environment-friendly leader of the mining industry - says Daniel Ozon, JSW President. - We want to strengthen the image of the JSW Group in the international forum as the biggest producer of coking coal and coke, i.e. the components required for production of steel and development of modern, low-emission industry and innovative technologies of the future. During COP 24  JSW is a leader in the economic usage of methane. The gas captured from the mine methane drainage and ventilation air system not only reduces the risk of methane hazards in mines, but also improves energy efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. At present, 60% of the captured gas is converted into energy. By 2030, the company intends to increase electricity production from methane fivefold - says Artur Dyczko - JSW's Vice-President for Strategy and Development,- JSW is taking intensive actions to implement a technology for separation of hydrogen from coke-oven gas. Separated and purified hydrogen can be used in hydrogen cells for environmentally-friendly and emission-free generation of electricity or environmentally-friendly public transport. One of the numerous attractions prepared by JSW for the COP 24 climate summit in Katowice will be a presentation of a mobile hydrogen station and availability of a hydrogen-powered bus for the summit participants. JSW estimates that in the future the company's coke plants will be able to produce hydrogen to power 800 such vehicles per annum. The JSW Group, one of the biggest producers of tar in the EU, also intends to use this product for production of carbon fibers, among others for modern European aviation, electronic and automotive industries.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 2 -- The 24th meeting of Conference of Parties ( COP-24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held at Katowice, Poland from 2nd December 2018 to 14th December 2018. COP-24 is very significant as it is expected to finalise guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2016. Union Environment Minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan who is leading the 17 member Indian delegation said that India expects that COP-24 should be able to frame guidelines, which are pragmatic and gives due consideration to challenges and priorities of developing countries inter alia different starting points as compared to developed countries, their vulnerabilities, development priorities like eradication of poverty, food security, energy access, providing health infrastructure etc. " COP-24 COP-24 should be balanced, inclusive, comprehensive and consistent with the principles and provisions of Convention and its Paris Agreement" said the Union Minister. India strongly supports the objective of the Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. India considers it important from the point of view of eradicating poverty and caring for the poor and the marginalised. The Agreement also focuses on developing country parties' need to adapt to adverse impacts of climate change, in a manner that it does not put an additional burden on them. During the COP-24 Significant gaps in pre-2020 climate efforts exist not only in mitigation but also in adaptation and support to developing countries. These implementation gaps will present an additional burden to developing countries in the post-2020 period. Therefore, the key concern for India is to ensure that no undue burden is shifted onto developing countries in the post-2020 period. The issue of pre-2020 commitments under Kyoto Protocol, particularly higher mitigation action of developed countries and the need for developed countries to fulfil their climate finance commitments of mobilising USD 100 billion per annum by 2020, will remain a priority for India in COP-24 . Additionally, the final political phase of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and stock take exercise on Pre-2020 implementation and action are also scheduled during COP-24 .India will be looking forward to a rich exchange of views during the high-level Talanoa dialogue at COP-24 , with consideration of pre-2020 actions and support as a crucial element, and its successful conclusion in 2018 as per the agreed modalities. India will be working together with all Parties in an open, transparent, inclusive and Party-driven manner to achieve a balanced and comprehensive outcome in the form of final PAWP at COP-24 . India made a voluntary pledge in 2009 to reduce the emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020 (excluding emissions from agriculture). As per the various reports, we are on the way to achieve this target. India enhanced its climate goals in 2015 outlining eight (8) goals for 2021-2030, including reduction of the emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. India's climate actions are synchronised with its development goals and simultaneously reflect its bold vision for combating climate change. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious goal that India must start generating 40 per cent of its total power from non-fossil fuels by 2030, thereby placing India at a premium position on the international renewable energy map. The United Nations' highest environmental honour, UNEP "Champions of the Earth" award was conferred on 3rd October 2018 on the Prime Minister of India in the policy leadership category for his pioneering work in championing the ISA and for his unprecedented pledge to eliminate all single-use plastic in India by 2022. On the sidelines of COP-24 , India will be setting up a Pavilion to create awareness about India's positive climate actions in various sectors of the economy. The theme of this year's India Pavilion is 'One World One Sun One Grid' as highlighted by our Hon'ble Prime Minister during the first assembly of the International Solar Alliance on 2nd October 2018. India Pavilion will strive to become an ideal platform for the exchange of innovative ideas for the world to come together and take action. Union Environment Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will inaugurate the Pavilion on December 3rd 2018 and will address and will also release India's second Biennial Update Report. In the pavilion, India will also hold side events from December 3rd to December 13th 2018. There will be around 20 sessions, covering issues related to sectors important for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The sessions will cover presentations and panel discussions involving experts from both public and private spheres. India would like to demonstrate the same spirit of commitment and leadership shown in the past during the COP-24 . India's expectation from COP-24 is that the decisions should be in consonance with the principles of UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement including equity, CBDR-RC, and climate justice.

Minister of Environment and Forestry, Siti Nurbaya, before COP-24 UNFCCC negotiators in Katowice, Poland reminded again that Delegates are part of the solution in achieving the formulation of modalities, procedures and The guideline for implementing Paris Agreement is mainly related to Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Indonesia has targeted a 29% emission reduction from Business as Usual together with the relevant ministries and has agreed on the priority activities. "This preparation has been on track including recording all activities through the National Registry System. We must encourage and be part of the solution in negotiating the NDC implementation guidelines which will be decided on the last day of the COP-24 trial", Minister Siti said some time ago. Minister Siti Nurbaya further said that because all mitigation and adaptation activities need international recognition under the UNFCCC regime, a transparency system is needed which will also be regulated at COP-24 . COP-24 negotiations. "Because transparency framework is related to measurement, reporting and verification on mitigation actions in achieving NDC targets, if it does not pass the MRV regulated by the UNFCCC, mitigation efforts will not be recognized," explained Nur Masripatin. Likewise, foreign aid to reach the 41% target will be difficult to obtain because it must be performance based. Nur Masripatin said that developed countries first build their MRV system when implementing their obligations through the Kyoto Protocol which was implemented from 1994 to 2018. They must share the technology to build the system, continued Nur. Ruanda Agung Sugardiman, Director General of Climate Change Control at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said that until now the national registration system since the Minister of LHK was launched 1177 mitigation actions throughout Indonesia, including stakeholders from non-state actors including local governments and the private sector. "Even in this SRN, information can be obtained on various adaptation and mitigation activities in cooperation with foreign countries," Ruandha said. At the Indonesian Pavilion COP-24 itself also shared information on actions carried out in the country. For example, the Pidie District Government - Aceh, Gorontalo District, and North Kalimantan Province appear to share information about what interventions are being done in changing business as usual that emit to contribute to the achievement of Indonesia's NDC targets. From COP-24 , it is hoped that a game agreement from Paris Agreement will be born. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 16 -- The Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change on Sunday said that outcome of 24th session of Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 24 ) was positive. The Ministry also said India demonstrated the spirit of commitment and leadership during the COP-24 "India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)", said an official release. The COP 24 India has been in favor of a robust transparency regime, and the finalised Enhanced Transparency Framework builds upon the existing guidelines while providing flexibilities for developing countries. The Ministry also said that India also engaged in a meaningful way in the '2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue' and stocktake exercise on Pre-2020 implementation and ambition. The Talanoa Dialogue was an inclusive and participatory process which led to exchanging best practices between all stakeholders. The pre-2020 stocktake exercise also led to a meaningful dialogue with developed countries being urged to step up their actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to address gaps in the provision of technology, finance and capacity-building support. "The outcome on dialogue also recalls the commitment of developed country parties to a goal of mobilising jointly 100 billion dollar per year by 2020", the release said. It also notes with concern the current, urgent and emerging needs related to extreme weather events and slow onset events in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. "India considers the outcome of COP 24 a positive one which addresses concerns of all parties and sets us on the path towards successful implementation of the Paris Agreement", the Ministry said.

Dec. 11 -- Brazilian actions in the environment have made it possible for the country to meet some of the targets assumed for the reduction of atmospheric gas emissions two years early. The good news was announced by the Brazilian delegation on Tuesday (11 December) to the participants of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 24 ) in Poland. In 2018 alone, Brazil reduced emissions by 1.28 billion tons of carbon. In the deforested area of the Cerrado biome, from August 2017 to July 2018 emissions dropped by 11% in relation to the previous period, the lowest percentage since the beginning of the historical data series. Deforestation, which reached 6,657 km in the Cerrado in 2018, was 33% lower than the amount mapped in 2010, when the plan to protect the area began. Economic Recovery A total 9.4 million hectares currently undergoing vegetation recovery have been identified in the country; Brazil has undertaken the commitment to recover 12 million hectares by 2030. Based on data from the TerraClass Amazonia project, executed in partnership between INPE (National Space Research Institute) and Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation) has made it possible to quantify the size and age of secondary vegetation areas for about 60% of the national territory.

Dec. 18 -- Climate change presents a US$3 trillion investment opportunity in Africa by 2030 - and the private sector will be key to green investment and development, Barbara Buchner, one of the top 20 influential women in climate change, has said., Buchner, who is also the Executive Director for Climate Finance Program at Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) lent her voice to those of other experts at the Finance Day organized by the African Development Bank at COP24 in Katowice, Poland. A range of high-profile speakers set out the challenges and opportunities for financing adaptation and mitigation efforts across Africa over four fascinating sessions, including Innovative Financing Solutions, Drive Billions to a Sustainable Economy in Africa, Inclusive Policies, and Finance for Sustainable Energy Access. Buchner set the scene by reminding the audience that 14% of the world's' population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, yet only 3% of global climate finance flows into the continent. She shared useful insights from her work on the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance initiative, emphasizing that a public-private approach is key to its effectiveness. "Since launching in 2014, the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance has launched 35 transformative solutions, collectively mobilizing US$1 billion in mitigation and adaptation efforts around the world," she said. Panel speakers called for innovative approaches to attract and steer financial ows consistent towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development to achieve the NDCs that Africa has set out. Statistics have it that Africa offers the highest returns compared to most emerging market economies. For the last two decades, the continent has seen steady economic growth underpinned by commodity exports, growing market demand, and strengthened structural elements. Between 2011 and 2015, and as part of its previous Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), the African Development Bank mobilized approximately US$12 billion of climate finance to support climate-resilient and low-carbon development in Africa. Nonetheless, Africa has not succeeded as much as other regions of the world in mobilizing the funding needed to implement climate-smart initiatives. With new Green Climate Fund (GCF) finance now available to be channeled through the Bank, African countries will have additional resources to access. David Jackson, Director of Local Development Finance at UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), said: "Adaptation is going to be a very expensive process; it's also a localized process. It can only be done by those responsible for land-use planning, agriculture, water management, transport etc." Jackson emphasized the need to encourage access at a local level and to set up national platforms for adaptation, which bring together national and local governments." Experts emphasized how programming adaptation efforts presents a unique challenge given the evolving nature of climate risks, associated uncertainties, and existing implementation issues. Gareth Phillips, Chief Climate Change and Green Officer at the African Development Bank, said: "Strengthening the capacities of national and subnational bodies to access, manage, and channel finance and collectively work together is critical to making adaptation happen at the speed and scale we need. At the same time, we have to do better at engaging national and sub-national stakeholders in the decision-making process. Unlocking finance is critical to achieving the African NDCs." The African Development Bank is working closely with international climate funds as well as other partners to scale up climate finance on the African continent and to strengthen institutions to directly access climate funds. In the words of Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank: "Africa's financial actors need to work together creatively to mobilize global financial resources at a scale that can support local innovation, and that drives climate-resilient and low-carbon development on the continent. Having been short-changed by climate change, Africa must not be short-changed by climate finance." The Bank's climate spending will increase to 40% of its total new investments by 2020 compared to 26% on average from 2011 to 2014. Source: African Development Bank Group \</doc>

The Dialogue will be co-hosted by the government of Germany, and the government of Poland, as the incoming President of COP24 . COP 24 , which will be an important milestone in implementing the Paris Agreement. The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) is set to take place in Katowice, Poland, later this year. The COP 24 will be an important milestone in implementing the Paris Agreement. It is expected to conclude the negotiations on the Paris Agreement Work Programme in particular, by agreeing on how they will fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. Minister Molewa will then proceed to the 2nd Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) that will be co-convened by the Governments of Canada, China and the EU and hosted by the EU from the 20 to 21 June 2018. The MoCA will examine outstanding issues in more detail and explore potential landing grounds. The list of invitees includes Ministers from the G20, the chairs of key Party Groupings in the UN climate negotiations and other key countries to ensure regional balance. Through the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, and the stocktake on pre-2020 action, Ministerial leadership will have frank political discussions on their performance thus far, and on how they can advance action and raise ambition from now into the future. Ministerial leadership will be critical to achieve outcomes that are comprehensive, balanced, effective and consistent with the spirit of Paris, and send the clear political signal that the transition to low-carbon and climate resilient economies is underway. Nationally, there has been increased momentum in the implementation of the National Climate Change Response Policy. Cabinet has also approved the Climate Change Bill for public comment, and it will become law after public consultations and adoption by Parliament. \</doc>

Mumbai, Dec. 11 -- The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and climate activists have said the COP24 being held in Poland is the last opportunity to ensure justice to communities most vulnerable to climate change. Hussain Rasheed Hassan, Maldives' environment minister and chair of AOSIS, said denial of climate change impacts will hurt all. Responding to the failure of COP parties in welcoming the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report titled "Global warming of 1.5 degrees, he said, "While we failed to endorse the findings of the IPCC special report here ( COP24 ), it doesn't change the fact that out in the world, coral reefs will continue to bleach, forest fires will continue, people will continue to die in droughts, heatwaves, storms, and sea will continue to rise. Denial doesn't change the reality that climate change is happening as is much worse than we feared." Hassan is going to be part of the ministerial meetings this week to finalise the Paris rulebook which will spell out how various provisions of the Paris Agreement will be operationalised. Hassan and former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed from the AOSIS delegation are likely to raise the issue of climate justice this week. COP 24 ends on December 14. "While small islands states will be hit first and hit the hardest, you will be next. This year we have seen the global effects of just 1 degree C. The impacts of climate change know no boundaries," the AOSIS said in a statement while adding that transparency in reporting of climate finance obligations by the developed countries will be one of their priorities. Progress on the Paris rulebook has been very slow, according to officials and activists Last week major differences emerged on key issues like climate finance and differentiation or equity in implementation of the Paris agreement, which basically means developed countries take the lead while developing and least developed countries also take action in accordance to their capacities. This is has brought together 10 academics and activists from different walks of life who are saying that it's the moral responsibility of COP parties to deliver a fair Paris rulebook. Members from India and US, who call themselves the People's Climate Network, launched their coalition last week and have called on vulnerable communities across the world to study the findings of the IPCC's report titled 'Global warming of 1.5 degrees.' "All of us need to reflect on IPCC's special report on the importance of keeping the earth's average surface temperature to 1.5degreeC without overshoot. This confirms the concerns of small island nations and others that have maintained for a long time that 2 degrees C is already greatly damaging," said a press statement by the network. The network, which includes Indian members who are mainly working with forest and tribal communities in central India, has started curating data and stories of people affected by climate change. "We plan to build a platform through which data can be collected and uploaded directly by community members... Indigenous communities already have a presence at the COP24 . In COP23 a platform was created by the UNFCCC for local communities and indigenous people, and one of their aims is to integrate indigenous knowledge systems and best practices into climate policy...," their statement said. "...In the past two days, the debate on whether the IPCC 1.5 degree report is taken seriously or diluted, has both digressed the talks from progress but also opened a report which was earlier approved by all countries. It is in India's interest to have a strong agreement from this COP," said Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends, a research and communication organisation.

India, Dec. 3 -- As the Conference of Parties starts at Poland's Katowice, scientific findings must guide negotiations. It is very important that the Katowice meet launches a process to raise climate ambition of all Parties by 2020 The 24th meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP) will take place from December 2-14, 2018, at Katowice, Poland. The mandate is daunting-to finalise the Rule Book for implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted on December 12, 2015, has the prime goal to curb dangerous temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (degC) and strive for 1.5degC. In the last three years, Parties have been working towards the mandate to agree on a set of reporting and accounting requirements to implement the Agreement, which would become operational in 2020. This has also been the time period when extreme weather events have inflicted havoc on every part of the world in the form of unseasonal rainfall, droughts, heatwaves, forest fires and dust storms. However, contrary to expectations that the negotiations would reflect the urgency to implement the Paris Agreement, which is the prime consensual arrangement that we have to address climate change, the negotiations have been conducted at a rather tardy pace. Developments such as the Trump Administration's announcement to pull out from the Paris Agreement and the fear of other countries following suit, an absence of clear leadership to steer the course of negotiations and the extreme technical nature of negotiations has further made the process of negotiations slow-paced. Not only does it seem an extremely mammoth task to finalise the Rule Book since practically everything needs to be consented, more important is the need to have a balanced, just and ambitious Rule Book, which can serve as the blueprint for ambitious climate actions from 2020 onwards. Inside the draft Rule Book As the Rule Book prioritises reporting requirements (in the form of NDCs, Adaptation Communications and Financial Reports), the challenge is of clearly demarcating the scope and content to avoid duplication and overlapping. For instance, on the issue of guidelines for NDC reporting, the draft Rule Book proposes options regarding scope, methodologies, baselines, reporting on fairness, ambition and equity, the domestic planning processes, mechanisms and policies. On new market mechanisms (NMMs), Parties are discussing the form and measurement of tradable units, referred to as the Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), the linkages between different sub-sections under market mechanisms, the nature of the supervisory body overseeing the mechanism and restrictions on the use of markets towards the fulfillment of countries' NDC. Discussions also focus on the Kyoto Regime's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and its integration in the new regime. However, this has the potential to subvert environmental integrity of NMMs by reviving a highly profit-oriented and failed approach to markets. Regarding enhanced transparency framework, countries have proposed options related to reporting on a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory as well as the form and duration of the submission of a transparency report. Developing countries have proposed financial support and flexibility, which are mentioned in the Paris Agreement but are open to interpretations. In our view, flexibility must only be for the least developed and island countries that require it the most, as opposed to emerging economies. Under the Paris Agreement, Parties are also required to submit adaptation communications which would provide a better and clearer picture of what they are doing in terms of adaptation actions, their needs, gaps and learnings, and best practices without causing additional reporting burdens on them in addition to support. All this is essential for the preparation of adaptation communications. A crucial top-down element in the Paris Agreement is the Global Stocktake, meant to assess collective efforts of climate actions in 2023. Collective could also encompass region wise and economic division of countries (high, middle and low income) could be an option for assessment. Loss and damage does not find a separate section in the Rule Book but is sprinkled in the other aspects involving the sources of inputs in the GST, reporting requirements within NDC, transparency framework and adaptation communications. It is crucial that this issue does not get sidelined at Katowice, as in previous climate meetings. Finance is one of the most pressing bottle neck issues in climate change. The Paris Agreement maintains differentiation in the issue of finance mandating developed countries to take the lead. Article 9.7 and 9.5 under the Paris Agreement talks of ex-ante reporting and ex-post reporting on finance respectively, which is also a bone of contention between developed and developing countries, with the European Union and the United States (US) blocking any meaningful outcomes on finance. The momentum in pushing developed countries to provide ex-ante financial information must be sustained. Countries are also discussing ways to specify climate additional finance, the nature of channels of financial flows, parity of finance between mitigation and adaptation finance, and on mobilisation of finance by public and private sources. This CoP would also see the political phase of the ongoing Talanoa Dialogue or the informal dialogue and discussions between different stakeholders including businesses and civil society to increase ambition. The dialogue started ahead of the intersession in Bonn in May 2018. Challenges How to preserve equity Equity has been deemed as the core of the global climate regime and the Paris Agreement also upholds equity, albeit in principle. As seen above, equity is prevalent on the issues of reporting on NDCs by reporting on fairness, adequacy and ambition; in global stocktake and in ex-ante financial reporting which would also bring the question of adequacy of financial resources. However, operationalising it has been a herculean task. In the past too, Parties have always opposed prescriptive ways of raising climate ambition. Dealing collectively with the US The US has been an obstructionist in the climate regime and has advocated re-negotiation of the Paris Agreement to suit American interests. It is expected that at Katowice too, it would push for its stance and would try to undermine justice and oppose equity and outcomes on finance. To deal with the US collectively thus becomes crucial. A balanced and robust Rule Book With better bargaining clout and diplomatic capabilities, developed countries have had the upper hand in negotiations, with outcomes in the past titled in their favour. This needs to change. Developing countries must collectively hold their ground and push for balanced outcomes. Raising ambition in accordance with science--A Rule Book plus approach? This year is crucial, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC coming out with its Special Report which has made it clear that with current climate efforts, the 1.5degC limit could be breached between 2030 and 2052. The Report mentions the need for an unprecedented, economy-wide transformation and upscaling of new technologies in each sector for carbon emissions to decline by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and net-zero emission by 2050. Like the IPCC, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emission Gap Report also reiterates the need for raising ambition by several folds. This report also provides a hope of staying within safer temperature levels in view of technical and economical possibilities that exist. The scientific findings must guide the negotiations at Katowice. Both reports have pointed to the need of urgent climate efforts. Therefore, not only is a balanced and robust Rule Book essential, Katowice launching a process to raise climate ambition of all Parties by 2020 is equally important. To maintain the environmental integrity of the Paris Agreement, decisive and ambitious outcomes, informed by science, are must.

NEW DELHI: Setting the tone for new climate ambition, the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - a UN body which evaluates climate change science - on Monday said the global average temperature was likely to increase by 1.5 degree Celsius between 2030 and 2052 from its pre-industrial levels if it continued to increase at the current rate, leading the world to face far more disastrous consequences of global warming than what was being faced now at 1 degree Celsius rise. It said, "Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 degree C than at present, but lower than 2 degree C. These risks depend on the magnitude and rate of warming, geographic location, level of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and implementation of adaptation and mitigation options". Besides noting the consequences, report also enlists ways to slow down the warming process and limit the rise to 1.5 degree Celsius by 2100 - well below the 2 degree Celsius rise which is the intended goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The IPCC came out with its findings and analysis of available options to limit global average temperature rise in its special report on 'Global Warming of 1.5 degree Celsius', released at Incheon in South Korea on Monday. The report examines pathways available to limit warming to 1.5\\xBAC, what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be. It will, therefore, be a key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland in December, when governments review the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. The Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties COP21) to the UNFCCC in December 2015, included the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degree C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre -industrial levels." The reference period 1850-1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial levels. As part of the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, the IPCC was invited to produce, in 2018, a Special Report on global warming of 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The IPCC's special report highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5\\xBAC compared to 2\\xBAC, or more. For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5\\xB0C compared with 2\\xB0C. Similarly, the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5\\xB0C, compared with at least once per decade with 2\\xB0C. Coral reefs would decline by 70-90% with global warming of 1.5\\xB0C, whereas virtually all ( 99 percent) would be lost with 2\\xBAC. The report, however, finds that limiting global warming to 1.5 degree C would require "rapid and far-reaching" transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. It said the global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050. This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air. "Stabilisation of average global temperature rise to 1.5 degree C has clear benefits as compared to 2 degree C rise. Science says it is not impossible to limit the warming to 1.5 degree C. We should, therefore, give it a try. The countries need to scale up their ambitions," said Joyashree Roy, one of the five Indian authors of the IPCC report. Citing examples of extreme weather events in India, another India author, Aromar Revi, said, "We had already seen extreme weather events in Kedarnath, Chennai and Kerala. Other parts of the globe faced similar events. Options to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius exist. We need to act on it. Otherwise, the cost to deal with the problem will be much higher later". Allowing the global temperature to temporarily exceed or 'overshoot' 1.5 degree C would mean a greater reliance on techniques that remove CO2 from the air to return global temperature to below 1.5 degree C by 2100. The effectiveness of such techniques are, however, unproven at large scale and some may carry significant risks for sustainable development, the report notes. "Limiting global warming to 1.5 degree C compared with 2 degree C would reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being, making it easier to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals," said Priyardarshi Shukla, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III. Ninety-one authors and review editors from 40 countries prepared the IPCC report. "The IPCC report is a wake-up call for slumbering world leaders. We must reduce emissions as quickly as possible to keep 1.5 degrees of warming within reach. The difference in impacts between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming is large, and potentially game changing. And, the devastation that would come with today's 3-4 degree Celsius trajectory would be vastly greater. Each tenth of a degree matters - and tragically it's the poor who will be most affected," said Andrew Steer, President & CEO of the World Resources Institute (WRI). According to the report, Arctic ecosystems, small island developing countries and least developed countries are among the regions which are at "disproportionately higher risk" of adverse consequences of global warming of 1.5 degree C.

Senator Loren Legarda welcomes the announcement made by President Hilda Heine, President of Marshall Islands and incoming Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) that this year's CVF Virtual Summit will be convened on 22 November. The announcement was made during the 6th Global Environment Facility Assembly in Da Nang, Vietnam. "The CVF plays a very significant role in pushing for a more ambitious climate commitment that would deliver beneficial results to vulnerable countries. We must continue to rally our respective governments and the community of nations to take urgent climate action," Legarda said. "The CVF Virtual Summit will serve as a venue for its members to reaffirm their genuine commitment to pursue the ultimate goal of building resilient, safe, healthy and livable cities and communities. We need to be reminded through this summit of the original purpose of organizing the CVF in the first place, and to also regain the momentum of global climate action,"Legarda added. According to the statement of Marshallese President Heine, this year's CVF Summit, which will be the first-ever global political summit to be held entirely online, will showcase "our intensions to work in new and innovative ways, and to build broader coalitions across society for the change we need and is aimed to inspire leaders all over the world to reconsider what might be additionally accomplished through the creative use of resources at hand." "We welcome this innovation and we support the move to take advantage of the latest technological advancements so we can do more and we can do better. This virtual summit is a new undertaking for CVF and hopefully, this will help the member nations to further promote inclusive dialogue and dynamic exchange of initiatives," Legarda said. Moreover, the Summit also aims to encourage more countries to join this new coalition of front-runners willing to raise ambition, accelerate climate action, and address climate threats. It will be held between the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 special report in October and Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) in Poland in December. In November 2015, the CVF adopted the Manila-Paris Declaration during a High-Level Meeting in conjunction with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21). It articulated common concerns and commitments of vulnerable countries and urged the strengthening of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels enshrined in the Paris Agreement. "We are striving for 1.5 degrees Celsius to ensure a sustainable, low-carbon economy, and we know we can do this together. The dream of having a safer and cleaner world needs the cooperation of all countries, and it would be much better if more countries would join us in this cause. After all, we live in the same planet; any harm done to the environment would not only impact the vulnerable nations but would affect the entire human ecosystem and balance of life," Legarda said. "Now that the Marshall Islands has assumed the CVF Presidency, I am certain that, with the unequivocal support of every member, it will continue to be a powerful voice of reason in the fight for climate justice for the vulnerable," Legarda concluded. \</doc>

- 250m framework aims to bring in 1bn of private sector capital investment - Bank seeks to double the supply of Green and Sustainability Bonds in its regions - Investment framework builds on Banks 8 years of expertise as a Green Bond issuer The EBRD presented its plans for a 250 million direct investment framework for Green and Sustainability Bonds targeted at financial institutions at an event during international climate talks in Katowice, Poland. Over the next three years, the EBRD framework, approved in September, is expected to mobilise private sector capital investments of a further 1 billion, and aims to double the supply of Green and Sustainability Bonds issued by financial institutions across the regions where the bank invests. Green Bonds whose proceeds exclusively go to projects with clear environmental benefits have gained global recognition for enabling debt issuers to finance projects that transition their business towards greater environmental stability. They are also seen as a key part of efforts in supplying a pledged US$ 100 billion in annual climate funding, due from 2020, which helped convince developing countries to sign up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. With the approval in September 2018 of the EBRDs direct investment framework targeted at financial institutions, the Bank may support Green and Sustainability Bond issuance in its regions. The objective of the EBRD Investment Framework is to incentivise transparency and adherence to high green standards with its financial institution clients and to report on the underlying projects quantitative and qualitative environmental benefits and impacts. The EBRD has issued Green Bonds since 2010 to finance its green project portfolio, which includes more than 380 projects in EBRD regions from Morocco to Mongolia and from Estonia to Egypt.Turkey accounts for 34 per cent of this green portfolio, which is in excess of 4 billion, and Poland 15 per cent. At the COP24 international climate conference in Katowice, Poland, the EBRD set out the latest expansion of its green bond operations as an investor - at a side event on 10 December on Extending Green Bonds to New Frontiers. While the global market for Green Bonds has grown rapidly in recent years, exceeding US$ 155 billion of issuance in 2017, large regional gaps remain with just under two per cent of global issuance volume coming from the EBRD regions. The Bank has been leading efforts to increase the markets scale and notes increasing calls from potential issuers for EBRDs involvement as investor and technical assistance provider for pilot issuance. In March 2018, the Bank completed a US$ 68.5 million investment in Amundi Planet - Emerging Green One, the worlds biggest Green Bond fund and the first dedicated to emerging markets, including the EBRD regions. In parallel with this investment, the EBRD launched a dedicated Green Bond Technical Cooperation Programme across its regions to help increase the issuance of green bonds to finance environmentally friendly projects. Together with other multilateral development banks, the EBRD seeks to establish harmonised best practices for this market, including for emerging Green Bond issuance, through its participation in the executive committee of the Green Bond Principles, which provide voluntary process guidelines developed by a broad forum of market participants under the secretariat of the International Capital Market Association. Since 2010, the EBRD has issued more than 70 Green Bonds totalling 2.6 billion equivalent. The EBRD is also a leading international financial institution in terms of renewable energy and energy efficiency financing. It is the largest financier of renewable energy projects in its markets; 43 per cent of the Banks 2017 investment was made in Green Economy Transition (GET) projects, achieving the initial target under the flagship initiative two years ahead of schedule. The EBRD invests in green projects across sectors, both directly and through intermediated channels. The sectors include clean energy, green transport, sustainable agriculture, and manufacturing and services. \</doc>

Climate change presents a US$3 trillion investment opportunity in Africa by 2030 and the private sector will be key to green investment and development, Barbara Buchner, one of the top 20 influential women in climate change, has said. , Buchner, who is also the Executive Director for Climate Finance Program at Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) lent her voice to those of other experts at the Finance Day organized by the African Development Bank at COP24 in Katowice, Poland. A range of high-profile speakers set out the challenges and opportunities for financing adaptation and mitigation efforts across Africa over four fascinating sessions, including Innovative Financing Solutions, Drive Billions to a Sustainable Economy in Africa, Inclusive Policies, and Finance for Sustainable Energy Access. Buchner set the scene by reminding the audience that 14% of the worlds population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, yet only 3% of global climate finance flows into the continent. She shared useful insights from her work on the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance initiative, emphasizing that a public-private approach is key to its effectiveness. Since launching in 2014, the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance has launched 35 transformative solutions, collectively mobilizing US$1 billion in mitigation and adaptation efforts around the world, she said. Panel speakers called for innovative approaches to attract and steer financial ?ows consistent towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development to achieve the NDCs that Africa has set out. Statistics have it that Africa offers the highest returns compared to most emerging market economies. For the last two decades, the continent has seen steady economic growth underpinned by commodity exports, growing market demand, and strengthened structural elements. Between 2011 and 2015, and as part of its previous Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), the African Development Bank mobilized approximately US$12 billion of climate finance to support climate-resilient and low-carbon development in Africa. Nonetheless, Africa has not succeeded as much as other regions of the world in mobilizing the funding needed to implement climate-smart initiatives. With new Green Climate Fund (GCF) finance now available to be channeled through the Bank, African countries will have additional resources to access. David Jackson, Director of Local Development Finance at UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), said: Adaptation is going to be a very expensive process; its also a localized process. It can only be done by those responsible for land-use planning, agriculture, water management, transport etc. Jackson emphasized the need to encourage access at a local level and to set up national platforms for adaptation, which bring together national and local governments. Experts emphasized how programming adaptation efforts presents a unique challenge given the evolving nature of climate risks, associated uncertainties, and existing implementation issues. Gareth Phillips, Chief Climate Change and Green Officer at the African Development Bank, said: Strengthening the capacities of national and subnational bodies to access, manage, and channel finance and collectively work together is critical to making adaptation happen at the speed and scale we need. At the same time, we have to do better at engaging national and sub-national stakeholders in the decision-making process. Unlocking finance is critical to achieving the African NDCs. The African Development Bank is working closely with international climate funds as well as other partners to scale up climate finance on the African continent and to strengthen institutions to directly access climate funds. In the words of Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank: Africas financial actors need to work together creatively to mobilize global financial resources at a scale that can support local innovation, and that drives climate-resilient and low-carbon development on the continent. Having been short-changed by climate change, Africa must not be short-changed by climate finance. The Banks climate spending will increase to 40% of its total new investments by 2020 compared to 26% on average from 2011 to 2014. \</doc>

An Andorran delegation participated from this Tuesday at COP 24 on climate change in Katowice, Poland, in order to strengthen the commitment of the Principality to the fight against climate change, and continue working from the multilateralism in this milestone. COP 24 on climate change began this Sunday, and the director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change, Carles Miquel, and an office technician participated during this week in the negotiations. In addition, the representatives of the Andorran delegation will defend in the plenary the second update bianual report of Andorra, which was presented in 2017. This conference of the Parties (COP) aims to work urgently to complete the details that will operate in the Paris Agreement. As the Polish President of the COP 24 , Micha? Kurtyka, explained, the work will be multidisciplinary and will include technical discussions, which when necessary will be raised to the heads of delegation to unlock progress. On this same Tuesday, in the COP 24 , the Katowice Declaration for E-mobility was approved, to which Andorra has adhered. In the declaration, the signatory countries emphasize the importance of e-mobility in combating climate change, they are working together to ensure that the fight against climate change and e-mobility are complemented, and underline that the transition Transport is of interest to all for a cleaner air, for innovation in the industry and for a safe and stable climate. In addition, the text includes the initiative of Poland to create a framework for the associations of electric mobility. Since it was approved in Paris within the framework of COP21, 184 states comprising the 197 signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have ratified the Paris Agreement. In Andorra, the General Council agreed to ratify it unanimously on November 30, 2016, and it came into force on April 23. Countries such as Andorra, which are part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, are required to report every two years a report called BUR (Bi-annual update report) in which they provide information about the emissions inventory of greenhouse gases, and on the actions that are being carried out to mitigate these emissions. Andorra submitted to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change its second BUR in August 2017. This report has satisfactorily passed the analysis of a group of technical experts, and in this second phase, the On December 7, the Andorran delegation will defend the report, which will be exchanged with the rest of the parties. Countries that participate in the debate may ask questions written or oral about the document. The high level segment of COP 24 will take place on December 11 and 12 and will be attended by the Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability, Silvia Calv, who will express the firm commitment of Andorra in favor of climatic action The general director of Environment and Sustainability, Marc Rossell, will accompany the minister during the participation in the conference of the parties. \</doc>

Prime Minister Juri Ratas will travel to Poland, Katowice, where he will attend the meeting for heads of states within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) tomorrow. The aim of the two-week conference is to agree on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. Approximately 30,000 people will attend the convention, including heads of states and representatives of regulatory agencies, local governments, entrepreneurs, and non-governmental organisations. According to Prime Minister Jri Ratas, the issue of climate change requires arriving at important decisions in order to leave a clean and habitable environment for future generations. Countries must cooperate to successfully establish the goals set with the Paris Agreement, the prime minister said. At the 2015 Paris Climate Conference COP21, an international agreement was adopted by 195 countries to stop climate warming. The main objective of this agreement is, in the long term, to keep a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and thus prevent dangerous climate changes. \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 4 -- Pay-as-you-go solar pioneer Azuri Technologies and the Electrification Financing Initiative (ElectriFi) will feature at the UN Climate Change Conference COP24 this week to showcase how innovative financing in the off-grid solar sector is helping millions across Africa access affordable, renewable, clean energy. Azuri announced last year an innovative US$20 million off-balance-sheet multi-phase debt financing programme to provide working capital for the expansion of off-grid energy and service provision in East Africa. The first phase of US$4 million comprises of investment from the EU programme Electrify and is currently being rolled out in Kenya. "The support from ElectriFI has been a key enabler for the African off-grid sector, providing both essential debt finance and a framework that is now being followed by commercial investors" said Azuri CEO Simon Bransfield-Garth. Dominiek Deconinck, Fund Manager ElectriFI added: "A major barrier to investments in access to energy in developing countries is the lack of working capital finance. ElectriFI is delighted to be supporting the off-grid energy sector in sub Saharan Africa and providing catalytic finance that will help improve the conditions for mainstream investment in this underfunded sector." The Azuri financing program allows commercial debt to be raised and secured against the future revenues of Azuri customers. ElectriFI was pivotal in the creation of this receivables financing scheme, investing alongside other commercial lenders. Over 600 million people in Africa have no access to electricity. Azuri, with the help of its financing partners, is tackling this crisis head on through award-winning solar innovation that is delivering reliable, renewable and distributed power on an affordable pay-as-you-go basis. Azuri has been a leading provider of pay-as-you-go-solar home solutions in Kenya since 2012. The pay-as-you-go sector is growing rapidly, and its continued expansion will require access to substantial levels of commercial debt capital, such as that initiated by ElectriFI.

At COP 24 climate talks, UN secy general says current efforts not enoughKATOWICE(POLAND) The world is "way off course" in its plan to prevent catastrophic climate change, the United Nations warned on Monday as nations gathered in Poland to chart a way for mankind to avert runaway global warming.After a string of damning scientific reports showing humanity must drastically slash its greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told delegates at the opening of a UN climate summit: "Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption."Leaders from at-risk nations such as Fiji, Nigeria and Nepal were to plead their case at the COP24 climate talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord.But host Poland will push its own agenda: a "just transition" from fossil fuels that critics say could allow it to continue polluting for decades. Nor are any of the world's largest emitters represented at the highest level in Poland.Nations to finalise goalsOfficials from nearly 200 countries now have two weeks to finalise how those goals work in practice. One of the key disputes is finance. Under Paris, richer nations-responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions-are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access.World Bank ups fundingBank on Monday announced US$200 billion in climate action investment for 2021-25-a major shot in the arm for green initiatives but one which needs bolstering by state funding.

New Zealand will provide a further $2.5 million to support Fijis ongoing presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference . New Zealand remains committed to standing with Pacific countries to reduce emissions, build resilience, and achieve the Paris Agreements long term temperature goal, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. New Zealands additional support will assist Fiji to continue this work for the remainder of its COP23 Presidency and reflects our deepening partnership with Fiji. Through New Zealands Pacific Reset, we recognise that such partnerships with our closest neighbours will bolster our efforts to tackle priority issues facing the region, the Ministry said. New Zealands $2.5 million contribution is in addition to the $1.3 million provided to Fiji when its presidency commenced in 2017. Fijis presidency continues until December 2018 when the presidency will pass to Poland. \</doc>

The first members of Scotlands Just Transition Commission have been announced, alongside publication of the bodys remit. The Commission will look at how to maximise the social and economic opportunities offered by moving to a carbon neutral economy and will be chaired by Professor Jim Skea. Announcing the membership while attending the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) in Poland, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: We are committed to achieving carbon neutrality while growing a sustainable economy that improves the opportunities, life chances and wellbeing of every citizen of Scotland, and I am absolutely determined that this will be done in a way that is socially inclusive. That is why I previously announced that Professor Jim Skea would chair a Commission to explore how the transition to carbon neutrality can help us meet our other economic and social ambitions. I am now delighted to confirm the appointment of the Commissions initial members. We are clear that no-one should be left behind in our move to a carbon neutral economy and that this should deliver fair work, and I look forward to working with the commission over the next two years to make this a reality. \</doc>

Dec. 6 -- Until next 14th, the Brazilian delegation to the UN Conference on the Environment ( COP-24 ) will reinforce the message that nature preservation and economic development are not rivals. To this end, government representatives intend to present examples of initiatives taken in Brazil by both the private and public sectors that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The country's commitment to the Paris Agreement is to reduce these emissions by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030, both compared to 2005. At the end of last year, the reduced quantity made it possible to anticipate meeting the target for 2020 in relation to the Amazon and the Cerrado. The reduction achieved in 2016 and 2017 is equivalent to the sum of the emissions of the five largest European economies in 2016. These results were achieved through actions created and put into practice by the government over the last two years and will be detailed by Brazil during COP-24 . Protected Areas One of the main measures that contributed to the good Brazilian performance was the increase in more than 94 million hectares of protected areas in the Amazon, the Cerrado, the Caatinga, the Atlantic Forest and the Marine Coastal biome, from May 2016 to June 2018 Currently, there are 335 federal conservation units in the five regions of the country, totaling more than 167 million hectares. Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) CAR is one of the main tools foreseen in the Brazilian forest law for the conservation of the environment, the environmental adequacy of properties, the fight against illegal deforestation and the monitoring of areas under restoration. The cadastre also assists in meeting national and international goals for the maintenance of native vegetation and ecological restoration of ecosystems. Until 31 August 2018, the number of registrations in the CAR totaled more than 5.3 million records, corresponding to a registered area of over 495 million hectares. Amazon Fund Managed by BNDES and coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment, the Amazon Fund has supported 102 projects and disbursed more than R $ 1 billion for activities related to the conservation, monitoring, recovery and sustainable use of the Amazon forest and other Brazilian biomes. Civil society Another priority of the Brazilian delegation at the event will be the Talanoa Dialogue . At this stage, Brazil will present initiatives from segments such as civil society, indigenous peoples, private sector, scientific community that contribute to reduce carbon emissions.

Times at CLIMATE MEET The current round of UN climate conference ( COP24 ) may not come out with a robust rule book for implementation of the Paris Agreement. An outcome will certainly be achieved, but it may not be on expected lines and therefore the remaining work on crucial issues will spill over to the next 'conference of parties' in 2019. This is the growing sense among participants at the climate conference here as different tracks of negotiation signal rich nations are digging in their heels to dilute the differentiation between developed and developing countries while framing the rule book. Continuing differences among developed and developing countries on key issues, primarily finance and reporting on countries' climate action and support, on the eighth day of negotiations here on Tuesday was another indication that this meet won't end with its full mandate of framing complete operational guidelines and procedures (rule book) on all 29 articles of the global deal which was arrived at Paris three years ago.  These disagreements have become red lines for developing countries. Though it would be premature to say anything conclusively at this juncture as there are many landing zones (potential convergence points) in the draft text and we still have three days of negotiations left for course correction, the COP 24 appears to be heading for a rule book which may not cover all articles of the Paris Agreement, said a key negotiator of developing country. The contentious article of the Paris Agreement on climate finance (Article 9) deals with issue of extending financial support by rich nations to developing countries for assisting them in both their mitigation (emission cut) and adaptation actions.

- This inaugural investment enabled the Green for Growth Fund to harness private funding for greater energy savings and renewable energy in the Middle East and North Africa region - Measures financed through the investment should result in annual primary energy savings of 200,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of 40,000 metric tons During COP24 taking place in Katowice, Poland, Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP) officially signed an investment of EUR 5 million to the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to support the funds lending for energy efficiency, resource efficiency and renewable energy measures in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Serving as a risk cushion, this investment helped the fund to attract further private investors, thus enhancing its outreach and impact. This operation was first committed at a ceremony held during COP 23, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Since then, GGFs outstanding portfolio in the MENA region has grown stronger to over EUR 110 million spread across 14 partner institutions and has generated cumulative sub-loans of over EUR 60 million. This existing portfolio is yielding estimated annual primary energy savings of 460,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of around 90,000 metric tons. Part of the portfolio has been developed thanks to the planned Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform support, and it already exceeds the targets set at the time of the initial announcement in Bonn. Founded in late 2016, the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform aims to fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits, thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The platform contributes to Luxembourgs international commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and is in line with the EIBs Climate Strategy. GGF Chairman Olaf Zymelka stated: EIB being one of the initiators of GGF, has been a tremendous support throughout our journey and we are grateful to them and the Luxembourg government to choose GGF as the very first investment of this joint initiative. This new partnership will enhance our capacity to respond to the growing demand for energy and resource efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy in MENA, and we are eager to contribute further to a green future for the region. Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and environment said: The first pillar of EIBs Climate Strategy focuses on reinforcing the impact of EIB climate financing. Thats why I am very pleased that following last years announcement at COP 23, we have now finalised our investment in the Green for Growth Fund (GGF). The EIB has played a key role in the development of the GGF, and remains one of the funds leading partners. We believe that this joint support under the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform is an important signal of confidence in the funds potential going forward and we hope our commitment will attract additional finance from third parties, including from the private sector. Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, said: For Luxembourg, being an important financial centre, unlocking private finance is a key objective. Luxembourg is thus very pleased to partner with the EIB on the Green For Growth Fund. \</doc>

Hosting COP24 , the latest of the UN's annual climate summits, in Katowice was meant to symbolise the transition from an old, dirty world to a new, clean one. Spiritually, the city is the home of Poland's coal miners. Today, it is replete with besuited management consultants and bearded baristas. The venue itself was on top of a disused mine in the city centre. Ahead of the two-week powwow, which concluded on December 15th, many feared the meeting would instead highlight the unresolved contradictions involved in that transition. So it came as a relief when nearly 14,000 delegates from 195 countries managed-more or less, and a day late-to achieve the gathering's main objective: a "rule book" for putting into practice the Paris agreement of 2015, which commits the world to keeping global warming "well below" 2C relative to pre-industrial times, and preferably within 1.5C. This outcome was far from assured. Setting an abstract goal, as governments had in Paris, is simpler than agreeing on how to go about reaching it. Technicalities-what counts as a reduction in emissions, who monitors countries' progress and so on-can be politically thorny. Poland's right-wing government, which presided over the talks, lacks both friends (alienated by, among other things, its anti-democratic attacks on judicial independence) and green credentials. Observers were braced for a diplomatic debacle. Implementing the judgment of Paris The summit got off to an inauspicious start. At the outset Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, declared that his country cannot reasonably be expected to give up its 200 years' worth of coal reserves. In France, his opposite number, Emmanuel Macron, caved in to massive protests and suspended a planned fuel-tax rise intended to help curb greenhouse-gas emissions from transport. Days earlier, Brazil had withdrawn its offer to host next year's summit after Jair Bolsonaro, the president-elect who takes office in January and who would love to follow his American counterpart, Donald Trump, out of the Paris deal, said his government had no interest. Despite these early setbacks, negotiators resolved most of 2,800-odd points of contention in the rule book's pre-summit draft. Michal Kurtyka, the amiable Polish bureaucrat who chaired the proceedings, turned apparent haplessness into a virtue, by leaving delegates space to thrash out their differences. Poor countries won firmer assurances that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea levels and fiercer floods, droughts, storms and other climate-related problems. The rich world, for its part, cajoled China into accepting uniform guidelines for tallying those emissions. Thus stripped of their most powerful voice, other developing countries reluctantly followed suit. If any cannot meet the standards, they must explain why and present a plan to make amends. This concession, long demanded by the Americans, may not persuade Mr Trump to keep the United States in the deal. But it could make things easier for any successor who wished to re-enter it after Mr Trump has left office. Besides haggling over the rules, a handful of countries-including big polluters such as Ukraine-used the jamboree to announce plans for more ambitious "nationally determined contributions" (or NDCs, as the voluntary pledges countries submit under the Paris deal are known). The city councils of Melbourne and Sydney, in Australia, joined a growing number of national and local governments intent on phasing out coal. So did Israel and Senegal. In the wake of Brazil's desertion, Chile stepped in to organise next year's summit, which convention dictates should happen in Latin America. The Paris compact has thus not come apart at the seams. Predictably, for negotiations that need to balance the interest of nearly 200 parties, no one leaves Katowice entirely happy. Vulnerable countries, such as small island states imperilled by rising seas, worry that the findings of a recent un-backed scientific report outlining the dire consequences of another half a degree of warming, on top of the 1C which has happened since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, have been underplayed. Rich countries grumble that poor ones can still get away with emitting too much carbon dioxide. Mr Kurtyka was also unable, because of Brazilian objections, to break an impasse on carbon trading. This is an arrangement that allows big belchers of CO2 to offset emissions by paying others to forgo some of theirs. Brazil balked at proposals intended to prevent double-counting in such trading, because it believed they penalised its large stockpile of carbon-trading instruments, such as promises not to chop down patches of the Amazon. As a result, the issue has been kicked into the long cassava. The direction of travel is, nevertheless, correct. Earlier in the meeting Ottmar Edenhofer, a veteran German climate policymaker who is director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, had feared that Katowice would mark "the beginning of the end of the Paris agreement". For all its shortcomings, the compromise which emerged is not that. But after all is said and done, the 2C goal (let alone the 1.5C aspiration) still remains a distant prospect. The current set of NDCs puts the world on course for more or less 3C of warming-and Kiribati and the Marshall Islands at risk of submersion. Campaigners, who spiced up the stodgy talks with a dash of sit-ins and marches, were right to decry the lack of ambition as unequal to the task of sparing future generations from climate catastrophe. The rule book is itself no nostrum for the planet's man-made fever. The only real medicine would be firmer commitment to decarbonising economies. And, as Mr Macron is finding, that medicine can be bitter. \</doc>

BRUSSELS, Dec. 3 -- The Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEM) Initiative is, today, unveiling its definition of an energy efficient mortgage which is the result of extensive cross-sectoral, market consultation of the lending institutions piloting the energy efficient mortgage framework and of the EEM Advisory Council. Today's announcement coincides with the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference - COP24 The definition is intended as a concrete response to the efforts of the European Commission to construct a capital markets union, to facilitate the clean energy transition in line with the Paris Agreements, and in this context, to build a financial system that supports sustainable growth. It will provide a market benchmark to operationalise the integration of energy efficient mortgages into the business lines of the forty-one pilot lending institutions. At the end of 2017, these lending institutions represented 55% of mortgages outstanding in the European Union, equal to 25% of EU GDP, constituting significant critical mass in the market. The EEM Initiative is a market-led initiative, funded via the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Programme, which aims to deliver a standardised European framework and data collection architecture for energy efficient mortgages, with favourable financing conditions for energy efficient buildings, energy saving renovations and anti-seismic measures. The EEM Pilot Scheme was launched in June 2018, further to the engagement of market actors in a consultation process by way of national and European roundtable events. The pilot scheme lending institutions are supported by the EEM Advisory Council, which includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, The World Bank, UNEP Finance Initiative, the Scottish Government and Climate Bond Initiative. To consult the definition, please click here( HYPERLINK http://eemap.energyefficientmortgages.eu/eem-definition/ http://eemap.energyefficientmortgages.eu/eem-definition/ ). Gerassimos Thomas, European Commission, Deputy Director-General for Energy, stated: "I believe the EEM Initiative will bring a positive change in the market, providing more accessible financing for energy efficiency in buildings. It will facilitate the implementation of energy efficiency investments where they are most needed, in the buildings sector. Having agreed on a definition is an important step, opening the way for a quick roll-out of energy efficiency mortgages. The definition agreed upon is operational and easy to use, and can be strengthened in time, to match the high level of ambition of the EEM Initiative, and to make better use of the tools provided by the European legislative framework." Luca Bertalot, Energy Efficient Mortgages Initiative Coordinator, stated: "Now is the time to take action, a market roadmap is the most effective way of delivering mortgage financing solutions to support European citizens in making their homes more energy efficient, comfortable, secure and therefore, ultimately, future-proof. The definition announced today provides a strong, operational market benchmark for lending institutions and a clear blueprint for the European Commission's Sustainable Finance agenda, by facilitating cross-sectoral and institutional coordination and delivering market innovation and synergies."

The cornerstone of the initiative is the assumption that energy efficiency has a risk mitigation effect for banks as a result of the impact on a borrower's ability to service his/her loan and on the value of the property, a correlation which the EeMAP Initiative will seek to substantiate. The Energy Efficiency Data Protocol and Portal (EeDaPP) Initiative - led by European Mortgage Federation-European Covered Bond Council (EMF-ECBC), Ca' Foscari University of Venice, CRIF, European DataWarehouse, Hypoport, SAFE Goethe University Frankfurt and TXS - aims to design and deliver a market-led protocol, which will enable the large-scale recording of data relating to energy efficient mortgage assets, via a standardised reporting template. The data will be accessed by way of a common, centralised portal, allowing for continuous tracking of the performance of the energy efficient mortgage assets, thereby also facilitating the earmarking of such assets for the purposes of energy efficient bond issuance.

As the year draws to a close, it has been put on record by scientists that this has been one of the warmest years of the past decade, rife with heat waves, rising sea levels and that most of these find their roots in climate change. Every year, at the Conference of Parties (COP), under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), nations discuss how they can work together to mitigate the impact of climate change. There have been several watershed moments in these negotiations, the latest being the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was signed by almost 200 countries. The provisions of this agreement are expected to come into effect in 2020, so the latest COP in Katowice, Poland-the 24th such meeting-focused on its implementation. While more than 200 nations (minus the US) agreed on implementing the Paris Rulebook at Katowice, there was a general sense that pledges made three years ago were insufficient. In Paris, there was talk of nations going ahead with nationally determined contributions to tilt the balance in favour of keeping the rising global temperature less than the 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels\'c2\£d-beyond which the consequences could be catastrophic. To limit global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C, all nations have to halve their emissions by 2030. While China and India have invested heavily in renewables, many others remain non-committal. While the Paris Rulebook makes it mandatory for nations to report on all aspects of climate finance, getting developing countries to collate and report on this is hard as many of them lack the knowhow. Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, says, "Countries are now on their own to mitigate, to adapt and to pay the cost of climate impacts. The UNFCCC is now a platform to collect and synthesise information, and provide a forum to discuss and debate. It doesn't have the tools to drive global collective action to combat climate change. One needs to question the raison d'\'c3\£atre of the UNFCCC." In 2015, developing countries had demanded transfer of technology and money to mitigate and adapt to climate change. While developed countries had agreed to raise roughly $100 billion a year into the climate kitty starting 2020, they are way off their target as of now. In Katowice, the finance issue was to be fleshed out and given teeth, but unfortunately there seems to be lowered accountability after the COP. Developed countries can now choose to fulfil their financial commitments through a mix of loans, grants, aids, and there is very little accountability if they decide to renege. The US, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia and some others have refused to acknowledge the grim findings of the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, commissioned by the United Nations, which was released in October. While the new report highlighted how 1.5\'c2\'b0C rather than 2\'c2\'b0C was the new tipping point, these nations wanted to keep the report out of the conference. The report sounds the warning bell saying there's a window of 12 years within which countries must act to prevent further damage. As per Bhushan, "This COP will be remembered as anti-science for its failure to take into account the findings of the IPCC's Special Report on 1.5\'c2\'b0C. It will be remembered for coming out with a rulebook that dilutes an already weak Paris Agreement." The stage seems set to take stock of the long battle at hand in the next meeting in Chile in December 2019. \</doc>

A day before the closing of the UNFCCC COP 24 , the issue of "flexibility" in implementing articles in the Paris Agreement, especially in the event of transparency in action and support, became a hot topic at the negotiating table. For developed countries that are more mature in the application of various provisions, methodology and reporting, this is not a problem with the severity of the requirements under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol. But for developing countries this still needs to be given space because it will only implement various provisions of the Paris Agreement in a mandatory manner. Nur Masripatin as Chair of the Indonesian National Focal Point for the UNFCCC and Chairperson of the Negotiator said that of course Indonesia as a developing country still needs flexibility in terms of methodology and reporting on the implementation of the target Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) especially in accordance with the Paris Agreement. "We also do not expect flexibility as wide as possible but we want a gradual process towards improving the methodology and details of reporting actions and support through the" Vehicle "established by the Paris Agreement, for example in transparency reports that are also debated between what action and support" annually (every year) "Or" biennial (two years) ", said Nur Masripatin. According to Nur, there was also seriousness in the developed countries because they were busy saying we were "more flexible" but they themselves did not want to be transparent in reporting available support, as well as those that had been given to developing countries. The Director of the Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Joko Prihatno, as the lead negotiator for the Transparency Framework said that flexibility is regulated in article 13 paragraph 1 and article 13 paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement. "As long as it does not conflict with the article, it can be implemented as a transparency framework by member countries," said Joko. In Article 13 paragraph 1, it is stated that the transparency framework in action and support can be applied, and must be adapted to differences in capacity and based on collective experience. Whereas paragraph 12 mentions the existence of a technical expert review in the support provided by developed countries in achieving NDC and paying attention to the "area of ??improvement" and the consistency of information delivered, but there needs to be flexibility in accordance with the capacity of developing countries. Although COP 24 "In this way, developed countries still cannot seriously help developing countries to fulfill their contributions in accordance with the promises in their respective NDCs," said Nur, who is still busy observing the knot of issues ahead of the COP closure. \</doc>

Dec. 20 -- The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) will inject R$ 163 million for new financing within the scope of the Climate Fund program. These funds are included in the R$ 228 million announced in late September and were enabled after the edition of Provisional Measure 851/2018, which incorporated the income of the equity Fund. The funds of the Climate Fund can be used to support the implementation of projects, the acquisition of machinery and equipment and the technological development that are related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to the adaptation to climate change and its effects. The program is divided into ten sub-programmes: native forests; renewable energies; efficient machinery and equipment; urban mobility; sustainable cities and climate change; solid waste; charcoal; carbon management services; and innovative projects. History - The Climate Fund, established by Law 12,114/2009, is one of the instruments of the National Policy on Climate Change, and its goal is to finance climate change mitigation projects, using technologies that still need incentive to their diffusion. BNDES is the accredited financial institutional of the refundable part and member of the Management Committee of the Fund, composed of ministries, industry, academia and civil society. The current portfolio has approximately R$ 600 million in projects, more than R$ 500 million have already been approved by BNDES, which leveraged more than R$ 1 billion in financing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These investments are estimated to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by about 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent. COP 24 - Climate Change is the focus of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations, the COP 24 , which occurs in Katowice, Poland, up to next Friday, 14, with the participation of BNDES technicians. On Tuesday, 11, the team of the Environmental Department of the Bank participated in two events representing the Amazon Fund at COP24 . In the morning, the theme was the payment by results of REDD+ (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). In the afternoon, BNDES participated in a presentation on the financing of forest recovery projects in large scale in Brazil. On Monday, 10, the team participated in an event promoted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), where a case study of OECD about BNDES and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) was presented. The document points out that development banks are fundamental for sustainable infrastructure investments in developing countries and is available from the following link: HYPERLINK http://www.oecd.org/environment/environment-development/Financing-Climate-Futures-NDB-Brazil-South-Africa.pdf http://www.oecd.org/environment/environment-development/Financing-Climate-Futures-NDB-Brazil-South-Africa.pdf \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 06 -- Perils of climate change are now there for all to see for themselves. The IMD has predicted above normal temperatures in the ongoing winter (December 2018 to February 2019) in the country and below normal cold wave conditions in the core zone, almost just like it was last season. Meanwhile, a study presented by Indian scientists at the ongoing COP 24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, put Assam and Mizoram among the most vulnerable Himalayan states. Also, in the Global Climate Risk Index 2019, with 2,736 deaths, India accounted for the second highest fatalities in the world in 2017 due to extreme weather events. Amid the international urgency to prevent global warming spiraling out of control and skeptics voicing doubts over climate parleys yielding results, environmentalists are hopeful of a '50-50' chance of Katowick succeeding and resulting in something 'concrete'. "Recent scientific findings and the IPCC and UN reports are pointing that window of opportunity to act is closing fast. The Paris agreement is not sufficient to keep the world safe. Time has come for the countries to revise the 2015 targets, they are not sufficient," says Chandra Bhushan, Deputy Director General, Centre for Science and Environment. "We just have this 15-year window of opportunity to act after which it will be very difficult to keep the temperatures below 2\'b0C," says Bhushan. Environmental expert Soumya Dutta says despite evidence the governments are not doing enough to meet climate targets. Weather events show urgency for higher goals. Since the Paris COP 21 meeting, the governments are talking only of limiting rather than eliminating the side-effects of global warming, says Dutta.

Dec. 3 -- Thanks to application of pro-ecological technology, POSEJDON service complex in Szczecin will reduce CO2 emissions up to even 76% compared to a similar building constructed using a traditional technology. The investor, Porto Sp. z o.o., was granted a EUR 29m loan by the European Investment Bank via Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego. The project was presented today during COP24 conference in Katowice as an example of a low energy consumption building. The Polish modern and pro-ecological construction project was presented today, during the first day the United Nations Conference COP24 related to climate held in Katowice, by the investor, Porto Sp. z o.o., and main financial partners, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). POSEJDON service complex, located in Szczecin, is the largest low energy consumption facility (NZEB - Nearly-Zero Emission Building), i.e. one that in advance meets the most strict, future standards related to energy consumption, which all facilities will have to meet after 1 January 2021 in order to obtain a building permit, currently constructed in Poland. Due to application of modern, pro-ecological solutions, the entire complex will reduce CO2 emissions by even 76% in relation to a similar building constructed using traditional technology. The project which obtained a EUR 29m loan from the EIB was presented in a joint EIB/Benelux Pavilion at COP24 in the presence of Pawe Nierada, First Vice-President of BGK, Vazil Hudak, Vice-president of EIB, Marcin Wozniak, a member of the Management Board of Porto. The presentation is available: HYPERLINK https://posejdoncenter.pl/download/file/fid/1029 https://posejdoncenter.pl/download/file/fid/1029 or alternatively https://we.tl/t-GdIReXqEg7 "POSEJDON is constructed in a place well known to every citizen of Szczecin, which waited very long to regain its former glory," said Marcin Wozniak, a member of the Management Board of Porto Sp. z o.o. "We have developed an ambitious and modern project based on three stable pillars: hotels of the largest global hotel network Marriot, modern offices, and a small, but well-conceived commercial part. Today, all facilities of this type are constructed like this all over the world." "As EIB, we are honoured to finance the first energy Nearly-Zero Emission Building in Poland," said Vazil Hudak, the Vice-president of the European Investment Bank. "The bank already financed similar facilities in other countries, e.g. in Germany or Scandinavia. Together with our long-term partner BGK and out new client and investor - Porto, we are pleased to present the Polish project Posejdon right here, during COP 24 conference organised by the United Nations in Katowice. This project is an example of EIB's support for pro-ecological city solutions in Europe as well as our fight against climate change through financing of energy-efficient projects, in this case, in the real property sector." Pawe Nierada, First Vice-President of BGK, said: "One of the key goals of BGK's activity is to improve the quality of life of Poland's population. The financing of environmentally friendly infrastructure projects is part of our mission, which is to promote the country's balanced development in social and economic terms. The joint commitment on the Posejdon project confirms the good, 17-year-old cooperation between BGK and the EIB. Thanks to this cooperation we have financed over time many projects, including the construction of the Lagiewnicka bypass in Krakow, around 800 km of motorways, more than 1200 km of expressways and 44 urban ring roads. We also cooperate on the Marguerite Fund II, a pan-European equity fund for infrastructure investments in renewables, energy, transport and digital infrastructure". Olgierd Geblewicz, Marshall of the Pomerian province, said: "The city centre of Szczecin is changing before our eyes. A congress centre, hotels, a modern office building - all using advanced ecological solutions. Thanks to Posejdon project, which combines pre-war architecture with the cutting-edge architectural trends and solutions, Szczecin's city center gains a modern character. This is another unprecedented project that revitalises the capital of the Western Pomerania." Additional information about the project How will the entire complex be able to reduce CO2 emissions by even 76% compared to a similar building constructed using traditional technology? Achieving such a spectacular result will be possible due to implementation of a passive geothermal energy system for the needs of heating and cooling, which is composed of 48 vertical heat exchangers located in 300-metre long ground boreholes under the foundation slab, connected with over 900 highly efficient, inverter heat pumps. Electrical energy necessary for operation of the entire system will be obtained by 342 photovoltaic panels of the total power 97.2 kW, located on the roof of the building. Rainwater system in toilets, 15-metre greenery wall in the patio and at least 10 electrical car charging stations complete POSEJDON's image as a leading pro-ecological project, which will be confirmed by, additionally to financing by the European Investment Bank, with BREEAM International New Construction 2016 certificate on predicted level of "very good/excellent." Financing by EIB is an element of a voluntary program initiated by the EU, which focuses on introduction of energy-efficient solutions in commercial properties and use of renewable energy sources. POSEJDON service complex has all the qualities to become a new symbol of modern, business-oriented Szczecin and the entire West Pomerania Voivodeship. At the end of 2019, this complex with a total area of 50k m2, constructed in the very centre of the city, will offer over 18k m2 of office space, nearly 12k m2 of hotel space and approximately 4.6k m2 of commercial and service area. POSEJDON will also become the largest congress centre in Szczecin with six conference and banquet halls and a spacious foyer with the total capacity for 1000 persons. An underground parking lot will offer 299 parking places for cars and 100 places for cyclists.

The Minister for the Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, has underlined the commitment of the Government of Spain with an ecological and just transition, that "does not leave anyone behind". In a meeting on the issue within the framework of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which takes place in Katowice (Poland), Teresa Ribera explained that the Spanish Executive will soon the National Strategy of Just Transition, one of the first regulatory frameworks on the subject that will be approved in the international arena. "I firmly believe in the ability of the green transition to reduce unemployment, create new opportunities and end inequalities, for which it is important to make efficient use of public policies that allow us to anticipate and correct the negative impacts that this necessary process can provoke sectors and territories, "said the head of Ecological Transition. "Do not leave anyone behind involves addressing the realities of the short term, but the just transition requires frameworks that guarantee employment and quality of life in all territories, both in the medium and long term," he added. The National Strategy of Just Transition will be the instrument that will allow the identification and adoption of measures that guarantee workers and territories affected by the transition to a low greenhouse gas emissions economy, an equitable and solidary treatment, optimizing the opportunities of creation of activity economic and employment linked to the ecological transition. For its preparation, the Spanish Executive is following the guidelines agreed by the International Labor Organization (ILO). Thus, among other issues, the framework will design industrial policies, research and development, promotion of economic activity and employment and professional training to ensure that the transition to a low carbon economy is fair and socially beneficial. Fair transition agreements In order to anticipate the adverse effects that may occur in some territories, the Strategy will articulate the formula of the Just Transition agreements. The objective is to support economic initiatives that are determined to be suitable for the different socioeconomic and labor contexts of the affected areas. Through these agreements, different actors may participate in territorial development projects: companies, union organizations, universities, educational centers, non-governmental environmental associations and organizations and the different Administrations. The agreements will be signed with the Ministry for the Ecological Transition, following a report from the Ministry of Labor, Migration and Social Security and the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce and other public administrations, in particular with local entities from geographic areas vulnerable to transition to a low carbon economy. Among other issues, the agreements will include an assessment of the state of vulnerability of the geographical area and of the affected groups, as well as the commitments acquired by the parties, including the companies that benefit from the measures to support the transition. Also fiscal measures, financing, employment, social protection and training activities to promote the adaptation of workers to the objectives reflected in the agreement and a timetable that includes the adoption of measures, with measurable objectives and monitoring mechanisms. The mining agreement, first step Last October , the Government of Spain and the coal mining sector signed an agreement for the just transition and sustainable development of the mining regions. With it, it responds to the social and economic consequences that will occur with the forced closure - at the end of 2018 - of the coal mines in compliance with the community regulations. The mining sector in Spain already underwent a significant transformation in the 1990s, going from 45,000 miners to around 2,000 at present. The agreement includes three types of measures whose common objective is to lay the foundations for a just transition for workers and territories in areas especially involved in the decarbonised economic future, towards which we must move forward. In the first place, it contemplates early retirement and incentivized redundancies for the workers of the mining companies involved in the closure in compliance with European Union legislation. Secondly, a training and support plan for labor insertion designed for mining workers, including workers from subcontracting companies, will be designed to adjust to the new employment needs that will arise in the new productive environment. And, finally, the agreement foresees a fund of 250 million euros, for a period of five years, aimed at supporting business initiatives and development of the affected regions to achieve structural transformation, economic recovery and social welfare. A specific shock plan for the affected areas will be launched, including a restoration plan for mining operations, a plan for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency, and the possibility for local or regional administrations to sign transition agreements with the government. \</doc>

India, Dec. 5 -- Time is running out and negotiators are still not happy. What will be the fate of the Paris Rule Book? Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are at the heart of the Paris Agreement. The awkward phrasing reflects the shift in climate policy thinking between the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Under Kyoto, countries negotiated targets at the international level and implemented them at the national level-a top-down approach. Paris saw the shift to a bottom-up approach. Countries are now supposed to determine their own climate targets at the national level, and communicate them to the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Every effort has been made to distinguish these NDCs from "targets". However, the Paris Agreement does three things to ensure that NDCs are concrete commitments (rather than general aspirations). First, it requires countries to undertake and communicate ambitious NDCs. Second, it requires that a country's second NDC must represent a progression over its first (the third must be a progression over the second, and so on). Third, it requires that countries should pursue domestic mitigation measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of their NDCs-this means that once a country has communicated an NDC, it is undertaking a legal commitment to pursue its self-determined targets. The first NDCs were submitted in 2015, before the Paris Agreement. At the time, they were known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC). Once a country ratified the Agreement, its INDC became its first NDC. These came in all shapes and sizes. They focused on different sectors-some included agriculture, for example, and some did not. They were not based on standard metrics. Targets ranged from percentage reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions per unit gross domestic product (GDP), to a targeted number of electric vehicles on the road. This is why countries are currently negotiating a 'Paris Rule Book'-to set out rules and guidelines which standardise how NDCs are communicated. The Rule Book is to be finalised at the 24 th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which commenced Monday and continues for the next 10 days. Most critically, NDCs are currently not on the same time frame. India, for example, has indicated targets up until 2030, as has China. Other countries have communicated targets up until 2025. These are the two most common approaches, but not the only ones. Hence countries are discussing the question of common time frames-to get all NDC communication on the same schedule. This is different from the question of how regularly NDCs are to be communicated-Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement is clear that countries have to submit a new NDC every five years. Hence, a country could submit an NDC in the year 2060, with targets for the time-period 2065-2075 (i.e. a 10-year time frame). It would then have to submit a new NDC in 2065 (i.e. 5 years later), with targets for 2070-2080 (still a 10-year time frame). As covered above, however, the 10-year time frame is not the standard at present. The draft text of the Paris Rule Book currently has four options for common time-frames-five years, 10 years, five or 10 years, or left to countries themselves. This last option, as several negotiators in Katowice pointed out on Monday, is not really an option. It is in the text as a negotiating tactic, but the time for such tactics is running out. The crux of the issue is the progressive increase in ambition required by the Paris Agreement. Shorter time-frames would mean more regular increases in ambition. The aggregate effect of the currently communicated NDCs has us on track to exceed the dangerous threshold of 1.5degC of warming in the mid-2030s-rapid and regular increases in ambition would be very welcome. A longer time frame, in theory, could allow for more consultation and domestic planning, which could result in more sustainable increases in ambition. It is more likely, though, to lock in un-ambitious domestic planning. The current negotiating text is the work of the co-chairs of the negotiating group on common time frames, and they have attempted to capture the preferences of the negotiators in as clear and concise a manner as possible. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there were early objections to the exclusion of some countries' preferences from the negotiating text. The discussions are hence open again for "options-between-the-options". One such proposal is to just set a schedule until 2040, and push decisions on the schedule beyond 2040 to future negotiating sessions. This is pragmatic, but does not send a strong signal on long-term commitment to climate action. Another proposal would require countries to submit two NDCs at a time, each with a five-year time-frame. Hence, in 2060, a country would communicate an NDC for 2065-2070, and one for 2070-2075. In theory, this combines the benefits of the five and ten year time frames. In practice, common time frames are just one of the issues at stake in Katowice. The fact that negotiators are still not happy to pick one of the options in the draft text is not a promising sign. Innovative proposals can offer a way to find compromise, but they are generally more complex to implement domestically. Besides, momentum behind these proposals should have ideally gathered at the negotiating sessions in Bonn (in May this year) or in Bangkok (in September). With just over a week to finalize the Paris Rule Book, countries must find quicker ways to common ground. cop24 katowice United Nations .

The World Bank has brought some excitement at the ongoing climate change conference here with its announcement that it would provide needy countries about US$ 200 billion between 2021-2025 to help them take more ambitious climate actions, and build resilience against climate change. It said this would almost double its current five-year commitments for climate change. Several hundreds of billions of dollars per year are estimated to be required to fund all the actions that need to be taken to curb climate change and help countries withstand its worst impacts. Developed countries have committed themselves to 'mobilise' at least US$ 100 billion every year from 2020 for this purpose, but most estimates show that this would be a small part of the required money. The World Bank said about half of its newly promised money, US$ 100 billion, will come from its own resources, while the other half would be from two of its associates, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), as well as private funders. But it did not say whether the money would be provided in the form of loans or grants. But significantly, the bank said that at least 25 per cent of this money, or US$ 50 billion, would be aimed for projects that would support climate adaptation, an area for which countries generally have been reluctant to provide money. "A key priority is boosting support for climate adaptation, recognising that millions of people across the world are already facing the severe consequences of more extreme weather events. By ramping up direct adaptation finance to reach around $50 billion over FY21-25, the World Bank will, for the first time, give this equal emphasis alongside investments that reduce emissions," the bank said in a statement. The announcement was welcomed at the climate conference here but people also wanted to see more details. "The World Bank's announcement has come at a time when rich countries are failing to meet their commitment of putting together US$ 100 billion per year for developing countries. The figure of US$ 200 billion over the next five years, divided equally between mitigation and adaptation is a clear recognition that adaptation requires a lot more money than what is available right now, " said Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid International. "However, there is no clarity in what form these financial flows will take place. Adaptation money should never be provided as loans. That would be cruel to the developing countries who did not cause the climate crisis but are already forced to invest in adaptation on top of their development budget," he said. \</doc>

The Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs is satisfied with South Africas preparations for the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP 24 ) that is scheduled to be held from 2 to 14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland. The committee received an update on the current status of the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and progress on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The committee is also pleased that the country has set key priorities stemming from the Paris Agreement where the South African leadership played a critical role. Priorities such as enough mitigation ambition to avoid dangerous human-made climate change, to have enough international financial, technology and capacity building support to make the whole system work and to have effective transparency to build trust and share experiences. These priorities are critical in ensuring that as a country, South Africa plays its part in participating globally in fighting climate change. The Chairperson of the committee remarked that the Katowice climate change negotiations are very critical in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Katowice COP 24 is mandated to adopt the Paris Agreement Work Programme, which should set out the mechanism for the full implementation of the historic Paris Agreement and for this reason, it is the committee's wish that the global climate negotiations succeed for the sake of humanity. The committee has noted the alarming report of the scientific advisory body to the UNFCCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which confirms that it is now evident more than ever before, that climate change is currently the greatest threat to humankind and that dramatic changes by all countries are urgently required in order to limit global warming to 1.5C. \</doc>

For the second day today, negotiators at the climate change conference here remained huddled within the backrooms, unable to make a significant progress on any of the contentious issues. "The progress on the negotiations has been extremely slow till now. It needs to be expedited. There are few days remaining in this conference and we can only hope that there will be a breakthrough very soon," A K Mehta, the head of Indian delegation, said. Negotiators, here, are trying to finalise the rulebook of the 2015 Paris Agreement, containing the processes and guidelines, that will implement its provisions. The issues under discussion are mainly procedural in nature. They are also very technical and complicated, involving details. More than the lack of progress, the developing countries were angered by the repeated attempts by the developed countries to erase the distinction between developed and developing that has been at the heart of the climate negotiations. The current draft of the main negotiating text acknowledges the differentiation between developed and developing country parties at just one place, and that too was in brackets, meaning it was up for negotiation. Differentiation between developed and developing countries has been central to the negotiations, and is enshrined in the 1992 UN Framework Convention "on Climate Change, the mother agreement, and then in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to act on climate change. Developed countries are mandated to do much more, both in terms of reducing their emissions as well as in providing money and technology for dealing with climate change, than the developing countries. Over the years, developed countries have tried to do away with the differentiation as much as possible, and the distinctions made in the 2015 Paris Agreement are much weaker in this regard as compared to the 1992 UN Framework Convention. While working on the rulebook here, attempts are being made to whittle it down even further. The rule book deals with such issues as accounting standards to measure emissions, processes for monitoring, reporting and verification of climate actions being taken by individual countries, mechanisms to raise financial resources and ensure the flow of funds for climate projects, and institutions to facilitate the diffusion of appropriate technologies to countries and regions that need them. Developing countries have been arguing that there cannot be common standards for all countries, for example, to report their climate actions in a certain matter. This could be due to the differences in the capabilities of the countries to gather and process data, for example. "This rule book is being framed for the Paris Agreement. As such, the principles enshrined in the Paris Agreement will apply. There has to be an element of differentiation on every provision, as provided for in the UNFCCC and in the Paris Agreement," a developing country negotiator said. Fresh drafts of agreement texts were expected on Tuesday afternoon but have twice missed the deadline. They are expected late on Tuesday evening now. Negotiators have to finalise an agreement by Friday. \</doc>

Andorra has defended its second annual update report on the greenhouse gas emissions inventory and on the actions that are being carried out to mitigate them, at COP 24 . The director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change, Carles Miquel, and the technician of the Albert Gom office take part from this Tuesday at the Conference of the Parties on climate change, which takes place in Katowice, Poland. This Friday, the Andorran delegation has defended, in front of representatives of different signatory countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the second biennial update report (BUR). This report was submitted to the secretariat of the framework agreement of the United Nations in August 2017, and has already satisfactorily passed the analysis of a group of technical experts. In the presentation of this Friday in Katowice, the delegation has exposed the measures applied to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases. On the one hand they have detailed the actions that will be carried out in the field of energy, specified in the sectoral plan for energy infrastructures, which aims to reduce the energy dependence of the foreigner thanks, mainly to energy sources, renewable origin In addition, they have explained the measures to promote the rehabilitation of buildings to promote energy efficiency, and the promotion of electric vehicles with the Engega plan. The exhibition also discussed the actions related to waste, and in particular with organic matter. The high level segment of COP 24 will take place on December 11 and 12 and will be attended by the Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability, Silvia Calv, who will express the firm commitment of Andorra in favor of climatic action The general director of Environment and Sustainability, Marc Rossell, will accompany the minister during the participation in the conference of the parties. \</doc>

NEW DELHI, Dec. 18 -- With the conclusion of the Paris Rulebook negotiations in Katowice, Poland, governments have reached the end of a long and difficult road. After decades of politically-charged negotiations on obligations, rules and institutions, the regime will now shift gears to the less headline-grabbing business of implementation. Governmental and media attention, ever fickle, is likely to wane, but that could prove beneficial. States can now proceed with the day-to-day work of implementation without attracting the ire of Twitter-happy politicians. But the diminished spotlight could also result in fewer resources - human, institutional, financial - being dedicated to climate change. This would be a profound mistake. The Paris Agreement, the most ambitious agreement that was politically feasible in 2015, would be out of reach in today's geopolitical context. Given the political dysfunction that birthed it, the Paris Agreement has both strengths and weaknesses. In this next phase of global climate governance, the international community needs to build on the agreement's strengths, and address its weaknesses. One core strength of the Paris Agreement, as fleshed out in the Katowice Rulebook, is the crucial role of information. States are required to provide detailed information on the type of actions they have taken. If they have absolute economy-wide targets, they need to provide quantifiable information on their reference points for measurements, the gases covered, their planning processes, how they consider their contribution fair and ambitious, and how it contributes to the objective of the regime. In short, they have to provide clear, transparent and understandable information on what they did and how they did it, so it can be added up and compared to what others are doing. Currently there is a wide variation in the information provided, making aggregation and comparison challenging. States also have to report on indicators for measuring their progress, which is significant as there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets identified in their contributions. States are obligated to submit new, tougher commitments every five years, but they do not face legal consequences if they fail to achieve their targets. There is also an extensive collation of information - from various sources (state, non-state, inter-governmental) and covering the entire spectrum of issues (mitigation, adaptation, support, equity and science) - that will feed into the global stocktakes of collective progress that will occur every five years. While these stocktakes, of political necessity, do not function as 'ratchets' for individual countries' contributions, states are required to provide information on how they have taken the outcomes of stocktakes into account in framing their next contribution. The strong informational flow in the process places considerable demands on countries like India to generate and present robust information. But building this capacity - institutional, research, technological - will help India and other countries develop better and more tailored regulation, governance and implementation processes. The Paris Agreement's principal weakness is its lack of mechanisms to review the adequacy of the contributions from states (adequate in relation to their unique capabilities or responsibilities) - and a 'ratchet' to oblige them to increase their efforts, if found lacking. Proposals to introduce such toothy provisions in the Paris Agreement proved unpopular, both with developing countries like India as well as most developed countries. Indeed, the absence of such provisions paved the way for the near-universal adoption of the Paris Agreement. This absence could be troublesome for a regime that aspires to limit temperature increase to "well below 2 degreeC", as evidenced by the fact that current contributions place the planet on a 2.7 degree-3.2 degreeC pathway. Thus adequacy review needs the most bolstering down the road, but there are promising signs that actors outside the regime can perform this function. The Paris Agreement, with the adoption of the Katowice Rulebook, is well on its way to being operationalised, and each of us has a vital role to play.

The global climate change control conference has begun. The 24th annual session of the State Party of the UNFCCC ( COP24 / CMP14 / CMA1.3) took place in Katowice, Poland, December 2-14, 2018. An estimated 45 thousand participants from 197 Country representatives attended the event discussing the status and efforts to control global climate change. As we know, the impact of climate change has threatened the sustainability of countries in the world and has a real impact on human life. For this reason, at COP 21 in 2015, UN participating countries agreed to try to reduce the temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius in 2100 or even 1.5 degrees Celsius as stated in the Paris Agreement. The COP 24 COP-24 , Monday morning local time (3/12/2018). The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres also reminded that the world is in trouble with climate change. According to him, climate change runs faster than human efforts. "We remind you that this is a deadline, we don't have much time for long negotiations. What we need is political will and green leadership, "said Guterres. In this UN session on climate change, the Indonesian Delegation negotiating team was also present, representing representatives from ministries and institutions, NGOs, and researchers, who had been provided with position papers. The LHK Minister, Siti Nurbaya stressed that the arrival of the delegation of the Indonesian Delegation was very important for the country of Indonesia in achieving the target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change adaptation programs mentioned in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) document. ) as a product of Paris Agreement. "These delegations are not only ready for negotiations, but also ready for soft diplomacy and convey Indonesia's excellence in controlling climate change," said Minister Siti. Indonesia has a target to utilize the agenda at events related to negotiations, as well as side events to improve Indonesia's gait profile in international forums. The Indonesian government itself has ratified the Paris Agreement through Law No. 16 of 2016 on October 24, 2016. The real form of Indonesia's commitment under the Paris Agreement is to submit the First Report of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Indonesia to the UNFCCC in 2016 ago. The NDC stated its commitment to contribute to reducing GHG emissions by 2030 by 29 percent with its own efforts and up to 41 percent if there is international cooperation. Regarding the results of Indonesia's NDC, new ones will be implemented after 2020, according to 2016 data, Indonesia has succeeded in reducing emissions by 8.7 percent from various sectors. In 2017 the emission reduction has reached around 16%. In achieving the target of 29 percent, Indonesia has good modalities in fulfilling NDC's promises, namely through policies and regulations that are owned, as well as the activities and roles of institutions in supporting funding, capacity building, technology transfer, partnerships and research. \</doc>

NEW DELHI: "There are some countries which are making attempts to reopen Paris Agreement, which we (India) are opposed to," India's environment secretary C K Mishra said ahead of the upcoming UN climate conference which is to begin in Katowice (Poland) on Sunday.Mishra, who didn't name any country, explained this in the context of India's expectation of the climate conference's outcome which, he said, should be inconsistent with the principles of the Paris Agreement. He was speaking about what India was expecting at the 24th edition of the conference of parties ( COP24 ) in Poland and what role the country would play to have a positive outcome.Mishra, who along with environment minister Harsh Vardhan will be part of a team of 17 negotiators to leave for Poland on Saturday, said the outcome should be "balanced, inclusive and consistent with the principles of the Paris Agreement".Explaining the reason of his remarks (consistent with the principles of the Paris Agreement), he pointed out the attempts being made by some countries to reopen the 2015 agreement and emphasised that it was not only India which was opposed to such attempts. "The entire developing world is opposed to it," he said.It was apparent that Mishra's reference was to the US which had last year announced its withdrawal from the 2015 global deal and also hinted at the possibility of "negotiations to re-enter" the Agreement.The American move to re-negotiate the Agreement has been consistently opposed by developing countries and the European Union (EU) nations. Mishra's remarks ahead of COP24 assumes significance in terms of re-emphasising India's stand on the issue.He said the country clearly conveyed the current COP presidency that "India is not going to create an obstacle. We are looking at a positive outcome and we'll facilitate that. The only thing we want is that our basic concerns are met".He said, "Differentiation should be a part of all the dialogue we hold (at COP24 in Poland). Our other concern is that pre-2020 should have as much importance as is due to them despite the fact that we will soon be crossing 2020 in terms of dialogues and processes."The COP24 is expected to frame rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement. The objective of the Agreement is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C.Referring to India's other key concerns, Mishra said, "We, as a country and as a block, would like to see some conclusion on the issue of finance both in terms of actual availability of finance (new, additional and predictable)."Asked whether India should revise its climate action commitments in the wake of the two recent reports (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change special report on global warming of 1.5 degrees C and the UNEP's Emission Gap report), Mishra said India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are very ambitious "but as a country we would like to do better than what we have promised".To that extent, if the developed countries put resource, technology and equity in the centre of all discussions, it (enhanced actions) can always happen, he said.Before leaving for Katowice, the Indian delegation issued a detailed note on the upcoming conference explaining the country's position and expectation. It said the COP24 should "be able to frame guidelines, which are pragmatic and give due consideration to challenges and priorities of developing countries including different starting points as compared to developed countries, their vulnerabilities, development priorities like eradication of poverty, food security, energy access, providing health infrastructure etc."The official note said, "India looks forward to a rich exchange of views during the high-level Talanoa dialogue at COP24 , with consideration of pre-2020 actions and support as a crucial element, and its successful conclusion in 2018 as per the agreed modalities."Finally, COP24 should give equal focus to all agenda items and outcome of COP24 should be balanced, inclusive, comprehensive and consistent with the principles and provisions of Convention (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement. India would work together with all Parties (countries) in an open, transparent, inclusive and Party-driven manner to achieve a balanced and comprehensive outcome in the form of final Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) at COP24 ."

Amid demands for countries to significantly increase their climate actions, a new assessment by the UN climate body shows that the developed nations were likely to fall short of even their modest emission reduction targets for 2020. A first-of-its-kind assessment by the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), made at the request of the developing countries, shows that developed nations had reduced their emissions by 16 per cent from their 1990 levels by the year 2016. But a rise in emissions after that has meant that by the year 2020, the emission levels were expected to be only 11.4 per cent below the 1990 levels, well short of their collective target of 18 per cent. The assessment comes at a time when there are growing demands for countries to step up their climate efforts in view of the recent reports that at current pace of emissions, the world would end up getting warmer by more than three degree Celsius above pre-industrial times. It has also strengthened the voice of the developing countries, who for long have been pointing out that the developed countries were not doing enough. India and some other countries have, in fact, been rallying support for a proposal that seeks to ensure that the emission gaps resulting from the inaction of the developed countries in the pre-2020 period is filled by the same countries in the post-2020 era. These targets for the developed countries for the pre-2020 period are governed by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and will expire in 2020, after which the Paris Agreement will take over. In the Kyoto framework, only the developed countries, responsible for the overwhelming majority of emissions over the last 150 years, were assigned specific emission reduction targets. In the Paris architecture, however, no country is assigned any target and everyone decides for their own the climate actions they want to take. India and other developing countries have been arguing that the emission gap created by the developed nations in pre-2020 period will eventually fall upon everyone to fulfill, and want to guard against this scenario. At a recent meeting in New Delhi, the four countries which go under the name of BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) had stressed that these emission gaps must not present any "additional burden to developing countries in the post-2020 world", and therefore, proposed that the developed countries must be made to carry over their unachieved targets beyond 2020 and finish them by 2023. The same argument has been made at the Katowice meetings as well, where India and other countries have said developed countries have not just failed to meet their emission reduction targets but had also not delivered on their commitment to provide money to developing countries in the pre-2020 period. They want the gap on the finance side to also be added to obligations of the developed countries in the post-2020 scenario. \</doc>

The approaching United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland today accused the National Council on Environment their shadows ahead. By which means climate warming can be contained and to what extent Austria contributes to it, that is why a good part of the debate turned with Environment Minister Elisabeth Kstinger. The Climate and Energy Strategy 2030 called the Minister as an important step in achieving the Paris climate targets. The topic was raised by the SP with a motion calling for swift fulfillment of the EU climate change policy. SP environmental spokesman Klaus Uwe Feichtinger, like his colleagues from NEOS and NOW, stated that efforts to protect the climate had to be stepped up. However, the governing parties VP and FP postponed the request by pointing out that the finalization of the strategy in 2019 is expected. Equally on hold were sent by the government majority, the other opposition proposals of today's committee meeting. Specifically, the initiatives of the SP were for more use against nuclear waste repositories near the Austrian border and against the removal of the Federal Environmental Agency from Vienna, as well as NEOS demands for curbing soil sealing and for a practicable funding regime for climate-neutral heating systems. On the part of the opposition, the postponements were sharply criticized as delaying the public treatment of applications in the National Assembly plenum. Opposition sees an urgent need for action in achieving the climate goals By the end of the year, SP MPs Muna Duzdar and Klaus Uwe Feichtinger are calling on the German government to come up with a draft for the National Energy and Climate Plan, as foreseen in the EU Energy Union Ordinance ( 461 / A (E) ). Environment Minister Kstinger holds that the SP plans to be deficient in the planning, even though the self-commitments it contains have far-reaching implications for future climate policy. So far, there is no discussion process with relevant stakeholders and - as EU legally anchored - with the public. Robert Laimer (SP) criticized the current plans of the government, such as the climate and energy strategy, for lack of ambition with regard to achieving the Paris climate goals and public participation. Plans such as Tempo 140 on the highways would counteract the climate targets, and transport and building measures would shift responsibility away to consumers. For Doris Margreiter (SP) and Bruno Rossmann (NOW), the measures taken do not go far enough against the backdrop of the recently published IPCC report. In order to achieve the goals, the efforts would have to be multiplied, underlined Rossmann. It also needed a greening of the tax system. A budgetary coverage of measures in the climate and energy strategy misses Michael Bernhard (NEOS). He wishes, that a clear commitment to climate protection will be made in the upcoming tax reform. With the climate and energy strategy, the government has launched a very ambitious program, stressed Klaus Lindinger (VP). The strategy would be fixed in 2019 and until then also the public involved sufficiently, which is why Lindinger pleaded for a wait of the results and applied for the postponement of the SP claim. The MEPs agreed that there was a need for action before emissions certificates had to be purchased. Johannes Schmuckenschlager and Martina Diesner-Wais (both VP) underlined in this context that renewable energy sources in Austria must be strengthened. They therefore appealed to the opposition parties to support a change in the Green Electricity Act in order to provide legal certainty for operators of bioenergy plants. Doris Margreiter and Klaus Uwe Feichtinger (both SP) were basically ready to talk. However, Margreiter emphasized that cooperation with the opposition also needed to be improved. To Federal Minister Elisabeth Kstigner Feichtinger appealed to the Austrian position at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice ( COP 24 ) vehemently. The Environment Minister was confident about COP 24 , but also stressed that the EU was responsible for only about 10% of global CO2 emissions. The US exit from the Paris Climate Agreement as well as the opt-outs of Australia and Brazil are questionable. The criticism of the Austrian measures Kstinger could not understand. In particular, the national climate and energy strategy is an important step towards achieving the climate goals. The EU's Governance Regulation has already been included before it even enters into force. In the climate and energy plan, federal and state working groups were set up, experts interviewed and social partners, NGOs and representatives of all parties included, the minister responded to criticism that the public was not sufficiently involved. As pressing as the concretization of the domestic climate policy is for SP mandator Feichtinger that Federal Minister Kstinger against a planned nuclear waste repository in the Czech Republic near the Austrian border occurs ( 451 / A (E)). At least a protective corridor of 100 kilometers should be provided to the warehouse for nuclear waste. In terms of finding sites for low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste from medicine, industry and research, Feichtinger is pushing for the involvement of the population. In the Environment Committee, Doris Margreiter (SP) recalled Chernobyl and underlined the importance for Austria of setting a clear position for its neighbors. Christian Hbart and Walter Rauch (both FP) were able to win a lot from the initiative of the SP and announced a joint proposal from all parties, which should be worked out by the next environmental committee. Talks with the Czech Republic on the issue of nuclear waste repositories are currently underway, said Martina Diesner-Wais (VP) and Environment Minister Elisabeth Kstinger underlined. \</doc>

Fraport AG is establishing new climate protection targets aimed at further reducing CO2 emissions not only for Frankfurt Airport but also across the entire Group. The goal is to lower CO2 emissions at Fraports fully-consolidated Group companies by nearly half to about 125,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2030. The corresponding emissions in 2017 amounted to 209,668 metric tons of CO2. Fraports new target is based on the national reduction rates agreed to at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. Fraport AGs executive board chairman, Dr. Stefan Schulte, said: Growth and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but belong together. In the spirit of corporate responsibility, we have firmly embedded climate protection in our Group companies to make a positive contribution to this worldwide effort. To achieve our CO2 goals, we will continue to improve the energy efficiency ratings of our buildings, facilities and processes. In the report, Group CO2 emissions were included with the non-financial performance indicators along with figures on the sickness rate and the ratio for women in management positions (in Germany). Other indicators include global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity at Frankfurt Airport, as well as Group-wide employee satisfaction. Advancements in these key topics and further initiatives with regard to sustainability are presented in the latest Fraport Group report for the 2017 fiscal year. Titled 2017 Compact Gute Reise! We make it happen, the report also provides information about Fraports financial performance during the past year. \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Nomvula Mokonyane, thanked the leader of the South African delegation to the international climate change talks in Katowice, Poland, Mr Derek Hanekom, Minister of Tourism, for his support and leadership during the crucial meeting. The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC CoP24 ) was hosted by Poland, the COP Presidency, from 2 to 14 December 2018 in the city of Katowice. Minister Mokonyane was very recently appointed Minister of Environment, and was unable to attend the Conference in person, and thus Minister Hanekom led the South African delegation to COP24 , considering that as Acting-Minister of Environmental Affairs in the recent past, he had been instrumental in the processes and preparations leading to COP24 . I would like to thank Minister Hanekom and the team for their support and commitment during COP24 . The long hours and hard work by the delegation contributed to the balanced outcome of the Katowice talks, said the Minister. Furthermore, I would also like to thank the National Business Institute for hosting the South Africa Pavilion at COP24 . She expressed the hope that this partnership between business and government would continue. Ms Mokonyane has welcomed outcome of the conference. The Katowice Outcome resulted in balanced implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement. The conference agreed on implementation guidelines (a rule-book) focused on finance, transparency, nationally determined contribution, the global stocktake, compliance and defining the guidelines for the adaptation communication. said Minister Mokonyane. However, negotiations on new market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement were not concluded, and will continue in 2019. The two-week 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24 ), which started on 2 December 2018, ended a day later than scheduled. The High-Level Segment started on 10 December. The theme of COP24 was Changing Together, emphasising the need for collaboration and cooperation to address climate change. The South African government joined 196 countries in ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Agreement came into effect on 4 November 2016 four years ahead of schedule giving recognition to world leaders concerns that climate change is one of the biggest challenges of the century. COP24 had as its central goal the adoption of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP), which sets out the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement on climate change, from 2020. We are comfortable that decisions adopted at COP24 provide developing countries with flexible arrangements that allow space for institutional and technical capacity building on communication and reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement, said Minister Mokonyane. Parties to the UNFCCC adopted decisions related to the mobilisation and governance of scaled-up financial support for developing countries, particularly the support needed for the enhancement of mitigation ambition, to address the remaining gap in global climate action needed to limit climate change. These included setting up a process to determine the long-term goal on finance and ensuring that the Adaptation Fund will receive a share of proceeds from the new sustainable development mechanism under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, while still continuing to receive a share of proceeds from the existing Kyoto Protocol, due to end in 2020. Parties had also adopted decisions to provide guidance to the Green Climate Fund on a process of reaching agreement, in the event consensus cannot be reached when adopting its decisions. In terms of the Katowice Outcome, implementation of the Paris Agreement starts in 2021, and reporting on climate change implementation by UNFCCC Parties, using the new rules agreed in Katowice, starts in 2024. South Africa welcomes the further guidance on information to be provided with NDCs, and on accounting guidance to track progress of implementation and achievement of these contributions. A strong quantitative basis has been established for accounting and tracking progress, with enough flexibility to accommodate all NDCs, said the Minister. With regard to markets, no formal agreement could be reached in Katowice. This means that discussion on this matter is ongoing. South Africa would like to see strong rules being established. We are, therefore, content that a decision has been taken to allocate more time to reach an agreement. This, for South Africa, is preferable to a weak outcome, Minister Mokonyane said. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- International public finance flows from developed to developing countries critical for urgent action on climate change, says India at the 24thConference of Parties (CoP) on climate change at Katowice in Poland. In a discussion paper, &#38;\' 3 Essential &#38;\' S' of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection' released on sidelines of the ongoing conference, the Ministry of Finance called for more credible, accurate and verifiable numbers on the exact size of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. One of the major tasks before the 24th CoP is to finalize the implementation guidelines for 21st Paris CoP, in which finance is a key component. The developed countries had committed to $100 billion per annum for climate adaptation and mitigation by 2020. While the funds are yet to be fully disbursed, there has been a continuing lack of clarity on how this climate finance should be defined and accounted, as serious concerns have been raised over self-reporting by the developed country parties. The report cites a &#38;\' roadmap to US $100 billion' published by the developed countries in 2016, which claimed that public climate finance levels had reached $41 billion per year in 2013-14.However, a government of India Discussion Paper in 2015 noted that the only credible number is $ 2.2 billion in 2013-14, taking into account country disbursements of actual climate finance on a concessional basis. "The definitions of climate change finance used in various reports were not consistent with the UNFCCC provisions and the methodologies used were also questionable," stated the report, highlighting that till 2017, only around 12 per cent of total pledges to multilateral climate funds have actually materialized into disbursements. Underlining the need for a robust accounting framework for transparent reporting of climate finance, it states "modalities for accounting of financial resources cannot be at the discretion of a particular country." Even as developing countries are racing against time to decarbonize their economies and shift to renewable energy, the Ministry states that the climate finance goal of $100 billion is a meagre amount in size in contrast to the actual needs assessed for developing countries in trillions of dollars, "We have to be much more serious in this business. Climate finance targets need to be set high in order for climate justice to be delivered for poorer countries and future generation," it stated. While developing countries like India have been taking many actions against climate change and adapting to its adverse effects best to their own abilities and national circumstances, they have to be supported by climate finance flows from developed countries. "It is time for the developed countries to wake up and take note of the huge challenge faced by the developing countries for mobilization and provision of financial resources," stated the report.

New Delhi, Dec. 24 -- Electric mobility powered by renewable energy could be key to fighting climate change, the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) in Poland has highlighted. For India, the world's third-largest automobile market, electric vehicles (EV) are an imperative. Some 25 million conventional vehicles--with internal combustion (IC) engines - were sold here in 2017, adding to a 230 million passenger vehicle fleet, which trebled in size from 2001 to 2016. Globally, transport accounts for a quarter of total emissions, and India's vehicle emissions have contributed to giving the country the worst air quality in the world. By taking 1.24 million lives, air pollution was responsible for one in eight deaths in India in 2017. Yet, India is likely to have twice as many vehicles on the road by 2040. Having suggested an ambitious plan to go all-electric by 2030, the government has quietly beat a retreat to say it aims to ensure that by 2030, at least 15 percent of the vehicles in the country are electric. The reversal acknowledges the challenges ahead, and a decision to proceed cautiously. It proposes to do this by providing subsidies and a range of other incentives such as tax breaks, especially to two-wheelers and public transport vehicles such as three-wheelers and buses. A new policy long in the works and reviewed by IndiaSpend seeks to provide clarity on the direction the government aims to steer the industry in, including domestic manufacturing as against import; the kind and extent of charging infrastructure to be set up; and how subsidies and tax incentives will be financed. Here's a look at where India's EV sector stands, and what must be done for it to take off. EV sector raring to go An electric car emits 25 percent less CO2--the most common greenhouse gas--than a diesel car over its lifetime even in countries with "dirty" (predominantly coal-fired) grids such as India, according to a December 2018 report by the World Bank on electric mobility launched at the COP24 . India's grid, however, is turning green rapidly: Renewables now account for one-fifth of installed power capacity. India had 448,000 electric vehicles on road as on March 2018, 90 percent of total sales (475,000 vehicles) being two-wheelers. Some 7,000 are four-wheelers and 150 heavy electric vehicles, such as trucks and buses, as per the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). There are also some 1.7 million electric three-wheelers, mostly e-rickshaws, with 850,000 of them (48 percent) having been sold within the last financial year 2017-18 (April 2017-March 2018). Leading EV manufacturers include Hero Eco, Mahindra Reva, Electrotherm, Avon, Lohia, Ampere making a range of electric vehicles - scooters, cars (hybrid and full electric), buses, mini pickup trucks, rickshaws, cycles - available for sale. In the electric car segment, following the lead of Mahindra Reva, the Indian unit of South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd and Maruti Suzuki will launch EVs in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Tata Motors is also looking to enter the EV market in 2019, Mint reported in June 2018. A range of businesses are emerging along the supply chain - sourcing or manufacturing raw materials, battery cells, battery packs, integrated vehicles, sales, recharge and services, and so on. Policy support Ever since the government announced the 'National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020' (NEMMP) in 2013, the industry has enjoyed point-of-sales subsidies, tax concessions and funding to develop charging infrastructure. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles (FAME) scheme, launched in 2015, took tentative steps towards promoting technology development, creating demand through subsidies, conducting pilot projects and setting up charging Infrastructure. Due to be renewed in 2017, it has been extended three times, keeping the industry waiting for a more comprehensive FAME-II that would enable the industry to scale by driving mass adoption for public transport as well as for private use. It would also create charging infrastructure, promote R&D of EV technologies and push for domestic manufacturing. Meanwhile, some recent developments are a good signal: Electric quadricycles, which until recently were illegal because they could not be registered under the Motor Vehicles Act (mandatory for any vehicle that plies on public roads), have now been allowed to get registered. These could soon replace (or supplement) diesel- and CNG-powered auto-rickshaws, much in use in smaller cities and towns and offering last-mile connectivity in large cities, too. Benefits available for battery-makers have now been restricted to lighter and more efficient lithium-ion and other fast-charging batteries, which will see the less efficient lead-acid batteries gradually disappear from the EV sector while boosting the manufacture and purchase of efficient batteries. "Having electric quadricycles registered as passenger vehicles and removing EVs with conventional battery from the ambit of FAME-I scheme will help drive innovation and research towards cheaper and better performing EVs," Shantanu Jaiswal, head of India research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told IndiaSpend. Meanwhile, six state governments now offer land and tax benefits to manufacturers in the EV sector--Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. More state governments are expected to follow suit. Decisions, investment delayed Many manufacturers, suppliers and service providers who are waiting for a clear policy have had to put their investment on hold while the government finalises FAME-II. The EV industry needs a quick clarity on the final structure of incentives and the long-term vision of the country, Jaiswal said, adding, "The delays in announcement... is delaying the investment decisions from many of the large global automakers that are active in India." Much will depend on how much subsidy will be provided on the upfront price of a vehicle; whether charging stations would adopt the fast-charging or battery-swapping model; whether subsidies will be provided for manufacturing batteries domestically or will it continue to be cheaper to import batteries, and so on. Who pays? Industry insiders say the key issue holding up FAME-II is money - how the various subsidies, tax breaks and funding support will be financed by the government. The government wants to levy a "feebate" on IC engine manufacturers on the 'polluter pays' principle, which would be used to create a fund to finance the transition towards e-mobility, Gill said. "This is the point of contention, because IC engine manufacturers will not like it to happen this way," he said, "The decision on feebate is sort of life-and-death situation for EVs in India. Without it there will not be enough funds and the new policy will be doing a very tepid job of only tinkering here and there." Even a modest feebate--a combined "fee" and "rebate" where a fee is levied on one player to provide a rebate to another--could potentially generate enough funds to enable the EV sector to take off, Gill said. Domestic manufacture or imports? Batteries account for more than 50 percent of an EV's cost today. There is growing concern that a subsidy on the cost of a vehicle instead of the battery - will make automakers reliant on cheaper imported batteries. This could hinder India's ambition to capture all the major parts of the manufacturing value chain, Jaiswal said, adding, "We believe the scheme should allow a progressively increasing requirement for locally-made batteries since the supply chain in India is not ready yet for a massive scale-up." Battery swapping or fast-charging infrastructure? The government has been trying to decide whether charging stations should adopt the fast-charging or battery-swapping model, or both. "Charging infrastructure will not be one model over the other that will be preferred, but, a combination of both that will help in serving diverse EV segments," CEEW researchers said, adding that battery swapping would be more suitable for three- and two-wheelers while fast charging would be preferred by fleet operators and commercial vehicles. Another point of contention regarding charging stations is whether they will be treated as a service provider (providing charging service) or a seller (of electricity). The Electricity Act allows only power distribution companies to sell electricity, so it would have to be amended if the latter view is taken. Pressure from IC auto industry Since the bulk of sales under FAME have been in the hybrid segment, the IC automobile industry has not felt an impact. But FAME-II is likely to subsidise only 100 percent electric vehicles, Amit Bhatt, strategy head for integrated urban transport at World Resources Institute India (WRI India), told IndiaSpend. Conventional automobiles consume 30 percent of petroleum produced in refineries. While EVs have about 20 parts, IC engine vehicles have 2,000, The Hindu Businessline reported on 11 December, 2018. Together, the oil and auto-parts industry will be formidable opponents of the EV sector, it said. A more comprehensive policy Being developed by the NITI Aayog, the government's think-tank, FAME-II is likely to be more comprehensive and forward-looking, as it will bring together voices from all stakeholder ministries - heavy industries, road transport, urban planning, power, and renewables. FAME-I, by contrast, was solely developed by the ministry of heavy industries, which restricted its scope. FAME-II would focus on turning electric all intra-city commercial transport, such as three-wheelers and taxi and bus fleets, according to government documents reviewed by IndiaSpend. Two-wheelers account for 80 percent of annual automobile sales in India, and FAME-II would subsidise electric two-wheelers. Subsidies, especially if enhanced, could be a game-changer as customers currently only choose EVs over ICs if they are cheaper. "There is still a wide cost gap between electric and non-electric vehicle, which despite subsidies and tax rebates is not getting bridged," Gill of SMEV said. For example, even after subsidies, an electric two-wheeler costs Rs 30,000 more than the closest IC engine option. Plus the EV has a maximum speed of 45 km/hour and cannot travel intercity. "The only way it can be resolved is if the government and the industry, at least for one or two years, somehow lower the acquisition price of EVs to make it attractive against IC engine. And make it a very limited-time offer," Gill said. This could convert 1-2 million IC engine buyers into EV buyers annually, he estimated. EVs would get greater tax relaxation, possibly by further reducing or rationalising GST for EVs. Currently, a 12 percent GST applies on EVs, as against a 28 percent-plus GST on petrol and diesel cars and hybrid vehicles. Green number plates provided to registered EVs would entitle them to special parking slots, toll waivers, lower road taxes and registration charges, among other benefits. In another first, 16- to 18-year-olds could be given licenses to drive electric two-wheelers. Currently, only people older than 18 years can acquire a driver's license (although learners' licenses are open to 16-year-olds). \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 12 -- The political phase of the ongoing UN climate negotiations, amid the assembly of nearly 200 nations delegates, including India, was held on Tuesday with ministers and high-level country representatives together with non-party stakeholders shared plans for the transformation of economies in line with the 2015 Paris goals Climate experts told IANS the facilitative dialogue, also called Talanoa Dialogue, illustrated the huge progress already underway across all sectors and together with the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report with urgency and also scaled up ambition. The high-level Talanoa roundtables, part of the UN Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ), constitute the final part of a year-long global review that governments, business and civil society have fed into following the questions: "Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there?" with the goal to increase countries climate ambition, a climate expert said. Mahindra Group Chief Sustainable Officer Anirban Ghosh said: "The Talanoa Dialogue provides opportunities to have these bold discussions without any inhibitions, we are all in this together and we must all help each other to do more." "Climate champions like India and China realise that reducing emissions will help their countries, not only in reducing rising temperature but also in terms of air pollution," he said. Though the champions must also realise that they need to spearhead other countries in taking bold actions too. Processes like the Talanoa Dialogue infuse trust in the process, which is an essential element of any progress, and found wanting in the negotiations right now, Ghosh added. Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International Executive Director said the leaders must now rise to the challenge and negotiate a decision on ambition here. "Our world is on fire and the question that must be answered at this COP is: Will decision makers take responsibility and act? Youth and activists around the world are rising up, warning that they have had enough of inaction," she said. US-based World Resources Institute Senior Associate Eliza Northrop said: "The Talanoa Dialogue has been a breath of fresh air -- creating an inclusive and participatory process to agree on a shared vision for a low carbon prosperous future and what we need to do to get there." "The many stories shared by countries, business, regions and cities emphasize the opportunities available for us to go further, faster and together. What countries need to do now is to send an unequivocal signal that they have listened to the 1.5 Celsius report and will enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020." So what is the Talanoa Dialogue? In the Paris Agreement provisions foresee a "global stocktake" every five years, starting in 2023, to prepare a new round of ever-increasing national climate commitments called Nationally Determined Contributions. The Talanoa Dialogue which was launched at the last COP in Bonn is meant to serve as an initial stocktaking exercise to inspire progress among countries and encourage them to increase their climate ambition. Three crucial days are left starting Wednesday to ensure that the ongoing for COP-24 talks respond to the urgency highlighted by the IPCC report that says temperatures could rise 1.5 degrees as early as 2030 - with devastating impact. To do that, in addition to delivering the Paris rulebook, the nations, both developed and developing, need to send a signal they are committed to collectively raise their ambition on climate change and united on a path forward to achieve that goal, say climate negotiators. It means by December 14 there must be a clear and unambiguous outcome to that effect, a negotiator added.

At an additional negotiation meeting at working level, climate diplomats from nearly 200 countries prepared the World Climate Change Conference in Katowice ( COP24 ) at the end of the year. The aim is both to adopt the detailed rules of the Paris Agreement and to initiate stronger climate protection measures in the countries. The additional negotiation meeting in Bangkok had been agreed to make the texts more concrete so that they could form the basis for ministerial-level decisions in Katowice. Environment Secretary of State Jochen Flasbarth said: "The exact nature of the rules will determine how well the Paris Agreement works, the devil is in the details, and I am therefore pleased that we now have a better basis for the negotiations on the World Climate Change Conference It is good to see that all countries are constructively working to pass the rules in Katowice, and we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am confident that the Polish presidency team will guide us through the negotiations. " The representatives of the almost 200 member countries of the UNFCC used the interim negotiations in Bangkok for intensive textual work and concretised and shortened the existing collections of text proposals. They have begun to work out concrete options that COP24 needs to decide at ministerial level. In terms of content, the complex negotiations deal with questions such as: What information must countries provide for the new global transparency system? Which flexibilities apply to countries that do not yet have the necessary human or technical capacities to create and maintain the necessary databases? What information do countries need to provide so that their climate goals can be understood? How does the five-yearly global inventory work? In Katowice not only the detailed rules are to be passed, but also possibilities for the improvement of the international climate protection are to be discussed. The background is that the world is heading for a warming of more than 3 degrees Celsius with the previous national climate targets. As a result, countries have agreed to review and, if necessary, improve their climate targets by 2020. COP24 aims to kick-start this process with the so-called "Talanoa Dialogue" and provide information for improving national goals and measures. Informal consultations took place in Bangkok on the Talanoa Dialogue. In the remaining weeks leading up to COP24 there will be a variety of events to advance climate protection internationally. At the Global Climate Action Summit (12-14-09) in California, cities, regions, businesses and other civil society actors will present their contributions to enhanced climate change. On the sidelines of the New York General Assembly, the " Climate Week"(24-30 September), with many events and informal consultations on climate change initiatives and COP24 For the pre-COP (22-24.10.), the Polish Presidency will become a representative group of ministers in Poland before COP24 In order to prepare the conference, Germany will continue to promote the international debate on the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 12 -- Indian group Help Us Green that gives marginalised women the chance to earn livelihoods and be respected in their communities through collecting temple ceremonial flowers tossed into the Ganges and turning them into sustainable incense, received a UN Climate Action Award Fifteen game-changing initiatives in 14 countries were honoured as winners of the award at a special ceremony at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in this Polish city on Tuesday evening. The Momentum for Change award, spearheaded by UN Climate Change, showcases some of the most practical and replicable examples of what people are doing to address climate change. This year's winning activities range from an app that promotes the fight against food waste to a government that is taking 100 per cent responsibility for its greenhouse gas emissions. A UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) post says Help Us Green, which is based in four cities of Uttar Pradesh and got the award in the Women for Results category, is doing its part to clean up the Ganges by recycling flowers from temples and mosques. Over eight million tonnes of flowers are discarded in the river every year for religious purposes. This is contributing to the pollution of the Ganges, which provides drinking water for over 420 million people. Women working with Help Us Green collect floral-waste daily from temples. The waste is up-cycled to produce organic fertilizers, natural incense and biodegradable packaging material. Till date, 11,060 metric tonnes of temple-waste has been flowercycled and 110 metric tonnes of chemical pesticides that enter the river through temple waste have been offset. So is the income of 73 manual scavenger families has increased at least six-fold. A total of 365 families have been impacted by Help Us Green through increased living standards and stable incomes. By 2021, Help Us Green, which plans to expand to Bangladesh, and Nepal, aims to provide livelihoods to 5,100 women and recycle 51 tonnes of temple waste daily.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 6 -- If the US ends up pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, the move will hurt that country the most, according to Christina Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change. She added that India, in contrast, is on track to meet two of its three targets set by that agreement - renewable energy and carbon intensity. Figueres is one of the movers behind the Paris agreement where 195 nations agreed to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The US has since indicated that it is pulling out of that agreement, which makes the discussions and negotiations at the COP24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland crucial for one reason: the world will fight climate change without the US. Figueres is optimistic that it is the US which will face the consequences this while the rest of the world moves ahead on a de-carbonised path. ".... The first date at which the US government can formally, legally leave the Paris agreement is November 6, 2020, three days after the next US election...," she said. The US reiterated its plans to exit the Paris agreement at the recent G 20 meeting as well. "If the US ends up exiting for whatever reason, it will only hurt the US because energy, IT and artificial intelligence technology, the whole gamut is irreversibly becoming de-carbonised. Every extra ton of CO2 is a result of lazy thinking, there is no need to contaminate the atmosphere any further. It was necessary last century, not now. If the world moves as it is into electric transportation, most transportation giants are already doing so. Who is going to buy their products in the global market? Young people don't want to buy their junk," Figueres added, explaining that COP 24 is in a "very complex situation now, caused, in no small measure, by the position of the federal government of US. The White House position in particular on climate finance promises to developing countries makes it particularly difficult for G 77 (collaboration of 134 developing nations) and China to come to the table with an open mind." Figueres hopes that COP 24 will see the adoption of the so-called rule book which is a set of guidelines on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Figueres is in India now as head of Mission 2020, a collective for pushing countries to deliver on climate promises before 2020, and has been participating in events on air pollution, a big crisis in the country. "Air pollution is an unacceptable crisis in India. Science has already proven that if you live in Delhi you have six years less life expectancy. I am sorry for you," she said. Figueres added that it doesn't make sense for India to import oil for transportation. "Oil is very volatile in price... Using foreign currency to buy oil doesn't make sense for India." "For India, specifically, battery swapping is a brilliant solution, since the overwhelming majority of vehicles on Indian roads are two-wheelers . Electric two-wheelers are also beneficial in terms of combating air, noise pollution." If it does this, "manufacturing batteries for energy storage, particularly utility scale storage, could be India's flagship industry. In fact India could lead the world in this sector because it has the technological skills, labour and the expertise with solar and wind power." According to Figueres, India on track to deliver on two Paris goals. "On level one, India... may over-achieve its original Paris contribution in renewable energy, it seems to be on track to meet its carbon intensity goal too but not on track on the third level which is land use and forestry..."

New Delhi, Jan. 2 -- The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the negotiating stand of India at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Katowice, Poland from 2-15 December 2018. This is in continuation to the earlier approval dated 28th November 2018. The Indian delegation was led by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The key focus of meeting was to finalize guidelines for implementation of Paris Agreement in post 2020 period. Indias approach was guided by principles and provisions of UNFCCC and Paris Agreement particularly the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability (CBPR-RC). India reiterated its commitment to Paris Agreement and highlighted its leadership during the COP-24 by reuniting its promise to implement the Paris Agreement fully in a collective manner. In line with our traditional ethos of protecting environment, Government of India has taken several initiatives to address climate change concerns under the leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and these initiatives reflect Indias commitment towards climate action. The push for renewable energy leading to achieving about 74 GW of installed renewable energy capacity including about 24 GW from solar; leading the world in its pursuit of enhanced solar energy capacity through International Solar Alliance; energy efficiency measures arc some of the examples. It is however important to ensure that the actions of developing countries are supported by sustained and adequate means of implementation including finance, capacity building and technological support by developed countries. The adopted guidance operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and requires developed countries to provide detailed information to bring clarity on projected levels of climate finance. Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of US$ 100 billion. Overall, Indias long-term interests have been protected. India Has however expressed Us reservation on the Global Stocktake (GST) decision regarding the need for considerations of equity in output of GST process, which is an important part of GST process as per the mandate of Paris Agreement to ensure that vulnerabilities, problems and challenges of the poor and marginalised are addressed.

POLAND MEET NEXT MONTH A group of developing countries, including India, China, Malaysia and Egypt, have decided to corner rich nations on their inadequate pre-2020 climate actions in the context of recent IPCC report on implications of global warming when they meet for the UN climate conference in Poland next month. The group, Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), jointly arrived at this point here during their two-day meet which concluded on Friday. Pakistan and Sri Lanka did not attend the meeting which was called to discuss the group's joint agenda ahead of the Katowice UN conference ( COP24 ) in Poland. Though Pakistan as part of this 24-nation group has never been a major force in climate negotiations, India invited all the countries as it wanted to take everyone along as a group at the multilateral forum. The issues of rich nations' pre-2020 climate actions to cut emissions and their unfulfilled financial commitments will be key negotiating points during COP24 (December 3-14) which is to be attended by over 195 countries. All the nations together in Poland are expected to frame rules, modalities and procedures for implementation of the Paris Agreement which is meant for their post-2020 climate actions.  The LMDC will ask the developed countries as to how would they sync their pre-2020 actions in the context of the latest IPCC report. Assessment and enhancement of pre-2020 actions and financial commitments will be important negotiating points at COP24  , said India's key climate negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad. These issues will also figure in the meeting of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) nations which is to be hosted by India in New Delhi on November 19-20.  The meeting of the LMDC was important in the run up to the COP24 as it helped in preparing a strong unified position on all key issues to defend the proposals of the developing countries, said Prasad, a joint secretary in environment ministry.

Bangkok, Sep 3 -- Against the backdrop of severe and record heatwaves, bushfires, droughts and floods across the world, governments are convening a supplementary six-day meeting here from Tuesday to prepare the implementation guidelines of the Paris Climate Change Agreement The guidelines are needed to make the 2015 Paris Agreement work fairly and transparently for all. Following a two-year negotiation process, the implementation guidelines are set to be adopted at the annual climate conference, COP24 , to be held in Katowice, Poland in December. While the talks have made modest progress, the Bangkok meeting is the last opportunity before COP24 "Building on progress made, countries now need to take a decisive step forward in preparing the ambitious and balanced outcome that we need in Katowice," Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), told reporters here. Achieving success at COP24 will be challenging without the preparation of an official negotiating text on the implementation guidelines. "It will be critical for negotiators in Bangkok to produce solid text-based output that can function as the basis for the concluding negotiations in Katowice and be turned into the final implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement at COP24 . "With only six additional days for negotiations in Bangkok, the UN Climate Change is carefully coordinating demands to fully support countries in their important task," she added. Highly technical in nature, the implementation guidelines are needed to monitor progress on climate action. Such action includes measures to deal with climate impacts such as droughts or floods and urgent support to enable developing countries to contribute to climate action. They are also essential for determining whether emissions are being reduced at an ambitious rate to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible this century. Importantly, the guidelines are also needed to make the agreement's institutions fully operational beyond COP24 . "Every year, the impacts of climate change are getting worse. This means that every year, the poorest and most vulnerable, who have contributed almost nothing to the problem, suffer more," Espinosa said. Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group Gebru Jember Endalew said: "This additional Bangkok session will be critical to the delivery of a robust, balanced and comprehensive set of implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement at COP24 .' The LDC Group looks forward to working with other countries to develop a strong package of guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement. The 2018 Climate Weeks in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco in mid-September and Climate Week in New York towards the end of September, to name a few, are all events that rally both governments and non-Party stakeholders around climate change. "These events clearly demonstrate global momentum. They show that the world is ready to implement the Paris Agreement in the way world leaders envisaged in Paris in 2015," Espinosa added. With 197 Parties, the UNFCCC has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. --IANS vg/qd/sed \</doc>

The Minister for Climate Change is travelling to Poland to take part in preliminary talks around deciding the rules for meeting Paris Agreement obligations to reduce global greenhouse gases. Talks in Krakow over the coming days will focus on key issues which will need to be addressed in the Conference of Parties summit ( COP24 ) in December, James Shaw said. It will also be an opportunity for countries to compare notes on our various domestic emissions reduction work programmes. Achieving the Paris Agreement in 2015 was a turning point in the commitment to address climate change. When we meet for COP24 in Katowice in December we will be making decisions that put the rules in place to help us meet the Paris commitment. There are complex issues and different views to work through about what those rules look like and how they work. So laying preliminary groundwork in Krakow over the next few days should help give us a focus and clear aims for COP24 . I am also pleased to be attending these pre-COP talks to support New Zealands leadership in the process, Mr Shaw said. Our Climate Change Ambassador, Jo Tyndall, will be helping run the Krakow conference as Co-Chair of the working group that was established to develop the guidelines, procedures and processes which will make up the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Excellencies, colleagues, let me start by welcoming you all to Brussels and thanking Minister McKenna and Special Representative Xie for co-organising this meeting today. And sincere thanks to all of you, ministers and high-level representatives, for having accepted our invitation. The EU, Canada and China have joined forces to encourage global leadership and ambition in the fight against climate change by building momentum for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Following the successful first MOCA in Montreal last year, we have convened this opportunity for ministerial guidance on the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme and on the other key political events at COP 24 . The MOCA brings together Ministers and high-level representatives from the world's largest economies and other countries from the different regional groups. In this more intimate and informal setting we hope to support but not to replace or prejudge-- the formal negotiations. As we have just heard in Berlin, achieving results at COP 24 will require us all to pick up the pace of negotiations, and to be well-prepared to send strong messages of political leadership. The agenda we have prepared reflects a subset of the key challenges that still need to be resolved. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue hosted by Germany and Poland earlier this week provided for excellent high level exchanges. We see the next two days as an opportunity for deeper and more detailed peer-to-peer conversations on the political differences that we will need to resolve if we are to ensure a successful conclusion to COP 24 . COP 24 and its main deliverables, and tomorrow we will address key matters of the Paris Agreement Work Programme as it relates to action and as it relates to support. With six months between now and the closing plenary in Katowice, we must seize the opportunity of this MOCA to discuss -- openly and sincerely -- our individual asks and limitations. At COP24 COP 24 should be robust enough to deliver confidence that we are on track to implementing Paris, flexible enough to reflect relevant differences in Parties' capacities, and dynamic enough to ensure that all Parties are improving their performance over time. In addition, through the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, and the stocktake on pre-2020 action, Parties should be prepared to share our achievements and the lessons we have learned so far, and on how we can advance action and raise ambition from now into the future. These processes will set the scene for the next round of NDCs and Long term strategies. I look forward, in the plenary discussion to come, to sharing with you the details of how the EU is preparing for Katowice. This will include an update on the agreement of EU climate policies necessary for us to achieve our NDC, preparations for a new long term strategy to put us on track towards the Paris goals, and an EU Talanoa Dialogue, launched last week with the involvement of 600 stakeholders from across the EU and around the world. Last Thursday, EU negotiators agreed to increase the 2030 renewable energy target to 32% up from the original 27% target on the basis of which our at least 40% emissions reduction target in our NDC was modelled. And yesterday evening, EU negotiators agreed on a new 32,5% energy efficiency target by 2030 up from the 30% original target. EU negotiators also agreed the governance rules to meet our climate and energy targets. Both new targets would de facto mean that the European Union would be in a position to raise the level of ambition of the NDC and increase its emissions reduction target from the current 40% to slightly over 45% by 2030. Each of these recent developments in the EU shows that in addition to raising headline targets, ambition can emerge from the bottom-up: if we strengthen our policies, renewables and energy efficiency in this case, we should be able to achieve deeper cuts in our overall emissions. One thing is clear: our collective Paris goal to pursue efforts to limit global average temperature rise to 2C and to limit this rise to well below 1.5C, requires each of us to look for deeper cuts than are reflected in our current Paris targets. You can count on the EU to defend and implement the Paris Goals. But we clearly cannot do it alone: the EU accounts for less than 10% of global emissions today. To succeed, we need all countries, regions and actors around the world on board. The MOCA is one way to contribute to getting everyone on board, so we look forward to our discussions. I now turn to my good friends and colleagues Minister McKenna and Special Representative Xie to share their expectations for this MOCA. \</doc>

Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, released a Discussion Paper entitled 3 Essential Ss of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection on the sidelines of COP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, Poland. The Discussion Paper examines analytically the scope, scale and speed required in climate finance. While the financial requirements of developing countries run into trillions of Dollars, the commitments made by the developed countries for enhancement and support in relation to climate finance is not clearly translated into reality. Equally important is the issue of reporting and tracking of climate finance. The Discussion Paper finds serious concerns with the various numbers on climate finance reported by the developed countries. Definitions of climate change finance used in various reports were not consistent with the UNFCCC provisions. Methodologies used were also questionable. This Paper attempts to identify the essential elements, step by step, for a robust and transparent accounting of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Climate change issues have taken centre-stage in the recent times with various scientific reports pointing to the serious effects of climate change and global warming. The urgency for global climate action cannot be overemphasised. While the developing countries like India have been taking many actions against climate change and adapting to its adverse effects best to their own abilities and national circumstances, as mandated in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, the climate actions of developing countries have to be supported by climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Yet the progress achieved is not quite satisfactory. The Parties at CoP 24 in Katowice in December, 2018 need to address these important questions on climate finance. While India will continue to play its constructive role at CoP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, it is hoped that this Reflection paper will be of utility to stakeholders during deliberations therein. \</doc>

This week in Poland, more than 20,000 delegates from 196 countries are participating in COP24 , considered to be the most important climate conference, held this year in Katowice, heart of the coal industry in the country as well as Europe's worst air quality city mostly due to its continued reliance on coal for fuel. Ready to welcome the public, the African Development Bank has opened its Pavilion at COP24 and launched its 2-week program with an exciting event: a training workshop on how best to cover the climate negotiations for African journalists present at COP24 . This daily workshop is in line with the Bank's vocation to disseminate knowledge and support capacity building. Participating young Africans represent the generation that will build the future of the continent. To this end, the Bank is sponsoring four young journalists, men and women from across the continent (Madagascar, Kenya, Sudan and Tunisia), in a partnership with Climate Tracker, an international organization dedicated to training journalists on climate change reporting, particularly in Africa. Over the next two weeks, these young African journalists will cover the negotiations for national media in their countries. As the most vulnerable region to climate change in the world, Africa needs more experienced journalists in this field. \</doc>

From 3 to 5 October 2018, the International Sustainable Energy Conference (ISEC 2018) took place in Graz under the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union. 370 scientific, industry and energy policy experts from 51 countries participated in the event. The conference focussed on the heat sector and resource efficiency in an interconnected sustainable energy system and the huge resulting possibilities for innovative research institutions and businesses. The public debate about the switch from a fossil?based to a sustainable energy system often concentrates, in the area of energy policy, on the electricity sector alone, which is accountable for only 20% of worldwide final energy consumption. The implementation of the agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, which was adopted at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015 in Paris, is only possible if a switch to renewable energy sources also takes place quickly in the heat sector. Recent statements by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also show that research and innovation play a key role if the energy transition is to be successful. In Austria, the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) supports cooperation between research institutions and the Austrian economy with energy research funds of approximately 100 million annually. Important factors in this respect are sector coupling and intelligent integration as well as storage technologies and digitalisation. At ISEC 2018, strategies for the decarbonisation of cities and industrial processes as well as energy planning measures were presented and discussed in 76 specialist lectures and 5 keynote speeches. A workshop organised by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), which also took place in the framework of ISEC 2018, offered participants the possibility to network with seven energy centres in developing countries. The conference was organised by the AEE Institute for Sustainable Technologies with the support of the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, as well as the Federal Province of Styria and the City of Graz. \</doc>

Various efforts to control climate change that have been carried out by Indonesia have turned out to receive international attention. This is evidenced by the presence of the Minister of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, Siti Nurbaya, at the UNFCCC COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, which invited the interest of various international media to dig deeper into this information. In particular, the 24 Hours of Reality headquartered in Los Angeles invited Minister Siti Nurbaya to Live Talkshow in the program "Al Gora and The Climate Reality" which aired in America on Tuesday morning local time (04/12/2018). In the session of the remote Live program via satellite, Minister Siti Nurbaya from TVN Studio Katowice, Poland, was asked to explain the efforts that Indonesia had made in controlling climate change. Minister Siti said that Indonesia had stated its commitment to contribute to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions by 2030 by 29% with its own efforts and up to 41% through international cooperation. Emission reduction is carried out through five main sectors, namely: forest and land sector (17.20%), energy (11%), waste (0.38%), industrial process and product used / IPPU (0.10%) and agriculture ( 0.32%). "The most significant reduction will be achieved in the forestry sector, with the reduction contributing more than half of the target, which is 17.2% of the 29% target, and 23% of the 41% emission reduction," explained Siti Nurbaya. In the Forestry sector, explained Siti Nurbaya, the main thing that Indonesia does is improve forest governance; peatland management; and mangrove management. President Jokowi has shifted the paradigm of forest management, from wood orientation to forest landscape management. Furthermore, corrective measures are also carried out through providing greater access to forests for the community, accelerating social forestry, new business configurations of smallholders and companies, customary forests, resolution of ownership conflicts, and law enforcement. While in peat governance, Indonesia's strong commitment to improving peatland management can be seen from the policy of postponing the issuance of new licenses for Utilizing Primary Forests and Peatlands, known as the Moratorium, since 2011. "This moratorium is part of our joint effort which has succeeded in reducing the rate of deforestation in the last 3.5 years to around 0.45 million ha per year, compared to the average deforestation rate in 1990 - 2012 which reached 0.92 million ha. This has reduced a large amount of carbon emissions which are usually emitted by the forestry sector, "said Siti Nurbaya. Learning from forest and land fires in 2015, where the area burned reached 2.6 million ha, and 800 thousand of them were peat land, President Jokowi issued a Government Regulation on Peatland Management and established a Peat Restoration Agency to accelerate operational policy work peatlands. "Peatlands can emit CO2 at a rate of 30 to 32 times compared to mineral land ecosystems. Thus, suspending peat land use permits will potentially be able to prevent large amounts of carbon emissions, "said Minister Siti Nurbaya. Related to mangrove management better, Indonesia has developed a One Map Policy for Distribution of Mangroves, and has mapped more than 3.3 million ha to date. In addition, the Indonesian Government has also developed social forestry for mangroves. So that people living in coastal areas benefit directly from the cultivation of mangrove commodities such as mangrove honey, trigona honey, mangroves and nypa syrup, nypa flour, peat coffee, and copra. "The community not only gets economic benefits from this activity, but also supports environmental sustainability," concluded Minister Siti Nurbaya. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 14 -- Amid rich nations' attempt to dilute line between developed and developing countries while framing rule-book for implementing the Paris Agreement, India along with its BASIC partners - Brazil, South Africa and China - on Wednesday strongly opposed to any such move and made it clear that there should not be any backsliding on the global deal which was reached in French capital exactly three years ago on this day. Breaking silence on the issue, all the four countries jointly expressed that they were willing to show "certain flexibility" to arrive at positive outcome of the ongoing UN climate change conference ( COP24 ), but it won't happen at the cost of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations at COP24 are meant for framing a rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement post-2020. "We are in a complete agreement that there should be no backsliding on the Paris Agreement," said Derek Hanekom, South African minister and head of the country's delegation, while referring to what the group stand for here at COP24 . He said, "The outcome at Katowice should be inclusive, consensus based and an integrated package including all the components of Paris Agreement Work Programme to reflect the global consensus reached three years ago on this very day while adopting Paris Agreement. Most importantly, we must stand with the poor, marginalized and vulnerable communities who would be most impacted by climate change to show that we are." During the joint BASIC press conference, the South African minister referred to instances where certain comments from rich nations' negotiators were made, raising an alarm bell on how the developed countries were trying to dilute the CBDR. Though none of the delegation leaders took name of any country during the press conference, the reference was obviously towards the US-led rich block. It is learnt that the attempts to dilute differentiation - the point which keeps developed and developing countries separately in terms of their responsibility towards climate actions and financial commitments - are being made by the US, Japan and Australia with EU being a silent supporter of the rich block on this front in the negotiation room. Negotiators in many developing countries believe that such an attempt of the rich block may not be good for the outcome of the COP24 if the developed countries continue to push for dilution in the CBDR. Besides, the existing disagreements among developed and developing countries on key issues, primarily finance and reporting on countries' climate action and support, have also emerged as stumbling block. The BASIC nations are, however, hopeful as they believe that some of these concerns would be addressed in the draft text of the COP24 outcome (on rule-book of the Paris Agreement). The Chinese head of delegation, Xie Zhenhua said that they (BASIC countries) would like to show flexibility to arrive at positive outcome of the COP24 . He said some progress had been made on contentious issue of finance, but they would be able to take a call on their joint stand after assessing the draft text. Slow progress of negotiation amid certain contentious issues was flagged by even the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres here on Wednesday. Raising his concerns, he said, "Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy. So, I urge you to find common ground that will allow us to show the world that we are listening, that we care." Expecting political will from leaders to make COP24 a success, Guterres while speaking at closing of the high-level segment of the Talanoa Dialogue said, "The Katowice package needs to deliver the Paris Agreement Work Program (rule-book), progress on finance and a strong and solid basis for the revision of National Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Talanoa Dialogue." Talanoa Dialogue, conceived by Fijian presidency of the COP23 last year at Bonn, is aimed to help countries take stock of their current climate actions, and decide how to raise their ambition for the next set of national climate pledges in 2020 to further cut down global emissions. The contentious Article of the Paris Agreement on climate finance (Article 9) deals with issue of extending financial support by rich nations to developing countries for assisting them in both their mitigation (emission cut) and adaptation actions. This has, however, become the most controversial element of rule-book discussions as the rich nations have been consistently opposing an ex-ante review of their financial commitments. Besides, there is not even a consensus on what 'finance' (public, private or aid) should mean. Enhanced transparency framework (ETF) for action and support (Article 13) is the other key matter of disagreement. Under this, all countries are required to report on their climate actions and also on the support they get. It has become a major red line for developing countries as their rich counterparts do not willing to provide flexibility (less stringent reporting requirements). Developing countries need enough flexibility as all of them do not have capacity to measure their emission, climate actions and even climate change impacts.While the US and European Union (28 nations) have pushed for selective flexibility meant only for least developed countries and island states, India and China are demanding flexibility for all developing countries. This concern was also discussed in the BASIC ministerial meeting here on Wednesday where all the four countries expressed the need to have flexibility in reporting exercise, arguing varying capability of developing countries on this front. \</doc>

Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland is backing redoubled efforts by the Commonwealth family of 53 countries to fight climate change, in light of a sobering report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calling for rapid and far-reaching actions to keep global warming below 1.5C. Speaking at the High Level Segment of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, Secretary-General Scotland warned that any delay in taking action will result in permanent and irreversible damage. The problems are multifaceted, and must be matched by multidimensional solutions... No country in our family remains untouched. We now need to do more - faster and better to win the race against time and save our Common Earth, she stated. According to the Report, carbon dioxide emissions must fall by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 on the way to reaching net zero by 2050. This timetable demands transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Without these changes, climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are very likely to increase. Heightened threats to biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction both on land and sea, are also expected if current trends continue. In scaling up efforts, the Secretary-General announced the development of a new toolkit by the Commonwealth to help member countries effectively implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - the commitments made under the global Paris Agreement on climate change. The initiative goes hand in hand with the Commonwealths toolkit on implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as other practical programmes focusing on ocean governance, vulnerability and resilience, climate finance, and youth engagement. In the margins of the COP24 meeting, Secretary-General Scotland met with Commonwealth youth leaders for an intergenerational dialogue that called for the inclusion of young people in climate negotiations. She applauded the progressive move by the Seychelles to include 18 youths as members of its official delegation to COP24 , with full training and access to negotiations. For the needs of all our people, particularly the marginalised and most vulnerable, we carry forward our fine Commonwealth record of pioneering practical action - to save our Common Earth and work towards a common future that is both sustainable and secure, she said. Several other flagship Commonwealth programmes will feature prominently today at COP24 . One side event will highlight the Fiji-led action group on ocean and climate change under the Commonwealth Blue Charter on ocean governance, while the Climate Finance Access Hub and the Commonwealth Disaster Risk Portal will be discussed on another panel co-organised with the African Union and the Government of Mauritius. \</doc>

Dec. 3 -- The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the bus and tram services operator MPK (Miejskie Przedsiebiorstwo Komunikacyjne SA w Krakowie) have announced today at the COP 24 conference in Katowice a new loan for the municipal company's renewal of the tramway fleet. The EIB will lend PLN 376m (EUR 86,9m) to MPK for the purchase of up to 90 new, low floor and low energy consumption trams to replace obsolete units and for the modernisation of the existing ones. The terms of the EIB loan mean that MPK can benefit from low financing costs and long maturity of debt. Mariusz Szakowski, Vice-President of MPK in Krakow, said: The loan agreement with the EIB will allow MPK to pursue it fleet renewal plans. In December, we plan to sign an agreement with the consortium formed by Stadler Polska and Solaris Bus & Coach SA for the purchase of 15 additional new tramways, as part of a framework agreement for 50 trams signed in January this year. Next year, in addition, we will launch the tender for the purchase 40 more tramways". "This is the third loan over a decade granted by the EIB to MPK, the Krakow operator of public transport services, for the purchase of new rolling stocks or the upgrade of the existing ones", said Vazil Hudak, vice-president of the European Investment Bank. "The bank has also co-financed over the same period of time the modernisation of the tramway infrastructure. We believe that the development of an effective urban public transport system is one of the best ways to fight against pollution and tackle the challenges of climate change". This is the third and largest direct EIB loan to MPK for the renewal of the rolling stock since the start of cooperation in 2010, bringing the total value of these loans to PLN 618m. For MPK in Krakow, the financing helps deliver on the company's plans to completely replace within a few years all tramways with new low floor and energy saving. MPK plans do invest around PLN 1 bn for that purpose. The EIB sees this loan in the broader context of the bank's long-standing cooperation with Krakow. It started back in 1998 with the first loan of 45 million denominated in ECU. Since then, the EIB has supported the City and its subsidiaries to improve various elements of the municipal infrastructure, including water and wastewater; district heating; roads, including the Lagiewnicka bypass; thermo-modernization of buildings. Background information: About the European Investment Bank (EIB) The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union and is owned by the EU Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investment in order to contribute towards EU policy goals both in Europe and beyond. The European Investment Bank is active in around 160 countries. It is the world's largest multilateral financier of climate-related investment with USD 100 billion committed for climate action in the five years up to 2020 in support of the Paris Agreement. The EIB has committed at least 25% of its investments to climate change mitigation and adaptation, rising to 35% in developing countries by 2020. With EUR 19.4 billion dedicated to climate action in 2017, the EIB exceeded its target for the eighth year running.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) asserts that ours is the last generation that can stop climate change. We need to do this by changing to a zero-carbon, sustainable, cyclic economy. Yet unlocking the finance for this has been a major challenge until now. Discover how ISO is at the forefront of this transition, developing several standards that will propel, catalyse and underpin the new sustainable economy. If there were a top-ten list of environmental risks, then resource depletion, pollution and climate change would be at the top. In fact, these three risks are strongly connected, just as economics and environmental management now form unbreakable linkages for a sustainable economy. The intent is certainly there to make this transition happen. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) held in Paris in 2015, over 400 major investors representing USD 24 trillion in assets petitioned for a strong, worldwide deal to tackle climate change. Although a deal did emerge from the Conference, financing it is proving a challenge due to the scale of investment needed. It also requires being creative in how we tap into the multitrillion-dollar bonds market that is typically funded by risk-averse financiers. The magnitude of the investment is unparalleled. UNEP, for example, has determined that by 2030, much of the worlds infrastructure will need to be redeveloped and replaced in the transition toward the new economy. Whats more, according to the New Climate Economy, the flagship project of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate an international initiative that examines how countries can balance economic growth with the risks of climate change this economic and environmental revolution will require funding to the tune of USD 90 trillion. Focusing on energy alone, the International Energy Agency estimates that the world will need to infuse at least USD 53 trillion in the energy sector by 2035 to prevent dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, on the continent that gave birth to the 2015 Paris climate change deal, the European Commissions (EC) High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (HLEG) has calculated that the EC must invest USD 180 billion annually if it is to fulfil Europes ambitions in tackling climate change. \</doc>

KATOWICE, POLAND: Experts and negotiation observes have found the Paris Agreement rule-book a mixed bag. A section of them, who participated at UN climate conference ( COP24 ), termed the Katowice package "weak on ambition" saying the countries failed to agree on measures to avert catastrophic climate change while the others found it "fairly substantive" which gave a solid foundation to keep building trust in multilateralism. Though the Paris Agreement's goal is to strengthen the response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (1850) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius, most of the experts have not found imprints of such targets in rule-book. They argued their points in the backdrop of latest IPCC special report which scientifically explained how the world was staring at disaster and how it could be minimised by opting for 1.5 degree C path of global warming. "This rule-book is weak and completely insufficient to drive ambitious climate action," said the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the New Delhi/based think tank which closely tracked the negotiations at COP24 . "The Katowice conference of parties ( COP24 ) will be remembered as an anti-science COP for its failure to take into account the findings of the IPCC's Special Report on 1.5 degree C, It will also be remembered for coming out with a rule-book that dilutes an already weak Paris Agreement, thereby undermining the global effort to combat climate change," said Chandra Bhushan, climate change expert of the CSE. Retired bureaucrat and former India's negotiator R R Rashmi, however, found the outcome "fairly substantive if not as ambitious as were expected".Rashmi, currently distinguished fellow at TERI, said the continuing work programme on some issues and the likely climate summit convened by the UNSG next year give ample opportunity to all the stakeholders to close the remaining gaps and scale up their ambition in the post-2020 period.Even Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and key architect of the Paris Agreement, remained quite optimistic. She said," Despite all the headwinds, the Paris Agreement has stayed course at COP24 , demonstrating the kind of resilience it has been designed for. The decisions made here on the Paris rule-book give us a solid foundation to keep building trust in multilateralism and accelerate the transition all across the world." The CSE, however, went into specifics and argued how the COP24 completely failed on all major key issues including finance and global stocktake. Noting unfulfilled financial commitment of US $100 billion each year by 2020, the CSE said the rule-book had to define what all would constitute 'finance', and how it will be reported and reviewed."But at Katowice, rules on financial contributions by developed countries have been diluted. Firstly, developed countries have the choice to include all kinds of financial instruments, concessional and non-concessional loans, grants, aids etc, from various public and private sources, to meet their commitments. Secondly, the rules on ex-ante financial reporting and its review for adequacy has been significantly weakened. Put together, these two dilutions will make it very difficult to hold developed countries accountable," said the think-tank in its analysis of the COP24 outcome. "Developed countries now have the freedom to decide the amount and the kind of financial resources they want to give to the developing countries and do this without any strong mechanism of accountability. The idea of 'new and additional' financial support from developed to the developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change is now a mirage", said Chandra Bhushan. Flagging low ambition of rich countries, the Johannesburg-based NGO ActionAid International said, "Despite urgent warnings from the world's leading scientists that we have just 12 years left to keep global temperatures at a safe level, governments have failed to create a rulebook that lives up to the promise of the 2015 Paris Agreement."Without taking name of the US, its global lead on climate change Harjeet Singh said, "Our governments have failed us. Some of the most powerful countries in the world are led by reactionary climate deniers and their views have been allowed to water down the ambition and cooperation needed to avert catastrophic climate change."Rich countries have a moral and a legal responsibility to provide money and technology to developing countries to make their economies greener and tackle the impacts of climate change.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 15 -- Climate experts and activists on Friday described the Paris rulebook draft prepared by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the climate negotiations at Katowice in Poland as "extremely weak" on 'climate finance' and 'loss and damage', describing it as "unambitious". The test of the Paris rulebook, the guideline on how the 2015 Paris Agreement will be operationalised, doesn't make any distinction between loans and grants which was one of the main concerns of developing countries including India and of Brazil, South Africa and China (BASIC). UNFCCC released a 144-page Presidency Textual Proposal of the rulebook late on Thursday night, after two weeks of intense negotiations and arguments over different aspects of the deal between developed, developing COP 24 - a meet described by experts as a "makeor-break moment" for the planet. But discussions on several issues in the draft rulebook were unresolved even after they were opened again in various meetings on Friday. Some officials said meetings may prolong till Saturday if there is no consensus. A finance ministry paper released last week on the sidelines of COP 24 said there are serious concerns with climate finance values being reported by the developed countries which they claim to have transferred to developing countries. The discussion paper, titled "3 Essential S's of Climate Finance Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection" also said the value of loans was being over-reported. Experts said the draft also doesn't substantiate much on insurance and guarantees. There is no mention of 'loss and damage', which refers to severe climate impacts being faced in some parts of the world that countries cannot adapt to. On the brighter side, however, the draft said it appreciates and is grateful to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and climate scientists for presenting the latest science in their 1.5 degree global warming report. US and oil and gas rich nations Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait have declined to welcome this report in the draft text. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and least developed countries called an emergency press briefing in response to the draft text on Friday. Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed said AOSIS, least developed and developing countries have come together for an emergency coalition. "The IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees says if we allow temperatures to shoot past 1.5 degrees every single nation at these talks will be at risk. We are at past 3 degrees with the talks at the moment. For some of us on the frontline of climate change we face extinction," he said. There were protests by climate activists at the COP24 venue on Friday afternoon over the weak draft. "Rich countries have a moral and a legal responsibility to support developing countries to make their economies greener and tackle impacts of climate change. Finance is the foundation on which you build climate action. Without finance, the Paris Agreement will collapse. A rulebook that doesn't reflect climate induced loss and damage and a way forward on climate finance will be unacceptable," said Harijeet Singh, global lead on climate change for Action Aid International. "The draft text appears to be very weak on finance and on loss and damage... The COP decision is also ambiguous on the IPCC 1.5 degree report and how countries would increase their mitigation ambition to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. So over all it's a very disappointing text," said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). But AK Mehta, additional secretary, environment ministry, said substantial progress had been made. "We are not very far from reaching an agreement. Its very substantial progress. There are some differences which will be sorted out. We don't expect more than one revision in text now. The discussion on 'loss and damage' is not going to end here," he said.

Times at CLIMATE MEET Experts and negotiation observers have found the Paris Agreement rule book a mixed bag. Some of them who participated at the UN climate conference ( COP24 ) termed the Katowice package  weak on ambition and said the nations failed to agree on measures to avert climate change while others found it  fairly substantive which gave a solid foundation to keep building trust in multi-lateralism. Though the Paris Agreement's goal is to strengthen the response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius, most experts did not find imprints of such targets in the rulebook. They argued their points in the backdrop of the latest IPCC special report which scientifically explained how the world was staring at a disaster and how it could be minimised by opting for 1.5 degree C path of global warming.  This rule book is weak and completely insufficient to drive ambitious climate action, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the New Delhi-based think tank which closely tracked negotiations at COP24 , said.  The Katowice conference will be remembered as an anti-science COP for its failure to take into account the findings of the IPCC's special report on 1.5 degree C. It will also be remembered for coming out with a rulebook that dilutes an already weak Paris Agreement, Chandra Bhushan, climate change expert at CSE, said. Retired bureaucrat and former Indian negotiator R R Rashmi, however, found the outcome  fairly substantive if not as ambitious as expected . Rashmisaid the continuing work programme on some issues and the likely climate summit convened by the UNSC next year gave ample opportunity to all stakeholders to close the remaining gaps and scale up their ambition in the post-2020 period.  Despite all the headwinds, the Agreement has stayed the course at COP24 , demonstrating the kind of resilience it has been designed for, said Laurence Tubiana, key architect of the Paris Agreement.

NEW DELHI: The 13-day UN climate conference kicked off in Katowice, Poland, on Sunday with negotiators from across the globe assembling to finalise a rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement post-2020.India is represented by a 17-member team, led by environment minister Harsh Vardhan, at the 24th edition of the conference of parties ( COP24 ) which is being held in the backdrop of devastating climate disasters around the globe, from California to Kerala, and Tonga to Japan.Two recent global reports set the tone for the conference where leaders on its opening day were urged for rapid action to save the world. The reports - the IPCC one on impact of 1.5 degree Celsius of global warming and another on 'Emission Gap' by the UNEP - sought urgent actions from the global community to restrict warming much below 2 degree Celsius by the end of the century.The UNEP report on gaps in climate action indicated that even if all commitments made by countries for the Paris Agreement were achieved, the world would still be on a course to warm by more than 3 degree C this century - a scenario which will be disastrous for the global community.Besides framing rules and procedures for how countries will meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement in Katowice, the negotiators during the next 12 days will also work on how climate action will be financed and how the countries would need to raise their ambitions (climate action targets) to exceed their respective Paris commitments when they are updated in 2020. Finalisation of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) will make the 2015 global deal fully operational by unlocking ambitious action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to empower developing countries through financial and technological support.The objective of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen global response to threat of climate change by keeping the average temperature rise this century well below 2 degree C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degree C."This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record. Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more - COP24 needs to make that happen," UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said in her remarks on the opening day.India has said it wants an outcome consistent with the principles of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement including equity, Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) and climate justice." COP24 should give equal focus to all agenda items, and the outcome of COP24 should be balanced, inclusive, comprehensive and consistent with the principles and provisions of the Convention and its Paris Agreement," Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday before heading for Katowice.

Indonesia is one of the countries that ratified the Paris Agreement less than one year after the adoption of the agreement. Indonesia has set an ambition of reducing emissions by 29% unconditionally to 41% reduction in conditional emissions from the BAU scenario in 2030, with forestry and energy as the main target sectors. Adaptation is an important part of the NDC, with three climate resilience target areas, namely, the economy; both social and livelihoods; and ecosystems and landscapes. "The values ??and goals of the Indonesian people will enable us to fulfill commitments under the Paris Agreement, namely that all citizens have the right to a good environment, and that natural resources are regulated by the state and maximally used for the welfare of citizens, as reflected in Article 28 H and 33 of the 1945 Constitution, "said Minister of Environment and Forestry Siti Nurbaya when delivering the Indonesian Statement to the High Level Segment of the COP, CMP, CMA, before the COP President and other state delegates at UNFCCC COP 24 in Katowice , Poland, Wednesday afternoon (12/12/2018) local time. Minister Siti Nurbaya said, supporting Paris Agreement relevant policy reforms had also been carried out, including legal recognition of the rights of Indigenous Law Societies, or Customary Law Communities, or internationally known as Indigenous Peoples, increasing access by local communities to forest land and resources through Social Forestry, improving Forest Management Units, and joint adaptation and mitigation at the grassroots level. In addition, the role of Non-Party stakeholders also increased, starting from the parliament, judicial institutions for law enforcement, subnational governments, the private sector, civil society, to the grassroots. "To monitor progress, we built a National Registry System (SRN) to record and monitor all their climate actions and resources," explained Siti Nurbaya. The most recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming 1.5 degrees Celsius highlighted the importance of initial action on climate change, which made the role of pre-2020 ambitions more important. "Therefore, Indonesia wants to urge our developed country partners to fulfill their pre-2020 commitments and to rapidly increase their ambitions to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement both in reducing emissions and in providing a means of implementation for developing countries", continued Minister Siti. Indonesia realizes the importance for all countries to transform into low emission and climate resilience development pathways. Indonesia, like many other developing countries, faces challenges in balancing between meeting international commitments and achieving national development goals. Indonesia wants to see fair and fair international policies that are conducive to international and national interests. "We cannot accept the use of environmental issues including climate to be a means of disguising trade discrimination against developing countries," Siti stressed in her speech. "We must not allow any effort to renegotiate the Paris Agreement. Indonesia assures you in our good faith to achieve tangible results in Katowice, and hopes to support your leadership by cooperating constructively with other Parties ", concluded Siti closing her speech. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 29 -- Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to take up with urgency the matters pertaining to expansion of the International Solar Alliance and his vision of 'One World, One Sun, One Grid' at the G20 meet in Argentina, Germany on Thursday supported expansion of the forum. "This is a fantastic idea. Soon after it was founded, it was realised that it should be expanded. It would make a lot of sense to incorporate more countries," German ambassador to India Martin Ney told reporters here. ISA is an alliance of more than 121 countries initiated by Prime Minister Modi and seeks to work for efficient exploitation of solar energy. On the eve of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Argentina to attend the G20 Summit, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said that at the Summit, Prime Minister will make a pitch for other countries which are not between Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn to join the International Solar Alliance. In the first assembly of the ISA in October this year, it was decided that the ISA membership must be open to all UN countries. The initiative to launch international platform was first proposed by Mr Modi in a speech in November 2015 at Wembley Stadium, London, in which he referred to sunshine countries as Suryaputra ("Sons of the Sun"). The alliance is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation. The initiative was given further push by the Prime Minister at the India Africa Summit, and at a meeting of member countries ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. Answering questions, the Ambassador Ney also said that the European Union-India free trade agreement (FTA) would make a "lot of sense". On the sidelines of the G20 Summit at Buenos Aires, Prime Minister is likely to meet among others German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Ledrien, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met during the G20 Leaders' Buenos Aires Summit. At the conclusion of the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP14) in Sharm el-Sheikh and the opening of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) at Katowice The three parties reaffirmed their firm commitment to working together and working with other partners to address climate change, protect the environment, and eradicate poverty and inequality. The three parties recognize that meeting these challenges needs to promote deep economic and social transformation, promote sustainable development, and build a community of human destiny. 1. The three parties emphasized that they collectively recognize the challenges of the global climate and environment, and the recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has once again highlighted these challenges. Climate change threatens poverty reduction and human development. The three parties further stressed that the time window for achieving sustainable ecological civilization transformation is only a few years away, far less than a generation. 2. The French side and China reiterated their firm support for the irreversible process and strong operational guidelines of the Paris Agreement. COP24 is essential for the completion of the implementation provisions of the Paris Agreement. Law, Lieutenant and other partners work together to promote COP24 to achieve a package of results that respect the content and spirit of the Paris Agreement. Its models, procedures and guidelines need to be balanced, comprehensive, powerful and operational in order to effectively implement the Paris Agreement, embody the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the respective principles of competence, taking into account different national circumstances. France and China once again reaffirm the highest political commitment to implement the Paris Agreement comprehensively, effectively and transparently, including but not limited to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. Therefore, both parties hope that the G20 Buenos Aires summit will provide political impetus for the success of COP24 . 4. The French side and China reiterated the importance of providing climate funding to developing countries. The three parties are working together to make the Green Climate Fund (GCF) an effective financial mechanism to promote sustainable investment and green finance, and to promote economic transformation to low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience. The three parties appreciate the progress made in the field of green finance, including the outcome of the "One Earth" summit. 5. The three parties emphasized that a fair transition, the creation of decent work and high-quality employment are essential to ensure an effective and inclusive transition to low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience development, and will help to strengthen public access to the Paris Agreement. Support for long-term goals. 6. The three parties agreed to work together on the linkages between climate change and biodiversity. China appreciates France's efforts to promote the World Environment Convention initiative, which aims to address possible gaps between international environmental law and its implementation. \</doc>

Amid rich nations' attempt to dilute the line between developed and developing countries while framing a rule-book for implementing the Paris Agreement, India along with BASIC partners \- Brazil, South Africa and China \- on Wednesday strongly opposed any such move and made it clear that there should not be any backsliding on the global deal which was reached in the French capital exactly three years ago to the day. Breaking their silence on the issue, all four countries jointly expressed the view that they were willing to show certain flexibility to arrive at a positive outcome at the ongoing UN climate change conference ( COP24 ), but it won't happen at the cost of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations at COP24 are meant for framing a rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement post-2020.  We are in a complete agreement that there should be no backsliding on the Paris Agreement, said Derek Hanekom, South African minister and head of the country's delegation here at COP24 . Hours later while making India's country statement, additional secretary in environment ministry and head of the national delegation, A K Mehta, clearly spelt out the red lines which must not be breached at any cost.  We all agree that the Paris Agreement is non-negotiable. Therefore, the delicate balance reached between developed and developing countries must be retained and the principles such as equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) must be given its due, said Mehta while delivering the country's statement on behalf of India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan. He said,  The outcome at Katowice should be inclusive, consensus based and an integrated package including all the components of Paris Agreement Work Programme to reflect the global consensus reached three years ago on this very day while adopting Paris Agreement. Most importantly, we must stand with the poor, marginalized and vulnerable communities who would be most impacted by climate change to show that we are. \</doc>

As the first week of negotiations at the climate change conference drew to a close, most of the contentious issues, including those related climate finance, had remained unresolved and left to be tackled at the ministerial segment starting on Monday. Negotiators worked through late into the night on Friday and through the first half of the day on Saturday to produce draft agreement texts on all the subjects under discussion. The most contentious issues, like finance, increasing of ambition of climate action, and transparency of action, as also several others have been left for the ministers to take the final call on. "Some progress has been made. Whatever we could decide on, we have decided. There are close to 90 decisions to be taken. But the important ones have been unresolved. You can expect some fights to happen on these in the ministerial segment. That is where the give and take will also happen. As you know, there is nothing unusual in taking issues to the second week," a developing country negotiator said. At the Katowice meeting, countries are trying to finalise the rulebook, containing the processes and guidelines, for the implementation of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, that seeks to keep the global average temperatures from rising above 2 degree Celsius from the pre-industrial times. As a result, the issues under discussion are mainly procedural in nature, but vital for preserving the effectiveness of the Agreement. Meanwhile, having asked the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for a special report on the feasibility of restricting the rise in global temperature to within 1.5 degree Celsius from pre-industrial times, and having got that report last month, the Katowice conference is debating what to do with it. The special 1.5 degree report, which has been making global news ever since it was released last month, needs to be acknowledged and mentioned in the decisions that will be taken at the end of the conference next week, since the request for the report had also come in this form. But there are serious differences within the countries in the manner that this report is mentioned. A number of countries, including some in the developing world, do not want a very prominent mention of the report, uncomfortable as they are with the idea of mainstreaming the 1.5 degree target, which might get translated into calls for more urgent and wider action on climate change from all countries. Though a relatively smaller issue, the discussion on 1.5 degree report has kept the negotiators of several countries engaged. The IPCC report said it was still possible for the world to attain the 1.5 degree target, but it required much greater action within the next few years itself. It said global emissions needed to be brought to half the levels of 2010 by the year 2030, and to net zero by the year 2050 in order to attain that goal. As of now, the world is only trying to prevent a temperature rise beyond 2 degree Celsius, for which it is aiming to reduce its emission levels by 20 per cent, from 2010 levels, by the year 2030, and achieve a net-zero emission level by the year 2075. The report has been extensively discussed at the Katowice meetings, with IPCC briefing the negotiators on the different aspects several times. As a result, the IPCC has had a much greater involvement in this year's conference as compared to previous years. And yet, some countries want the matter to end with just an acknowledgement of the report in the final outcomes of this conference, while some others are in favour of showing intention to act on the report. "It is important to provide proper space to IPCC report (on 1.5 degree) during this conference... It is important that the discussion on the IPCC report is properly accounted for," the conference president Michal Kurtyka said. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said the 1.5 degree report had been very well received globally, and therefore, she hoped that it will get the importance that it deseverd. "I certainly hope that we will be able to have the willingness (and) agreement in welcoming and highlighting the importance of this report. What I have realised in my travels across the world is that the IPCC 1.5 report has made and incredible impact on the people. One very important contribution of this report has been that it has put the focus firmly on the 1.5 degree goal," Espinosa said. \</doc>

U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in response to the Trump administrations roll back of crucial power plant carbon emission standards that were implemented by the Obama administration. The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administrations proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year. The Presidents continued efforts to undo the progress weve made to combat the effects of climate change are threatening the health and safety of the American people, said Shaheen. Rising temperatures interrupt New Hampshires fall foliage season and maple syrup production, directly impeding our business and tourism sectors, and elevated sea levels put the homes and livelihoods of our Seacoast families at risk. It is unconscionable that the administration is knowingly pursuing a policy that puts the wellbeing of the fossil fuel industry over American lives. The Presidents actions also undermine years of work by small businesses in New Hampshire and across the nation that were incentivized under the Obama administration to prioritize technology in renewable energy and to curb carbon emissions. Im deeply concerned by the Presidents destructive efforts to unravel necessary protections that safeguard our air, water and land, and that preserve our environment and wildlife. Ill continue to oppose the administrations dangerous policies that put Americans health at risk and jeopardize the sustainability of our planet. Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the Presidents anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trumps anti-climate executive order and restore our nations leadership role in the fight against global climate change. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 12 -- As the crucial two-week long climate negotiations by nearly 200 nation draws closer to culminate, UN's climate chief Patricia Espinosa and other top UN officials making passionate pleas to governments to finish the work they set for themselves and conclude the summit with a strong and effective outcome The main objective of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 is to finalise the implementation guidelines of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Amid the presence of 100 ministers in this Polish city to provide political guidance, Espinosa said on Tuesday: "Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome." "But I believe it's within our grasp to finish the job. Let's complete the Paris Agreement Work Program and, by doing so, immediately unleash the power of the Paris Agreement itself," she said. Climate negotiators told IANS that Espinosa's plea comes in the wake of sharp differences between the rich and poor countries over climate finance, transfer of technology and mitigation. "The developed countries have effectively taken a stand that the differentiation between the developed and developing countries can no longer be operationalised in the Paris rulebook," a negotiator said. The rulebook is a Bible for transparent implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement -- the first global treaty to reduce emissions by all rich and poor nations. Last week, the four big oil and gas producers -- the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait -- had faced off against every other country who wanted to formally "welcome" in the UN text the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius IPCC report that talks about urgency and also scaled up ambition by the world. The US had even rejected the science itself, standing alone among all the world's countries in refusing to endorse the findings of the report. Ahead of the COP24 , the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on the achievability and implications of a 1.5 degrees Celsius global average temperature rise compared to pre-industrial levels, the lower temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. In Katowice, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee reiterated the key findings of the report, namely that the temperature goal is achievable, but that this can only happen if there if governments take urgent and far-reaching action in all aspects of society, with many implications for policy-making. "Every bit of warming matters. Every year matters. Every choice matters. With this report, the scientific message is clear. It is now up to you, the governments, to act," he said. World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at the COP24 warned that current levels of greenhouse gas emissions were unsustainable, and were already leading to dramatic climate change impacts around the world, from the melting of Artic ice to many incidents of fires flooding this fear. "We are expecting a two to four per cent increase in global carbon dioxide emissions this year. If we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we need to see different numbers." Good news also came during the COP24 . Germany announced that it will double its contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to euro 1.5 billion. France and China together with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared to acecooperate closely to make this summit a defining moment to accelerate action, increase ambition and mobilize the required resources to achieve an ecological transition". The World Bank announced it will double investments in climate action to about $200 billion from 2021-2025. India's Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan signaled that the country is ready to update its nationally determined contributions or NDCs if other countries do the same, followed Canada to continue to lead critical climate negotiations. The world's largest container shipping company Maersk pledged zero emissions by 2050. Volkswagen also announced that it will sell no more combustion cars after 2040 and will put the last fossil-fuel based models on the market in 2032. A WHO report says the health benefits of meeting the Paris goals outweigh costs by far. And New Zealand released a defence policy statement, identifying climate change as the country's most significant security threat.

Ribera has participated today in Krakow in the ministerial negotiations leading up to COP24 in which it is planned to agree on the book of rules that will govern the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. The minister stressed that the meeting in Krakow "has paved the way to the COP24 , as it has allowed to know where are the meeting points and differences between countries on the most important issues on the negotiating table of this next summit" . These four subjects are, fundamentally, the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the transparency of the system to report on compliance with country commitments and climate financing. Ribera recalled that the multilateral process must be "credible", and said that for Spain it is a priority that the "book of rules" for the implementation of the Paris Agreement should be approved by the COP24 . The close to 200 countries that make up the UN climate change convention have set the end of 2018 as the deadline to adopt that book of rules or package of measures for the proper functioning of the agreement. In addition, the minister stressed the urgency of increasing global efforts to combat climate change after the adoption of the Special Report on the 1.5 C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, in its acronym in English), on October 8th. In this sense, it is necessary a reflection where it becomes clear, on the one hand, that the Paris goal of 2C is not enough and that with the current contributions it is not reached and, on the other, that it is necessary in the coming years go further, as the latest IPCC report points out. This report has confirmed the need for an unprecedented transformation to limit the increase in the global temperature of the planet to 1.5C, in addition to showing that current emission reduction commitments are insufficient to keep us below that limit. Ribera has held bilateral meetings with the ministers of Poland, Sweden, Norway, France, New Zealand and the Marshall Islands, as well as with the European Commissioner for Climate Action, Miguel Arias Caete. \</doc>

Times at CLIMATE MEET Seeking to end the deadlock on critical issues, the European Union (EU) and 27 countries have decided to raise emission reduction targets by 2020. In answer to environmentalists who wanted current big polluters like China and India to do the same, the two countries have cited their lower per capita emission and huge developmental needs. As crucial negotiations to finalise rule book for Paris Agreement entered the final round, India and other developing countries want the rich ones (historical polluters) to meet their pre-2020 targets so that  no undue burden is shifted to post-2020 period . A recent IPCC special report on the impact of 1.5 degree celsius of warming across the globe, has galvanised the EU and 27 countries, including a few developing ones, to come together as a 'High Ambition Coalition' (HAC) and decide to raise their Paris Agreement targets. Though these countries are not formally required to increase their targets until 2025, they will now raise their targets substantially under the HAC by 2020. The move is seen as an attempt to send a positive signal at the UN climate conference ( COP24 ) where the lack of cooperation shown by four fossil-fuel powers  USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  have demoralised other participants. COP24 requiring all cou ntries to raise their emission reduction ambition by 2020.  Like the European coalition, emerging economies like Brazil, South Africa, India and Chinacountries should also announce their intention to increase their ambition before 2020. This will boost the global collective action, said Chandra Bhushan, climate change expert of the New Delhibased Centre for Science and Environment. Senior bureaucrat and India's head of delegation at COP24 , A K Mehta, while delivering India's country statement on Wednesdaysaid,  India is guided by its own belief in sustainable lifestyles which respects nature, evident from the fact that our share in cumulative historical global GHG emissions is only 3% and our per capita emissions are about one-third of global average. \</doc>

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the negotiating stand of India at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Katowice, Poland from 2-15 December 2018. This is in continuation to the earlier approval dated 28th November 2018. The Indian delegation was led by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The key focus of meeting was to finalize guidelines for implementation of Paris Agreement in post 2020 period. India's approach was guided by principles and provisions of UNFCCC and Paris Agreement particularly the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability (CBPR-RC). India reiterated its commitment to Paris Agreement and highlighted its leadership during the COP-24 It is however important to ensure that the actions of developing countries are supported by sustained and adequate means of implementation including finance, capacity building and technological support by developed countries. The adopted guidance operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and requires developed countries to provide detailed information to bring clarity on projected levels of climate finance. Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of US$ 100 billion. Overall, India's long-term interests have been protected. India Has however expressed Us reservation on the Global Stocktake (GST) decision regarding the need for considerations of equity in output of GST process, which is an important part of GST process as per the mandate of Paris Agreement to ensure that vulnerabilities, problems and challenges of the poor and marginalised are addressed. \</doc>

Times at CLIMATE MEET Sensing urgency of climate action in view of the recent IPCC special report on impact of 1.5 degree celsius of global warming, the European Union and 27 countries, including a few developing ones, have formed a 'High Ambition Coalition' (HAC) and decided to raise their Paris Agreement targets of carbon emissions reduction by 2020. As part of the Paris Agreement, these countries had specified their different voluntary targets to cut emission by a certain percentage by 2030 from 1990 level. Though these countries are not formally required to increase their targets until 2025, they will now increase their emission reduction target substantially under the HAC by 2020. The move is seen as an attempt to send a positive signal at the ongoing UN climate conference ( COP24 The four oil and gas rich countries have opted to 'take note' (not welcome) of the IPCC findings which highlighted that limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared with 2\'b0C would reduce the impact on ecosystems, human health and well-being, making it easier to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The attitude of these has created a lot of unease among most of the developing countries, including India and China, during crucial negotiations here at COP24 . Besides the EU (as a group of 28 nations), the other countries in the HAC include Canada, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ethiopia, Jamaica and New Zealand among others. Australia which was part of a similar coalition in 2015 preferred not to join the HAC which was launched here on late Wednesday evening. Big developing countries and high current emitters like China and India are also out of the HAC, even as the civil society members have been pushing for the COP24 outcome requiring all countries to raise their emission reduction ambition by 2020 keeping in view the latest IPCC report. \</doc>

NEW DELHI: A group of developing countries, including India, China, Malaysia and Egypt, have decided to corner rich nations on their inadequate pre-2020 climate actions in the context of the recent IPCC report on implications of global warming when they meet for the UN climate conference in Poland next month.The group, like minded developing countries (LMDC), jointly arrived at this point here during their two-day meet which concluded on Friday.Pakistan and Sri Lanka did not attend the meeting which was called to discuss the group's joint agenda ahead of the Katowice UN conference ( COP24 ) in Poland. Though Pakistan as part of this 24-nation group has never been a major force in climate negotiations, India invited all the countries as it wanted to take everyone along as a group at the multilateral forum. The issues of rich nations' pre-2020 climate actions to cut emissions and their unfulfilled financial commitments will be key negotiating points during COP24 (December 3-14) which is to be attended by over 195 countries. All the nations together in Poland are expected to frame rules, modalities and procedures for implementation of the Paris Agreement which is meant for their post-2020 climate actions."The LMDC will ask the developed countries as to how would they sync their pre-2020 actions in the context of the latest IPCC report. Assessment and enhancement of pre-2020 actions and financial commitments will be important negotiating points at COP24 ," said India's key climate negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad.These issues will also figure in the meeting of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) nations which is to be hosted by India in New Delhi on November 19-20."The meeting of the LMDC was important in the run up to the COP24 as it helped in preparing a strong unified position on all key issues to defend the proposals of the developing countries," said Prasad, a joint secretary in environment ministry.India's environment secretary, CK Mishra, also attended the meet. The participating countries were represented by their senior negotiators and key functionaries. The LMDC group is learnt to have also discussed how to link the financial commitments of the developed countries (to support developing countries for taking climate actions) with the Global Stocktake (GST) which will happen in 2023.Under the Paris Agreement, the GST is meant to assess whether the climate actions being taken is consistent with the goal of keeping the global average temperature rise within 2 degree celsius by 2100 from pre-industrial levels.The inter-governmental panel on cimate change (IPCC), however, in its latest report last month projected that a 2 degree celsius rise would lead to worse global and regional climate impact. It, therefore, pitched for limiting the warming to 1.5 degree celsius, saying it's not impossible to limit the global warming provided nations together cut their emissions substantially by opting for "rapid and far reaching" transition in various sectors over the next 10 to 20 years.Algeria, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Venezuela are among other nations of the LMDC which is a group within the larger developing countries' Group of 77 and China."It has stood united and strong during the climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and has always protected the core principles embedded in the Convention and the Paris Agreement, including equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) as well as climate justice," said an official note on the LMDC meet.The discussions during the two-day also focussed on issues related to implementation of the Paris Agreement in post-2020 period including nationally determined contributions (NDCs), transparency of action and support, adaptation, market and non-market mechanism, technology development and transfer and capacity building. "The meeting was of great significance for the group of LMDC as the year 2018 is an important year for climate change negotiations," said the note.Referring to COP24 , it said the discussions at Katowice would focus on 2018 facilitative dialogue (Talanoa Dialogue), assessment and enhancement of pre-2020 actions and commitments of the developed countries.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 19 -- The Paris Rulebook adopted at the climate negotiations ( COP24 ) in Katowice on Sunday is an opportunity for India to set its house in order. The Rulebook states that under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, all signatories have to submit and update an adaptation communication periodically to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Adaptation essentially means anticipating the impact of climate change and making cities and villages resilient in the face of a 1.5 degree rise in global warming over pre-industrial levels by the early 2030s. The warming can be as high as 2 degrees for many parts of Asia, including India. India must now climate-proof its rural and urban infrastructure by adopting strategies that reduce the impact of droughts, use crop diversification, promote and deliver agriculture and climate insurance, and adopt flood and heat stress control. India has already proposed using the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to conduct drought-proofing and afforestation. The Rulebook has also established a system to ensure developed nations deliver climate finance to developing countries. At COP24 , parties agreed that new finance targets will be established from 2025, over the current target of mobilising $100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries. Developed countries have the choice to include all kinds of financial instruments to ensure the flow of funds. According to a report of the UNFCCC standing committee on finance, the total climate specific finance flows from developed countries in 2016 was $38 billion - less than 40% of the target. Money apart, countries such as India need to draft a strategy to use funds to minimise the impact of climate change; The Kerala floods of 2018, and the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand were both caused by climate change. The India Meteorological Department acknowledged that the country is facing climate change-led aberrations in long-term meteorological trends. Instead of wearing blinkers like the oilrich nations such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and the US did at COP24 , India must reduce its vulnerability to weather extremes by using climate science and modelling simulations.

Demonstrates that multilateralism works to tackle a clear global problemclimate change. Three years ago almost to the day, some 200 countries came together to land an ambitious Paris Agreement. Over the last few weeks, the world gathered once again in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) where our team worked hard throughout the negotiations to find common ground between developed and developing countries. I am pleased countries around the world came together to agree to rules for transparently reporting how all countries are fulfilling their commitments to reduce emissions and tackle climate change. To increase our ambition for climate action, we need clear and transparent rules. Canada also played a leading role in laying the groundwork for a global carbon market, to help mobilize the billions of dollars of investments needed to tackle climate change. We were pleased with the outcome although more work remains over the next year to finalize the guidelines for international trading. Recognizing the global momentum on pricing pollution, Canada took part in the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, encouraging all countries around the world to use the most cost-effective tool to reduce emissions. At COP24 Canada helped advance the work of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, with Indigenous representatives from Canada and around the world. To further this work, we will be supporting an Indigenous representative in the UN Climate Change secretariat. By bringing together not only governments, but also stakeholders, organizations, businesses, Indigenous partners, and civil society, COP24 demonstrated the worlds shared commitment to fight climate change. As we move toward a more sustainable economy in our common fight against climate change, we can ensure good jobs and healthy, resilient communities for our people. \</doc>

Even as a few developed countries started to put some money on the table to show their commitment to mobilising funds for climate change, none of the issues related to finance could be resolved by the negotiators till late on Monday night at the climate change conference here. At the two-week year-ending climate conference in Katowice, Poland, countries are trying to finalise the rulebook, containing the processes and guidelines, for the implementation of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that seeks to keep the global average temperatures from rising above 2 degree Celsius from the pre-industrial times. The issues under discussion here are mainly procedural in nature and deal with the details of the processes and mechanisms through which the provisions of the Paris Agreement will be implemented. Many of these are also extremely complicated and contentious. After the first week of talks, negotiators had left all the contentious issues for their ministers to decide at the high-level segment that started on Monday. Ministers discussed the issue on Monday but were unable to reach a conclusion. At least five groups of ministers were formed, each having a minister from a developed and a developing country, to lead the discussions on one particular area where there were major differences between countries. These groups have been asked to facilitate the dialogue, while also holding informal meetings with countries to narrow down the differences. The ministerial group on finance, comprising Egypt's Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad and the German state secretary at the federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Jochen Flasbarth, had a long list of issues to resolve. Among them is the fight over the nature and level of reporting that needs to be done by the developed countries on the finances they provide to the developing world to deal with climate change. Developed countries are under an obligation 'mobilise' at least US$ 100 billion every year from the year 2020 to help the developing countries fight climate change. The Paris Agreement requires the developed countries to report information every two years about the money it was likely to provide in future, and the money that it had already provided in the previous two years. How this will be done, and the nature of information to be provided, needs to be spelled out in the rule-book. But some developed countries have now been arguing that they were not in a position to report advance information on the money they were likely to provide in future because of constitutional and budgetary constraints. The developing countries, on the other hand, have countered saying they were only seeking "indicative" amounts. Developing countries also want to ensure that money provided by developed nations was "new and additional" to the money already flowing in other forms, and want specific mention of this in the rule-book. However, the phrase "new and additional" is not mentioned in the Paris Agreement, and developed countries do not want it in the rule-book either. There were several other issues related to finance under discussion, like the future of Adaptation Fund, an instrument under the Kyoto Protocol, which runs till 2020 before being replaced by Paris Agreement. Developing countries have been asking for a smooth transition of the Adaptation Fund, which was being used to fund adaptation projects, to the Paris Agreement, and this needs to be specified in the rulebook. But there is no consensus as of now on how to achieve this. Similarly, there is this issue about enhancing the climate finance target beyond the US$ 100 billion per year. The Paris Agreement says the finance commitments of the developed countries needed to be revised upwards from 2025, but neither does it specify the revised amount, nor does it say anything about what this revision needed to be based upon. Several studies now say that the amount of climate finance required to meet the global objective of meeting the 2 degree target ran into trillions of dollars per year. Incidentally, the US$ 100 billion figure was not based on any assessment. It was announced by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the Copenhagen climate change meeting in 2009, mainly to instil trust and confidence in the negotiations after the near-collapse of the talks. Developing countries are now asking that the revised amount should adequately reflect the requirement. For this, they have been arguing that a need-assessment be done. Developed countries, on the other hand, say that it was too early to talk about the revision which was to happen only in 2025. The ministerial group on finance has to resolve these and many other matters over the next two days. The high-level segment continues till Wednesday. Amidst the stalemate on finance negotiations, some of the developed countries announced new financial commitments. France, for example, said it would provide 15 million euros to the Adaptation Fund, and another 20 million euros to the LDC Fund, an instrument aimed solely at funding projects in the least developed countries. European Union separately pledged new 10 million euros for the Adaptation Fund, while Sweden said it would contribute 50 million Swedish krona (about 5 million euros) each for the Adaptation Fund and the LDC Fund. Germany promised a new commitment, of as yet undisclosed amount, for Adaptation Fund, while New Zealand pledged three million USD over three years. Additionally, Switzerland promised to provide 13 million USD over four years to the LDC Fund and a Special Climate Change Fund. Elsewhere in meeting rooms, ministers were trying to resolve the other difficult issues. There were a whole lot of issues related to transparency that needed to be resolved. Transparency is a cross-cutting issue, concerning every topic in the rulebook and there are serious differences amongst the countries on how to ensure transparency in processes, mechanisms, accounting and reporting of actions, and also in financial flows and technology transfers. Negotiators also have to finalise the provisions for a new market mechanism for carbon trading, to replace the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The Paris Agreement provides for the establishment of a new carbon market, but its rules and procedures have to be specified in the rule book. Sue Biniaz, former lead climate lawyer and negotiator for the United States under the Barack Obama administration said the ministers had been burdened with too many issues, and too technical and complicated subjects, and it was not practical to expect them to resolve all these over the next two days. Several negotiators have been conceding in private that Katowice would probably not deliver a completed rulebook and that many issues would have to be left to be resolved at a later date. The implementation of the Paris Agreement begins only on January 1, 2021, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol in 2020. \</doc>

On the first working day of the year-ending climate change conference here, India told the world that it was well on course to achieving all its climate targets much ahead of the deadlines it had set for itself. It then asked the developed countries to fulfil their obligations as well, including those relating to providing financial and technological help to the developing countries so that India could do much more than it was doing right now. "We will achieve all our targets ahead of our schedule. There is no question about that. We are doing much more than we were expected to do. We are monitoring the progress on these at the highest level... For us (India), climate action is not just a matter of technicalities. For us, it is a moral issue as well," Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said here. India had, in 2015, as part of the international requirement ahead of the finalisation of the Paris Agreement, listed a series of specific actions it would take to fight climate change. Among the important ones, it had said it would reduce its emissions intensity (or emissions per unit of GDP) by 33 to 35 per cent by the year 2030 compared to the 2005 baseline. It had also promised to ensure that at least 40 per cent of its total electricity in the year 2030 would be generated through renewable sources of energy and that it would create between 2.5 to three billion tonnes of additional carbon sinks through extensive afforestation. Environment Secretary C K Mishra said the current progress on the third target of carbon sink would suggest that India was lagging behind a bit. "But several new initiatives on the afforestation sector are currently being unveiled. So that the pace of progress would almost be doubled in the next few years. On our other two targets, we will obviously reach there quite soon," he said. "We are quite conscious of our targets. We are doubly conscious that we are in a position to over-achieve them," he said. India's statement came on a day when a new analysis, by the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a US-based organisation that conducts research and analysis on financial and economic issues related to energy and environment, showed that India was likely to attain the goal of having 40 per cent of its electricity generation coming from renewable sources by the year 2020 itself instead of the original target of 2030. "IEEFA estimates India's thermal power capacity will be 226GW, or 63 per cent of India's total of 360GW, by March 2019. By the close of calendar 2019, India's non-fossil fuel capacity is set to exceed a 40 per cent share for the first time," a statement from IEEFA said. IEEFA has based its conclusions on the new projections for the power sector contained in the National Electricity Plan of 2018, and other data. It said that by the year 2027 renewables like solar, wind and biomass would generate about 275 GW of electricity, comprising 44 per cent of India's total power generation of 619 GW. Hydro and nuclear, also considered clean sources of energy, would contribute another 80 GW, or about 13 per cent. The Environment Ministry would not say when exactly it hoped to attain its targets. India was supposed to provide a comprehensive update on the progress of its climate actions, as well as detailed information on its greenhouse gas emissions in the last few years, through what is known as biennial update report (BUR), something that every country needs to submit to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN climate body, every two years. But it postponed the announcement at the last minute. Officials said the BUR was ready but yet to get the formal approval of the Cabinet. India's deadline to submit it is December 31. BURs contain detailed information on the country's emissions, its sources, growth projections and how measures to tackle climate change impact growth. India's first BUR had been submitted in December 2015 and it had information about emissions until 2010. This second BUR is likely to have data on India's emissions till the year 2015. In the previous BUR, India had said that its total greenhouse gas emissions had grown from 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the year 2000 to 1.8 billion tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2010. During this time-frame, the population of the country had increased by about 18 per cent, while the GDP had almost doubled. The emission intensity of GDP, a measure of how efficiently energy was being used, declined by about 12 per cent during this period, pointing to more efficient utilisation of energy resources. \</doc>

On December 2 begins the Conference of the Parties of the Cmnucc in Katowice, Poland. The purpose of the event is to adopt a set of decisions that allow an effective operationalization of the Paris Agreement and that, at the same time, respect and be faithful to the provisions already agreed upon. For Colombia, the successful outcome of the COP24 will be determined by two elements: the first, the adoption of the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP) and the second, a political signal that reaffirms the countries' commitment to not only implement their commitments under the Agreement, but to strengthen them in light of the urgency that science demands. The PAWP should be consistent with the Paris Agreement, including its long-term vision of the ambition needed to achieve the goals agreed in 2015. Reaching consensus on the rules to operationalize the Agreement is crucial to accelerate climate action. In this sense, today the coordination meeting of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean - Ailac, of which Colombia is part together with Chile, Honduras, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, Paraguay and Guatemala, is taking place. and in which the consolidation of the technical positions is sought, together with the negotiation strategy. At this meeting, and during COP24 , Colombia holds the "pro tempore" Presidency of Ailac. \</doc>

Aug. 13 -- Rational management of raw material resources, environmentally-friendly manufacturing and minimization of the environmental footprint. These and other subjects were discussed during a 3-day conference organized in Katowice by the largest trade union confederations. 21 presentations were delivered during the PRE_ COP24 social conference attended by nearly 300 guests. Polish trade union officers frequently noted that the climate policy should not interfere with industrial development in any country. - We would like to convince the countries that signed the United Nations Convention that every nation has the right to freely choose the path and directions for its industry to ensure energy security of their country, their citizens, so that everyone has the opportunity for sustainable growth. We hope this message will be heard and that every nation can develop based on its own natural resources - noted Dariusz Trzcionka, head of the "Kadra" Trade Unions Association. As a result of the three-day meeting, three trade union confederations issued an appeal to the Presidency of COP24 in Katowice and all the parties to the Framework United Nations Convention, among others to replace the term "decarbonization" with "climate neutrality" The signed appeal also noted that climate neutrality may be achieved by using two equivalent measures: reducing emissions and absorption by soil, forest and peatlands in accordance with the principle of solidarity, which means that all countries should be involved in preventing climate change. - I would like to thank all the participants, the trade unions, I also want to emphasize the role of employers, who took part in this conference. I'd like to express my gratitude to the scientists, representatives of the parliament and the European Parliament and the ministry. I believe that this is a good test before the COP in December, a test of dialogue, exchange of thought and what we have done so far and what we can do about protecting the environment - Grzegorz Tobiszowski, Vice-Minister of Energy thanked the attendees, adding: - All countries should be involved in environmental protection, but every country has the right to its own vision of the energy industry, in accordance with the principle of solidarity. On behalf of the Ministry of Energy and for myself, I would like thank all those who accepted the invitation for this exchange of ideas. The event was attended among others by Poland's largest coal producers: Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa, Polska Grupa Gornicza, Tauron Wydobycie and Przedsiebiorstwo Gornicze Silesia. It was also attended by the representatives of the Famur group and the academia. The three-day PRE_ COP24 conference preceded the UN climate summit, which will be held in Katowice in early December.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the UN climate conference, environment ministers and top negotiators of BASIC nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - will brainstorm here in a two-day meeting beginning on Monday on how not to let rich nations pass gaps in their 'pre-2020 climate efforts' to the post-2020 period.If rich nations are allowed to do so, it will put an additional burden of mitigation (cutting emission of greenhouse gases) on developing countries post-2020.Under the Kyoto Protocol, only rich nations (historical polluters due to their early industrialisation) are expected to cut their emissions and take other climate actions by 2020. But under the subsequent global deal (Paris Agreement) which is meant for post-2020 actions, the responsibility to cut emissions falls on all countries as per their voluntarily set targets."Pre-2020 action and ambition remain very important concerns for India. It is important to ensure that developed countries honour their pre-2020 goals and commitments before it is too late," said a government's note on the country's stand and agenda points of the BASIC meeting.Expecting the second commitment period of Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) to come into force before the UN climate conference ( COP24 ) in December, the note said, "It is also important to ensure that we do not displace the delicate balance we achieved between pre-2020 and post-2020 actions when we agreed upon the Paris Agreement."Besides environment minister Harsh Vardhan, the Indian side will be represented by environment secretary C K Mishra and joint secretary (climate change) Ravi Shankar Prasad among others in the BASIC meeting.The meeting will help consolidate a strong stand of the BASIC group in framing rules, procedures and operational modalities for implementation of the Paris Agreement. The COP24 COP24 adhere to the core principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, including equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC).Another key concern for developing countries is the issue of support from developed countries including finance, technology transfer and capacity building."Finance is one of the critical enablers of climate actions in developing countries and any regression or slow progress in climate finance will hamper progress towards achieving the goal of the convention," the note said.

Following a year of devastating climate disasters around the globe, from California to Kerala, and Tonga to Japan, the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) opens today with the goal of finalising the implementation guidelines for the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The guidelines will provide clarity on how to implement the landmark agreement fairly and transparently for all. Specifically, they will strengthen international cooperation by ensuring that national contributions to the global effort are transparent, responsibility is shared fairly and progress on reducing emissions and building resilience can be accurately measured. Patricia Espinosa, the UNs Climate Chief, said: This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record. Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more COP24 needs to make that happen. A finalized set of implementation guidelines will unleash practical climate actions with respect to all the targets and goals of the Paris Agreement, including adapting to climate change impacts, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing financial and other support to developing countries. Six months after the 2015 Paris Summit, the negotiations on the implementation guidelines were launched and COP24 was set as the deadline. While governments are committed to finalizing the guidelines in order to unleash the full potential of the agreement, a great deal of work still remains to be completed in Katowice. The 2015 Paris Agreement entered into force faster than any other agreement of its kind. I now call on all countries to come together, to build upon this success and to make the agreement fully functional, said in-coming COP President, Mr. Michal Kurtyka. We are ready to work with all nations to ensure that we leave Katowice with a full set of implementation guidelines and with the knowledge that we have served the world and its people, he added. Ms. Espinosa noted that countries have strong backing for rapid climate action, given that public awareness and demand for solutions have increased due to clear evidence that our climate is changing. We simply cannot tell millions of people around the globe who are already suffering from the effects of climate change that we did not deliver, she said. Talanoa Dialogue The conference is being held hot on the heels of the Global Warming of 1.5C report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as a cascade of UN and other reports on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions and on health and other serious impacts. All of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris Agreements aims of limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5C, Ms. Espinosa stressed. All our focus should be on reaching this aim and on building up ambition towards it, she added. COP24 will also conclude the year-long, Fiji-led Talanoa Dialogue, the first-ever international conversation of its kind to assess progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement, including the goal of limiting global temperature increases. One of the dialogues aims is to find practical and local solutions for how countries can increase their ambition in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which describe their individual efforts to reduce national emissions. During the high-level event that will conclude the Talanoa Dialogue, Ministers will consider the IPCCs 1.5C report and its relevance in the context of future actions. It is my hope that this will give Ministers the opportunity to provide a political signal for enhanced ambition, Ms. Espinosa said. COP highlights Following a procedural opening on Sunday, 2 December, to enable work to begin quickly, Monday will be the grand opening ceremony graced by the presence of some 40 Heads of State and Heads of Government. In a world-first, and supported by the in-coming Polish COP presidency, the UN has launched the Peoples Seat initiative. During Mondays opening ceremony, the initiative will open a new window for people to express their views through social media and digital technology. It will also aim to engage people from all walks of life around the globe in the growing momentum to take climate action in their personal lives. Climate action before 2020 At the COP, Ministers will have the opportunity to engage in several high-level events, which all highlight the key elements of current climate change efforts. These high-level events will address some critical aspects of climate action before the year 2020, including: The Pre-2020 Stocktake will assess climate actions to be taken before 2020. The High-level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance will consider the state of global climate finance flows as captured by the third Biennial Assessment. The High-level Global Climate Action Event will offer a unique vision of how the world is affected by climate change and how different sectors are tackling the issue. Together, all events provide Ministers with a space to have frank and open discussions on progress made to date. Capacity-building for climate action, a critically important element for developing countries now and in the future, will receive a significant boost at COP24 . At a specially created capacity-building hub, some 35 events will cover topics such as implementing NDCs, integrating gender into climate action and utilizing the knowledge of indigenous peoples. \</doc>

Dec. 11 -- A Global Network of Sustainable Water and Energy Solutions, led by Itaipu Binacional and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, was launched during the UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP 24 ) in Poland. The network is the result of an agreement signed between the two organisations in March 2018. It will create a platform for sharing knowledge and good practices on integrated approaches for delivering Sustainable Development Goals 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy). The initiative is supported by the International Hydropower Association (IHA), with Chief Executive Richard Taylor joining as a member of the partnership's steering committee. At the launch event in the Polish city of Katowice on 4 December 2018, UN DESA Under-Secretary-General Liu Zhenmin stated that water and energy are interconnected and crucial issues for the achievement of the SDGs. In South America, for example, the availability of water has a direct relationship with energy generation, since hydropower accounts for more than 80 per cent of electricity supply. At the same time, the process of treatment and supply of drinking water is highly dependent on electricity. Mr Liu drew attention to the fact that 1 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity, and 2.1 billion people lack access to water at home. "The next decade is a window of opportunity for the international community to take action on these issues and to make significant progress. In this scenario, an integrated approach to SDGs 6 and 7 is a powerful tool," said Mr Liu. "And Itaipu is an example of this, as I personally witnessed last May when I visited the plant," he added. Itaipu, a member of IHA, was represented at the launch by financial directors, Mario Cecato (Brazil) and Monica Perez dos Santos (Paraguay), who emphasised the company's commitment to sharing its experiences in promoting development, biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, and income generation "This partnership with UN DESA is closely linked to our company. Water and energy are key issues for Itaipu's activities", said Mr Cecato. "It is from the water and energy care that Itaipu demonstrates its commitment to promoting economic, social and environmental development, both in Brazil and in Paraguay," Ms Perez added. Mr Taylor said the International Hydropower Association was committed to supporting the initiative. "There are very few examples, such as Itaipu, where the commitment to sustainable development is central to all its activities", Mr Taylor said. "So we have to learn from these examples. For the sake of our future generations, the time to act is now." Itaipu is also a strategic partner for the World Hydropower Congress, which is organised by IHA and hosted by UNESCO in Paris. Registration for the biennial event, held between 14 and 16 May 2019, is now open. "Your goal is clear: to grow this global network over time to become one of the largest multi-stakeholder-based knowledge networks on water and energy. You also recognise the influential and defining role that climate change plays in this as well. We appreciate your work, your partnership and the results you've achieved so far. Never have we needed this work like now." Ms Espinosa added: "Governments alone cannot solve climate change. We need all people on board if we're to truly make a difference." How it works The network's proposal is to attract other organisations, governments and companies working with an integrated approach between water and energy. To join the platform, UN DESA is asking interested parties to produce case studies about their practices. After a review by the UN body, the studies will be made available online.

India, Dec. 10 -- Less than 4 per cent of the global climate adaptation funding is to deal with health impacts The world remains ill-prepared for the health impacts that come with increasing temperatures and extreme weather events, say two reports released recently. While the 2017 adaptation funds-$472.82 million-already fall short of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement, only 3.8 per cent of it is allocated for health, reveals The Lancet Countdown . Another report- United Nations Environment Adaptation Gap 2018 -reiterates the fact that the current adaptation efforts and finances made available are by no means sufficient to minimise future health impact of the changing climate. Both the reports call for financial preparedness to deal with health risks owing to climate change. This report was released at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Fatal heat Climate change is expected to cause 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. Of these, 38,000 people will die in old age owing to heat exposure, 48,000 people will die due to diarrhoea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to malnutrition, warned the latest World Health Organization assessment . But while progress has been made in reducing climate-sensitive diseases and injuries, current adaptation efforts are well below the level required to avoid or minimise negative health impacts. Unless adaptation efforts are strengthened considerably, heat and extreme weather events-related morbidity and mortality will continue to rise, warns the report. Heat-related annual mortality of the elderly can rise by more than 90,000 by 2030 and more than 250,000 by 2050, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Tracking a task Current funding for climate change adaptation in health is negligible. While health is a priority sector in 54 per cent of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), only few are measurable. NDCs are at the heart of the Paris Agreement and list efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. But the less number of quantifiable targets will hinder national policy-making efforts, and the ability to increase ambition over time. The annual cost of adaptation can range from $140 billion to $300 billion by 2030 and from $280 billion to $500 billion by 2050. What is urgently needed to narrow the adaptation gap in health, both today and in the future, is the political will and the necessary financial resources to implement the most important actions related to climate resilient health systems. The UN report calls for widening the development agenda aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate-sensitive health risks, particularly infectious diseases and food and nutritional insecurity. It also recommends that since health impacts will strongly increase in the future due to climate change, it is essential that the nations scale up their adaptation measures.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for increasing India's contribution to the Paris Agreement for reducing greenhouse emissions and fighting climate change, according to a UN spokesperson. When they met on Thursday night in Buenos Aires, "they discussed the upcoming UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) and the importance of the completion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme, its transparency framework and climate finance," Guterres's Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Friday. "The Secretary-General also thanked Mr. Modi for his commitment to increase India's nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement," he added. India has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of gross domestic product (EIGDP) by 33 per cent to 35 per cent below the 2005 levels by 2030, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). EIGDP is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by a unit of GDP. A UNEP report last month said that India was on its way to meeting its target and was projected to be even more than 10 per cent below its target of greenhouse gas emissions. The 24th round of the UN climate change conference known as the Conference of Parties 24 ( COP24 ) begins on Sunday in Katowice, Poland. World leaders and experts at the conference will discuss action plans to achieve the Paris Climate Change Agreement's goal of limitingAglobal temperature rise during this centuryAto less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 9 -- As the first week of the crucial UN climate summit ended this weekend, businesses, investors, local authorities, trade unions and NGOs on Sunday called upon the European Union to commit to significantly increase the current climate commitments by 2020, in order to secure a successful outcome of the summit Stakeholders standing together as the Coalition for Higher Ambition urged the EU governments attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 , to respond to the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report with urgency and also scaled up ambition. The first week of the talks delivered limited progress on technical issues, but most decisions that are expected from this COP, including a commitment to strengthen all countries' climate pledges by 2020, are left to the ministers, who will be attending the summit this coming week. To stimulate progress of the talks, the EU needs to do its best to convince all countries to support such a commitment, including by pledging to substantially increase its own climate targets. With its new draft long-term strategy calling for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the EU brought new ambition to the negotiating table, but it is the increase of the short-term emission cuts by 2030 that will make or break our response to the climate crisis. Wendel Trio, Director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, told IANS in a statement: "The first week of the climate summit was full of bad news on emissions reaching all-time highs and targets not matching the demands of science." "It is clear that governments are not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris Agreement was signed. The second week of the COP is the last chance to correct the course. "We urge EU leaders to show leadership and ambition, and commit to increase the EU's 2030 target even beyond the 55 per cent reduction some member states and the European Parliament are calling for," Trio added. Yann Francoise, Head of climate, energy and circular economy strategies in Paris, said: "Achieving Paris agreement is already a priority of numerous EU cities. The city of Paris adopted in last March its new Climate Actions Plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 for a fair, inclusive and resilient city." "To achieve this ambition, all policies local, regional, national and European should be aligned. The EU should increase its ambition. Thirty years is a short period to achieve this transition which claims social justice initiatives as the same level than mitigation and adaptation solutions. Cities act, have solutions, cities are ready to work together." Mir Roca Montserrat, Confederal Secretary of European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), said: "Scientists and citizens marching in the streets are reminding us that the climate clock is ticking. The ETUC supports the objective of a net-zero emissions EU in 2050, but reaching that objective requires much more ambitious milestones for 2030 and 2040." Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is a viable target for the overall EU economy and a source of opportunities for value and job creation, added Miguel Angel Munoz, head of climate policies. Experts say the priority outcome at the COP24 , which will conclude on December 14, will be the finalisation of the "Paris rulebook", a Bible for transparent implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement -- the first global treaty to reduce emissions by all rich and poor nations. The COP24 India, one of the participants, has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of gross domestic product (EIGDP) by 33-35 per cent below the 2005 levels by 2030, according to UN Environment. EIGDP is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by a unit of GDP. Indian Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan, who was attending the summit, said the high level of greenhouse gas emission was a major concern and reaffirmed that India would play a "positive, constructive and balanced role" in the climate summit. He said India is working hard for achieving the 175 GW target for installed Renewable Energy capacity by 2022.

KATOWICE (POLAND): Seeking to end deadlock on critical issues by showing urgency of climate actions, the European Union (EU) and 27 countries have decided to raise emission reduction targets by 2020. Though environmentalists want similar ambition from big current emitters like China and India, the latter flagged their low per capita emission and huge developmental needs. As crucial negotiations to finalise rulebook for Paris Agreement entered the final round, India and other developing countries want the rich ones (historical polluters) to meet their pre-2020 targets so that "no undue burden is shifted to post-2020 period".A recent IPCC special report on the impact of 1.5 degree Celsius of warming across the globe has galvanised the EU and 27 countries, including a few developing ones, to come together as a 'High Ambition Coalition' (HAC) and decide to raise their Paris Agreement targets. Though these countries are not formally required to increase their targets until 2025, they will now raise their targets substantially under the HAC by 2020.The move is seen as an attempt to send a positive signal at the UN climate conference ( COP24 ) where the lack of cooperation shown by four fossil-fuel powers - USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - have demoralised other participants, leading to slow progress in talks on other entirely unrelated issues.Big developing countries and high current emitters like China and India are not part of the HAC, even as civil society representatives pushed hard for an outcome to COP24 requiring all countries to raise their emission reduction ambition by 2020 keeping in view the latest IPCC report."Like the European coalition, emerging economies like the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries should also announce their intention to increase their ambition before 2020. This will boost the global collective action. It'll also give a signal to climate laggards like the US and Saudi Arabia that despite their obstructions, the world will move ahead to combat climate change," said Chandra Bhushan, climate change expert of the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Senior bureaucrat and India's head of delegation at COP24 , A K Mehta, while delivering India's country statement on Wednesday, again reminded the gathering that the country's per capita emissions continued to be much less than many countries. He said, "India is guided by its own values and belief in sustainable lifestyles which respects nature, evident from the fact that our share in cumulative historical global GHG emissions is only about 3% and our per capita emissions are just about one-third of global average."The CSE and several civil society groups have, however, long been saying that India is already doing far better than what it had pledged and therefore the country can raise its ambition and show leadership on climate issues.

May 25 -- Counselor of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF), member of the International Advisory Council of Rosatom State Corporation Takuya Hattori, who had a familiarization visit to Beloyarsk NPP, said, "I am impressed with your success. The issue of fast neutron reactors is of high importance for the future development of nuclear energy and is of interest for international cooperation. And Russia is the world leader in the development and operation of reactors of this type." After inspecting the reactor and engine rooms and the unit control room for the 4th power unit with the BN-800 reactor, Takuya Hattori said, "My mission was to learn the way Rosenergoatom - the world's leading nuclear company - operates fast reactors. I simply do not believe my eyes; there is a fast neutron reactor that is safely and reliably operated at such a level of power. The future of nuclear energy in Japan is still being discussed at the governmental level with the aim to spread clean energy sources in accordance with the Paris Agreement (2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris). My opinion is that without nuclear energy, we will not be able to achieve sustainable ecological and socio-economic development in the future; its role and importance are in no way comparable to other sources of energy. The main lesson of Fukushima that we learned is that the safety of a nuclear power plant should be the main intent of those operating the reactors." Chief Engineer of Beloyarsk NPP Yuriy Nosov, his deputies Valeriy Shamanskiy and Ilya Filin introduced the Russian experience in the operation of sodium-cooled fast reactors and the BN-800 assembly and commission peculiarities to the guest. "The evolutionary development of fast reactors in Russia has been carried out for more than 60 years now", Valeriy Shamanskiy said. "BN-1200 will become the basis for commercial sodium-cooled fast reactors. In terms of safety, it will correspond to Generation IV (G-4). " The Beloyarsk NPP has come into operation in April 1964. The first power blocks of the Beloyarsk NPP with thermal reactors AMB-100 and AMB-200 has been closed after the accumulated running time. The power block with a fast industrial capacity reactor BN-600 is still on. The power block with a fact reactor BN-800 is currently being prepared for coming into operation.

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 12 -- In addition to providing customer savings while safeguarding reliable service, NWS can support the integration of smart, customer-centered technologies that promote a cleaner, more flexible and resilient grid, the report, The Non-Wires Solutions Implementation Playbook: A Practical Guide for Regulators, Utilities, and Developers, explains. The Playbook identifies the key barriers that have inhibited more widespread NWS deployment and provides recommendations to overcome them. These recommendations focus on three themes: establishing more supportive regulatory environments, integrating NWS within a utility's standard operating procedures and adapting current utility procurement practices to effectively support NWS sourcing. For the past decade, regulated utilities have spent an average of $55 billion annually upgrading their distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to meet customer needs. The largest share of this investment has been in distribution infrastructure to maintain and modernize the last-mile networks that deliver energy to homes and businesses. Using the Playbook, grid planners can improve on this approach to infrastructure investment by more systematically evaluating opportunities to deploy modular-and often lower cost-NWS portfolios. Doing so reduces the risk that infrastructure investments based on uncertain forecasts may burden ratepayers with higher electricity bills for years to come if demand growth doesn't materialize, and provides a time-value-of-money benefit since investments can be delayed until needs are realized. "Utilities are facing new challenges to support the health of a grid that is aging, alongside new customer demands for energy choice and cleaner energy," Jeff Waller, a principal at RMI and one of the report's authors, said. "The proliferation of DERs and the growing ability and confidence of grid planners to integrate them into grid operations promises to lower customer costs, cut emissions and diversify the service offerings utilities can offer their customers. We hope our Playbook can be a valuable resource to speed the delivery of these benefits through the deployment of NWS." The Playbook also includes practical NWS implementation guidelines to help utilities operationalize NWS programs. These implementation guidelines cover four central elements that are at the heart of a successful utility NWS program: criteria to identify potential non-wires solution projects, competitive RFP processes that lead to meaningful responses, evaluation frameworks to help utilities determine if NWS projects are viable and competitive and a discussion of key contract terms that are specific to non-wires solution projects. "We have found that with a supportive regulator and our willingness to innovate and rely on the private sector, we can deploy non-wire solutions to benefit our customers and the environment," Damian Sciano, a director in Distribution Planning for Con Edison, the energy company that serves New York City, said. "RMI's research shows that if our industry, policy makers and other stakeholders work together, we can unlock the potential of clean energy solutions like solar, battery storage, energy efficiency and combined heat and power." The report was released today at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland. RMI consulted with members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 17 governors, in drafting this report, which will inform the Alliance's efforts to advance interstate policy solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and grow the economy. The report's release at COP24 comes alongside the participation of governor's policy advisers from California, Washington, Hawaii and Maryland at COP24 in a series of climate meetings with international counterparts to discuss collaboration on climate solutions. The U.S. Climate Alliance unveiled plans for the Impact Partnership at COP24 , which provides technical, analytical and other support to the alliance from civil society.

The Minister for Asia and the Pacific visited Poland on 24 to 25 January to continue discussions on UK-Poland initiatives such as our clean growth partnership. FCO Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field visited Poland on 24 to 25 January to follow up on the 3rd annual UK-Poland Inter-Governmental Consultations, held in London in December. The visit also follows the recent COP24 climate conference in Katowice last month, which Minister Field attended, and allowed for an exchange of views on key issues across the Asia-Pacific region, as well as further strengthening of relations between the UK and Poland. While in Poland Minister Field met key Polish figures including Deputy Foreign Minister Maciej Lang, Deputy Minister for the Environment Slawomir Mazurek and Minister for Strategic Energy Infrastructure Piotr Naimski. It is evident that relations between the United Kingdom and Poland are as strong as ever, with a huge amount of bilateral work taking place between our 2 countries. We continued discussions on important joint initiatives such as our clean growth partnership, much of which resulted from the hugely productive Inter-Governmental Consultations, which the Prime Minister hosted in London in December. Ours is a very fruitful partnership, and that is why it is important for me to be back in Poland so soon after my last visit in December for COP24 in Katowice. The UK and Poland have a long shared history and we continue to work closely together on some of the most pressing issues facing our 2 countries, including through NATO and the UN Security Council. The Minister also met representatives of UK and Polish businesses working in green technology and energy. \</doc>

Time is running short for countries to decide the practical details of how the Paris Agreement will be brought to life, known as the Paris rulebook. Negotiators meeting in Bangkok have just concluded another round of climate talks. The key aim was to whittle down a series of lengthy documents into a set of clear options for politicians to choose from when they meet later this year. As the talks concluded on Sunday, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the talks, told reporters uneven progress had been made at an extra set of talks in Bangkok. It is now critical to achieve balance across all the different aspects of the rulebook, she said. The diplomats leading the talks have been tasked with taking this process forward in the run-up to COP24 Good progress was reportedly made in areas such as carbon markets, but progress stalled in some others. Disputes included whether rich and poor countries should include the same types of information in their climate pledges, how developed countries should report on their contribution to climate finance, and where to include the sensitive issue of loss and damage in the rulebook. Setting the rules The Paris Agreement on climate change was struck in 2015. By 2016, it had been ratified by enough countries to bring it into force, but it will only apply from 2020. The talks last week, which ended on Sunday evening, aimed to continue hammering out its finer details, known formally as the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP) and informally as the Paris rulebook. This instruction manual must be finalised by the end of this year. Yamide Dagnet, project director on international climate action at the World Resources Institute, says the rulebook is important for the credibility of the multilateral climate regime. She tells Carbon Brief: We know this is very important. Well need it not only to guide a countrys action on the ground and help them to enhance their NDCs Nationally Determined Contributions, or country climate pledges by 2020, but also to really hold accountable parties who commited to adopt those rules by this time. There was a lot to get through, with slow progress in the previous negotiating session in May in Bonn having led to this additional Bangkok session being scheduled. In a joint reflections note released ahead of the talks, the diplomats leading the talks wrote: The main objective of the additional session in Bangkok is to reach an agreed basis for negotiations for all PAWP items, reflecting clear and streamlined options, and with sufficient detail for the outcome of the session to be swiftly turned into draft decision text. If Parties do not achieve this in Bangkok, a satisfactory outcome in Katowice will be in jeopardy. These pieces of UN climate jargon (reflections note, agreed basis for negotiations, streamlined options, draft decision text, informal notes) are all different ways to describe pieces of text. The coded language refers to different levels of progress on the journey from collections of disparate country proposals through to universally agreed legal decisions. Roughly speaking, proposals are organised into informal notes or tools and then streamlined until they are concise and clear enough to form an agreed basis for negotiations. These are then crafted into draft decision text which looks like a final legal decision, but includes a range of clearly articulated different pieces of language in square brackets, for example, giving legally binding or indicative instructions as shall should . Finally, negotiators settle on a single formulation and adopt the legal decision text. Negotiators in Bangkok had less than a week to make progress. The main task was to streamline a series of informal tools basically, documents setting out all proposed options by different parties as much as possible. These tools were set out in a series of nine documents, together running to 189 pages, published ahead of the talks by the Ad-hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement, or APA which is responsible for most of the Paris rulebook. As the talks concluded on Sunday afternoon, a 307-page informal note was published by the UNFCCC secretariat in a bid to sum up the status of negotiations. This text draws in the additional areas covered by the other two UNFCCC groups, namely SBI and SBSTA, which also have responsibility for some elements of the rulebook. However, this summary text still lacks the clarity some hoped for, as a basis for smooth negotiations at COP24 . COP24 . This should include textual proposals that would be helpful for advancing parties deliberations, the request says. This will allow the chairs to translate informal notes into legal language and identify potential compromises ahead of COP24 , Climate Home News reports. Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at Christian Aid, notes in a statement: We have fortunately avoided going off the cliff edge. Governments have empowered the co-chairs to turn the progress made so far into a more solid basis for negotiations in Poland. It is now vital for the co-chairs to change the course of the negotiations from diplomatic doldrums towards a win-win approach and craft middle ground options that the whole world can get behind at COP24 . \</doc>

Nagpur: At a time when India is battling accelerating pace of climate change and toxic air, allocating large portions of conservation funds towards tiger conservation is causing an ecological imbalance, according to a United Nations' (UN) expert.Madhav Karki, member of multidisciplinary expert panel of the UN's Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem (IPBES), was in the city on Monday to attend a brainstorming session on biodiversity loss organized by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri).In an exclusive interview with TOI, Karki highlighted the need for a balancing act. "Specie-specific conservation is critical but what we need right now is an eco-system level conservation," he said.At the recent 24th United Nations climate change conference which was held in Katowice in Poland, union environment minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had declared that the country has achieved 1% increase in its forest cover.However, according to Karki, the country needs more than just standing trees. "We are literally missing the forest for trees here. While increasing the forest cover is a good start, the next step is to enrich it with biodiversity. The country is facing high losses of endemic and other species, and the policymakers need to address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss," said Karki. On Monday, a landmark international report revealed that at least one-third of the Himalayan ice cap is doomed to melt due to climate change. Agreeing that the effects of climate change are speeding up, Karki said that vehicular emissions are also responsible for glacier melting. "Apart from rise in temperature, air pollution is also responsible for it. Emissions of short-lived climate pollutants from transport and thermal power plant sector are the two main culprits," he added.The main short-lived climate pollutants are black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and fluorinated gases. "Though the government is taking positive steps in transport sector by promoting electric vehicles, it needs to move fast towards clean energy," said Karki.As being reported by TOI, the environment ministry has been giving clearances to new coal-fired plants despite the Central Electricity Authority's declaration that the country doesn't need more plants till 2022.The ministry recently launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in which the government has targeted to reduce air pollution by 20-30% by 2024. The country's national climate action plan, known in the UN parlance as nationally determined contributions (NDC) aims at increasing the share of non-fossil fuels to 40% and reducing emission intensity of the economy by 33 to 35% by 2030 from 2005 level.But for a country which has 9 out of 10 most polluted cities in the world, more needs to be done. "The government needs to scale up as well as geographically scale out its targets," said Karki. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

Nuclear powers electricity generating capacity risks shrinking in the coming decades as ageing reactors are retired and the industry struggles with reduced competitiveness, according to a new IAEA report. The declining trend may set back global efforts to mitigate climate change, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said. The 38th edition of Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050, published, provides detailed global trends in nuclear power by region. Its projections1 for nuclear electricity generating capacity are presented as low and high estimates, reflecting different driving factors that have an impact on the worldwide deployment of the low-carbon energy source. Overall, the new projections suggest that nuclear power may struggle to maintain its current place in the worlds energy mix. In the low case to 2030, the projections show nuclear electricity generating capacity falling by more than 10% from a net installed capacity of 392 gigawatts (electrical) (GW(e)) at the end of 2017. In the high case, generating capacity increases 30% to 511 GW(e), a drop of 45 GW(e) from last years projection. Longer term, generating capacity declines to 2040 in the low case before rebounding to 2030 levels by mid-century, when nuclear is seen providing 2.8% of global generating capacity compared with 5.7%. The declining trend in our low projection for installed capacity up to 2050 suggests that, without significant progress on using the full potential of nuclear power, it will be difficult for the world to secure sufficient energy to achieve sustainable development and to mitigate climate change, Amano said. The wide range in the projections is also due to the considerable number of reactors scheduled to be retired around 2030 and beyond, particularly in North America and Europe, and whether they will be replaced by new nuclear capacity. Nuclear power produced about 10% of the worlds electricity in 2017, accounting for about one-third of total low-carbon electricity. As of today, the worlds 455 operating nuclear power reactors have a record level of 399.8 GW(e) total net installed capacity. Over the short term, the low price of natural gas, the impact of renewable energy sources on electricity prices, and national nuclear policies in several countries following the accident at Japans Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 are expected to continue weighing on nuclear powers growth prospects, according to the report. In addition, the nuclear power industry faces increased construction times and costs due to heightened safety requirements, challenges in deploying advanced technologies and other factors. Still, interest in nuclear power remains strong in the developing world, particularly in Asia where countries such as China and India need huge amounts of electricity and also want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Commitments agreed to at the 21st session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) could also produce a positive impact on nuclear energy development in the future, according to the publication. \</doc>

India, Dec. 6 -- COP24 : UNFCCC reportsays financial support provided by the developed countries to the developing ones also saw increase Between 1990 and 2016, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developed countries declined by 13 per cent, says a report titled ' Compilation and Synthesis ', released by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Thursday at the 24 th Conference of Parties in Katowice, Poland. Actions to mitigate climate change as well as the impacts of economic and demographic growth helped bring down emissions in these countries by 4.4 per cent between 2010 and 2016, says the report. It also highlighted a 23 per cent drop in GHG emissions per person in developed countries between 1990 and 2016. Emission reduction measures have increased and are paying off, it says. This serves as an important start-off to meeting climate action targets, under the Paris Agreement, before 2020. Further, financial support provided by the developed countries to the developing ones increased by 13 per cent between the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 reporting periods. The developed nations contributed nearly $49.4 billion in 2016. The report commends that this hike in financial support could provide the much-needed impetus to developing countries to shift towards a low-emission economy and meet the sustainable development goals. Another boost to developing countries' climate action plan beyond 2020 is the technology transfer and capacity-building support, says the report. The report, however, flagged the disproportionate implementation of measures and policies. It says that while some developed countries are ahead of their targets, others still lag behind. The paper is based on reporting that developed countries are obliged to undertake every two years. UNFCCC cop24 Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

Austria will join the "High Ambition Coalition" and support the "STATEMENT ON STEPPING UP CLIMATE AMBITION". This was announced today, Thursday, by Austria's Minister of Sustainable Development Elisabeth Kstinger as part of the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice. "We have reached a point where the efforts for a good result at the climate summit need a strong political push," said Kstinger. The High Ambition Coalition (HAC) was originally set up as part of COP21 in Paris, which includes both industrialized and developing countries. The HAC yesterday published a "Statement on stepping up climate ambition". The initiative is an instrument that brings ambitious countries together in the field of climate protection to give new impetus to negotiations. "The goal is clear," says Kstinger. "We want to achieve a good degree here. We are in the midst of a very intensive phase of negotiations. "Elisabeth Kstinger, in her role as Austria's sustainability ministers, supports this initiative and the current declaration for more ambition in climate protection and at the COP in Katowice. The content of the joint declaration includes the current IPCC Special Report, which clearly identifies the need for action. "The IPCC report is unequivocal," says Kstinger. "Only through rapid global action can we limit global warming to 1.5 C. Therefore, the "High Ambition Coalition" is committed to decisive global climate protection, "says Kstinger. "Together we have to act, the COP24 is the chance that the community of states is binding on a framework for action to combat climate change. We need to join forces to bring COP24 to a positive conclusion. " Supporters of the initiative include: the European Commission, Canada, France, Spain, Denmark, Costa Rica, Argentina, Colombia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, Germany, Granada, Italy, Jamaica, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Santa Lucia, Sweden, Great Britain and now also Austria \</doc>

Scaling-up public resources for adaptation, loss and damage as well as tackling the imbalance between financial support provided for mitigation and adaptation is yet another important task for COP24 . A good opportunity for looking into the possibilities for new and additional finance for loss and damage would be the technical paper on sources of financial support for loss and damage. The paper is planned to be published in 2019 and received input from the Suva Expert Dialogue that was held at the last session of Subsidiary Bodies (SB48) in May 2018 in Bonn The Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index is an analysis based on one of the most reliable data sets available on the impacts of extreme weather events and associated socio-economic data. The Germanwatch Climate Risk Index 2019 is the 14th edition of the annual analysis. Its aim is to contextualize ongoing climate policy debates especially the international climate negotiations with real-world impacts during the last year and the last 20 years. People all over the world have to face the reality of climate change in many parts of the world manifesting as increased volatility of extreme weather events. Between 1998 and 2017, more than 526,000 people died worldwide and losses of US$ 3.47 trillion (in PPP) were incurred as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events. Whats on the agenda for resilience at COP24 in Katowice? Key messages Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events. Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities). Storms and their direct implications precipitation, floods and landslides were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones. Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017s hurricanes. It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise. In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance: Countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. Of the ten most affected countries and territories (19982017), eight were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica) and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico). The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the rulebook needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines. Furthermore, COP24 must increase efforts to properly address loss and damage, which appears as a cross-cutting issue referenced throughout various negotiation streams, with significant risk of being omitted from final negotiation text. The risks of future climate-related losses and damages are far too severe to simply function as a negotiation chip. In Katowice, the three-year period to develop the rulebook for the Paris Agreement comes to an end. As stipulated in the Paris Agreement, states should regularly communicate their priorities, support needs, plans and activities in the field of adaptation (Article 7, para 10,11). These reports (adaptation communications) shall also inform the global stocktake of countries climate outputs. Based on the previous negotiations, it will be up to the reporting countries to decide in which document the information will be provided. They may be, for example, part of the National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) or the National Climate Plans (NDCs). Parties still debate whether the guidelines should be identical in both cases, or whether guidelines should be vehicle-specific, i.e. separate guidelines for NAPs and NDCs. Regardless of the document the information is produced for, it should be publicly accessible in an adaptation register (Article 7 12). The issue here is whether climate protection measures and climate adaptation measures should be made accessible separately or jointly. Apart from that, in Katowice it will be important that the issue of loss and damage finds its way into the rulebook, especially under the global stocktake. On the basis of a COP21 decision, the Least Developed Country Expert Group, in collaboration with the Adaptation Committee, prepared a report on progress in the process of developing and implementing NAPs. The recommendations of the report will be submitted to COP24 . \</doc>

Incheon (South Korea) Oct 8 -- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a world body assessing the science related to climate change, urged "rapid and far-reaching" changes in all aspects of the entire world on Monday to fight global warming after adopting a special report on the issue The 48th IPCC session in South Korea's western port city of Incheon brought together about 570 representatives from 135 countries and international organisations, Xinhua news agency reported. It approved the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius that will be a key scientific input into the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Poland in December. The report highlighted a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in comparison to 2 degrees Celsius or higher. It examined pathways available to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be. The report found that limiting the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require "rapid and far-reaching" transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities. The special report was requested by 195 nations when they adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UNFCCC. The report would become a key scientific basis for the COP24 to the UNFCCC, scheduled for December in Poland, according to the IPCC. The IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments about climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies. --IANS pgh/ \</doc>

In the recently launched landmark report of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the worlds leading scientists warned that we only have 12 years to prevent the global environmental catastrophe caused by irreversible climate change. This will require rapid and far-reaching climate action in all sectors, including energy, industry, buildings, transport, agriculture and cities. While industry is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly one third of total global emissions, it is also a leading provider of climate technology solutions and green jobs. Speaking at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), UNIDO Director General LI Yong said, Innovation is key to addressing climate change and promoting economic and social prosperity. UNIDO is currently implementing over 400 projects, which directly contribute to achieving the targets and goals set by both the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To enhance knowledge sharing and demonstrate proven and effective solutions for replication and scaling up, UNIDO showcased some of these projects during COP24 side events. For instance, the UNIDO-GEF Global Cleantech Innovation Programme, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in developing innovative climate and clean energy solutions as profitable business models, prominently featured in multiple technology-related side events. UNIDO also presented its clean cooking fuels initiative, which promotes the production of biofuels in developing countries, as well as the manufacturing of the stoves on an industrial scale. A dedicated side event marked the fifth anniversary of the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), the implementing arm of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. Hosted by UNIDO and UN Environment, the CTCN promotes the accelerated transfer of environmentally sound technologies for mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries. \</doc>

The Indonesian delegation welcomed the conclusions of the trial of the SBSTA, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA), with a proposal from the conclusion of the APA Co-Chairs-SBI-SBSTA, which will continue to be considered at the UNFCCC COP-24 , as a basis for further consideration at next week's ministerial hearing. "We have high hopes of leaving Katowice with a balanced result - comprehensive, resulting from a process that is transparent, inclusive and in accordance with party desires, and applies to all while maintaining the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) ", said Nur Masripatin, as Indonesia's National Focal Point for the UNFCCC, after attending the closing of the SBSTA, SBI and APA trials at the UNFCCC COP24 in Katowice, Poland, Saturday night (12/08/2018) local time. SBSTA is one of two permanent supporting bodies for the Convention established by COP / CMP. This supports the work of the COP, CMP and CMA through the provision of timely information and advice on scientific and technological matters relating to the Convention, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. SBSTA and SBI work together on cross-cutting issues that touch on areas of expertise, including developing countries' vulnerability to climate change and response measures, discussions under the Technology Mechanism, Adaptation Committee. SBSTA and SBI meet in parallel, twice a year. While APA is a temporary trial to discuss the preparation for implementation of the Paris Agreement articles. Representing the Indonesian Delegation, Nur Masripatin expressed his deep appreciation to all the presidency teams in their leadership and efforts in guiding the negotiation process to complete the Paris Agreement Work Program. "Our sincere appreciation was also given to the COP Presidency for leadership, and to the Polish people for their hospitality," said Nur, who was present with 196 other countries. Nur Masripatin said during plenary on Friday - Saturday to obtain various inputs, the secretariat team managed to concoct all inputs and concentrations from the party. "This is important because before the COP Closing Meeting on December 14, 2018, a meeting with ministers was needed to finalize the draft prepared during this week which would later be referred to as Katowice Ooutcome," explained Nur Masripatin. The Indonesian delegation acknowledges the progress of negotiations both in terms of facilitation and compliance, global stock take, and the common time frame for NDCs. "We note a number of important issues that need to be resolved, including differentiation in relation to ICTU and accounting for NDCs. In the Transparency Framework, Indonesia wants to reiterate that the MPG is comprehensive and balanced for Transparency Framework between action and support, and between elements in action and in support ", said Nur Masripatin. "Our emphasis in intervening in the closing of this trial is very important because it is the core issues of the Paris Agreement and is very much related to the implementation of domestic NDCs, especially the substances prepared as material for Ministrial Level Meetings," he continued. Regarding non-PAWP, Indonesia welcomes conclusions about working with Koronivia on agriculture (ongoing work) and Gender and Climate Change. "We are also pleased that the parties can reach a consensus on" Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples platforms "/ Local communities and Indegenous People, platforms that we hope can further enhance the role of LCIP in the climate action agenda," Nur stressed in Indonesia's intervention With the principle that nothing has been agreed until everything is agreed upon, the Indonesian delegation has confidence that all Parties will maintain a commitment to achieve tangible results in Katowice. "Indonesia hopes to support your leadership by cooperating constructively with other Parties", said Mrs. Nur closing the Indonesian Intervention at the closing which was attended by more than 1,000 people. \</doc>

Oct. 29 -- Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa is the first company to have signed an agreement with the Polish State Forests Information Center on promotional activities during the global Climate Summit. Accordingly, JSW has become a partner of the Polish National Pavilion at the COP24 Conference to be held in Katowice later this year. During the Summit, according to the signed agreement, Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa will have a 349-square meter stand in the so-called temporary building, located between Katowice's Spodek arena and the International Congress Center. JSW will be able to use this space during the Partner Day. This is where Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa, the largest producer of coking coal in the European Union, will hold panel discussions, meetings with experts and other events during which the company will present itself as an environmentally oriented leader in the mining sector. Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa is an enterprise that runs its mining operations in accordance with the slogan "We respect natural resources" and destroys the stereotypical image of a backward mining industry owing to the implementation of various innovative technological solutions. It is JSW's ambition to be a company that excels in the development of low-carbon industry and technologies of the future. This applies, among other initiatives, to developing techniques enabling the company to obtain hydrogen from coke oven gas created in JSW's plants, which may then be used to propel motor vehicles. The result of hydrogen combustion in vehicle engines is only water vapor. That is why JSW intends to present a hydrogen-propelled bus during the summit, for use by the COP24 guests. The global Climate Summit will be held in Katowice starting on 3 December 2018. Events with the participation of over 20,000 guests from all countries of the world will last until 14 December 2018.

New Delhi, Dec. 20 -- Conversations in India rarely revolve around the subject of Climate Change. Discussions surrounding the topic are largely limited to the highest offices and international forums, while the country's citizens remain mostly disassociated from it. And, yet, it is no secret that the country will be the worst affected in the world once the full-scale repercussions of the global crisis are realised. The UN report by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released earlier this year noted that a mere increase in global temperatures by 1.5\'b0C will "disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations through food insecurity, higher food prices, incomes losses, lost livelihood opportunities, adverse health impact, and population displacements". These sombre warnings show why India will be one of the most significantly-affected nations, given its huge population, inequality and poverty levels. The country's vast coastline also puts a large number of livelihoods at risk. Apart from rising sea levels, deadly heat waves and catastrophic cyclones are also becoming more frequent, which are manifest evidence of Climate Change. With this background, the Climate Change negotiations that were recently concluded at Katowice in Poland should be enthusiastically welcomed. The 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 COP24 seems promising. The rulebook ensures that from 2020, the fight against Climate Change will be driven by actions rather than promises. The agreement defines the responsibilities of each of the 195 signatory states for tackling Climate Change, reporting progress and intensifying their efforts in the future. The very act of reaching an agreement shows that even if multilateralism has been desecrated in the last few years, it is not yet dead. The negotiators at the summit believed that the rulebook is a robust tool to combat the worst effects of Climate Change. But the reality is not as promising. Against the Paris Agreement's long-term goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C, the current pledges put the world on track for up to 4 degrees of warming. It might disappoint many that COP24 could not urge governments to commit to more ambitious targets, especially after the findings of the IPCC report. All eyes will now be on the next deadline in 2020, when countries are expected to demonstrate that they have met their previous targets and set new tougher ones for themselves. India, on its part, is on track to meet at least two of the three commitments it made in Paris. The intensity of the country's greenhouse gas emissions was to be reduced by 33-35 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Second, 40 per cent of its power capacity was to be based on non-fossil fuel sources. Third, India promised to create an additional 'carbon sink' of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India is well on its way to achieving the first two targets. It is heartening that most of the countries around the world are resolute in their commitment to the fight against Climate Change. Katowice has once again reaffirmed that belief. The world now has a solid roadmap for the actions it needs to take to carry on the fight. What is missing is strong leadership, the sense of unified urgency and scaled-up national ambitions. Hopefully, 2020 will change that. As Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old Swedish activist said at COP24 : "Until you start focussing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope." \</doc>

Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine Ostap Semerak, while delivering a speech at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) which takes place in Katowice (Poland), urged the Parties and the Secretariat to maintain a staunchest position regarding Crimea and not to recognize any change in the status of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol. He recalled that the Russian Federation has repeatedly tried to include data on the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in the reports on emissions and green gas removal, therefore violating a number of international documents. "I want to remind all Parties and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change about paragraph 6 of the UN GA Resolution 68/262 Territorial integrity of Ukraine that calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. We urge all Parties and the Secretariat to strictly follow the provisions of this resolution regarding the documents submitted by Russia, " Ostap Semerak stressed. Moreover, he placed a special emphasis on inadmissibility of any forms of recognition of attempt to annex Crimea and the need to block Russian attempts to include data on the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in its statistical reporting. It should be noted that the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) will be held from December 2 to December 14, 2018 in Katowice (Poland). About 30 thousand people from all over the world will take part in the event.The conference is expected to finalize the rules for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change under the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP). The Ukrainian delegation is headed by Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine Ostap Semerak. Apart from participating in the conference, the Minister also held a series of bilateral meetings, in particular with the Ministers of Ecology of Turkey and Estonia. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 24 -- Clearing the smoke of uncertainty over the issue of a cleaner environment, India this year succeeded in its multilateral diplomacy to evolve a roadmap for the international community to decisively address climate change. Also, India's success in renewable energy auctions, in reducing emissions besides its largest commitment to eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, has enabled it to win accolades globally. Even the Indian private sector is not lagging behind in joining the ranks of leading global companies that have committed to set a scientific target to be carbon negative. Experts believe it's a win-win situation for India as its success in the just concluded diplomatic intrigues in the coalfields of Katowice in Poland lies in promoting a more fine-tuned form of responsibility -- not just among countries, but within them as well. Eventually, the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 , produced a deal that paves the way for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is supposed to replace the existing Kyoto Protocol in 2020. Voicing its reservations at the COP24 talks, which saw a holdback due to certain objections of the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil and Turkey, India went vocal over the lack of equity in the rules relating to the global stocktaking in the rulebook that implements the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. In the same breath, India signaled that it is ready to update its nationally determined contributions or NDCs if other countries also do so. Also playing a crucial role to mitigate climate change and other environmental challenges, India in June announced it would strengthen its support with a 25 per cent increase over its contribution to the $15 million Global Environment Facility's new investment cycle. India has committed that by 2030, as much as 40 per cent of its installed energy capacity will be based on non-fossil fuels. India has also won global accolades for opting for green technologies. India is on track to meet a majority of its Paris goals and become a global climate leader by meeting its targets a decade earlier, US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said in a report on the margins of COP24 . According to IEEFA, India's NDCs included three key targets: To achieve 40 per cent of electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030, to reduce the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 33-35 per cent from the 2005 level by 2030 and to create an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon sinks -- reservoirs that accumulate and store carbon dioxide -- through the planting of additional forest and tree cover.

Rashmi, India's former climate negotiator and now a Fellow at The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), told IANS at COP24 : "In terms of India's efforts in reducing its emissions relative to its economic growth, it is a fairly positive story and it is more significant because the energy growth is tremendous." Even the World Bank praised India's success in renewable energy auctions that delivered record-setting low prices for solar power. "There is a great opportunity now for countries to learn from each other to accelerate the uptake of good policies," said Riccardo Puliti, Senior Director for Energy and Extractives at the World Bank, in a report this month. "For example, how did India structure its renewable energy auctions to deliver record-setting low prices for solar?" A Germanwatch report says carbon dioxide emissions are rising again globally but India's ranking has improved by three points. But India moved to 11th rank from last year's 14th as a result of improved performance in renewable energy, comparatively low levels of per capita emissions and a relatively ambitious mitigation target for 2030, said Germanwatch's Climate Change Performance Index 2019. Even India's private sector is not lagging in committing carbon neutral targets. Taking the lead, Mahindra &#38; Mahindra, the leading manufacturer of utility vehicles and part of the $20.7 billion Mahindra Group, announced its commitment to become a carbon neutral company by 2040. Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra announced this at the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in San Francisco in September. Likewise, India's Dalmia Cement Group CEO Mahendra Singhi announced at the GCAS that the company too aims to be carbon negative by 2040. On the political front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was selected for this year's Champions of the Earth award -- the UN's highest environmental honour -- along with French President Emmanuel Macron.

LHK Minister Siti Nurbaya stressed that the implementation of the climate change agenda in Indonesia is not left behind compared to other countries. Various examples of best practices include resolving the status of customary forests, social forests, forest fire control, and peat restoration. Minister Siti conveyed the comparison, the land use in East Kalimantan which was well-done, and was environmentally sustainable, was able to hold carbon around 30 million tons. If all of the big industries there are 2,000 applying the same thing, then they can hold up to 300 million tons. "Imagine if all provinces applied the same thing, some even started too. We have a mandate that we have to solve about 2.8 Giga Tonnes by 2030, now 890 million tons. It means that we are actually progressing, we are advancing, in the journey, and this should be with all existing practical capital, it should be delivered to the international community, "said Minister Siti at" Indonesian Delegation Plenary Meeting at COP-24 / CMP-14 / CMA1 .3 UNFCCC, Katowice, Poland, in Jakarta (11/23/2018). The 24th meeting of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP24 / CMP14 / CMA1.3) will be held in Katowice, Poland, 2-14 December 2018. Through side events, or negotiations outside of negotiations, Indonesia can show what has been done in controlling climate change. The agendas at the Indonesian Pavilion can also be useful to show the progress made by all layers in Indonesia. Furthermore, Minister Siti also stressed that Indonesia needs to take a more aggressive stance, especially for international outreach. Because there have been many initiatives and innovations to control climate change in Indonesia. "We are actually not lagging behind in implementing the climate change agenda. So now we are not only aware, namely being alert and understanding climate change and then behaving. Now we have to advocate, what other countries need to do. So once again, we invite people to be aware, appeal, ask, act, and advocate, "he said. Related to this, Minister Siti said that some time ago a number of officials from the United Nation Environment Program (UNEP) had the opportunity to directly see waste management in the city of Surabaya. "They were surprised, because a lot has been done, for example bus tickets use five plastic bottles, previously it only existed in Sydney and Turkey, and now it is in Surabaya. There are also hotels in Bali that have not used plastic pipettes for two months, but use paper pipettes, some from glass too. So there are already many, and that's just a small example, "said Minister Siti. Indonesia has a target to utilize the agenda at events related to negotiations, as well as side events to improve Indonesia's gait profile in international forums. Since 2015, the direction of Indonesia's policy in Climate Change Control is climate resilience and justice. This emphasizes the strength of the nation's adaptability, which is called national resilience, and that is the handle. "So, make sure that Indonesia is not affected by anything that happens in the world, because we have national security, and basic mandates in the constitution for the Indonesian people," said Minister Siti. Participants in the Plenary Meeting of the Indonesian Delegation consisted of President's Special Envoy for Climate Change Rachmat Witoelar, Climate Change Advisory Board Sarwono Kusuma Atmadja, Indonesian Ambassador to Poland Peter F. Gontha, Senior Advisor to the LHK Minister, Echelon I Official KLHK, officials from the Ministry / Institutions, and other DELRI Members from Ministries / Institutions, NGOs / CSOs, Local Governments, Private Parties, Universities, Media circles, and other stakeholders. \</doc>

This month, our columnist examines a burning issue - the rising emissions of Greenhouse Gases and the consequent global warming that is threatening to spiral out of control. At COP24 in Poland, consensus was reached on the rules for reporting GHG emissions, which should help in monitoring the progress of climate mitigating efforts. But a lot more needs to be done urgently and time is running out. K Sahasranaman, Independent Consultant - Process Engineering, Energy, Utilities and Safety In discourses about various challenges confronting the human race, climate change invariably takes a back seat. CO2 emissions in USA increased by 3.4% in 2018, the largest YOY increase in more than 2 decades barring 2010. This is alarming because it challenges the belief that equipped with clean energy technologies like renewable power, batteries and electric vehicles, we have been able to decouple emissions from economic growth. Another piece of bad news is that transportation has overtaken power generation as the largest source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in USA. With cars becoming cheaper and increasingly affordable in our country, we cannot but be concerned on the likely outcome of increased emissions. India's Emissions With 6.5% share of the global emissions, we are the third largest GHG emitter behind USA and China. Energy sector's share of the emissions is a whopping 68%. Industry and agriculture accounts for 20% and 9% respectively, with waste management making up the balance 3%. Within the energy sector, electricity generation accounts for 77%. This is expected to decline significantly in the next decade thanks to the ambitious goal of increasing the share of renewables in the fuel mix to 40% by 2030. India's emissions grew annually by 5.6% from 2005 to 2013, the most recent year for which reliable data are available. Per capita emissions also grew 4% annually during this period. Our commitment under Paris Agreement is to reduce the GHG emission intensity of GDP by 33-35% below 2005 levels by 2030. Emission reporting is not mandatory for companies in India, as in China. The few companies that report voluntarily follow varied methodologies. In the absence of reliable data based on unified methodology, it is difficult to put a policy framework in place and monitor the progress. COP24 Held in December 2018 at Katowice, Poland, COP24 had one major success - an agreement on the "Rulebook" for putting the 2015 Paris Agreement into practice. The Paris agreement in 2015 saw 195 of the world's governments commit to prevent climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The "Rulebook", a detailed operating manual, needed for the Paris Agreement to enter into force in 2020, covers a number of questions, such as how countries should report their GHG emissions, contributions to climate finance, and what rules should apply to voluntary market mechanisms like carbon trading. A key section of the "Rulebook" is Article 13, which covers transparency. It describes what, how often and with which details should countries report on their mitigation efforts. New Rules The new reporting rules that kick in for all countries from 2024 is a major transformation of biannual reporting requirements. Presently, biannual reporting is required only for 44 developed countries listed in the annexures of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The new rules will ensure that all countries are held to proper standards and make it difficult to wriggle out of their commitments. Under the new rules, GHG emissions must be reported no more than two years in arrears. Reporting in 2024 would cover the years at least up to 2022. Countries will have to report emissions using "common reporting tables" and a "common tabular format" to be developed by the technical body SBSTA (Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice) One important detail of the COP24 agreement commits countries to report emissions in "CO2 Equivalents". Some critics are of the opinion that this is a retrograde step. They explain that short and long-lived GHGs affect the climate in fundamentally different ways. Lumping them all together and using a single metric of "CO2 Equivalent" seriously misrepresents the climate impact of methane. Science Based Targets Targets adopted by companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered "science-based" if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre- industrial temperatures, as described in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Science Based Targets (SBT) quickly became the gold standard for companies that aspired to be world leaders in climate change. It is built on the concept that corporate targets should be based on what is required than what feels achievable and proposes an egalitarian approach to reducing emissions. However, SBT has lost some of its aura, following the recent publication of the Special Report by IPCC, which examines the impact of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. For many years, limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was the de-facto target for global policymakers. The Special Report portrays a grim picture at even 1.5 degrees Celsius and indicates that this target is possible only through removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by afforestation, carbon capture or other technologies, and not by merely reducing emissions. Market Mechanisms Market-based instruments put a price on GHG emissions, thus promoting efficient climate change mitigation. There are basically two different approaches which lead to the creation of carbon markets: emissions trading schemes and crediting mechanisms. An emissions trading scheme sets a regulatory ceiling or 'cap' on GHG emissions. Within the sectors covered by the scheme, only a limited quantity of emission permits (allowances) are issued, namely just enough to allow the reduction target to be met. Each business covered by the emissions trading scheme must possess an allowance for each tonne of CO2 equivalent they emit. These allowances can be freely traded. This allows participants in the scheme to buy additional allowances or, if they have succeeded in reducing their own emissions, to sell excess allowances they no longer need. A crediting mechanism enables monetisation of achieved emission reductions. With this type of mechanism, tradable certificates are issued for actual emission reductions achieved. Certificates are issued when actual emissions are verifiably reduced below a predetermined baseline. Participation in a crediting mechanism is voluntary and demand for generated certificates must thus be created elsewhere. This can be done, for example, by allowing the certificates generated under the crediting mechanism to be traded in an emissions trading scheme. Some countries are critical of market mechanisms because they can become simply off-setting mechanisms, or worse, by bad design can create ways of avoiding action and increasing total emissions beyond what would otherwise have been achieved in their absence. Countries could not reach consensus on market mechanisms at COP24 . There was no agreement on basic accounting rules to prevent the "double counting" of emission reductions, reductions counted once by the country generating them and again by the country buying the offset. Parties were also unable to agree on how to implement the Paris Agreement's goal of "overall mitigation in global emissions", which aims to create a net reduction in emissions through voluntary mechanisms, rather than merely offsetting existing emissions. Epilogue The UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions' targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions' commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond. The partial success at COP24 and the Special Report of IPCC has to be viewed in the light of increase in absolute global emissions, which grew at the rate of 2.7% in 2018 to reach a record high of 37.1 billion tonnes. The window for taking action is closing.

NEW DELHI: The 200 signatories to the historic Paris climate accord may have agreed to a "rulebook" on tracking efforts to curb emissions at the COP24 meet last week in Poland. But there was little talk on countries actually ratcheting up emissions control. Global temperatures are headed for a 3 degree Celsius rise from pre-industrial levels although scientists have warned that anything above 1.5 degrees would be disastrous. In fact, 2018 saw an increase in CO2 emissions, largely due to coal and oil. A look at the top emitters, where they are and where they need to be underlines the challenge. UNITED STATESDonald Trump has said he's taking US out of the Paris accord and is dismantling green regulations introduced by Barack Obama, his predecessor. US looks like falling well short of its pledge, which means it will find it progressively tougher to effect emissions cuts.EUROPEAN UNION The 28-country bloc has taken some decisive actions to curb emissions. But challenges remain. While countries like Britain and the Netherlands seek to phase out coal power, Poland, which hosted the COP24 meet, is building new coal plants. CHINAThe country pledged that emissions would peak around 2030 and it would get 20% of its energy from non-fossil sources. China appears on track to hit that target as it is investing heavily in renewables and now sells more electric cars and buses than the rest of the world combined. But experts said the country, which saw a rise in CO2 emissions in 2018, would have to significantly ramp up emissions control for the world to keep below 2 degrees of warming. INDIAWith low per capita emissions as compared with the developed world, India has insisted that the wealthier countries should effect curbs to match their emission levels. The country now looks like it could surpass those goals given the falling cost of solar power and its focus on other renewable sources. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

Amid recent alarming reports of the dramatic loss of wildlife and ecosystems worldwide, the European Union is calling for stronger global response to biodiversity concerns at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference 2018. At the 14th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, the EU will be leading the international efforts for a post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Wider integration of biodiversity concerns in agriculture, energy, mining, industry and infrastructure projects is instrumental to keep global temperature increases well below 2C, in line with the commitments of the Paris Agreement.The high-level biodiversity conference is expected to create international consensus on the urgency of achieving global biodiversity targets by 2020. Representing the European Union at the High-Level Segment, Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Karmenu Vella said: "Biodiversity - nature - is our life-support system. The current rate at which we are losing our wildlife and ecosystems is an existential threat as worrying as climate change. I am encouraged by the growing awareness of the links between the two, also at high-level international events such as this one and the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Poland. Protecting biodiversity on land as in the ocean is important for future generations, but also for our current wellbeing." Engaging more than 350 million per year on biodiversity in developing countries, the EU is the biggest donor for the protection of biodiversity in the world. Growing awareness across Europe of the positive role of biodiversity and ecosystems for health and for food security means the European Union is well placed to provide global leadership. The business community is also realising how dependent they are on biodiversity with some businesses taking bold measures to consider their dependencies on natural capital. Capitalising on these positive examples, the European delegation, headed by Commissioner Vella, will aim to bring biodiversity policy to the political forefront to prepare for an ambitious and united outcome at the Conference of the Parties (COP15) in China in 2020. It will call for integrating nature objectives in the sectors of industry, mining, energy and infrastructure. All the parties will adopt a joint Declaration to that end. Voluntary public and private commitments, with a review mechanism to ensure accountability, will be encouraged, to step up the implementation of biodiversity targets. Commissioner Vella will also sign the EU's joining of the Coalition of the Willing for Pollinators, as foreseen in the recent EU Initiative on Pollinators. This will help a strong, coordinated international response to the decline of pollinators. In the spirit of President Juncker's ambition for a new partnership with Africa, the EU delegation highlighted, at the preceding Africa Ministerial Biodiversity Summit, the crucial role of ecosystems and biodiversity for fighting land degradation, climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. Better resource management and nature preservation is a factor for better economic development. \</doc>

At COP24 climate talks in Poland, UK government sets world-leading ambition for first 'net-zero carbon' cluster by 2040 to cut emissions, backed by up to 170 million funding. The UK could have the worlds first net-zero carbon cluster of heavy industry by 2040, thanks to up to 170 million of new funding announced at COP24 climate talks in Poland. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry set the world-leading ambition alongside plans for at least one low-carbon cluster by 2030 at UN climate change talks ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. Using cutting-edge technologies like carbon capture and storage, the UK is aiming to become a world-leader in clean technology and services that will be needed as the world tackles climate change. The UKs low carbon economy has the potential to deliver export sales of low carbon goods and services around the world, by 2030 annual exports could be worth up to 170 billion and could support up to 2 million green collar jobs by 2030 a key part of our modern Industrial Strategy. Currently, industry accounts for around 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, with more than two-thirds of these industrial emissions coming from energy intensive industries which are often located next to each other in clusters. This new funding of up to 170 million, which is expected to be backed by industry, will help heavy industries like steel, ceramics, cement, chemicals, paper and glass to share expertise and innovative low-carbon solutions to clean up the air we breathe as we move to a greener, cleaner economy. Energy and Clean Growth?Minister?Claire Perry said: Thats why Im launching a mission to create the worlds first net-zero carbon cluster by 2040 in the UK with up to 170 million of new government funding. This will help to develop the technologies of the future to transform industry around the world, ensuring the UK seizes the global economic opportunities of moving to greener, cleaner industry a key part of our modern Industrial Strategy. By investing in world-leading innovative technology, such as carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS), climate change can be tackled alongside creating highly skilled jobs and generating export opportunities. At the end of last month, Minister Claire Perry co-hosted a global summit in Edinburgh at which she unveiled plans to enable the first UK carbon capture project from the mid-2020s. Todays announcement comes as the UK-Canada led Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) celebrates one year of success, now with over 70 members. As part of this, the UK has committed 20 million for a World Bank programme (ESMAP) to help developing countries move away from coal power and embrace renewable energy. To make a real impact on the reduction of coal power, UK government has established the Utilities Taskforce to become influential advocates for the PPCA. At international climate talks in Poland this year at COP24 , the UK and Canada will announce new members of the PPCA, committing to eradicating coal power while redirecting resources to renewables. Around 3.5 billion tons of coal are currently burnt globally for power every year, contributing to 45% of the worlds emissions. The UK government has put moving to a cleaner, greener economy at the heart of its Industrial Strategy. Through the Clean Growth Grand Challenge, the transformation in the clean energy sector has contributed to the whole of the UK cutting its emissions by more than 40% since 1990 while growing the economy by more than two-thirds the best performance on a per person basis of any G7 nation. But UK has always been clear that the move to a cleaner economy must be both public and private sector led, which is why the modern Industrial Strategy establishes clean growth as one of the greatest economic opportunities of our time with heavy industry now set to also benefit from this new clean revolution and seize the vast global economic opportunity that comes with it. Power stations are also set to benefit too from the move to a cleaner economy. To make a real impact on the reduction of coal power, UK government is working with investors to establish the Utilities Taskforce a group comprising companies which supply electricity to UK homes to become powerful and influential advocates for the alliance and encourage investors to commit funds into the thriving clean energy market instead of investing in coal projects. \</doc>

The Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, says New Zealand will put in every effort to ensure success for the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which gets underway in Katowice, Poland, tonight. Over the next two weeks in Katowice, COP24 needs to agree the guidelines that countries will use to implement the Paris Agreement, says James Shaw. The negotiations cover a complex range of inter-related issues, including how countries report their own actions, how the actions of other countries will be reviewed, and how support is provided to ensure all countries can contribute to reducing the worlds greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Our New Zealand delegations first priority will be to see agreement reached on the Paris guidelines. New Zealand is also co-hosting a series of events on sustainable agriculture and climate change, collectively called Act!on Agriculture. The events will focus on the role the agriculture sector can play in achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement. Well also be working with other countries to galvanise greater collective action through initiatives such as the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, the Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, and the High Ambition Coalition. And we will continue to advocate for our Pacific region and friends; especially given the recent warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which states that action is critical over the next 10 to 12 years to limit global temperature rise to 1.5o Celsius above pre-industrial levels, says James Shaw. Im under no illusion the sorts of questions we face in Katowice will involve some tough discussions, but COP23 in Paris three years ago showed that we can reach agreement on a common purpose when it comes to the crunch. \</doc>

Times at CLIMATE MEET The global rules agreed to at the Katowice climate conference provide the nuts and bolts for implementing the Paris Accord, providing rules that ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. At present, climate actions are being guided by Kyoto Protocol which mandates only rich nations (historical polluters) to cut their carbon emissions. It took nearly 200 countries three years to agree on procedures, guidelines and institutional mechanisms to implement the Paris deal which is meant for post-2020 climate actions by all countries with the aim of keeping average global temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius by the end of the century. Reacting to the pact, India said in a statement on Sunday,  India considers the outcome of COP24 Though the negotiators tried to cover as many points as possible during two weeks, certain contentious issues, including governance of a new  market mechanism for trading of carbon emissions, have been deferred for the next conference of parties (COP25) in 2019. The market mechanism provides flexible instruments for reducing the costs of cutting emissions, such as carbon markets. It is believed that the market mechanism will act as a key instrument in countries' mitigation measures in future.  We have worked on this (Katowice) package for three years. With 200 countries in the room it is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. But in these circumstances every single step forward is a big achievement, said the COP24 president and secretary of state in Poland's environment ministry, Michal Kurtyka. The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalise the transparency framework (reporting and verification on countries climate actions). It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries.

The private sector is key to mobilising green investment and sustainable development in Africa. Climate change presents a US$3 trillion investment opportunity in Africa by 2030. 75% of the investment is expected to come from the private sector to complement public sector financing. This calls for innovative approaches to attract and steer financial ?ows consistent with a pathway towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development. In addition to being a force for financing, the private sector in Africa is important in mitigating climate change and implementing adaptation measures. With SMEs constituting 95% of Africa's private sector - which is the continents main energy user and greenhouse gas producer - ensuring that nascent and growing SMEs are not only climate-responsible but also helping curtail climate change is fundamental. Throughout Private Sector Day at the African Pavilion during COP24 in Katowice, a number of expert panellists stressed the need to ensure private sector development and involving financial sector actors in helping leverage opportunities for Africa to leapfrog to a climate-friendly trajectory. In sessions, including Harnessing synergies between market mechanisms and climate finance in Africa and Greenpreneurs and ecoenterprises - climate resilient entrepreneurship and SME development, the need for global financial institutions to support low-carbon and climate-resilient investment schemes and enterprises was mentioned frequently; particularly the catalyst role of governments through enabling market and investment policies and mechanisms. On climate financing, the Paris Agreement established market mechanisms, including cooperative approaches and a new multilateral sustainable development mechanism in the future architecture of the climate regime. Gareth Phillips, Division Manager for Climate and Environment Finance at the African Development Bank, said: In order to achieve tangible benefits for Africa, market mechanisms should build on those elements of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) reform that have enhanced participation in Africa, and continue to advocate further improvement of rules. Building bridges between market-based approaches and climate financing institutions is crucial to allow for rapid investments into emerging mechanisms, so that the policy instruments of the Paris Agreement can evolve in a learning-by-doing approach. Louise Brown, Senior Climate Change Advisor at the African Development Bank, spoke about the Adaptation Benefit Mechanism (ABM) that the African Development Bank has been piloting. She explained: Its a results-based approach to incentivize the private sector to invest in adaptation, by creating a price signal for adaptation results. By assigning a unit of measurement and price to an adaptation result, such as dams built or climate-resilient livestock produced, we are able to price the outcomes of an adaptation project and create a mechanism where developers can go to investors and make a financial case for it. The ABM is governed and regulated through an architecture modelled on the CDM to ensure it is credible and can make the most of the legal structures that exist. Ensuring strong contributions by African negotiators and policymakers to the COP24 processes will have a critical impact on the equitable participation of African countries in the mechanisms of the Paris Agreement and ensure adequate resources around mitigation challenges. Mbaye Diagne, Member of the CDM Executive Board and Managing Director of Afrique-Energie-Environnement who was at the COP24 negotiations, said: In Africa we havent benefited from the CDM for many reasons. We werent really involved when it came to building the rules in 2001 in Marrakesh. Our concerns were not taken into account. Now under the Paris agreement its different; we werent represented on the Executive Board of CDM but now we are. If we succeed in embarking on improvements within the new market mechanism that will be for the benefit of Africa. However, he pointed out that negotiations had been difficult and that it is critical to advocate for and promote African positions and experiences through more visibility at key events like COP24 . This can support Africas efforts to contribute to shaping ongoing reforms and development of multilateral rules. Later in the discussions on the role of the private sector in being active against climate change, the importance of SMEs and entrepreneurship for a clean future for Africa was another message that rang through loud and clear. Muawia Shaddad from the Nile Basin Discourse who moderated the session on greenpreneurship set the tone when he said:: Well need 600m jobs in Africa in 2030. SMEs have a huge part to play in this, and in helping to mitigate climate change effects. Development needs to be sustainable and green so we dont become part of the problem and entrepreneurship is critical to that. From the blue economy to the green economy and agriculture, startups and growing SMEs in Africa have a responsibility to not only mitigate but to adapt to climate change. Hearing first hand from dynamic youth from Sudan, Seychelles and Canada who are leading in growing youth-led private sector development in a responsible and climate-friendly manner bought the responsibility and determination of Africa's youth in the effective implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement to the forefront. In the end, an enabling environment, the right skills and knowledge and derisking mechanisms for financial investments in green private sector development were reiterated by young entrepreneurs and Marcel Fodgo, Head of Climate Finance and Insurance at the National Climate Change Programme for the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The African Development Banks Jobs for Youth in Africa (JfYA) Strategy aims to support African countries in scaling up responses to youth unemployment and underemployment. \</doc>

All EU policies should be closely aligned with the Paris Agreements long-term goals, Parliament said on Thursday. MEPs stress that the current commitments taken by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) parties would limit global warming only to a temperature rise of about 3.2C and would not even come close to 2C, in a resolution on the COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, adopted with 239 votes to 145 and 23 abstentions. They consider that the impact of a 2C rise in global temperatures would be profound and most likely irreversible, but may be avoided by pursuing the target of 1.5C. The technological solutions needed are available and increasingly cost competitive. All EU policies should be closely aligned with the Paris Agreements long-term goals, they say. Parliament calls on all Parties, including the EU, to update their contributions by 2020 in order to close the remaining gap towards the Paris goal. Call for a 55% emission reduction by 2030 MEPs say that while the agreement reached between the Parliament and the Council to raise targets for renewables and energy efficiency will result in a reduction of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions of more than 45% by 2030, the EU should aim for a reduction of 55% by 2030. MEPs regret that in non-EU countries, the debate on increasing their contributions has only just begun. MEPs also call on the European Commission and member states to prepare contributions to reduce GHG emissions by 2020, to be presented at the pre-2020 stocktake at COP24 . Should other major economies fail to make comparable commitments, it will be necessary to maintain carbon leakage provisions, in order to ensure the global competitiveness of European industry, say MEPs. Climate finance The EUs budget should also be coherent with its international commitments, and the post-2020 long-term budget should have climate and energy targets at its heart, they say. The share of climate-related spending should be increased from 20% to 30% as soon as possible, and all remaining spending should be Paris-compliant and not counter-productive to climate efforts. The EU should also set up a dedicated and automatic EU public finance mechanism providing additional and adequate support towards the EUs fair share in the delivery of the 100 billion dollar international climate finance goal, say MEPs. \</doc>

New Delhi, Jan. 09 -- A visionary in the field of Solar Energy and the chairman of National Solar Energy Federation, Shri Pranav R Mehta, has taken over as the president of Global Solar Council (GSC) from January 1, 2019. The GSC has its headquarters in Washington D.C., USA. Highlights: Solar Man of India Pranav R Mehta continues to increase country's Clout in Solar World Chairman of NSEFI and world-renowned Shri Pranav R. Mehta took over as head of the Global Solar Council, headquartered in Washington DC from 1 January 2019. Pranav R. Mehta will be felicitated with "Solar Visionary and Influencer Award" in Abu Dhabi next week The Global Solar Council (GSC) was launched on December 6, 2015, following the historic United Nations Climate Change Conference (UN COP 21). The GSC came into being as International Coalition of more than 30 nations, utilising maximum solar energy, decided to harness the renewable energy for the greater good. Mr Mehta has been invited by over 15 countries in the last two years to share his vision and experience in India's impressive solar growth. The visionary started his solar journey way back in 2006 when India was at Zero Megawatts solar capacity and is credited with having played a catalytic and pivotal role in opinion building, emphasis and awareness about the importance of solar energy, integrating the efforts of all solar energy stakeholders including government and private sector as well as the intellectual inputs. Today, India is placed amongst the Top 5 solar players in the world and is third largest solar market. But the suave and low profile attributes the credit to the political will and leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in equal measure to solar industry players and all stakeholders including the government. "India's impressive growth would not have been complete without Prime Minister and his government's enabling policies, role of proactive bureaucracy and significant contribution of solar industry players in terms of capital investment, technology deployment, employment generation, skill development, innovative financing and above all, achieving cost reduction," opines Mr Mehta, who is well known for his work in the area of sustainable development and outgoing environmental and social concerns. Recognising his contributions to the solar sector across the world, Shri Pranav Mehta who has been keeping the Indian flag flying high in the solar arena, has been conferred with the 'Visionary Disruptor Award' by Solar Future Today, which he will be receiving on 15th January, 2019 at the sidelines of World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi. Speaking about GSC's future plans, Mr Mehta stated, "My heart goes out to the energy have-nots. Moreover, solar energy has a vast potential for poverty alleviation. We at Global Solar Council will thus strive to achieve not only growth but spread of solar energy globally and reach out to those who have no access to energy. To this end we will - together with and in consultation with ISA, IRENA, World Governments and like-minded positive organizations - strive to achieve 1.0 Trillion Mini Grids ensuring decentralized energy, 1.0 Trillion Solar Homes, and 10.0 million jobs by 2030. Of course, we will aim at 1.0 million of each of the above items and then scale it up deploying new storage and other technologies." \</doc>

BERLIN, Dec. 6 -- The Renewables Academy AG (RENAC), an international training provider for green energy technologies, announces the start of the scholarship application phase for one of the trainings under its 18-month programme "Green Banking MENA - Capacity Building on Green Energy and Climate Finance". The programme comprises a total of three training courses, a Train-the-Trainer seminar, an Applying Green Energy Finance Programme and an Online Training. The main objective of the programme is to sustainably improve capacity for renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) financing options in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The agreement signed in Paris during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) is proof of the key role renewable energy and energy efficiency play in international climate change mitigation efforts. While green markets keep gaining momentum, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia enjoy the necessary natural resources for widespread implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Local professionals with the appropriate know-how will be able to profit from new business opportunities in a growing industry, which additionally presents manifold benefits (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy security and job creation, among many others). Currently, RE and EE projects face substantial blocks to external financing from banks, which is usually characterized by high interest rates. The trainings are intended to tackle these circumstances. Through the "Green Banking MENA" programme, professionals from private and public financial institutions involved or interested in financing green energy projects will gain specific knowledge in technologies, financial schemes, risk evaluation, mitigation measures and international climate finance options. Interested professionals from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia can apply here until 15 January 2019 for the first part of the scholarship programme, the Train-the-Trainer seminar at RENAC's Training Centre in Berlin, Germany. "Green Banking MENA" is a scholarship programme as part of the project DIAPOL-CE - Policy dialogue and knowledge management on low emissions development strategies in the MENA region. DIAPOL-CE is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) within the German International Climate Initiative (IKI) and implemented by GIZ. Since 2015, RENAC's award-winning Green Banking programme has been successfully implemented in South-East Asia and is now being transferred to other regions, such as MENA. To ensure that the content of the programme meets local requirements, capacity needs assessment trips took place in winter 2017 in cooperation with the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE). "The Green Banking Train-the-Trainer seminar is a great opportunity to learn from one of the world's top renewable energy countries as well as obtain efficient didactical methods", said Nguyen Thi Cam Tu of Vietnam Public Joint Stock Commercial Bank, who participated in the scholarship programme in Vietnam.

Katowice (Poland), Dec 9 -- The US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait have blocked the other 193 assembled countries in this Polish city from "welcoming" the recent IPCC report, even though the report had been requested by the earlier UN climate summit in Paris in 2015 The US had even rejected the science itself, standing alone among all the world's countries in refusing to endorse the findings of the report. Reacting to this development, Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, said: "Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and especially the United States are rogue nations. "These four major fossil fuel producers are working together against the interests of the rest of the world and jeopardising the chances of a safe climate. "They show disregard for the wellbeing of the most vulnerable people on the planet. Climate change even threatens the future of their own people and yet they act to suppress scientific warnings. "I had hoped that Saudi Arabia was undergoing reform and this was their chance to demonstrate it. But they have shown they don't care about human rights, people or the planet." These nations are climate villains and they must be opposed by the rest of the world, instead, they have found a steadfast ally and co-conspirator in the world's most powerful country, the US, he said. Regarding the US pro-coal side event taking place on Monday at the ongoing UN climate summit, known as COP24 , he added: "With great power comes great responsibility, and yet the US has failed to take this responsibility seriously. President Trump's actions threaten the lives of many of the poorest people around the world. "The scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) have shown that coal is the cause of our climate crisis and needs to be left in the ground, not touted at meetings designed to solve the suffering it has caused. The fact President Trump's America is holding a pro-coal event at the climate summit underlines his utter ignorance and recklessness," he added.

New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- In 2015, when over 190 countries came together in Paris to make a joint declaration against climate change, the mood was buoyant and upbeat. As a similar global platform gathers in Poland to iron out a "rule book" to implement the Paris framework, the global mood could not be more different. The exit of the US from the Paris Agreement; a slew of recent studies which bring the window of irretrievable planetary change much closer (to 2040); and the glacial pace in effecting substantial carbon emission cuts have cast a pall of gloom. The world has already warmed by 1&#38;deg;C since pre-industrial levels, and is likely to reach 1.5&#38;deg;C between 2030 and 2052, in a business-as-usual scenario. That is the level at which significant climate impacts begin to hit large swaths of humanity, particularly climate-vulnerable countries such as India, Bangladesh and the Maldives. A recent review by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, a wing of the agriculture ministry, predicts that crops, plantations and livestock in 151 districts (one-fifth of India's districts) are susceptible to the impact of climate change. It is little wonder then that India, and even China, want to set and meet "bold and ambitious targets" under a global agreement, despite the non-participation of the US, which is the world's second-largest carbon emitter. India's self-declared national target is to achieve 40% electric power generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and reduce the emission intensity of its gross domestic product by 33-35% from the 2005 level. In the inaugural session of COP24 in Katowice, Poland, India reaffirmed that it is on track to meet these targets. The country has also installed 72GW of renewable energy capacity. The massive push towards renewable energy is a result of India's leading role in promoting the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which pledged to generate 1,000GW of solar power capacity by 2030. At Katowice, India's main theme would remain-One World One Sun One Grid. But even as India strives to meet its goals, the bigger challenge remains the lack of consensus on climate action among the developing and developed countries. In November, India held two meetings with like-minded developing countries to collectively make a big issue of technology transfer and climate funding from the developed world "so that we don't have a situation where they don't deliver". While the issue of climate funding dates back to Cancun in 2010-when rich nations first made a commitment to create a green corpus in order to help countries like India purchase new technology-there has been little money to show eight years down the line. For India to meet its national targets, and for global human-caused CO2 emissions to reach "net zero" by 2050, advanced technology to capture carbon has to be more widely available. While the Paris Agreement requires that developed countries "shall provide financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation", there is a continuing lack of clarity on the release of these funds and the modalities regarding its accountability and use. COP24 is also significant as it is expected to finalize guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2016. The rulebook negotiations would be central to the Katowice conference, in the background of differences prevailing between developing and developed countries over its contents. The contention of developed countries is that the Paris accord makes them "liable" for climate change impacts, which is why they are reluctant to commit to specific emission targets. With this ambivalent stance, the developed countries could risk sending the signal that they do not want to help the developing countries in fulfilling their commitments. In a recent report, the United Nations highlighted that people exposed to natural hazards in the poorest nations are seven times more likely to die than a similar person in the richest nations. The "protection gap" between the rich and the poor is evidently wide enough. Thus, the need of the hour is to strike a balance between the adaptation and mitigation, but in a manner that it does not put any additional burden on developing economies. COP24 should be able to frame guidelines, which are pragmatic and gives due consideration to the challenges and priorities of developing countries-their vulnerabilities and challenges, including poverty, food security, energy access, and public-health. India has already made it evident that the goals set in the Paris Agreement are non-negotiable. If the world wants to save the poor and vulnerable who account for more than half of the world's population, the global temperature rise has to be curtailed at 1.5 &#38;deg;C. The next 15 years are critical for action on climate change and any delay would only render it impossible to limit the level of planetary warming to even 2&#38;deg;C. Absolute economic losses might be concentrated in high-income countries, but the human costs of disasters would fall on low and lower middle-income countries. And then, it might just be too late even if the world wants to come together to work towards a fix. We must act together, now and quickly. Will COP24 be able to finalize guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2016?

This years UN Climate Summit ( COP24 ) has come and gone. For the over 20,000 partiticpants who made the journey to Katowice, Poland for the summit, COP24 was mostly about getting global attention for the climate change issues in their respective jurisdictions. For delegates from Africa, the summit was more than a show-shop: COP24 was an opportunity for the continent to recalibrate its climate change aspirations and credentials. The central role that transport and cities play in the continents movement towards low carbon development was the theme of several events hosted by the African Development Bank in Katowice. The discussions highlighted and explored important issues and avenues for collaboration between public, private and civil society organisations to mainstream resilience in the continents urban development. Africas is becoming increasingly urbanized. Already with the highest urbanization rate on the planet, the continent urbanization rate is projected to accelerate in the coming decades, with the current 1.1 billion population doubling over the next 30 years. More than 80% of the increase will occur in cities. These projections have dire implications for already vulnerable populations impacted by lack of access to safe drinking water, healthy and hygienic living conditions and climate hazards. Adequate mechanisms therefore need to be put in place to mitigate the negative fallouts of urban growth. Giving the opening remarks at the session held in the African Development Bank Pavilion and themed Resilient pathways for sustainable urban development in Africa, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Senior Director for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice at the World Bank observed that some of the largest cities in Africa grow as fast as 4 percent annually, and that these cities face diverse challenges. Inadequate city planning, inefficient land use, and poor regulatory systems have created an unsustainable model of urban growth that has resulted in unmanaged sprawling, fragmented and hyper-informal cities and all forms of pollution. This scenario usually takes a toll on forests and other natural ecosystems. He further remarked that Africas rapid urbanization was placing increasing pressure on urban populations, natural resources and the environment, hence many African cities have realized the importance of sustainable development, economic prosperity, and quality of life for their urban populations. Thats really why we are here to share experiences and learn from each other Ijjasz-Vasquez reckons that alliances and collaboration will help tackle and resolve these challenges. One key example of an initiative established through collaborative effort and which also became operational in 2017 is the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC), launched by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to bring global environmental benefits to cities. The GPSC promotes sustainable urban development through three pillars, namely, sustainability indicators and tools; integrated urban planning solutions; and municipal finance. These objectives are achieved through knowledge sharing, capacity development, and connecting partners, and supporting the 28 cities in 11 countries are a range of implementing agencies, knowledge partners, and investment partners. Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank remarked that, The potential consequences of climate change such as the rise in sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns will increasingly strain the capacities of Africas urban systems and heighten their vulnerability. Africas foremost development finance institution is in the driving seat of the national, regional and continental efforts to stem the effect of climate change on the continent, ensuring a developmental path that is sustainable and resilient to various shocks while ensuring the highest possible quality of life for current and future citizens in Africa. Urban environments are expanding rapidly across Africa, for example in places like Egypt and along the coast of West Africa. Placing our attention on resilient urban planning, we can ensure we will reach the UN 2030 development goals, we can ensure an inclusive, resilient and sustainable urban environment. And we can improve our resilience to climate changes, Nyong said. The session also explored possible avenues for collaboration between various development and private sector partners to mainstream resilience in urban development on the continent. With an estimated 13 African cities that will surpass New York City in population over the next 80 years, it is critical for the continent to identify and implement sustainable models of urban growth. \</doc>

Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each countrys natural resources. hundreds of thousands of people will get electricity for the first time thanks to UK government funding announced at COP24 in Poland 100 million extra funding to the Renewable Energy Performance Platform will support up to 40 new renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa projects funded by the new investment could help cut carbon emissions equivalent to those created by 800,000 cars a year Hundreds of thousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa will get access to electricity for the first time thanks to an extra 100 million of funding from the UK government. The new investment triples funds for the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP), to support up to 40 more renewable energy projects over the next 5 years. The new funding could unlock an extra 156 million of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023. Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each countrys natural resources, and the electricity generated is expected to provide 2.4 million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. Power produced from new projects funded is expected to save around 3 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime, compared with fossil fuel generation the equivalent to the emissions from burning 21,000 railway cars of coal or from 800,000 cars in a year. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: This 100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies. The new investment is in addition to 48 million previously committed to the REPP. The programme is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5 million people over the project lifetimes, creating 8,000 jobs during development and operation. Expected results from some of the 18 projects already receiving support from REPP are: hydropower from the Nzoia River in Kenya, providing 290,000 people with energy and creating 330 jobs mini grids in Nigeria which will provide 72 rural villages with pay-as-you-go clean, reliable energy, creating 2,500 jobs during construction and 430 when its up and running biomass plants in Ebolowa and Edea, Cameroon, providing enough clean energy for 520,000 people in a rural area creating 460 jobs solar power to provide electricity for 87,600 people and business in Burundi, creating 300 part-time jobs and 50-full times posts a hydropower plant creating enough power for more than 90,000 people for the first time in a remote part of Tanzania, creating 80 jobs in total The funding is part of the UKs commitment to invest 5.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020 to encourage ambitious action from other governments, the private sector and communities in the global effort to tackle climate change. To date, UK climate finance has: supported 47 million people cope with the effects of climate change provided 17 million people with improved access to clean energy At COP24 15.6 million to help countries vulnerable to climate change have a voice in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations 771,000 to help developing countries take part in COP24 an additional 45 million to the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) Facility, co-founded by the UK, to help reduce emissions within an economic sector an additional 1 million for the Global Innovation Lab, which helps innovative climate finance proposals move more quickly to implementation and attract funding. \</doc>

Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen has invited European heads of state to sign a joint appeal to the international community in the run-up to COP24 . The World Climate Change Conference in Poland therefore bears a special responsibility. The statement calls on the international community, especially against the background of the recent alarming report by the IPCC, to revise its climate targets in order to respond effectively to the climate crisis. The statement concludes with an emotional appeal to do everything in common, swiftly and decisively to stop the worst effects of the climate crisis, seize the multiple opportunities for a bright future, and leave a livable world for future generations. At the invitation of the Polish President, Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen will participate together with numerous colleagues at the opening of the World Climate Change Conference in Katowice on 3 December and open the state of Austrian foreign trade at COP24 on 4 December. It presents projects of Austrian companies that are exemplary in terms of climate protection technology. Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen emphasizes the urgency of the success of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference: "The international community is called upon to make swift, determined and joint efforts to initiate effective measures against global warming before it is too late. The World Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland in December 2018 is the most important international round of climate negotiations since the agreement on the Paris Agreement in 2015 and crucial for our future. " The Federal President will present the initiative in a few days, in time for the start of the World Climate Change Conference. There are still discussions with possible supporters, the interest is high. \</doc>

New Delhi, July 25 -- The Global Climate Action Summit, taking place in September in San Francisco, has announced inclusion of China's Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs Xie Zhenhua as its fifth Co-Chair. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd Chairman Anand Mahindra is among the panel of summit Co-Chairs An announcement in this regard was made in San Francisco on Tuesday. Xie joined an existing four-member panel of summit Co-Chairs that comprise Governor of California Edmund G. Brown Jr., UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael R. Bloomberg and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. The Global Climate Action Summit, taking place from September 12-14, will bring leaders and people together from around the world to "take ambition to the next level". It will be a moment to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of states, regions, cities, companies, investors and citizens with respect to climate action, a statement by the summit organisers said. Minister Xie has for many years represented the Chinese government with distinction at both the national and international level, including as China's chief negotiator for the landmark 2015 Climate Change Agreement (COP21). "All the Parties are devoting efforts to the completion of the negotiation on the Paris Agreement Work Programme at Katowice ( COP24 ), in order to lay the firm foundation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions," Xie said. "During this important period, the summit will help to mobilize the national, sub-national, business, and society actors to demonstrate their actions and determinations, which will not only advance the global climate governance process, but also push the global green and low-carbon transformations," Xie added. The summit also serves as a launchpad for faster and deeper worldwide commitments and accelerated action from countries, supported by all sectors of society, that can put the globe on track to prevent dangerous climate change and realize the historic Paris Agreement. Further, the summit will pave the way for leaders, including heads of state and ministers, to announce more ambitious national climate plans at the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Week in New York, COP24 in Poland and the UN Secretary-General's Climate Leaders' Summit in September 2019. --IANS vg/qd/sed \</doc>

India, Dec. 3 -- Nations most threatened by rising sea levels and devastating droughts will use a UN summit in Poland on Monday to urge richer countries to pay their fair share in the climate change fight. The presidents of at-risk states such as Honduras, Nigeria and Bangladesh are expected at COP24 talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. But host Poland - heavily reliant on energy from coal - will push its own agenda: a "just transition" from fossil fuels that critics say could allow it to continue polluting for decades. The Paris deal saw nations agree to limit global temperature rises to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and under 1.5C if possible. Delegates from nearly 200 countries now have two weeks of negotiations to finalise how those goals work in practice, even as science suggests the pace of climate change is rapidly outstripping mankind's response. One of the key disputes is finance. Under Paris, richer nations - responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions - are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access to make their economies greener. But US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord has dented trust among vulnerable nations, who fear there is not enough cash available to help them adapt to our heating planet. The World Bank on Monday announced $200 billion (175 billion euros) in climate action investment for 2021-25 -- a major shot in the arm for green initiatives but one which needs bolstering by state-provided funding.

Lucknow, June 6 -- "Single use plastic is bad for the planet and must be banned without worrying about its replacement,"said Grammy award winning Indo-American music composer Ricky Kej on Tuesday, the World Environment Day. Kej was speaking at the 22nd Dr CR Krishnamurti Memorial Oration organised at the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) Lucknow. "We overthink about what we will use to replace the plastic in our lives and procrastinate over banning plastic," Kej said. Beating plastic pollution is the United Nation's theme for this year with the tagline 'If you can't reuse it, refuse it'. Kej's album 'Shanti Samsara' won the Grammy in 2015. His album was inaugurated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which put the spotlight on him. "Music, for me, is a global language, which can be used to convey a message across the world," Kej said. The musician, who is also an adjunct professor at the prestigious National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore, has been using music to spread awareness about environment conservation. He is also among the few celebrities who have spoken about the possible submerging of island nations. At the IITR event, Kej spoke about his journey to Kiribati, a south Pacific island, which is on the verge of getting submerged in the ocean due to rising water level caused by global warming. "The basic elements of nature, especially water and air, are not bound by any territory. So, if air or a water body is being polluted somewhere, it is eventually going to impact the entire world. It's a common problem at the end of the day. We must understand this and join hands to stop pollution," Kej said to an intrigued audience at the packed IITR auditorium. "What's happening in Kiribati is going to repeat in other places too unless we all come together and prevent global warming," he added. In his hour-long oration, Kej also focused on the issue of coexistence. "We think of coexistence as something between people. It is time we broadened our horizon and included other species that we share our planet with," he said, adding that animals were truly the first citizens of any country, as they existed much before the arrival of humans. Director IITR Alok Dhawan also stressed on the need to reduce the use of plastic in one's day-to-day life. MUSICAL SYLLABUS ON ENVIRONMENT The renowned music composer is working on developing a musical syllabus, especially for young school-going children, with the aim of generating greater awareness on environment preservation. "People never forget the songs that they learn in their childhood. I am developing a music curriculum about environment for young people," Kej said when asked about his upcoming projects. CLIMATE REFUGEES While speaking about the island nation of Kiribati, Ricky said that the younger generation of the country was facing a looming crisis of becoming climate refugees. "The young generation of Kiribati is being forced to migrate to other nations, as their country is getting submerged in the sea. This forced migration will make these young people the first climate refugees," said Kej. Reportedly, the Kiribati government has started a programme to train youngsters in various services, as it would enable them to get jobs in places they migrate to.

Bonn, May 10 -- A United Nations top official said a lot of progress has been made on technical issues at the climate change talks that concluded here on Thursday but a lot of work still has to be done ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland in December "We have had a satisfactory meeting, but we need to be clear that we have a lot of work in the months ahead and we need to increase the pace of work to achieve a good outcome at COP24 in Katowice," UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa told reporters here. Climate negotiators from nearly 200 countries, including India, gathered in this German town, headquarters of the UNFCCC, for a two-week meeting to discuss the implementation of the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement and how to step up action. At the crucial inter-sessional talks, said an expert, progress was made on a number of technical issues, which include the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement, and to prepare the ground for the governments to commit to raise the ambition of their climate pledges by 2020. The Paris Agreement's central aim is to keep the global average temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The talks made progress on the rulebook, especially on common rules for the global stock-taking, the five-year review of countries' climate efforts that will trigger increased ambition, a negotiator told IANS, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Coming as a positive surprise to many observers the parties agreed late Wednesday to give co-chairs the mandate to reconcile their positions in a text that will serve as a common basis for the next round of negotiations in Bangkok in September. "Still, more work on key issues is needed to stay on track to meet the deadline," he added. Negotiators say the talks edged slightly closer to completing the Paris Agreement Work Programme, including guidelines on how to put the agreement into practice, despite rich countries persistently blocking progress on key issues like finance. Without advances in the talks over the commitment of future financial support from rich countries to developing nations, who are already facing devastating climate impacts, it became difficult for other areas of the negotiations to progress. Harjeet Singh of ActionAid International said: "The issue of finance underpins so many different parts of climate negotiations, because poor countries simply can't cover the triple costs of loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation on their own." "But with developed countries refusing to move on finance, lots of pieces are still unfinished." Speaking of a growing trust deficit in the talks, Christian Aid's Mohamed Adow said: "The silence over money has sown fears among poor countries that their wealthier counterparts are not serious about honouring their promises." But an optimistic Senior Policy Advisor Climate Diplomacy and Risk Camilla Born said: "Negotiations went better than expected. Parties showed they are serious about delivering the Paris Agreement so in Bonn they got down to serious business." "The next challenge is to mobilise the political will to get the COP24 outcomes over the line in Katowice." World Resources Institute Global Director of Climate Programme Paula Caballero said that the negotiators kept up a good pace this week, but will be leaving Bonn with a lot more ground to cover to get to the finish line in Poland this December. "At the next negotiation session in Bangkok delegates will need to maintain that same focused approach to turn the corner on the politics and policy." Talks will resume in Bangkok from September 3-8 where negotiators will pick up "informal notes" forwarded by this session. --IANS vg/tsb/bg \</doc>

President Dalia Grybauskait? is traveling for working visit to Poland at the invitation of President Andrzej Duda. Dalia Grybauskait? will attend the UN Climate Change Conference COP24 in Katowice. The key objective of the meeting is to adopt the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement. In addition, COP24 will call on all countries to enact responsible and adequate measures across all economic sectors, to strengthen dialogue and cooperation, and to step up support to developing countries. If no immediate action is taken, climate change could have devastating consequences for the planet. Global warming leads to expanding deserts, reduced areas of arable land, diminishing water bodies, and more frequent extreme weather events. This can become an incentive for military conflicts and migration. On October 8, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a special report, which specifies that the temperature has already increased by 1C above pre-industrial levels. Climate change affects ecosystems, species and weather. An overshoot of 2C in global warming would result in irreversible changes, including long-lasting droughts, torrential rains and temperature swings. Climate change is felt in Lithuania, too. Over the past 50 years, the average temperature has increased by 1.2C. The number of days with heat reaching 30C has gone up by 3-4 times, and the Baltic Sea level in the Klaip?da Strait rose by 15 centimeters. More frequent weather and climate extremes have a negative impact on health, infrastructure and the economy. The infrastructure may become unable to operate due to excessive fallouts. Extreme weather, such as torrential rains and prolonged droughts, caused the Lithuanian agricultural sector to lose hundreds of millions in 2017 and 2018. At the Global Climate Change Conference held in Paris three years ago, Lithuania like all EU countries took on the commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions at least by 40 percent by 2030. EU member states will have to submit their long-term national strategies on greenhouse gas emissions before 1 January 2020 which will govern their actions after 2030. Lithuania is making good progress in fighting climate change. According to the President, Lithuania has demonstrated that economic development and environmental preservation can be successfully balanced. After regaining independence, Lithuania has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by almost 60 percent, while its GDP went up by 30 percent. Lithuania exceeded its 26 percent target in renewables back in 2016. Ambitious climate change mitigation targets are good for Lithuania because they strengthen national energy security, diminish dependence on fossil fuels and promote innovative technologies. \</doc>

NEW DELHI, Dec. 9 -- Global negotiations under way in Katowice, Poland, to evolve a rulebook for enforcing the 2015 Paris agreement to curb climate change have made little headway a week into their fortnight's duration amid persisting differences over key issues such as climate finance. Delegates to COP24 The draft deals with issues such as periodic reporting of action being taken by the 195 signatories to the accord in meeting the so-called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) they had committed to, how much finance will flow in from developed to developing countries to mitigate the effects of climate change and in what form (bilateral or multilateral loans or grants). Negotiators in the Polish city are talking about rich countries taking the lead in implementing the agreement and the less well-off taking action in accordance with their capacities. Government officials and representatives of non-government organisations at COP24 said progress has been slow and major disagreements persist on key issues. 'The process is still evolving. On every section of the agreement document, there are disagreements. Differentiation and climate finance are major sore points which will have to be resolved," said Ravi Shankar Prasad, joint secretary in the Union environment ministry. Environment secretary CK Mishra, who returned last week from the negotiations, said: "There is good momentum. We are not sure yet if the outcome will be optimum." Developed countries were to contribute an annual $100 million to developing nations to mitigate the effects of climate change under the Paris agreement. Developed countries are not spending enough to mitigate the impact of climate change, the Indian ministry of finance submitted at COP24 . In a paper titled '3 Essential "S"s of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection' released on the sidelines of the conference, the ministry questioned climate finance values being reported by developed countries as having been transferred by them to developing countries. The ministry quoted a recently released report of the standing committee on finance by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which assessed the total climate finance flows based on the biennial assessment reports of developed countries. The total climate-specific finance flows from Annex II Parties (which include the US, Australia and European Union) in 2016, according to this report, amounted to only around $ 38 billion which is less than 40% of the $100 billion target of climate finance. "Progress ( COP24 The negotiations will continue for another week until December 14. Ministers of the negotiating countries will meet next week to iron out the differences. In the first week of the Katowice conference, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) briefed delegates about the consequences of not meeting their climate goals and the urgency for enhancing the goals to prevent global warming of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An IPCC report in October, titled 'Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees', warned that the Earth will face devastating consequences of climate change if the world fails to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius of preindustrial levels. The UN 1.5-de"The gree report also warned that India will be one of the worst affected by heat stress resulting from climate change. Crops, plantations, even livestock in 151 districts, or slightly more than one-fifth of the total districts in India, are susceptible to the impact of climate change, according to an annual review by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), a wing of the agriculture ministry. "It is notable that the first week started off with the long shadow of IPCC which stressed the urgency of climate action. A few parties also called for 1.5 degrees to be the official goal of the Paris agreement. That said, there are still many issues like transparency for reporting on finance by developed countries, allowing for differentiation in many sections which are crucial and have to be addressed in the next week when the high-level segment begins," said Aarti Khosla of Climate Trends, a research and communications organisation. Climate scientists are hoping thatnegotiators taketheirwarnings seriously. "At the climate negotiations, it is always the case that nothing is agreed upon in the first week," said NH Ravindranath, a climate scientist from Indian Institute of Science (IISc). "In the second week, towards the end, things start improving. In all paragraphs being negotiated on, there will be some bracketed parts that are later decided. Monitoring, reporting and verification of how countries are acting against climate change is among the many contentious issues. But I am hopeful that there will be something to look forward to at the end of next week." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, will introduce British Columbias CleanBC plan to global climate change leaders, as part of discussions at the United Nations COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland. Our message for the international audience at COP24 is that sub-national governments like B.C. can be difference-makers in the fight against climate change, Heyman said. Were there to listen to ideas and to share how our plan puts our province on the path to a cleaner, better future - with a low-carbon economy that creates opportunities for all. From Dec. 10-13, 2018, Heyman will participate in a number of panels with international government and private-sector leaders, as well as provide keynote addresses on carbon pricing and sustainable transport policy. The conference is an opportunity to connect with world leaders and share what is being done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home, as well as to learn what other nations and sub-national governments are doing to combat one of the greatest challenges facing the planet. Quick Facts: Highlights of the CleanBC plan include: By 2040, every new car sold in B.C. will be a zero-emission vehicle. Government is helping people afford cleaner cars and save money on fuel with incentive programs, and making it easier to charge or fuel them. The Province is speeding up the switch to cleaner fuels at the gas pump with further reductions to the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. Every new building constructed in B.C. will be net-zero energy ready by 2032, meaning they will be so energy efficient they will be able to produce their own power. Along the way, government will require new buildings to become progressively more efficient through changes to the building code, and by ramping up funding for renovations and energy retrofits to existing homes and offices, including $400 million to support retrofits and upgrades for B.C.s stock of publicly funded housing. Government is helping B.C. to reduce residential and industrial organic waste, turning it into a clean resource. The Province is helping industry lower its emissions and reduce its pollution by reinvesting some of the carbon tax paid by industry in technologies that reduce their emissions. \</doc>

Following last months COP24 UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, Airports Council International provided an update on the latest developments among the community of 259 airports currently in the global carbon management standard, Airport Carbon Accreditation. Niclas Svenningsen, who heads the Climate Neutral Now initiative at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat in Bonn, Germany commented Following the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report and COP24 , the need to address the escalating threat of Climate change is ever more urgent that means all hands on deck. This isnt a time for cynicism it is a time for raising awareness and driving collaborative action. The airport industrys work through the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme is an example of global private sector engagement in climate action now with 259 airports on board. 167 of those are actively reducing their emissions, 102 of them have also engaged others on the airport site to get involved and 49 are running carbon neutral airport operations. I invite people to find out more about their local airports involvement and ambitions mobility is a fundamental part of life, so lets try to make it as efficient & ecological as possible. The latest airport operator to become carbon neutral is Aeroporto di Napoli in Italy. After gradually making its way through the different levels of Airport Carbon Accreditation, demonstrating the CO2 reduction it has made on-site and the engagement of aviation partners, it has invested in Gold Standard offsets to address its remaining residual emissions. Armando Brunini, CEO of Aeroporto di Napoli said Running an airport is a complex business there are lots of stakeholders and many collaborations and partnerships that need to be fostered and maintained, if real efficiency gains are to be achieved. Our journey to this moment from initially mapping our carbon emission sources, to reducing our emissions, engaging other companies on the airport site to get involved and now becoming carbon neutral have benefited from the framework, guidance and rigour of the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. We in the airport business compete with each other on so many fronts: attracting airlines to set up new routes, attracting passengers, being the first to embrace the latest innovation and more. With Climate change now an urgent priority, its only fitting that we should seek to exceed expectations on this too as a way of motivating even more climate action within the airport industry and the wider air transport sector. With four different levels of accreditation covering all stages of carbon management (Mapping, Reduction, Optimisation and Neutrality), Airport Carbon Accreditation is independently administered, institutionally-endorsed and has the support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Commission (EC). \</doc>

In order to finalize the rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement by the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December this year, an additional negotiating session will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from August 31 to September 9. At the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP22, November 2016) held after the Paris Agreement entered into force (November 4, 2016), the Parties decided to develop the rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement by 2018. A delegation of the Republic of Korea to the meeting will be led by Ambassador for Climate Change Yoo Yeon-chul, and composed of officials from relevant government agencies and experts. Officials from seven government agencies -- the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Ministry of Justice, and the Korea Forest Service -- and experts from research institutes The meeting will consist of the 6th part of the 1st session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-6), the 2nd part of the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 48.2), and the 2nd part of the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48.2). Prior to the additional negotiating session, pre-sessional meetings and an APA round table will take place. The additional negotiating session will be the last official negotiating session before the COP24 in December this year. In the session, the Parties are expected to focus their discussions on technical issues to make progress in negotiations. They will discuss how to devise specific guidelines for implementing the Paris Agreement after 2020, including on mitigation, market, adaptation, technology development and transfer, finance, transparency, the global stocktake, and the implementation and compliance mechanism. The delegation of the ROK government will work to make constructive contributions to the international communitys efforts to develop the rulebook for the Paris Agreement in cooperation with major negotiation groups, including the Environment Integrity Group (EIG), and other countries. The Environment Integrity Group is a climate change negotiation group consisting of six countries -- ROK, Switzerland, Mexico, Monaco, Liechtenstein, and Georgia. The ROK delegation will exert active efforts to make sure that all Parties can take more ambitious climate action, considering their capabilities and conditions. The delegation will also ask for the Parties interest and cooperation for the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C to be adopted at the 48th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Songdo in October this year. \</doc>

Identifying terrorism, radicalism and financial frauds as the major threats to the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged BRICS nations to join forces against the menace of black money. "Terrorism and radicalism are a threat to the world, those who commit financial crimes are also a big threat. We have to work together against black money," PM Modi was quoted as saying by ANI. He was participating in the BRICS leaders' informal meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Argentina's Buenos Aires. The prime minister also underlined that BRICS nations have to talk in one voice for the interest of developing nations in the United Nations and other multilateral organisations. "This is the reason we have come together for BRICS," Modi told his fellow BRICS nations. He also reaffirmed India's commitment to globalisation and reformed multilateralism. BRICS as an engine of global growth. In his first of the many engagements today, PM @narendramodi participated at #BRICS Leaders' Informal Meeting on the margins of #G20Summit.

Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the main topic of Prime Minister Modi's discussion with the UN chief was the forthcoming COP24 climate change meeting in Katowice, Poland from December 3. "The Secretary-General has said India plays a major role in climate change negotiations. He acknowledged that Prime Minister had taken a number of concrete steps towards addressing climate change," Gokhale said. "He mentioned the International Solar Alliance. The Secretary-General also said that when he was in Delhi last month he had seen for himself the manner in which other campaigns the prime minister had led including the Swachh Bharat campaign having an impact on the environment," he said. Modi had also met with Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Summit. During their meeting, the two leaders discussed ways to boost economic, cultural and energy ties, besides ways to enhance investment in technology, renewable energy and food security. Taking to Twitter, PM Modi said, "Had a fruitful interaction with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.

NEW DELHI: Government representatives from over 190 countries, including India, will meet in Bonn, Germany for next round of UN climate change negotiations, beginning Monday, to develop guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement post-2020. The platform at Bonn during April 30-May 10 conference will also give developing countries a chance to press the rich nations for actions during the pre-2020 period amid several scientific reports that the overall promises of climate action, made by nations together in Paris, will not be enough to save the world from disastrous consequences of global warming.Though the guidelines to operationalise the Paris Agreement will be finalised at the UN climate conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland later this year, discussions at Bonn will aim to find solutions to how countries can increase their ambition now and in the next round of their national climate action plans, officially termed 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs).The guidelines will be a kind of operating manual, enlisting practical actions to realise the Agreement's goals. Its finalisation is necessary to assess whether the world is on track to achieve the Agreement's goals to limit the average global temperature rise to well below 2\\xB0C by the end of the century, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\\xB0C."To reach success at COP24 , it is essential that nations begin working towards draft negotiating texts at the May meeting. This will provide a solid foundation for work in the second half of 2018 and help them to deliver a strong result," said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, in a statement.It is learnt that the developing countries, including India and China, will ask the rich nations - historical polluters - during the 11-day conference to spell out how they can can scale up their climate ambition and implementation in the pre-2020 period. They will also question the developed countries on status of their promise to mobilise USD 100 billion per year to help developing countries take mitigation and adaptation measures to fight climate change. Concerned about the need to accelerate action, Espinosa said, "I strongly urge developed countries to make progress towards mobilizing the USD 100 billion that they have pledged to provide per year by 2020. Many developing countries desperately need this support in order to make their contribution to climate action." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

India, in its latest submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has claimed that the rate of carbon sequestration in its forests and croplands jumped by 50 per cent between 2010 and 2014. With dismal stories of rampant deforestation being more common, the news of carbon being sequestered and its rate increasing seemed too good to be true. And, indeed, the UNFCCC has asked India to re-check its submission on forest carbon and forest cover and share more details regarding the sources. What gives? The government defines forests as simply an area with more than 10 per cent tree canopy cover, whether in its internal biennial State of Forest reports, or in its report to the UNFCCC. Their estimate of 'forest cover' includes horticultural plantations of coffee, tea, rubber, cashew, coconut, or areca nut, and farm forestry plantations of eucalyptus, casuarina and poplar, along with single-species plantations of teak, pine or eucalyptus present on public lands. Environmentalists have long complained about this. We monitor forests because we want to conserve them, not just for the carbon they sequester, but also for the biodiversity they offer, their hydrological benefits and the multiple products (firewood, fodder, medicinal plants, bamboo) they provide to local communities. These benefits are generally far lower in horticultural or silvicultural plantations than in natural or semi-natural, multi-species forest. Only carbon sequestration rates and timber productivity are possibly higher in plantations. Mapping and tracking the area of natural forests separately can prevent countries from meeting their carbon sequestration targets at the cost of these benefits. This was agreed upon in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2010 in Canc\'c3\'ban. India's claim that this separation is difficult is simply untenable in today's age of multi-season, high-resolution satellite imagery. The forest departments prefer this lumping so that it hides their continued focus on plantations in afforestation programmes. The UNFCCC pointed out the opacity in India's estimates and thereby its unreliability. For instance, the jump in sequestration rates reported in the Second Biennial Update Report of 2018 (not yet made public) hides the fact that sequestration rates in forests show a decline, whereas those in croplands show a dramatic (and unlikely) increase. This opacity also points to the heart of the problem: the whole system is manned by foresters themselves and controlled by the ministry. The maps, the ground truth, the sample plot locations and the data sets, on which forest carbon estimates are based are not in the public domain. There is no credible, independent process involving scientists and citizens. The government prefers to mix categories and fudge estimates because it hopes to 'sell' this 'forest carbon' to offset the emissions of rich countries. Policy-makers are blinded by this supposed market for forest carbon offsets, and forest departments are happy to tag along for the funds it might bring in. But, forests are not meant to serve some singular national goal. They provide diverse benefits to multiple stakeholders, like the 250 million forest-dependent people of India. These communities are slowly asserting their historic rights, using the Forest Rights Act, 2006. A carbon-centric forest policy will hurt these communities, as well as the biodiversity. Recognising multiple stakes and stakeholders will enable us to devise multi-dimensional and robust systems of monitoring and reporting all forest benefits in ways that will have both international credibility as well as local legitimacy. Enabling local communities to decide priorities in areas they use, and supporting them with carbon and other funds, will ensure that these multiple benefits are sequestered for the long run.

If there is one routine that L G Mageshbabu, an avid marathoner, doesn't skip for the world, it is a run, every morning and evening. As an administrative professional with Saint Gobain Glass India, his schedule is jam-packed, but a breathtaking woodland right in the middle of his office campus in Sriperumbudur gives him more room to train than he could have ever asked for."If not for this space, I cannot imagine running at a marathon with a schedule like mine," he says. "I even take this route to reach different departments within the campus because it's the perfect respite to a chaotic workday," says the 34-year-old.Industries' impact on the environment is often unavoidable, owing to their high resource and raw material consumption. But in a bid to minimise their carbon footprint in whatever way they can, a growing number of multi-national companies are building the expertise to launch environmental-friendly initiatives that resonate with best practices of energy consumption worldwide.Saint Gobain, which has set up two rainwater harvesting reservoirs on its campus and powers nearly 75% of the electrical energy requirements of its gas manufacturing facility with solar panels and waste heat power generation, is a year from completing its own in-house urban forest housing 1,00,000 trees. The company, a signatory to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21), it has already covered eight out of the nine acres planned around its campus with 74,000 native trees."In 2017, when we were preparing our biodiversity management plan, we came across Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki's concept of the urban forest through which small pieces of land could be converted into high-density forests within a short span of time. We started by planting 10,000 trees in close proximity on one acre plots of land," says B Santhanam, MD, Saint-Gobain India.A thick canopy of neem, banyan, rosewood, teak and jackfruit trees now surrounds the scenic rainwater harvesting reservoir at Saint Gobain's World Glass Complex in Sriperumbudur, with a two-kilometre jogging track running along the forest area. The company also creates its own organic manure at the factory to tend to this forest.Worldwide, research has shown that employees working in a green company are significantly more productive and enjoy better cognitive functioning. A 2018 study by Magali A Delmas of UCLA Anderson and University of Montenegro's Sanja Pekovic said that a company's green practices including its recyling, pollution reduction and energy efficient programmes resulted in higher labour productivity, when combined with other performance-enhancing practices.At Mahindra World City, more than two lakh trees have been planted on 70 acres of land, and another two lakh will be planted ahead of the monsoons this year. "During the last cyclone, we lost 3,500 trees at the campus. Involving employees in the plantation drive has enhanced their awareness of sustainable practices and increased productivity," says Vijayan Janardhanan, business head, Mahindra World City, Chennai.Hafiz Khan of Communitree, which conducted the afforestation drive along with the community, says the initiative has developed a culture of sustainable living among residents who live on the campus as well. "Every week, employees and their families tend to the forest and also create manure from household waste," he says.For conservation groups like the Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), the trend could be the stepping stone towards a culture of responsible industry ethics. EFI has partnered with Larsen and Toubro and Indusind Bank in their afforestation drives. "The fact that companies are getting interested in the subject and channelising their resources into real-time effort is encouraging," says Arun Krishnamurthy, who heads the group. "Companies must now invest in research on how these forests can survive distress periods of flash floods and excess heat too," he says. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

New Delhi, Jan. 8 -- Shri Pranav R Mehta, Chairman, Global Solar Council, addressing a Press Conference at Press Club of India on 7th Jan, 2019 about Global Solar Council and its activities Solar Man of India Pranav R Mehta continues to increase country's Clout in Solar World Chairman of NSEFI and world-renowned Shri Pranav R. Mehta took over as head of the Global Solar Council, headquartered in Washington DC from 1 January 2019. Pranav R. Mehta will be felicitated with "Solar Visionary and Influencer Award" in Abu Dhabi next week A visionary in the field of Solar Energy and the chairman of National Solar Energy Federation, Shri Pranav R Mehta, has taken over as the president of Global Solar Council (GSC) from January 1, 2019. The GSC has its headquarters in Washington D.C., USA. The Global Solar Council (GSC) was launched on December 6, 2015, following the historic United Nations Climate Change Conference (UN COP 21). The GSC came into being as International Coalition of more than 30 nations, utilising maximum solar energy, decided to harness the renewable energy for the greater good. Mr Mehta has been invited by over 15 countries in the last two years to share his vision and experience in India's impressive solar growth. The visionary started his solar journey way back in 2006 when India was at Zero Megawatts solar capacity and is credited with having played a catalytic and pivotal role in opinion building, emphasis and awareness about the importance of solar energy, integrating the efforts of all solar energy stakeholders including government and private sector as well as the intellectual inputs. Today, India is placed amongst the Top 5 solar players in the world and is third largest solar market. But the suave and low profile attributes the credit to the political will and leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in equal measure to solar industry players and all stakeholders including the government. "India's impressive growth would not have been complete without Prime Minister and his government's enabling policies, role of proactive bureaucracy and significant contribution of solar industry players in terms of capital investment, technology deployment, employment generation, skill development, innovative financing and above all, achieving cost reduction," opines Mr Mehta, who is well known for his work in the area of sustainable development and outgoing environmental and social concerns. Recognising his contributions to the solar sector across the world, Shri Pranav Mehta who has been keeping the Indian flag flying high in the solar arena, has been conferred with the 'Visionary Disruptor Award' by Solar Future Today, which he will be receiving on 15th January, 2019 at the sidelines of World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi. Speaking about GSC's future plans, Mr Mehta stated, "My heart goes out to the energy have-nots. Moreover, solar energy has a vast potential for poverty alleviation. We at Global Solar Council will thus strive to achieve not only growth but spread of solar energy globally and reach out to those who have no access to energy. To this end we will - together with and in consultation with ISA, IRENA, World Governments and like-minded positive organizations - strive to achieve 1.0 Trillion Mini Grids ensuring decentralized energy, 1.0 Trillion Solar Homes, and 10.0 million jobs by 2030. Of course, we will aim at 1.0 million of each of the above items and then scale it up deploying new storage and other technologies."

New Delhi, Dec. 07 -- As the Canadian oil industry endures its worst crisis ever, a fair share of the blame has been lobbed at environmentalists who oppose pipeline projects. But while industry boosters say the message from the recent price crash is that the government needs to reduce regulations and help get new pipelines built more quickly, environmental activists see different lessons entirely. Here's their take, according to three of the most prominent: Wean oil-rich Alberta off crude. "The writing is on the wall -- we need to stop expanding the oil industry now and create a plan for retraining and economic diversification," said Tzeporah Berman, co-founder of the Stand.Earth activist group. The government needs "to ensure that families and our economy are not so dependent on oil sands and what clearly has become a boom-and-bust economy." Output cuts, which boosted crude prices and producer shares, are a "short-term, last-ditch effort" to prop up a dying industry, Berman said in an interview from Katowice, Poland, where she was participating in the United Nations Climate Change Conference . To be sure, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is an advocate of economic diversification herself and many in the oil industry wouldn't disagree that the Canadian province's cash cow won't be here forever. Diversifying might be more easily said than done, though, for a remote area in the prairies whose main economic appeal is still its crude. Focus on renewables instead. The sense that government efforts are misplaced is shared by Clayton Thomas-Muller, who helped organize indigenous opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and is a campaigner for climate change activist Bill McKibben's 350.org. Perhaps the most egregious misstep was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion project to save it from cancellation, he said. "None of these pipelines are going to solve the problem," he said in an interview from Winnipeg. "What's going to solve the problems is a bold and visionary policy that moves us off fossil fuels and to 100% renewables." Can't flip a switch overnight. Despite the desire to stave off climate change, Keystone XL opponent Jane Kleeb says she doesn't see Alberta's output cut as a victory. Kleeb, whose Bold Alliance has been instrumental in delaying the TransCanada Corp. pipeline's passage through Nebraska, said she feels bad for the families that rely on oil jobs. She also says she knows that you can't flip a switch and have the economy running on 100% renewable energy overnight. "We should have a diverse energy system, and that's what Bold has advocated from the beginning, but that does not include the creation of new pipeline infrastructure," Kleeb said in an interview. "That is where we draw the line." Don't expect a major new pipeline in Canada. Despite the government support, the three activists said they don't expect Keystone XL or the Trans Mountain expansion, both currently being delayed by court cases, to ever be built. More broadly, opposition to pipelines will continue for years because it's being led by the younger generation and has involved other organizations like indigenous groups and workers' groups to become more effective, Thomas-Muller said. "It's very much a new kind of social movement that we're seeing, one that is not siloed up in the way that historically movements have been," he said. "They're quite savvy." \</doc>

India, Nov. 29 -- Ahead of COP24 , 130 national academies urge governments to take immediate steps to address climate change and failing global food systems About 130 national academies - across Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe - have come together to compile a report urging governments across the globe to change the current approach towards food, nutrition, agriculture and the environment, and improve the sustainability of global food systems. The report, titled ' Opportunities for future research and innovation on food and nutrition security and agriculture: The InterAcademy Partnership's global perspective', asks political actors to take collective action to transform global food systems and mitigate climate change. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the absolute number of undernourished people - those facing chronic food deprivation - has increased to nearly 821 million in 2017, from around 804 million in 2016. Scores of people have been reported to be suffering from micronutrient deficiency and disorders associated with being overweight or obese. The food security status has worsened in parts of Africa, South-East Asia and Western Asia, and especially in areas affected by conflict, and droughts, floods or other natural disasters. Agricultural production cannot expand infinitely - it is critically important to avoid further depletion of ecosystems and biodiversity, says the study. According to the World Bank, approximately 11% of the Earth's land is used for arable purposes, with over one-third used for agriculture, including pasture and grazed forest lands, it says. "Our food systems are failing us. Next week at COP24 , we need to see leaders take action on climate change and go beyond political statements. It is not only the environment that is at stake, but health, nutrition, trade, jobs and the economy," said professor Joachim von Braun, Co-chair of the IAP project, president of the Pontifical Academy of Science, and Director of the Center for Development Research (ZEF) at the University of Bonn. "Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change. We need a robust and ambitious policy response to address the climate impacts of agriculture and consumer choices - and scientists have a major role to play. Our new report is a wake-up call to leaders," added professor Braun. The drive for calories in food production is causing health challenges, including obesity, says the report. Climate change is only adding to the insecurity and inequalities in food and nutrition. "In addition to climate change, our current food systems are negatively impacting people's health around the globe. High-calorie diets have become cheaper, and this has serious implications for public health, obesity, and malnutrition. Science is critical to tackling the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, hunger and health," said professor Volker ter Meulen M.D., co-chair of the IAP project and President of IAP. The study adds that agriculture is one of the main sources of Green house gas (GHG) emissions and, currently, food systems account for about 30% of emissions, about half being derived from agricultural production and half from land conversion. According to the report, some of the actions to mitigate the contribution of food systems to GHG emission and climate change can include reduction in over-consumption of food, changing specific dietary habits, and ensuring that people globally have access to nutritious, affordable and environmentally sustainable food. Deriving conclusions about the future of animal production, in addition to GHG emissions and biological efficiency of production, considerations such as type of animal, health/nutrient characteristics of animal-based food, other products from animals and alternative land use are all important, it says. Climate-smart agriculture, incentives for consumers to change their diets, innovative foods, and cutting-edge technologies are indispensable while addressing the root causes of our failing global food system, says the report. It suggests that policy makers need to find ways to change consumer behaviour, and make people understand the environmental implications of food choices. Reducing food waste should be prioritised, it says. Further, it suggests reducing meat consumption in regions like Europe and promoting innovative foods and diets. IAP advises creating an international advisory panel on food and nutrition security and agriculture, to include participation by academies and to strengthen international governance mechanisms. The report gains importance in the backdrop of climate change talks, set to commence in Poland, urging governments to consider immediate steps to tackle the crisis arising out of failing global food systems and subsequent climate change.

KATOWICE: The current round of UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) may not come out with a robust rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement. An outcome will certainly arrive at the end, but it may not be on expected lines and therefore the remaining works on crucial issues will spill over to the next 'conference of parties' in 2019. This sense has come out from different tracks of negotiation where rich nations (the US and EU nations) have become quite adamant on diluting differentiation between developed and developing countries. Rich nations have strongly been pitching for diluting this line while framing the rule-book, even though the Agreement has kept the dividing line intact. The move to dilute this line will, however, not be acceptable to developing countries, including India, and it may thus have its impact on rule-book.Existing disagreements among developed and developing countries on key issues, primarily finance and reporting on countries' climate action and support, made it almost clear on eighth day of negotiation here on Tuesday that this Conference won't end with its full mandate of framing complete operational guidelines and procedures (rule-book) on all 29 Articles of the global deal which was arrived at Paris three years ago. "These disagreements have really become red lines for developing countries. Though it would be premature to say anything conclusively at this juncture as there are many landing zones (potential convergence points) in the draft text and we still have three days of negotiations left for course correction, the COP24 appears to be heading for a rule-book which may not cover all Articles of the Paris Agreement,"said a key negotiator of developing country. Echoing sentiments of other developing countries' negotiators, he said a broad rule-book would be there to show the COP24 as a "success", but many finer points would be left for next year. He did not rule out the possibility of negotiations going beyond schedule date of conclusion of the Conference on December 14 to arrive at some results on rule-book. The contentious Article of the Paris Agreement on climate finance (Article 9) deals with issue of extending financial support by rich nations to developing countries for assisting them in both their mitigation (emission cut) and adaptation actions. This has, however, become the most controversial element of rule-book discussions as the rich nations have been consistently opposing an ex-ante review of their financial commitments. Besides, there is not even a consensus on what 'finance' (public, private or aid) should mean.Enhanced transparency framework (ETF) for action and support (Article 13) is the other key matter of disagreement. Under this, all countries are required to report on their climate actions and also on the support they get. It has become a major red line for developing countries as their rich counterparts do not willing to provide flexibility (less stringent reporting requirements).Developing countries need enough flexibility as all of them do not have capacity to measure their emission, climate actions and even climate change impacts.While the US and European Union (28 nations) have pushed for selective flexibility meant only for least developed countries and island states, India and China are demanding flexibility for all developing countries.Reacting to major disagreements among countries which may lead to an incomplete rule-book, the New Delhi-based research and advocacy group, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said it would be better to have "no rule-book than a weak and incomplete rule-book"."Considering that the Paris Agreement itself is a weak regime, having a weaker rule-book will make it inconsequential. This is something that the world cannot afford. It would a better choice to have no rule-book here at Katowice than have a weak, ineffectual rule-book," said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the CSE. Amid those sticking points in ongoing negotiations, the CSE recommended that countries should work for another year to develop a consensus on a "robust and meaningful rule-book " and then finalize it by 2019."The Paris Agreement came with a mandate which needs to be balanced and strong. The negotiations are stuck on contentious issues because there is no commons consensus reached by Parties (countries) one way or another. A strong rule book should strike a balance between action and support, between mitigation and adaptation, and between science and political will. If we can do this, we can easily reach a consensus at negotiations," said Vaibhav Gupta, senior programme lead of the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water.

New York, Dec 4 (IBNS): As world leaders and decision-makers get to work on mitigating climate change at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, renowned broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough launched a new UN campaign to give individuals their say on the key global issue, via social media. Sir David announced the start of The Peoples Seat initiative, enabling individuals around the world to unite to battle climate change, during the opening session of the crucial two-week COP24 on Monday. The UNs new ActNow.bot [this link opens in Facebook Messenger] is designed to fuel climate change understanding, and urges advocates to take personal action via the Facebook Messenger Platform. Sir David told delegates on Monday in Poland that if we dont take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world, is on the horizon. Attenborough spoke passionately for The Peoples Seat, the UN initiative calling on people from across the globe to be part of the climate change dialogue: In the last two weeks, the worlds people have taken part in creating this address, answering polls, creating videos and voicing their opinions, he said. They want you the decision makers to act now. The people are behind you, supporting you in making tough decisions, but they are also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives. To make this even easier, the UN is launching the Act Now Bot. Helping people to discover simple everyday actions that they can take, because they recognize that they too must play their part, he urged assembled officials. UN Under-Secretary-General of Global Communications Alison Smale welcomed the launch: This new social media tool, a Facebook Messenger bot, will help people learn about activities to reduce their carbon footprint, and showand share with friendshow they are making an impact. We all need to do things differently. The innovative campaign was created with support from Facebook and Grey advertising company and harnesses advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to engage people in the growing movement to take climate action. The bot is a fully interactive and responsive chat bot which users can find on the UN Facebook page. It suggests everyday actions determined by the users interaction with the bot, that can be taken to preserve the environment and shared via the social platform to encourage collective action. The collective actions will be presented during the United Nations Secretary-Generals Climate Summit in New York in September 2019. The initiative comes as global decision makers are being asked to intensify efforts in the battle against climate change and to agree the implementation guidelines of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. All this is evolving against a backdrop of conclusive new evidence by UN Environment which found countries to significantly step up the necessary actions to fulfil the commitments made in Paris. \</doc>

Climate change impacts are high on the international agenda. From severe wildfires in California and Greece to devastating floods in Kerala, these impacts have dominated headlines this year. Both the increasing number of extreme weather events and the continuing rise in global carbon emissions add urgency to this years COP24 in Poland, where the global effort to tackle climate change is being developed. One key area of focus at COP24 will be the financing gap between climate change adaptation (coping with the impacts of a changing and more variable climate), and climate change mitigation (reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change). Mitigation finance flows are 4-5 times greater than adaptation flows, as shown recently in the UNFCCCs 2018 Biennial Assessment. The assessment illustrates the urgent need to scale the financing of climate adaptation, in addition to ensuring that these flows are consistently defined, tracked and reported. In 2015, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) Climate Finance Tracking and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC) Climate Finance Working Group agreed upon a set of Common Principles for Climate Change Adaptation Finance Tracking. During a MDB-IDFC side-event at COP24 , the Working Group will jointly launch Lessons Learned from Three Years of Implementing the MDB-IDFC Common Principles for Climate Change Adaptation Finance Tracking. The report synthesises the experience of the major climate finance providers in defining, tracking and reporting climate adaptation finance. Here are the lessons learned from implementing the Common Principles over the past three years: A process-based approach is important for preparing, tracking and reporting adaptation finance. The Common Principles have a three-step approach for tracking adaptation finance: i) setting out a project-specific context of climate vulnerability; ii) making an explicit statement of intent to address that climate vulnerability; and iii) articulating a clear and direct link between the context of climate vulnerability and the specific project activities and for tracking and reporting adaptation finance. A range of approaches is needed to determine shares of project costs that can be counted as adaptation finance. The Common Principles recommend that adaptation finance should be reported based on the disaggregation of adaptation activities from non-adaptation activities within projects. This is being implemented using a range of approaches that reflect the varying mandates and business models of the different MDBs and IDFC members. The application of the Common Principles has generated valuable experience of how to determine the project-specific context of climate vulnerability. The climate vulnerability context should explain how a projectincluding its assets, the services it is meant to provide, the ecosystem services it relies on and the targeted beneficiariesis affected by climate variability and climate change, now and in the future. It is important to integrate technical considerations into adaptation finance tracking. These considerations include improved use of climate information, introduction of better management practices for climate resilience, and policy or regulatory reforms that incentivise more climate-resilient practices and behaviours. Implementing the Common Principles has helped build institutional capacity and expertise within the MDBs and among IDFC members. This includes the development of a range of technical resources and training or guidance materials, many of which are in the public domain and may therefore benefit a much wider range of organisations working on adaptation and adaptation financing. We need to develop further ways to define and report the impact of adaptation projects. Whilst there is more adaptation finance being reported, institutions have become more aware that reporting on adaptation efforts needs to go beyond tracking the finance and also capture the results that the projects and finance have delivered. Growing international awareness of the urgent need to cope with climate change impacts has led to much greater focus on financing flows for adaptation, said Craig Davies, Head of Climate Resilience Investments at EBRD. This report is the result of a close partnership and excellent collaboration between a wide range of organisations involved in adaptation financing, added Zeynep Cansever Stevens, MRV Analyst in EBRDs Energy Efficiency & Climate Change team. In addition to MDBs and IDFC members, a significant number of national and international organisations have also contributed towards the analysis contained in the report. Since the adoption of the Common Principles for Climate Change Adaptation Finance Tracking, MDBs have delivered adaptation finance exceeding US$ 18.6 billion though more 1,000 projects. IDFC members have also reported adaptation finance in excess of US$ 20.5 billion between 2015 and 2017. The EBRDs climate resilience investment operations is one of the pillars of its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, through which the Bank seeks to increase the volume of green financing to 40 per cent of EBRD annual investment by 2020. Since 2011, the EBRD has signed more than 210 climate resilience investments with a total business volume exceeding 5.6 billion, and GET adaptation finance in excess of 1.6 billion. \</doc>

KATOWICE: With two initial draft texts of the Paris Agreement rule-book missing key concerns of developing countries, the current round of UN climate conference ( COP24 ) was extended on Friday to thrash out some results at the end. Negotiators are expected to huddle together overnight to remove those differences, specifically on issue of finance and reporting mechanism (transparency) on climate action."We are not very far from reaching an agreement," said senior bureaucrat and India's head of delegation here at COP24 , A K Mehta, while hinting on arriving at an outcome on Saturday. The Conference was scheduled to end on Friday. Referring to ongoing negotiation on the latest draft text, he said, "Focus of this COP is to frame a rule-book for implementing the Paris Agreement. Very substantial progress has been made. There are some differences. We hope that will be sorted out."Asked about India's red lines, Mehta said that most of the country's concerns were "very well reflected" in the latest text. It is expected that the COP presidency will come out with one more draft text before the final one after those grueling rounds of overnight negotiations.India wants that there should be a definite road map on the issue of finance which the developed countries are expected to contribute for developing countries for helping them to adapt themselves to the challenges of climate change.Besides, the country also wants a kind of transparency mechanism (reporting on climate actions) which may allow certain flexibility to developing countries as they all have varying capabilities to report on their actions. "Developing countries need a certain differentiation and flexibility to enable them to move together with the world," said Mehta. His remarks came in the backdrop of huge protests from civil society members and advocacy groups who think the draft text in its present form may not address the concerns of poor and vulnerable countries. "On the whole, the analysis is that the current draft text is weak in terms of finance and raising ambition. There is no mention of raising ambition in action and support post 2020 and integrating it with science. It is still a long way to go to determine the finer details of the elements," said Indian climate expert Chandra Bhushan.Bhushan, deputy director general of New Delhi-based research and advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), claimed that the developing countries have lost the fight for "flexibility to all" while providing information on their climate action.Other experts too expressed their concerns on the draft text. "The new text has made a deliberate attempt to shot down the principle of equity, and the principle of differentiation. On finance, ex-ante reporting is significantly weak. We are not moving towards a balanced architecture, and instead of locking ourself into this, we should take time and demand stability between action and support," said Vaibhav Gupta, senior programme lead of the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).

Africa is the continent with the most rapidly growing urban population, at an estimated annual rate of 3%. The surge in population is paired with rapid urbanisation and increased transportation. Consequently, emissions from transportation are growing significantly all across Africa, further driven by urban sprawl, rapid motorization and low levels of institutional capacity to manage traffic and its impact. The exponential increase in transportation brings with it a worsening urban air quality. Emissions from transport-related sources are a major cause of chronic respiratory-related illnesses and premature deaths in Africa. It is estimated that 90% of urban air pollution in developing countries is attributable to vehicle emissions. The World Health Organization has calculated that 176,000 deaths per year in Africa are due to outdoor air pollution. At an event hosted by the African Development Bank, at the COP24 , on transport emissions monitoring and mapping, attendees and speakers exchanged experiences on developing cleaner and more efficient transport infrastructure. The speakers agreed that governments are not acting quickly enough in addressing the worsening urban air quality situation in the region. One of the reasons offered was the lack of reliable data on air pollution levels due to weak and non-existent air quality monitoring networks in several countries. This makes it harder for local and regional governments to take coordinated action to tackle the sources of air pollution. "Standards are important in this area. The first standard to be respected is to protect human health. These standards must be adapted to each government and to the specificities of each region," stated Mark Radka, chief of energy and climate at UNEP. Another reason for weak government support for air pollution measures was thought to be the limited regional evidence of the environmental and human health impact of air pollution, and the exact magnitude of the associated health risks. To address these gaps in both knowledge and collaborative action to address air pollution, there is a need to develop a systematic assessment and approach to guide governments, key municipal stakeholders, and policy-makers on the most effective ways to collect, store and analyse data, and map air pollution levels within cities. A study by the African Development Bank on the topic Transport Emission, Mapping, Monitoring and Capacity Building in 5 selected African countries, proposes several recommendations to strengthen the coordination of air quality efforts in African cities, by integrating mandatory quantitative air quality components in environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) to establishing institutional frameworks and baselines for air quality. "Air quality has become more and more of a priority for the C40 cities, from London to Dar-es-Salaam to Bangalore. Clean transportation is a win-win process. With these recommendations we hope to drive this development forward," stated Andrea Fernandez from C40 cities. The recommendations by the panelists at the COP24 event will help to improve the monitoring of air pollution trends in cities; produce clearer projections of the impact of investments on air pollution and carbon-finance benefits; encourage efficient planning of land-use and transport systems; and contain emissions from the transport sector. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 5 -- India and China could gain massive health benefits by tackling climate change, the WHO said on Wednesday. For India, the gains could be $3.28-8.4 trillion And meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. The latest estimates from leading experts also indicate that the value of health gains from climate action would be approximately double the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is even higher in countries such as China and India. The World Health Organization (WHO) report was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 It highlights why health considerations are critical to the advancement of climate action and outlines key recommendations for policy makers. The largest gains would be expected in China and India, which would generate even larger net benefits by pursuing the 1.5 degrees Celsius target rather than the two degrees target ($0.27-2.31 trillion in China and $3.28-8.4 trillion in India). The health gains of meeting the two degrees target would also significantly offset the costs in other regions, such as the European Union (seven-84 per cent) and the US (10-41 per cent). Exposure to air pollution causes seven million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated $5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than four per cent of their GDP. Actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around one per cent of the global GDP. "The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health -- clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter -- and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We can't afford to delay action any further." The same human activities that are destabilising the earth's climate also contribute directly to poor health. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution. Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. WHO's COP-24 It describes how countries around the world are now taking action to protect lives from the impacts of climate change -- but that the scale of support remains woefully inadequate, particularly for the small island developing states, and least developed countries. Only approximately 0.5 per cent of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation have been allocated to health projects, the WHO said. The report calls for countries to account for health in all cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation. It also recommends that countries use fiscal incentives such as carbon pricing and energy subsidies to incentivise sectors to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. It further encourages parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to remove existing barriers to supporting climate-resilient health systems. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, was an essential step to address climate change. It has the central goal of keeping global average temperature rise this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. --IANS vg/mag/sed \</doc>

Ahead of the global climate conference COP24 , taking place in Poland on 3-14 December 2018, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has launched a first-of-its-kind citizens climate survey, in partnership with the global public opinion company YouGov, to find out how 25 000 citizens in the European Union, the United States and China, feel about climate change. Today the EIB is presenting the findings of the first two parts of its survey. Despite encouraging trends in climate awareness across Europe, the survey shows that 20% of EU citizens still do not feel concerned when thinking about climate change. When compared to the United States and China, Europeans have a much stronger understanding of the challenges of climate change. 78% of Europeans describe themselves as being concerned or alarmed about climate change compared to 65% in China and 63% in the US. The survey also revealed that there is only a very small proportion of sceptical Europeans, 7% compared with 14% of US citizens who express scepticism about climate change. Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice President responsible for climate action and environment said: The EIB Climate Survey sends an important signal to delegates at COP24 in Katowice, that citizens are increasingly aware of the challenges posed by climate change. This is key to the international climate debate, because citizens already are making a difference through their individual actions. It is now up to businesses, citizens, governments at all levels and public institutions to use this momentum and work together. The EIB stands ready to play its part. Regarding the publics perception of the impact of climate action on job creation and economic growth, the survey found that EU citizens are more pessimistic than their Chinese and US counterparts: Europeans express greater concern about the financial impact of climate change. 55% of Europeans consider that the financial impact of climate change will affect them personally as compared to 40% of Chinese and 45% of US respondents. According to the survey, Americans are also the most optimistic regarding the economic benefits of measures to combat climate change: 26% believe the effect of climate action can be positive on the economy in contrast to only 21% of Europeans and 11% of Chinese. Against this backdrop, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is committed to serve as one of the largest sources of finance worldwide to fight climate change: the EIB has invested over EUR 130bn globally, supporting the delivery of over EUR 600bn in climate action investment since 2011 roughly the equivalent of the Polish GDP. Monica Scatasta, the Head of Environment, Climate and Social Policy at the EIB, said: Finance is a key factor in the global fight against climate change and its negative impacts. At the EIB, we strongly believe that financing climate action is also key to harness growth and innovation opportunities. We are convinced that measures aimed at addressing climate change can also generate sizeable benefits for economic growth and create a significant number of new jobs. But public finance alone, including from international institutions, is not sufficient. Investors, entrepreneurs and all economic actors have a role to play against the threats of climate change. At the EIB we are working alongside our partners to help mobilise these forces for climate action. \</doc>

Following a series of discussions that have engaged Scania and more than 60 other major companies, the business sector has submitted its recommendations for action to the forthcoming COP24 UN climate change conference in Katowice, Poland. The companies have called for zero carbon emissions to be translated into global, national and sector-based carbon greenhouse gas emission budgets up to 2050. This is very much in line with Scanias Pathways study into how to decarbonise the transport sector, which was presented earlier this year. We need transparency on decarbonisation The Pathways Study started with the Paris Agreement, explains Andreas Follr, Sustainability Manager at Scania. Then we back-casted for our sector and ended up with four different scenarios. We showed not only what we believe can be accomplished but what we expect from adjacent sectors and other partners in the ecosystem. We put our cards on the table and asked, Here we are, whats your role in this? We have subsequently formed a coalition with other leading companies. I think we need to enter a new era of transparency towards each other. Leaders should show where we are going so we can all assist each others journeys. Then, I believe, we can limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Among the companies that have joined the discussions in seven cities around the world are ABB, BP, IKEA, Fortum, Fujitsu Nordea, Philips, Volkswagen and Yara. In total, all the companies involved have combined revenues of USD 1.3 trillion. Climate action: from risk to opportunity We found that much of our discussion throughout the dialogues framed the private sectors engagement with climate change as a journey from risk to opportunity, with sustainable development another word for innovation, the participants report. Their report concludes that it is clear that policymakers can rely on private sector leadership, finance and innovation to contribute to the Paris Agreements climate goals; but authorities must also act to unleash the agreements full potential. To this end, the companies have set out recommendations to guide the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the various negotiating parties towards giving the business sector the fullest possible role in delivering the Paris Agreement goals. Call for global carbon pricing Among the recommendations are that a global pricing regime for carbon should be encouraged, thereby enabling trade in emission reductions in support of zero carbon emission targets. By pricing carbon, markets can more easily direct finance to the most cost-efficient emission reduction opportunities. The companies also believe that national carbon reduction contributions should evolve into comparable, reportable, blueprints for zero carbon emissions. They have called for clear incentives to the private sector to move ahead of and beyond regulation and policy, so as to accelerate progress. Meanwhile, counterproductive incentives, such as subsidies for fossil fuels and high greenhouse gas emitting practices in agriculture, should be phased out. We learned that many businesses are already charting their way to zero carbon emissions through a new relationship with business, government, society and the environment, the businesses state in their report. COP24 , the United Nations takes place from December 3 to 14. \</doc>

Katowice, Dec 5 -- Europeans are more concerned about climate change than people in the US and China, a survey has said Climate change doubters or deniers are more likely to be found in the US, a first-of-its-kind citizens' climate survey by the European Investment Bank (EIB) said on Tuesday. The survey was in partnership with the global public opinion company YouGov to find out how 25,000 citizens in the European Union, the US and China feel about the climate change. The EIB presented the findings of the first two parts of its survey on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate negotiations, known as COP24 , which saw world leaders and decision-makers getting to work on mitigating climate change in this Polish city. The survey says a large majority of Europeans well aware of the climate change issue but 20 per cent still not feeling concerned despite the recent special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that finds that warming could reach 1.5 degrees as soon as 2030, with devastating impacts. A total of 14 per cent of Americans are sceptical about the reality of climate change versus seven per cent of the Europeans. Citizens with lower income more worried by the negative economic impact of climate actions than high-income ones in Europe, except in Poland. EIB Vice President responsible for climate action and environment Jonathan Taylor said: "The EIB climate survey sends an important signal to delegates at COP24 in Katowice, that citizens are increasingly aware of the challenges posed by climate change." Regarding the public's perception of the impact of climate action on job creation and economic growth, the survey found that EU citizens are more pessimistic than their Chinese and US counterparts. The Europeans express greater concern about the financial impact of climate change. Fifty-five per cent of Europeans consider that the financial impact of climate change will affect them personally, as compared to 40 per cent of Chinese and 45 per cent of US respondents. According to the survey, Americans are also the most optimistic regarding the economic benefits of measures to combat climate change. Twenty-six per cent believe the effect of climate action can be positive on the economy in contrast to only 21 per cent of Europeans and 11 per cent of Chinese. Against this backdrop, the EIB is committed to serve as one of the largest sources of finance worldwide to fight climate change. It has invested over 130 billion euros globally, supporting the delivery of over 600 billion euro in climate action investment since 2011 -- roughly the equivalent of the Polish GDP. "Finance is a key factor in the global fight against climate change and its negative impacts," EIB Head of Environment, Climate and Social Policy Monica Scatasta said. --IANS vg/in \</doc>

The UN climate conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, concluded today with the adoption of a clear rulebook to make the Paris Agreement on climate change work in practice across the world. The completion of the rulebook was the EU's top objective in these negotiations. The Paris rulebook will enable the Parties to the Paris Agreement to implement, track and progressively enhance their contributions to tackling climate change, in order to meet the Agreement's long-term goals. EU action The EU's nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, under its wider 2030 climate and energy framework. All key legislation for implementing the 2030 emissions target has already been adopted, including the increased EU's 2030 targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency which if fully implemented could lead to an EU GHG emissions cut of some 45% by 2030, the Commission has estimated as well as the modernisation of the EU Emissions Trading System and 2030 targets for all Member States to cut emissions in sectors such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. Back in November 2016 just before the Paris Agreement entered into force the Commission presented the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, aimed at setting the most advanced regulatory framework that will make the European energy sector more secure, more market-oriented and more sustainable. We acknowledge that this transition is going to be more difficult for some regions than others notably those regions, where the economy is based on coal production. The Commission, together with these legislative proposals, outlined a special initiative to work with coal and carbon-intensive regions in transition so that they can also benefit from the clean energy transition. The clean energy transition is a transition for all Europeans and its socio-economic impacts must be carefully managed. EU ambition also goes beyond 2030. Following the invitation by the EU leaders, the Commission on 28 November presented a strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral European economy by 2050. The strategic vision, which follows wide stakeholder consultation and takes into account the recent IPCC special report on 1.5C, is an ambitious vision for ensuring a prosperous, modern, competitive and secure economy, providing sustainable growth and jobs and improving the quality of life of EU citizens. The strategic vision, which the Commission presented to global partners at COP24 , will kick-start an EU-wide debate which should allow the EU to adopt a long-term strategy and submit it to the UNFCCC by 2020. To this end, the European Council invites the Council to work on the elements outlined in the Communication. The EU also remains committed to the collective global goal to mobilise USD 100 billion a year by 2020 and through to 2025 to finance climate action in developing countries, from a variety of public and private sources. In 2017, the EU, its Member States and the European Investment Bank together provided a total EUR 20.4 billion in climate finance, around a 50% increase from 2012. Key outcomes The Paris Agreement rulebook contains detailed rules and guidelines for implementing the landmark global accord adopted in 2015, covering all key areas including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation. COP24 outcomes include: The first ever universal system for the Parties to track and report progress in climate action, which provides flexibilities to those countries that genuinely need it. This will inspire all Parties to improve their practices over time and communicate the progress made in clear and comparable terms. A good, consensual outcome on adaptation issues. The Parties now have guidance and a registry to communicate their actions as regards to adapting to the impacts of climate change. As to the global stocktake process, the next moment to review collective action, which the EU considered vital for the Paris Agreement, the result provides a solid basis for further elaboration on the details of the process. The global stocktake will invite Parties to regularly review progress and the level of ambition based on the latest available science. Finally, with the decisions on finance and technology, there is now a solid package that the EU trusts will provide reassurances to our partners on our commitment to continued global solidarity and support. \</doc>

The UN climate conference finally reached a deal late on Saturday night to adopt a universal rule book for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. The deal, struck a day after the meet was scheduled to end, paves the way for operationalizing the post- 2020 climate pledges made by countries in Paris. Despite President Donald Trump's vow to abandon the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to the deal, making it easier for the administration to change its mind or for a future president to return to the pact. The US cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until late 2020. Although India, along with other developing countries, had expressed concerns on certain points, it found the overall outcome a positive one. The global rules agreed to at the Katowice climate conference provide the nuts and bolts for implementing the Paris Accord, providing rules that to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. At present, climate actions are being guided by the Kyoto Protocol which mandates only rich nations (historical polluters) to cut their carbon emissions. It took nearly 200 countries three years to agree on procedures, guidelines and institutional mechanisms to implement the Paris deal which is meant for post-2020 climate actions by all countries with the aim of keeping average global temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius by the end of the century. Reacting to the pact, India said in a statement on Sunday,  India considers the outcome of COP24 Though the negotiators here tried to cover as many points as possible during two weeks, certain contentious issues including governance of a new  market mechanism for trading of carbon emissions have been deferred for next conference of parties (COP25) in 2019. The market mechanism provides flexible instruments for reducing the costs of cutting emissions, such as carbon markets. It is believed that the market mechanism will act as a key instrument in countries' mitigation measures in future.  We have worked on this (Katowice) package for three years. With 200 countries in the room it is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. But in these circumstances every single step forward is a big achievement, said the COP24 president and secretary of state in Poland's environment ministry, Michal Kurtyka. The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework (reporting and verification on countries climate actions). It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries.

Europeans are more concerned about climate change than people in the US and China, a survey has said. Climate change doubters or deniers are more likely to be found in the US, a first-of-its-kind citizens' climate survey by the European Investment Bank (EIB) said on Tuesday. The survey was in partnership with the global public opinion company YouGov to find out how 25,000 citizens in the European Union, the US and China feel about the climate change. The EIB presented the findings of the first two parts of its survey on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate negotiations, known as COP24 , which saw world leaders and decision-makers getting to work on mitigating climate change in this Polish city. The survey says a large majority of Europeans well aware of the climate change issue but 20 per cent still not feeling concerned despite the recent special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that finds that warming could reach 1.5 degrees as soon as 2030, with devastating impacts.

Indonesia ,Sept. 6 -- The UNFCCC States Parties meet again for the second time in 2018, from the 4th to the 9th of September 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand to attend the Bangkok Climate Change Conference. Located in the United Nations (UN) building ESCAP in the middle of Bangkok City, the UNFCCC States Parties and the Paris Agreement negotiated and struggled to agree that a mature negotiating text would contain detailed arrangements regarding modalities, procedures, and guidelines of the Paris Agreement Rule Book. The draft negotiating text is targeted to be adopted by the UNFCCC State Parties and the Paris Agreement at the 24th UNFCCC Meeting of States Parties ( the twenty- fourth session of the Conference of the Parties / COP24 /CMP14/CMA1.3) which will be held in Katowice, Poland, on 3-14 December 2018. The Bangkok Climate Change Conference begins with the Roundtables on Substantive Linkages meeting on September 3, 2018. This pre-opening session aims to discuss the various linkages between the main elements that become the backbone of the Paris Agreement Rules Book in more depth. The main elements of the Paris Agreement Rules Book are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Adaptation Communication, Transparency of Action and Support, Global Stocktake, Compliance , and support for the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the form of climate finance and technology. In this case, G77 & China highlight 3 (three) crucial elements of collective perspectives, namely: Transparency Framework, Adaptation, and Finance. At the opening of the Bangkok Conference on Tuesday, September 4, 2018, Mr. Frank Bainimarama, the Prime Minister of Fiji as COP23 Presidency, delivered the negotiation session in Bonn, which was considered not to have resulted in significant development in all PA Rules Book elements , so that additional sessions were needed which gave States parties the opportunity to produce draft texts with sufficient level of detail to be negotiated. While Mr. Michal Kurtyka, the Polish Minister of the Environment who is also COP24 Presidency said that the States Parties need to make the best use of their time in Bangkok with the spirit of working towards mutual respect, building collectively with the spirit to achieve adoption targets The Paris Agreement Rules Book at Katowice later. The delegation of the Republic of Indonesia was led by Dr. Nur Masripatin, Senior Advisor to the Minister of Environment and Forestry in the Field of Climate Change and International Convention as the National Focal Point for the UNFCCC. As Head of Delegation Dr. Nur emphasized the importance of the level of detail of each MPGs element from the PA Rules Book . For this reason the Indonesian Delegation has prepared a position that is poured into the draft text that is ready to be negotiated in the next week. The Indonesian delegation at the Bangkok Conference totaled 46 (forty six) participants consisting of representatives of 10 (ten) Ministries / Agencies, namely the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office of the Special Envoy of the Republic of Indonesia on Climate Change Control, Cabinet Secretariat, Ministry of Finance, Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Ministry of Industry, State Electricity Company (PLN), and Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing. \</doc>

In Africa, as elsewhere, urbanized locations exert pressure on already vulnerable populations impacted by lack of access to potable water supply, sanitation and waste management, energy supply, transport infrastructure and services. With nearly 90 percent of global population growth occurring in Asian or African cities, the goal of improving the quality of life for the people of Africa will only be achieved by mainstreaming resilience and effective financing mechanisms into the continents urban development agenda. This was the key message of expert deliberations at events hosted by the African Development Bank and its partners during the United Nations Climate Change Conference held this December in Katowice, Poland. During one of the sessions themed Resilient pathways for sustainable urban development in Africa, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, the World Banks Senior Director for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice said African cities with annual population growth rates exceeding 4 percent were particularly in need of resilience and financial support. He observed that: Many African cities have realized the importance of sustainable development, economic prosperity, and quality of life for their urban populations. In Africa, as elsewhere, urbanized locations exert pressure on already vulnerable populations impacted by lack of access to potable water supply, sanitation and waste management, energy supply, transport infrastructure and services, healthy and hygienic living conditions and climate hazards. Adequate mechanisms therefore need to be put in place to tackle the negative fallouts of these challenges. According to the United Nations, cities are hotspots for global emissions and climate vulnerability. They are also responsible for two-thirds of the worlds overall energy consumption and an estimated 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Already, with the highest urbanization rates on the planet, Africas urbanization rate is projected to accelerate in the coming decades, with the current 1.1 billion population doubling over the next 30 years. More than 80 percent of the increase will occur in Africas cities. Inadequate city planning, inefficient land use, and poor regulatory systems have created an unsustainable model of urban growth that has resulted in unmanaged sprawling, fragmented and hyper-informal cities and all forms of pollution. This scenario usually takes a toll on forests and other natural ecosystems, Ijjasz-Vasquez remarked. The potential consequences of climate change such as the rise in sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns will increasingly strain the capacities of Africas urban systems and heighten their vulnerability, said Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. Urban environments are expanding rapidly across Africa, for example in places like Egypt and along the coast of West Africa. Placing our attention on resilient urban planning, we can ensure we will reach the UN 2030 development goals, we can ensure an inclusive, resilient and sustainable urban environment. And we can improve our resilience to climate changes, Nyong said. Integrated urban planning is urgently required, Nyong further remarked, noting that African cities need effective planning and financing strategies to realign their growth trajectories onto a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive path administrators now have an opportunity. The African Development Bank, Africas foremost development finance institution is in the driving seat of continental efforts to stem the effect of climate change on the continent, ensuring a developmental path that is sustainable and resilient to various shocks while ensuring the highest possible quality of life for current and future citizens of the continent. As part of efforts to identify and implement sustainable models of urban growth in Africa, the Bank is involved in the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC) initiative, launched in 2016 by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to bring global environmental benefits to cities. The GPSC promotes sustainable urban development through three pillars, namely, sustainability indicators and tools; integrated urban planning solutions; and municipal finance. Implementing agencies of the GPSC include the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). \</doc>

If we had started cutting emissions 20 years ago, drastic measures would not be necessary now Global warming is physics and chemistry, and you cannot negotiate with science for more time to solve the problem: more emissions mean a hotter planet. Dealing with the problem, however, requires an international negotiation involving almost 200 countries. In big gatherings of that sort, the convoy always moves at the speed of the slowest ships. This is why the reporting on the United Nations climate change conference in Poland has been so downbeat. It did not produce bold new commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It saw the usual attempts by the biggest fossil fuel producers, the United States of America, Russia and Saudi Arabia, to stall the process, and in the end it just produced a 'rulebook'. But that is all it was supposed to do, and it is not 'just' a rulebook. The great breakthrough at the Paris conference three years ago saw every country finally agree to adopt a plan for emission reductions. But the Paris accord was a mere sketch, only 27 pages long. Fleshing it out - what the plans should cover, how often they should be updated, how countries should measure and report their emissions, how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data - was left until later. Later is now, and in the end they did come up with a 256-page rulebook that fills in most of these blanks. "We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends," said the European Union's climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete. It was an excruciating process, and it still leaves a few things out, but it settled a thousand details about how the Paris deal will really work. This year's conference dealt with the details at the ministerial level. Next year, the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, will host a summit of the biggest emitters to lay the groundwork for the key 2020 meeting. That is when countries will report if they have kept their 2015 promises on emission cuts, and hopefully promise much bigger cuts for the next five years. The Paris deal is important, but it has come far too late to stop the average global temperature from rising to the never-exceed target of +2 degrees Celsius that was adopted many years ago, let alone the lower target of +1.5 degree C that scientists now believe is necessary. We are already at +1 degree C, and current promises of emission cuts will take us up past +3 degree C. At the moment emissions are still going up (by 3 per cent this year). Even if countries make further major commitments to cut emissions in 2020, it is hard to believe that we can avoid devastating heat waves, droughts, floods, a rise in sea-level, and a sharp fall in global food production. So while we are cutting emissions, we also need to be working on ways to remove some of the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we have already put into the atmosphere. Various ideas for doing that are being worked upon, but they will probably become available on a large scale too late to keep the temperature rise below +2 degree C. So geoengineering - direct intervention in the atmosphere to hold the temperature down while we work on getting emissions down - will probably be needed as well. Nobody really wants to do 'solar radiation management', but cutting the amount of sunlight reaching the planet's surface by just a small amount is technically feasible. It could temporarily halt the warming and give us the extra time we are probably going to need. We are getting into very deep water here, but we may have no other options. If we had started cutting our emissions 20 years ago (when we already knew where they would eventually take us), such drastic measures would not be necessary. But that is not the human way, and so we will have to take the risks or pay the price. \</doc>

Poland, Nov. 29 -- Following a series of discussions that have engaged Scania and more than 60 other major companies, the business sector has submitted its recommendations for action to the forthcoming COP24 UN climate change conference in Katowice, Poland. The companies have called for zero carbon emissions to be translated into global, national and sector-based carbon greenhouse gas emission budgets up to 2050. This is very much in line with Scania's "Pathways" study into how to decarbonise the transport sector, which was presented earlier this year. "We need transparency on decarbonisation" "The Pathways Study started with the Paris Agreement," explains Andreas Foller, Sustainability Manager at Scania. "Then we back-casted for our sector and ended up with four different scenarios. We showed not only what we believe can be accomplished but what we expect from adjacent sectors and other partners in the ecosystem. We put our cards on the table and asked, 'Here we are, what's your role in this?' "We have subsequently formed a coalition with other leading companies. I think we need to enter a new era of transparency towards each other. Leaders should show where we are going so we can all assist each other's journeys. Then, I believe, we can limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius." Among the companies that have joined the discussions in seven cities around the world are ABB, BP, IKEA, Fortum, Fujitsu Nordea, Philips, Volkswagen and Yara. In total, all the companies involved have combined revenues of USD 1.3 trillion. Climate action: from risk to opportunity "We found that much of our discussion throughout the dialogues framed the private sector's engagement with climate change as a journey from risk to opportunity, with sustainable development £nother word for innovation'," the participants report. Their report concludes that it is clear that policymakers can rely on private sector leadership, finance and innovation to contribute to the Paris Agreement's climate goals; but authorities must also act to unleash the agreement's full potential. To this end, the companies have set out recommendations to guide the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the various negotiating parties towards giving the business sector the fullest possible role in delivering the Paris Agreement goals. Call for global carbon pricing Among the recommendations are that a global pricing regime for carbon should be encouraged, thereby enabling trade in emission reductions in support of zero carbon emission targets. By pricing carbon, markets can more easily direct finance to the most cost-efficient emission reduction opportunities. The companies also believe that national carbon reduction contributions should evolve into comparable, reportable, blueprints for zero carbon emissions. They have called for clear incentives to the private sector to move ahead of and beyond regulation and policy, so as to accelerate progress. Meanwhile, counterproductive incentives, such as subsidies for fossil fuels and high greenhouse gas emitting practices in agriculture, should be phased out. "We learned that many businesses are already charting their way to zero carbon emissions through a new relationship with business, government, society and the environment," the businesses state in their report.

U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) issued the following statements after the Trump administration released on Friday a report on the effects of climate change, which includes specific findings for the Northeast region. The report details the profound impact climate change is having, and will continue to have, on the regions environment, economy and public health: Ignoring climate change is not an option, said Shaheen. This report makes it clear that every Granite Stater is impacted by climate change, and the threat to our state will worsen over time unless aggressive action is taken. These findings should compel the Trump administration and Republican leadership in Congress to finally face the facts and work across the aisle to address this threat to New Hampshire and the planet. This report also praises the regions participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and suggests that it could serve as a model for the nation. I wholeheartedly agree, and urge leaders in Concord to maintain New Hampshires leadership in controlling harmful greenhouse gas emissions through RGGI. Its time for the nation to catch up to the Northeast region in tackling climate change head-on. There is no question that climate change is having very real and very serious consequences for our economy, environment, and way of life and we need action now, said Hassan. From our maple syrup and ski industries to our coastal infrastructure, this report details the negative impact that climate change is having in the Northeast region and makes it abundantly clear that the economic impacts will worsen dramatically if we fail to take urgent and meaningful action. New Hampshire and the Northeast have helped lead the way through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and I urge the President, his Administration, and Republicans in Congress to acknowledge the scientific facts and join us in addressing this massive challenge. Among the findings in this report for the Northeast region: Climate change threatens coastal marshes, fisheries, ecosystems and coastal infrastructure; In particular, warming waters are a direct threat to lobster and cod catches; Increased precipitation will lead to more inland flooding; Warming weather will lead to poorer air quality and allergens, with health-related impacts; Winters are warming three times faster than summers, which is leading to a shorter snow season for winter tourism; Shifting seasonality is negatively affecting the health of forests and harming migratory patterns of birds and parasite infections for animals such as moose; Changing seasons are also threatening maple syrup production because of increased variability in the tapping season; And coastal and inland flooding will necessitate investments in aging infrastructure. Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the Presidents anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trumps anti-climate executive order and restore our nations leadership role in the fight against global climate change. Senator Hassan has long fought to protect natural resources and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Senator Hassan spoke on the Senate floor earlier this year about the urgent need to act to combat climate change, and introduced a bill to create a national study on net metering, which would help support the growth of clean energy and work to reduce the release of toxic emissions into the air. As a State Senator and then as Governor, Senator Hassan worked to create and strengthen the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and New Hampshires Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to maintain and grow the states clean, renewable energy sector. She also worked across party lines as Governor to raise the net metering cap in order to boost New Hampshires solar industry and ensure that it can continue to grow and thrive. \</doc>

New York, Oct. 3 -- UN Secretary-General Ant Guterres on Tuesday praised India progress on implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular the pursuit of Sanitation for All and Affordable and Clean Energy, which featured heavily during day-two of his official visit to the country. Speaking at the closing session of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention in New Delhi, Guterres noted Gandhis long record of advocacy and action on the issue, adding that the decision to begin marking the 150th anniversary of Gandhis birth which takes place on 2 October next year with the Convention, was a fitting tribute to this great human being and example to us all. An estimated 2.3 billion people, said Guterres, still do not have basic sanitation facilities. Almost 1 billion defecate in the open, a practice that poses a serious threat to children, contributing to diarrhoea and to malnutrition and stunting that has a lifelong impact. The UN chief outlined some of the many consequences and risks of poor sanitation, including disease, stunting and indignity, and pointed out that it exacerbates inequalities between men and women, rich and poor, city and countryside. And it has major implications for human rights and human dignity. He said that women and girls are disproportionately impacted, as they may face an increased risk of harassment and abuse, and higher health risks due to a lack of access to sanitation facilities. Guterres went on to praise the Indian Governments Clean India Mission, which seeks to achieve universal sanitation coverage, as the largest investment and largest mobilization campaign in the world. He added that All people have the right to safe water and sanitation. If we are to build resilient societies on a healthy planet and achieve the overarching ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must tackle this issue urgently, as is being done in India. The country, said Guterres, is well on target to reach the SDG of Sanitation for All including for women, children, young people, people with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous peoples, the homeless, refugees and migrants before 2030. On Tuesday evening, the Secretary-General addressed the first general assembly of the International Solar Alliance, an organization initiated several years ago by the Governments of India and France in the build up to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , which describes itself as a coalition of solar resource-rich countries. The UN chief lamented the lack of political commitments to make the transformative decisions that will help to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement: current commitments are falling far short of meeting the target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and striving for 1.5 degrees. At the same time, he said, the world is witnessing a global renewable energy revolution, with solar energy; now competitive with - and often cheaper than - fossil fuels, at the centre. Renewables accounted for some 70 per cent of net additions to global power in 2017, and India has set a goal to mobilize $1 trillion towards the deployment of 1,000 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030. Despite these positive developments, Guterres said that if we do not change course by 2002, we risk missing the opportunity to avoid runaway climate change. This, he said, is why he is convening next Septembers UN Climate Summit, with the aim of bringing climate action to the top of the international agenda, providing leaders and stakeholders with the opportunity to showcase their ambition. Also on Tuesday, Guterres held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during which he thanked Modi for the strong cooperation between India and the UN, especially in support of the UN chiefs organizational reform effort. The Secretary-General also underscored the leadership role that India plays in South-South Cooperation. The Secretary-General also addressed a group of young people at the India Habitat Centre, where he spoke to them about global challenges and answered questions on challenges facing the international community, including the trust-deficit, growing attacks on multilateralism and climate change.

KATOWICE, POLAND: The UN climate conference ( COP24 ) finally on late Saturday night adopted rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement. This global deal is meant for climate actions by all the countries across the globe post-2020.The global rules are important to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. Currently, climate actions of rich nations for pre-2020 period are being guided by the Kyoto Protocol. "We have worked on this (Katowice) package for three years. With 200 countries in the room it is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. But in these circumstances every single step forward is a big achievement," said the COP24 president of Poland, Michal Kurtyka. The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries."The implementation of the agreement will benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. The agreed 'Katowice Climate Package' is designed to operationalize the climate change regime contained in the Paris Agreement. Under the auspices of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, it will promote international cooperation and encourage greater ambition," said the UNFCCC in a statement. It said, "The guidelines will promote trust among nations that all countries are playing their part in addressing the challenge of climate change."Kurtyka said, "All nations have worked tirelessly. All nations showed their commitment. All nations can leave Katowice with a sense of pride, knowing that their efforts have paid off. The guidelines contained in the Katowice Climate Package provide the basis for implementing the agreement as of 2020".Besides transparency framework, the Katowice package also includes guidelines that relate to the process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilizing $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries. It also includes how to conduct the Global Stocktake (GST) of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023 and how to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology"This is an excellent achievement. The multilateral system has delivered a solid result. This is a roadmap for the international community to decisively address climate change," said the UN's Climate Chief, Ms. Patricia Espinosa. She said, "The guidelines that delegations have been working on day and night are balanced and clearly reflect how responsibilities are distributed amongst the world's nations. They incorporate the fact that countries have different capabilities and economic and social realities at home, while providing the foundation for ever increasing ambition."The agreed guidelines mean that countries can now establish the national systems that are needed for implementing the Paris Agreement as of 2020. The same will be done at the international level.Functioning together, these systems will ensure that nations can act in an atmosphere of trust and assess progress of their climate actions."While some details will need to be finalised and improved over time, the system is to the largest part place," said Espinosa. The main issues still to be resolved concern the use of cooperative approaches, as well as the sustainable development mechanism, as contained in the Paris Agreement's article 6. These would allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals through the use of so-called "market mechanisms".Market mechanisms provide flexible instruments for reducing the costs of cutting emissions, such as carbon markets. Here, the Paris Agreement recognizes the need for global rules to safeguard the integrity of all countries' efforts."From the beginning of the COP, it very quickly became clear that this was one area that still required much work and that the details to operationalize this part of the Paris Agreement had not yet been sufficiently explored", explained Espinosa."After many rich exchanges and constructive discussions, the greatest majority of countries were willing to agree and include the guidelines to operationalize the market mechanisms in the overall package. Unfortunately, in the end, the differences could not be overcome," said Espinosa.Because of this, countries have agreed to finalise the details for market mechanisms in the coming year in view of adopting them at the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP25).The Fiji-led Talanoa Dialogue, a year-long inclusive dialogue around ambition as it relates to the Paris Agreement, also concluded at COP24 , with the global warming of 1.5 degree Celsius report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a major input."As the decision adopted indicates, there is a clear recognition of the IPCC's role in providing scientific input to inform countries in strengthening their response to the threat of climate change", Espinosa underlined.The final High-Level session in Katowice resulted in the Talanoa Call for Action, which calls upon all countries and stakeholders to act with urgency.Countries are encouraged to factor the outcome of the dialogue into efforts to increase their ambition and to update their nationally determined contributions, which detail nations' climate actions, in 2020.A High-Level stock-taking of actions taken before 2020 gave countries the opportunity to assess their current level of ambition. Another stock-taking is planned for 2019."While there are clearly gaps that remain, the stock-take of actions taken before 2020 and the Talanoa Dialogue have clearly shown that the world has built a strong foundation for climate action under the Paris Agreement", said Espinosa.

Brussels, Jan 28 -- At least 70,000 people participated in the second "Rise for Climate" march in Brussels aimed at pressuring the Belgian government and the European Union (EU) to increase their efforts to fight climate change The event on Sunday was described as Belgium's biggest climate march ever, exceeding previous demonstrations held this month, reports Xinhua news agency. The march began at 1.30 p.m. from the Gare du Nord and the crowds arrived shortly after 3 p.m. at the Place du Luxembourg, the headquarters of the European Parliament, where a series of speeches and concerts were performed. "Humanity is facing the greatest challenge it has ever faced on Earth, and it is imperative that we should make our politicians accountable," the organisers told the crowd of protesters. "The fight looks long and difficult, but we will not let go." The protesters waved banners and placards with slogans such as "No More Company Cars", "Act Now", "No time to waste". Sunday's march follows an earlier demonstration of more than 65,000 people held in Brussels on December 2, a date that coincided with the first day of the COP24 that opened in Poland, a major international meeting to discuss the fight against climate change. --IANS ksk \</doc>

India, May 11 -- The latest round of climate talks held at the UNFCCC secretariat in Bonn, Germany since April 30 drew to a close on Thursday. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to 2degC, and ideally to 1.5degC, by the end of the century. However, the scale and directions of climate action required to achieve this ambitious target is yet to be negotiated. The meeting in Bonn was the first step of this process. The main agenda of the recently concluded talks was to put together the contents of a negotiating text that would be presented for political discussions at the 24th session of the Conference of Parties in December 2018 Katowicze, Poland. With respect to the agenda, the outcome at the end of the two weeks has been a lukewarm one. While progress has been made regarding the 'rule book' or implementation guidelines, much remains to be done. Tasked with preparing a viable negotiating text in time for the COP24 , an additional session of discussions has been scheduled in Bangkok this September. While the Bonn meet was packed with hundreds of parallel meetings, progress on readying a text has been slow. The conclusion of the current session saw several civil society organisations and negotiators from developing countries calling for more urgency in talks. "I am satisfied that some progress was made here in Bonn. But many voices are underlining the urgency of advancing more rapidly on finalising the operational guidelines. The package being negotiated is highly technical and complex. We need to put it in place so that the world can monitor progress on climate action. We have made progress here in Bonn, but we need now to accelerate the negotiations," said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change in a statement to the press. While the preparation of a negotiating text is a steep enough task, what cuts the odds further is the notoriously difficult process of political discussions scheduled for COP24 in Poland. The urgency in discussions is likely to be influenced by IPCC Special Report on 1.5degC due to be published in October. An early draft, accessed in January, indicated that the current trajectory of emissions and associated global warming is nowhere close to the one required to achieve the targets of Paris Agreement. The just-concluded meeting in Bonn was also the venue for parallel discussions, including but not limited to the Suva Expert Dialogue on losses and damages due to climate change-which shall be the input for the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Losses and Damages-the Korinivia Joint Work on Agriculture-which delivered a road map of discussions on agriculture until 2020-and the Talanoa Dialogue, which is currently in the process of collating more than 400 submissions towards the facilitative dialogue process, which shall ultimately be discussed in the context of Paris Agreement.

In a guest contribution for Handelsblatt, EIB President Werner Hoyer argues that climate protection and a sustainable economy create many new jobs, contrary to certain claims heard at the COP24 in Katowice that they destroy jobs and slow economic growth. He warns that such voices are harmful, dangerous and wrong. Statistics conversely confirm that the green economy has been a driver for employment growth in recent years, with the number of jobs worldwide in renewable energy increasing by 45% since 2012. These arguments must be highlighted to the populace to raise the willingness to invest in climate-friendly measures, asserts Mr Hoyer. The EIB intends to allocate a total of EUR 100 billion towards climate protection by 2020, which will reduce the risk for private investors. He adds that the EIB supports over 1,000 cities and communities across the globe investing in sustainable infrastructure. If Europe is to grow sustainably, we must work together to make our economies greener, more resilient and fairer, Mr Hoyer stresses, concluding that the clock is ticking mercilessly and so we must act more quickly. In a page-2 excerpt from Mr Hoyers contribution, he is quoted as saying that Europe needs a circular economy that will improve the environmental footprint and strengthen Europe's competitiveness. \</doc>

Stakeholders from all over the world are gathered in Switzerland this week (14-15/05) to contribute to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Task Force on Displacement and to assist in drafting recommendations to avert, minimize and address displacement in the context of climate change. The conclusions will be presented by the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) at the Katowice Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in December 2018. Displacement of people in vulnerable communities is happening and we have given the role to identify and strengthen practical measures to address the challenges of climate change displacement. I therefore urge the community of practitioners to deliver on this mandate by COP24 , said Pepetua Latasi, from Tuvalu, and Co-Facilitator of the Task Force on Displacement. An average of 25.3 million people per year were forced to leave their homes due to floods, tropical storms, droughts, glacier melting and other natural hazards between 2008 and 2016. The impacts of such hazards are magnified by climate and environmental change, fast-paced urbanization and population growth. IOM, the UN Migration Agency, and the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) are jointly hosting the stakeholder meeting on behalf of the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement in Bogis Bossey, Switzerland. More than 60 experts from governments, regional organizations, civil society and international organizations in the field of migration and climate change are in attendance. We need to act, and to act together. Cooperation in this area is not only a necessity, but also a duty of humanity, to the women, men and children who are most often already living in vulnerable situations. It is clear that States and others need to strengthen efforts to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse effects of climate change, said Marie-Pierre Meganck from the Permanent Mission of France, speaking on behalf of the PDD Chairmanship. The Task Force on Displacement was created by States to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change following a decision adopted at the Paris Climate Change Conference (COP21) in 2015. The Task Force operates under the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM Excom). IOM and PDD are Members of the Task Force on Displacement. Since its creation in 2017, the Task Force undertook nine mapping exercises and analyses, covering policy, practice and data related to human mobility in the context of climate change. Task Force members identified and suggested solutions for several gaps related to international law, operational implementation, funding, and data collection and analysis. One of the objectives of the stakeholder meeting is to present and discuss these findings, and gather additional inputs from international experts. This meeting will be the first time that such a diverse group of stakeholders come together to review the relevant research and practices regarding displacement in the context of loss and damage under the work of the Task Force. There are many effective practices to prevent and reduce displacement and to help those who are displaced, but they must be harmonized, made more predictable and scaled up. This not only requires more resources but also stronger efforts of climate change, disaster management, development, humanitarian and migration actors to work hand in hand, highlighted Prof. Walter Kaelin, Envoy of the Chair of the PDD. If we invest in climate action today, we reduce the risks of displacement due to climate change for future generations. It will mean reducing losses and damages that occur when migration is a tragedy and a last resort. But we also have to think migration policy and practice with innovative eyes, so as to see how safe and orderly migration can provide solutions and opportunities for people who are affected by climate change to move in a dignified manner, said Dina Ionesco, IOM Head of Migration, Environment and Climate Change division. The event ends this afternoon (15/05) with a meeting for Task Force members only, chaired by the two Task Force co-facilitators, Australia and Tuvalu, to discuss the next steps. IOM is a leading partner in mitigating climate displacement. The Organization continues to lead climate migration programmes in more than 40 countries, including in the Pacific Islands, Latin America and on the Asian and African continents, while also working with governments and other stakeholders to drive policy coherence and development. The State-led Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) works towards better protection for people displaced across borders in the context of disasters and the adverse effects of climate change. Following up on the work of the Nansen Initiative, PDD, now under the leaderships of Bangladesh and France, works in partnership with IOM and UNHCR to find policy solutions for those forced to move and to cover data gaps. \</doc>

India, Sept. 5 -- Implementing carbon markets can incentivise climate action and emission reductions; however, the state of current negotiations makes that questionable Despite climate change making its presence felt by battering Bangkok with heavy rains in the past few days, the current weather conditions have not spurred the world's negotiators to swiftly decide on a working draft of the Paris Agreement "Rulebook", leave alone the looming deadline for its final adoption at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, this December. The pace of negotiations at the Bangkok climate intersession is lethargic and this follows through the current discussions around Article 6 of the Paris agreement, the article concerned with carbon market mechanisms. Co-chairs have provided negotiators with informal tools and have even reorganised the informal documents in a manner that can be read like draft rules, modalities and procedures for Article 6, and help expedite the negotiation process of deciding its provisional elements. Regardless, negotiators continue to reverberate the same propositions for the Article 6 as they did in the Bonn climate intersession in May. Decidedly, the state of Article 6 negotiations is business-as-usual. Continuing mistakes of the past Given the environmentally deleterious problems (such as outsourcing of emission targets, cheap credits corruption, non-additional projects etc.) faced in the previous carbon market mechanism, Parties like the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), Russia and the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), continue to support the need to transition projects from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) under the Kyoto Protocol into Paris' New Market Mechanism (NMM). Discussions with some carbon market experts who attended CSE's side event in Bangkok on the NMM, confirm our view that including projects from the Kyoto Mechanisms under NMM will be highly environmentally detrimental. Carrying forward environmentally non additional projects, such as "supply side "energy efficiency" projects and "clean" fossil fuel based projects that were prevalent under the CDM, will cripple efforts towards achieving overall emission reductions and deem the NMM non-credible and environmentally pernicious. Focus on markets neglects non-market environmental benefits While the market sections of Article 6 are receiving plenty of attention in Bangkok, non-market approaches under Article 6.8 are currently being neglected. The current chair's note/tool on Article 6 relegates Article 6.8 to an annex, which is most likely to be decided on after COP24 next year. The problem with this oversight is that markets are not suited to solving all climate problems, especially those related to the depletion of major carbon sinks. Forest and land-use sectors, in particular, are not suited to a private own-and-trade model. The incentive for profit making from trading cheap land sink reductions leads to unsustainable practices such as monoculture plantation and displacement of forest dependent communities. The political movement in several developing countries, India included, is to collectivise ownership of forests and forest rights among the communities who directly depend on them so that they reap the ecological and economic benefits. It is critical that the international negotiations on markets do not reverse this trend by including them under the market sections of sub articles 6.2 and 6.4. The outcomes of Article 6 at the Bangkok intersession will determine the fate of many communities in developing countries as well as the path the world will take towards addressing climate change. It is imperative that negotiators take good heed of the lessons learned from the past mechanisms and prevent further environmental and humanitarian harm.

Digitalisation is a new reality we cannot ignore. So, the question is not if, but how and when, said Finance Minister Edward Scicluna during the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels. The Council meeting was discussing the European Commissions proposal on introducing a tax on digital services of leading international companies. Minister Scicluna reiterated Maltas call that such an initiative should rather be based on an international consensus within the OECD. Minister Scicluna cautioned against haste since many issues remain unresolved. COP24 conference on climate change scheduled to be held in December 2018. In this context, the European Commission noted that it already provides funding to developing countries to the tune of EUR 20.4 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, on Monday, Minister Scicluna participated in the Eurogroup meeting which also discussed the draft budgetary plans submitted by the Italian Government. In the margins of ECOFIN, Minister Scicluna held a bilateral meeting with European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici. Finance Minister Scicluna was accompanied by Maltas Permanent Representative to the European Union Daniel Azzopardi. \</doc>

Following are UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres remarks as delivered at the closing of the high-level segment of the Talanoa Dialogue at the twenty-fourth Conference of Parties ( COP24 ), in Katowice today: In my opening statement to this Conference one week ago, I told you that this was the most important COP since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. I warned that climate change is running faster than we are and that Katowice must in no uncertain terms be a success, as a necessary platform to reverse this trend. To achieve it, I said that ambition and compromises were both needed. Never have the stakes been higher. I left Katowice hopeful, but uncertain. While I was away, three more reports were added to the long list of warnings signals: a Special WHO World Health Organization report on impacts to health due to climate change; a United Nations Environment Programme report which highlights the opportunities for reducing emissions in the construction sector; and NASAs research on the first signs of significant melting of glaciers in East Antarctica. Returning to Katowice, I see that despite progress in the negotiating texts much remains to be done. And today, the Presidency is presenting a text as a new basis for negotiations. Id like to thank the Polish Presidency for its efforts. I understand it takes an enormous amount of energy and work to organize such a conference. I also understand the weight of responsibility that this COP carries. There can be no doubt that it is a moment of truth. In this regard, key political issues remain unresolved. This is not surprising; we recognize the complexity of this work. But we are running out of time. Today, it is only fitting that we meet under the auspices of the Talanoa Dialogue. Id like to thank Fiji for initiating this Dialogue. Its no coincidence theyre the ones who established the process to discuss the ambition to meet a 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. Small island States know better than any of us the importance of meeting that goal. As I said in my opening remarks, for people living on those islands, climate change isnt a theoretical exercise about the future - its a matter of life and death today. Talanoas spirit is exactly how we can achieve a successful result in these last crucial days of COP24 . It is defined by openness, driven by optimism and focused not on political differences, but on the collective well-being of those living on this planet. And let me be open and transparent. The IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island States home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it. Over the last 10 days, many of you have worked long, hard hours and I want to acknowledge your efforts. But we need to accelerate those efforts to reach consensus if we want to follow up on the commitments made in Paris. The Katowice package needs to deliver the Paris Agreement Work Programme, progress on finance and a strong basis for the revision of National Determined Contributions under the Talanoa Dialogue. These three components are linked by one central idea boosting ambition. Ambition when it comes to predictable and accessible financial flows for the economic transition towards a low-emission and climate-resilient world. Ambition with respect to climate action. And ambition with respect to developing a flexible but robust set of rules for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Let us start by finance. The financial obligation from developed countries to support efforts of developing countries was established in the Convention when it was adopted in 1992more than 25 years ago. Its very difficult to explain to those suffering from the effects of climate change that we have not managed to find predictable support for the actions that must be taken. But there is some good news. The World Bank announced a new set of climate targets for 2021-2025, doubling its current five-year investments to $200 billion, both in mitigation and adaptation, in support for countries to take ambitious climate action. Here at COP24 , multilateral development banks announced the alignment of their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement and in line with the science-based evidence identified by the IPCC. It represents $35 billion in developing and emerging economies with an additional leverage on $52 billion from private and public sources. And before the COP, we saw a new Investor Agenda, as well as, for example, an announcement by ING that it would set science-based targets to shift its lending portfolio towards a low-emission future. These private sector actors are making important progress because they recognize the seriousness of the climate challenge we face and the opportunities related to addressing it. Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy. So, I urge you to find common ground that will allow us to show the world that we are listening, that we care. Developed countries must scale up their contributions to jointly mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. And we need to strengthen the Green Climate Fund. Germanys pledge to double its contribution in the current replenishment process is a very positive sign that I hope will inspire others to do the same. I have appointed the President of France and Prime Minister of Jamaica to lead the mobilization of the international community, both public and private, to reach the target of $100 billion in the context of the preparation of the Climate Summit I have convened in September of next year. \</doc>

Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry has committed funding to help support Pacific Islands in their work against climate change. Pacific Islands, including Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Marshall Islands are on the frontline of climate change and are already facing rising sea levels that could undermine livelihoods, security and human rights. the UK is playing a leading role at the UN Secretary Generals climate conference in 2019 to accelerate the transition to a climate resilient planet. to date, the UK has invested over 70 million in the Pacific, focusing on strengthening climate resilience and addressing security issues. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry has emphasised the UKs commitment to support the Pacific Islands in combating climate change. Opening the UK/New Zealand Wilton Park Forum on Climate Change and Resilience in the Pacific yesterday (16 December 2018), Claire Perry championed climate vulnerable nations and reminded governments, businesses, and international organisations everywhere of their absolute duty to tackle the biggest threat of our time. The event, jointly hosted by the UK, New Zealand and the Pacific Island Forum, turned discussions and recommendations into practical solutions in areas including multilateral negotiations, oceans, plastics, finance, risk assessment and migration, deepened engagement between the UK and Pacific Island leaders and promoted new stakeholder partnerships to enhance future collaboration. Speaking at the Forum, Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: The Pacific Islands are small, but they are mighty. Despite hardly contributing to climate change, they are driving international action to reduce emissions and building the resilience of their communities. We can learn so much from them. With the UKs world-leading expertise in tackling climate change and the Pacific Islands determination, we will work closely together to find practical solutions and drive transformational change. The UK has a longstanding relationship with the Pacific Islands and a shared agenda on Climate Change. During the COP24 summit in Poland last week, Claire Perry launched the UKs new Capacity Building for international negotiations Programme (CaBIN). The 15.6 million technical assistance programme will increase the capacity of low income and climate vulnerable countries to become leading voices in international climate negotiations. In addition, the government is providing 1.2 million in funding to support a Pacific Regional Nationally Determined Contributions Hub to support these countries in implementing their Paris Agreement commitments. The countries of the Pacific are at the forefront of the fight against climate change and we have much to learn from one another. Failure to recognise that these challenges are coming down to the line, and to find ways to mitigate them, or to sufficiently adapt to them, in advance, is no longer an option. Throughout COP24 , the UK cemented its position as a global leader in tackling climate change and achieved: driving genuine climate action to ensure a level playing-field for every country and doing its bit to secure a robust rulebook that applies to all nations urging higher global ambition, by ensuring the Talanoa Dialogue, which takes stock of collective global efforts to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, results in a firm commitment from all countries to review and update their international Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) continuing to play an active role in the negotiations while promoting UK experience and showcasing the scale and impact of UK International Climate Finance (ICF) since 1990 the UK economy has grown by 71 per cent while emissions have fallen by 43 per cent - the fastest progress on decarbonisation in the G20 since 2000 \</doc>

While billions of pounds have been pledged to tackle climate change, much more is required to turn the tide on global warming. And even more effort is required to translate the money that has been committed into action on the ground, according to Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change reported a 17 per cent increase in global climate finance flows from 2015 to 2016. While the Secretary-General welcomed the boost, she stressed that not only do the available funds still fall woefully short of the needs of developing countries, but that the most vulnerable states are struggling to access financing for climate projects, due to cumbersome application procedures and their own lack of capacity. Innovative financing options are needed for both demand and supply. On the supply side, countries with advanced economies need to deliver the promised finances required to deal adequately with the challenge of climate change, she told delegates at the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on climate finance yesterday. However, in addition to the quantity of finance available, the means by which it is made available to our member countries needs to be simplified. The modest amounts available are not currently reaching the intended beneficiaries because of complex application processes. \</doc>

India, Nov. 23 -- Developing countries, especially from BASIC, must shift away from committing to engaging in climate action depending on what has been committed by developed nations The 27 th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change held on November 19 th - 20 th in New Delhi, India, brought ministers from Brazil, South Africa, India and China to decide on a collective stance towards mitigating climate change. This joint ministerial meeting gives one insight on how these countries will politically place themselves on different climate issues, especially in the context of the upcoming Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) that is to take place in Katowice, Poland this December. As mandated by the Paris Agreement, countries will convene at Katowice to agree upon a set of modalities, procedures and guidelines that will enable the implementation of the Agreement, informally known as the Paris Rulebook. At the meeting, the BASIC ministers underscored the importance of addressing climate change through a low carbon transition and creating an "ecological civilisation". As they have done in previous meetings, the ministers argued for a balance to be struck between different elements of climate policy (primarily mitigation, adaptation, equity and finance) and emphasised on the obligation of developed countries to provide financial and technological support to developing countries. The ministers also reiterated the need to meet significant gaps present in the pre-2020 climate efforts-both in terms of adaptation and mitigation, and support provided to developing countries-and that these gaps should not create an additional burden on developing countries post-2020. Equity The joint ministerial statement had a keen focus on the issue of equity, a key and longstanding concern of the BASIC countries. Ministers reaffirmed that progress towards scaling global climate action would only occur based on the recognition of their national circumstances and an alignment of action with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The countries assert that embedding these principles within all elements of the Rulebook would promote climate justice, a just transition and an increase in ambition. They highlighted the importance for incorporating "flexibility" into the modalities, procedures and guidelines of the rulebook for developing countries, as one of the means of establishing equity. Textual options for this flexibility have been considered in the draft of the rulebook; however, the outcome on whether it will be available to some or all developing countries remains uncertain. Finance The second priority emphasised in the meeting related to the provision of financial support to developing countries. The ministers stressed on the need for developed countries to support the developing world through "adequate and predictable finance, technology development and transfer as well as capacity-building support", as these can be pivotal enablers for developing countries to increase their climate ambition. By asking for such support to be predictable, ministers allude to the need for improving transparency, through robust, clear methodologies and reporting requirements, to effectively track and account for the support provided and received. Such rules can cogently illustrate the progress made by developed countries on mobilising their $100 billion climate finance obligation to the Paris Agreement by 2020. IPCC report In light of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5degC released in October this year, the ministers took note of its findings that highlight the "high vulnerability of developing countries to climate change effects and high resultant costs of adaptation". The findings of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming make it incredibly clear that the impacts of an already warming world are significant, and that impacts at 2degC are catastrophic compared to those of 1.5degC. Yet, the BASIC ministers recalled the Paris goal of limiting the temperature rise to well under 2degC, and aspiring to limit it to 1.5degC, suggesting their continued pursuit of 2degC as the target temperature limit. The BASIC countries also contend that their nationally determined contributions (NDCs)- voluntary pledges of national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-have demonstrated "a high level of ambition in the context of poverty and sustainable development". However, the IPCC report unequivocally states that pursuing current national pledges under the Paris Agreement will set the world on track to reaching 3.5degC warming levels. It is evident that at its current form, parties' NDCs are inadequate in mitigating the deleterious impacts of climate change. All NDCs will require a radical overhaul to keep global actions in line with 1.5degC. While developed countries must take the lead to reduce GHG emissions and enable developing countries to scale climate action (as the ministerial note emphasise) developing countries (especially BASIC countries) must shift away from adhering to such a myopic view of equity- one that commits to engaging in climate action depending on that committed by developed nations. Doing so ignores the responsibility countries have to protecting their own climate-vulnerable people. It is critical that all countries actively step-up to rapidly reduce global GHG emissions within their own jurisdictions and collectively work with each other to limit warming to 1.5degC-and there is no better time than at Katowice for governments to promptly act on this.

India, Dec. 27 -- Here are the major policies framed, studies conducted and steps taken in the last year to protect the world from climate change While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report projected that the impacts at 2degC are "catastrophic" for the poor and developing nations like India, news reports also provided evidences of how change in the climate has been affecting the nation and its plans to cope up. Several flagship reports and studies released at the end of the year too provided facts and figures on the state of India's climate. Here is a low down on what the climate has been up to in 2018 WIDESPREAD IMPACT Change isn't productive The Economic Survey 2018 said climate change is taking a toll on India's agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes. Scarcity alert! Overall 600 million Indians will be moderately or severely affected by changes in temperature and rainfall, warned the new World Bank report released in June. Not-so-super 30 Farming of 30 traditional crops has been abandoned in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand in the last one decade due to climate change and migration, said a study by Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Nilgiri Tahr must worry Most of the existing habitats of the Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats will become unsuitable as global warming intensifies, projects a study by Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment. Yak under threat Yak-the lifeline of pastoral nomads in high altitudes of the Indian Himalayan region-is facing the threat of gradually rising temperatures in the region. NOT INACTION, BUT IN ACTION The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) came up with the country's first state energy efficiency preparedness index to achieve India's climate commitments Hit the gas India plans a Rs 65,000-crore project to reduce greenhouse gases from agriculture. The goal of the project, with a run period 2018-2025, is to "sequestrate" 49.9 million tonnes of carbon gases through improved agro-ecosystems. Pledge to perform In September, at the Global Climate Action Summit, mayors and government functionaries of Indian cities announced to scale up their actions to combat climate change and to protect people from hazardous climate impacts. In April 2018, more than 170 countries, including India, signed an agreement in London to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 50 per cent (based on 2008 levels) from shipping by 2050. 'Unsatisfactory' change Eight years after the Centre's direction to formulate a state action plan on climate change, the Maharashtra adopted a plan on climate change, but meteorologists and environment experts weren't satisfied with it. Himachal Pradesh became the first state in India to get its climate-smart agriculture (CSA) profile done. The agriculture department in Bihar with support from the Borlaug Institute for South Asia (Bisa) also launched a project to develop 100 climate smart villages in the state. Orissa deal On June 6, the state government released a five-year action plan to deal with climate change Capital health Delhi government's health department prepared a road map on how to deal with the seasonal changes in the Capital. Paris rulebook lacked balance At Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice on December 16, nearly 200 countries agreed upon and adopted a rulebook to implement Paris Agreement. But India and many other developing countries said the "balance" that they would have liked to see in the agreement was missing. WAY FORWARD: STUDIES DONE, POLICIES MADE Climate costs heavy A World Bank report released in June said climate change could cost India 2.8 per cent of GDP, and lower living standards of nearly half of its population by 2050. It added that average annual temperatures are expected to rise by 1-2 per cent over three decades. Time to act The latest report of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on October 8 warned that global warming is occurring faster than anticipated and that it can have devastating impacts if steps are not taken to cut down emissions. Risky business India ranked 14 th in the Global Climate Risk Index done by Germanwatch. It was released at the annual climate summit in Poland's Katowice in December. Carbon jump Global carbon emissions jumped to all-time high in 2018 and almost all countries contributed to the rise, with emissions in China up 4.7 per cent, in the US by 2.5 per cent and in India by 6.3 per cent in 2018. Shaping up The 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change, published in Lancet, said an average person experienced an additional 1.4 days of heat wave per year in 2017 compared to 2000. The research was conducted by the University of York.

United Nations, Sep 29 -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that climate change is absolute priority, while urging the international community to take immediate action Speaking at a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), an intergovernmental organization, which holds UN observer status, the UN chief said that with COP24 (the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) coming up in November, and the UN Climate Summit scheduled for September 2019, "the world needs to urgently step up action," Xinhua reported. The meeting, at UN headquarters in New York, comes shortly after the organization's annual summit, in Nauru on September 3-6, which reaffirmed in an official communique known as the Boe Declaration, that "climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific." "It will be the central concern to ensure countries enhance their ambitions over the next two years," he said, noting that "for the moment, unfortunately we are going too slow regarding what we promised in Paris. And what we promised in Paris was not enough." Forum leaders welcomed the secretary-general's leadership on climate change, calling for the appointment of a special adviser on climate change and security, to strengthen the global focus on climate change as a security risk. --IANS ahm/ \</doc>

Washington, Dec 8 -- US President Donald Trump once again railed against the Paris climate deal on Saturday, claiming that the ongoing riots in the French capital were taking place because the citizens there didn't want to pay "large sums of money, much to third world countries" His comments came as world leaders gathered in Poland for the UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) in which key aspects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement were set to be implemented. "The Paris agreement isn't working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France," Trump said in a tweet. "People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment." The US leader also claimed that the protesters in Paris were "chanting 'We Want Trump!'" The President, earlier this week, cited the riots as justification for pulling out of the climate deal, calling it "fatally flawed". Washington pulled out of the landmark deal in June 2017, saying that the "unfair" accord would have imposed "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the US, as it would have made the country pay for nations which benefited the most from the deal. That time he had targeted India and China, saying both these nations were benefiting most from the Paris deal, which was "unfair" to the US. --IANS soni/vm \</doc>

U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) spoke on the Senate floor highlighting how climate change is negatively affecting New Hampshire and the nation, and underscored the serious environmental, economic and public health consequences that are looming unless meaningful action is taken to combat the ongoing threat to New Hampshires way of life. Shaheen discussed how the changes in temperature are influencing fall foliage and maple production, as well as effects on New Hampshire wildlife, including the moose population and fisheries. Shaheens remarks come in response to a report on the effects of climate change that was released by the Trump administration last week. The report makes it abundantly clear that every American every American is affected by climate change, and the threat it poses will get worse unless we take action, said Shaheen. She went on to discuss how the effects of climate change, specifically rising temperatures that are shortening the fall foliage season, hurt New Hampshires outdoor recreation economy, impacting hunting, fishing, skiing, snowboarding and more, all of which contribute more than $4 billion to New Hampshires economy. Shaheen continued, If we fail to act on climate change, were going to see a steep loss of jobs in revenue that is going to affect our outdoor recreation industry. And its going to affect our traditional maple syrup industry. New Hampshire produces more than 100,000 gallons of maple syrup annuallythat makes it the third largest maple syrup producer among the New England states. Maple syrup is entirely dependent on weather conditions were already seeing the impact that these weather changes are having. Addressing the impact on Granite State wildlife, Shaheen said, Because of milder winters due to climate change, ticks and other insects arent dying off. That leads to infestations of our wildlife and trees. And according to New Hampshires Fish and Game Department, the estimated moose population in New Hampshire has decreased by more than 50 percent since the mid-1990s. That story is even worse for moose calves. A recent study by researchers at the University of New Hampshire found that winter ticks are the primary cause of an unprecedented 70 percent death rate of calves over a three-year period... And to quote Dr. Peter Pekins, a professor at UNH who is a lead author on the study: The iconic moose is rapidly becoming the new poster child for climate change in parts of the Northeast. In closing, Shaheen reaffirmed, Through smart energy policies, through thoughtful conservation measures, we can stop climate change from reaching dangerous, irreversible levels but we have to act now. Earlier this month, the Trump administration released an assessment by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which is a federally-mandated analysis on the effects of climate change, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years. The assessment is delivered to Congress and the President every four years. The report released last week shows that our world is already experiencing the effects of climate change and finds that changes in the likelihood or severity of recent extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires, can now be attributed with increasingly higher confidence to manmade warming. The analysis estimates that by 2090, global warming could cost the United States economy more than $500 billion a year in crop damage, lost labor and extreme weather damages. The report details the profound impact climate change is having, and will continue to have, on the Northeast region of the United States environment, economy and public health. The report also praises the Northeast regions participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and suggests that it could serve as a model for the nation. Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the Presidents anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trumps anti-climate executive order and restore our nations leadership role in the fight against global climate change. \</doc>

Dec. 11 -- Hundreds of thousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa will get access to electricity for the first time thanks to an extra 100 million of funding from the UK government. The new investment triples funds for the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP), to support up to 40 more renewable energy projects over the next 5 years. The new funding could unlock an extra 156 million of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023. Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each country's natural resources, and the electricity generated is expected to provide 2.4 million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. Power produced from new projects funded is expected to save around 3 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime, compared with fossil fuel generation - the equivalent to the emissions from burning 21,000 railway cars of coal or from 800,000 cars in a year. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: This 100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies. The new investment is in addition to 48 million previously committed to the REPP. The programme is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5 million people over the project lifetimes, creating 8,000 jobs during development and operation. Expected results from some of the 18 projects already receiving support from REPP are:  hydropower from the Nzoia River in Kenya, providing 290,000 people with energy and creating 330 jobs  mini grids in Nigeria which will provide 72 rural villages with pay-as-you-go clean, reliable energy, creating 2,500 jobs during construction and 430 when it's up and running  biomass plants in Ebolowa and Edea, Cameroon, providing enough clean energy for 520,000 people in a rural area creating 460 jobs  solar power to provide electricity for 87,600 people and business in Burundi, creating 300 part-time jobs and 50-full times posts  a hydropower plant creating enough power for more than 90,000 people for the first time in a remote part of Tanzania, creating 80 jobs in total The funding is part of the UK's commitment to invest 5.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020 to encourage ambitious action from other governments, the private sector and communities in the global effort to tackle climate change. To date, UK climate finance has:  supported 47 million people cope with the effects of climate change  provided 17 million people with improved access to clean energy At COP24  15.6 million to help countries vulnerable to climate change have a voice in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations  771,000 to help developing countries take part in COP24  an additional 45 million to the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions' (NAMA) Facility, co-founded by the UK, to help reduce emissions within an economic sector  an additional 1 million for the Global Innovation Lab, which helps innovative climate finance proposals move more quickly to implementation and attract funding Source: Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Government of U.K. \</doc>

Stockholm, Dec 8 -- American economist and 2018 Nobel laureate William Nordhaus said on Saturday that participation in climate agreements needs to be mandatory for all countries Nordhaus, a 77-year-old economics professor at Yale University, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for inventing macroeconomic analysis models that take into consideration the effects caused by climate change and the corrective policies that can be used to counter its damage. In an interview to Efe news, Nordhaus criticized previous climate agreements such as the yearly UN Climate Change Conferences, the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Agreement and the Paris Agreement. The American economist said none of them had imposed any kind of responsibility and instead were completely voluntary, which he described as the main reason they had made no effect. Nordhaus said that, in his view, countries should have certain obligations, responsibilities and commitments in order to obtain results from a climate deal. Nordhaus said this obligation had to "go beyond being mandatory" by also imposing punitive sanctions on the countries refusing to participate in an agreement. He added that he was keeping an eye on the ongoing Katowice climate change conference ( COP24 ), in which key aspects of the Paris Climate Agreement were set to be implemented. Nordhaus is currently in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, where he will receive the Nobel Prize alongside fellow American economist Paul Romer at an official ceremony on Monday. --IANS soni/ \</doc>

Nov. 22 -- The cycling team of Moving for Climate NOW, an initiative promoted by the Spanish United Nations Global Compact Network and Iberdrola, has been received this morning at the Moncloa Palace by the Spanish government's High Commissioner for Agenda 2030, Cristina Gallach. During the meeting, the participants presented Gallach with the Manifesto they will take to the Climate Summit ( COP 24 ) to be held from 2 to 14 December in Katowice (Poland). The CEO of Iberdrola Espana, Angeles Santamaria, and the Spanish United Nations Global Compact Network vice-president, Victor Vinuales, were present at the event, as representatives of the organisations promoting this initiative, which is now on its third iteration. Angeles Santamaria affirmed that "the energy transition towards decarbonisation will require everyone to contribute, along with courage in decision making, constancy in execution and sensitivity towards vulnerable communities, so as not to leave anyone behind. It's technically and economically possible, it's an opportunity and, moreover, there's a demand from society that demands future answers. For his part, Victor Vinuales explained that "climate is one of the pillars of the United Nations Agenda 2030 and it is a challenge that we cannot face individually. Collective action through alliances reinforces our chances of success, so our goal with this initiative is to expand the level of commitment reached to the largest possible number of stakeholders". The vice-president of the Spanish United Nations Global Compact Network added that "to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), we need collective action, government commitment, private sector drive, awareness and metrics". Moving for Climate NOW brings together over 40 participants from different countries and organisations, who will travel more than 600 kilometres by electric bicycle with the common objective of making society aware of the need to act urgently against climate change using all the mechanisms available. The bicycle rally will depart from Vienna on Monday, 26 November, and pedal to Katowice (Poland), the city that hosts this year's Climate Summit, where they will arrive on Sunday 2 December. Upon arrival, the members of Moving for Climate NOW will deliver the initiative's Manifesto to the United Nations Executive Secretariat for Climate Change. The document focuses on the Talanoa Dialogue, a space for conversation designed to encourage the participation of governments and civil society, with the aim of taking stock of the joint work carried out so far to achieve the climate objectives agreed at the Paris Summit in 2015. Iberdrola is the only Spanish company and the only energy company taking part in the debates in the technical phase of this Dialogue. The Moving for Climate NOW Manifesto states that "the Katowice Climate Summit is going to be very important because now is the time to finalise the main elements of the Paris Agreement and implement the conclusions of the Talanoa Dialogue to inform future climate action, also taking into account the conclusions and guidelines of the IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 oC and the magnitude of the measures required". It also calls for a just transition that pays special attention to vulnerable communities and leaves no one behind, and in which the energy sector plays a key role, contributing to the development of a model based on clean energy, sustainable mobility and energy efficiency. The third 'Moving for Climate NOW' Moving for Climate NOW is now in its third iteration, after pedaling to the Marrakech Climate Summit in 2016 (COP 22) and Bonn in 2017 (COP 23). This time, the cycle rally will depart from Vienna (Austria) on Monday 26 November and arrive in Katowice (Poland) on Sunday 2 December, after travelling more than 600 kilometres on electric bicycles. The team is made up of over 40 people from different organisations and countries, in line with UN Agenda 2030 SDG 17 (partnerships to achieve the goals). In this third Moving for Climate NOW the cycling team will be joined by representatives from associations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), government bodies such as the Spanish Office for Climate Change and the Biodiversity Foundation, initiatives such as Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), non-governmental organisations such as ActionAid and The Climate Reality Project and university centres such as the Pontificia Comillas University and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, among others. As on previous occasions, the rally will comply with gender parity, in line with compliance with SDG 5. The Spanish United Nations Global Compact Network At the international level, it has over 13,000 signatories. In Spain, it has more than 2,600 signatories, which makes it the country with the largest presence in the initiative. The Global Compact is working for sustainable development through multistakeholder and public-private alliances. As a United Nations initiative, it pursues the organisation's development goals, the main one being the fight against climate change, which is essential for the development of people, societies, the planet, prosperity and justice. About Iberdrola Iberdrola is a global energy leader, the number one producer of wind power, and one of the world's biggest electricity utilities by market capitalisation. The group is present in numerous countries and supplies energy to over 100 million people mainly in Spain, the United Kingdom (Scottish Power), the USA (AVANGRID), Brazil (Neoenergia) and Mexico.

Almost two decades ago, Iberdrola realised that climate change was a real challenge for humanity that required urgent action. It also realised that the electricity sector was key to providing solutions to combat this global problem. In this context, a few years ago Iberdrola launched its Action Plan on Climate Change, which focuses on four main areas: playing a leading role in major international organisations and business coalitions, active involvement in international negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, implementation of a Social Awareness Plan with internal and external measures and implementation of internal actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The High Commissioner for Agenda 2030 Under the direct authority of the president of the government, a high commissioner for Agenda 2030 has been created, with the rank of undersecretary, who is responsible for coordinating actions to comply with the United Nations Agenda 2030 and, in particular, to carry out the following functions: a) Monitor the actions of the competent bodies in the General State Administration in fulfilling the objectives of sustainable development and Agenda 2030. b) Promote the preparation and implementation of the plans and strategies necessary for Spain to comply with Agenda 2030. c) Evaluate, verify and disseminate the progress made in meeting the objectives of Agenda 2030. d) Collaborate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Spain's international dialogue on the global implementation of Agenda 2030.e) Promote the development of the information and statistical systems necessary to accredit progress in achieving the objectives of Agenda 2030. Society as a whole is called upon to participate in order to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals: central government, regional and local governments, civil society and the private sector, in order to fulfil the new global social contract without leaving anyone behind. A Spain that has achieved the SDG by 2030 will be the country we all dream of. For this reason, Agenda 2030 is already at the centre of our vision for state and government action. It represents a way of acting in the world. Source: Iberdrola \</doc>

Sept. 10 -- Nuclear power's electricity generating capacity risks shrinking in the coming decades as ageing reactors are retired and the industry struggles with reduced competitiveness, according to a new IAEA report. The declining trend may set back global efforts to mitigate climate change, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said. The 38th edition of Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050, published today, provides detailed global trends in nuclear power by region. Its projections[1] for nuclear electricity generating capacity are presented as low and high estimates, reflecting different driving factors that have an impact on the worldwide deployment of the low-carbon energy source. Overall, the new projections suggest that nuclear power may struggle to maintain its current place in the world's energy mix. In the low case to 2030, the projections show nuclear electricity generating capacity falling by more than 10% from a net installed capacity of 392 gigawatts (electrical) (GW(e)) at the end of 2017. In the high case, generating capacity increases 30% to 511 GW(e), a drop of 45 GW(e) from last year's projection. Longer term, generating capacity declines to 2040 in the low case before rebounding to 2030 levels by mid-century, when nuclear is seen providing 2.8% of global generating capacity compared with 5.7% today. "The declining trend in our low projection for installed capacity up to 2050 suggests that, without significant progress on using the full potential of nuclear power, it will be difficult for the world to secure sufficient energy to achieve sustainable development and to mitigate climate change," Amano said. The wide range in the projections is also due to the considerable number of reactors scheduled to be retired around 2030 and beyond, particularly in North America and Europe, and whether they will be replaced by new nuclear capacity. Nuclear power produced about 10% of the world's electricity in 2017, accounting for about one-third of total low-carbon electricity. As of today, the world's 455 operating nuclear power reactors have a record level of 399.8 GW(e) total net installed capacity. Over the short term, the low price of natural gas, the impact of renewable energy sources on electricity prices, and national nuclear policies in several countries following the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 are expected to continue weighing on nuclear power's growth prospects, according to the report. In addition, the nuclear power industry faces increased construction times and costs due to heightened safety requirements, challenges in deploying advanced technologies and other factors. Still, interest in nuclear power remains strong in the developing world, particularly in Asia where countries such as China and India need huge amounts of electricity and also want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Commitments agreed to at the 21st session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) could also produce a positive impact on nuclear energy development in the future, according to the publication. Regional Trends Northern America: Nuclear electricity capacity could decrease by almost one-third in 2030 in the low case or maintain output near 2017 levels in the high case. Latin America & the Caribbean: Nuclear electricity generating capacity is projected to increase in both low and high cases, but its role will remain small in the coming decades. Northern, Western and Southern Europe: Several countries in these regions have announced a gradual phase-out of nuclear power. Generating capacity is projected to fall by as much as 30% or slightly increase by 2030. Africa: In the low case, generating capacity is projected to remain at current low levels, with the possibility of greater expansion by 2050. Western Asia: Generating capacity is expected to increase significantly in the low and high cases. Southern Asia: Generating capacity is projected to continue to grow in both the low and high cases. Central and Eastern Asia: Nuclear electrical generating capacity is projected to increase significantly in both low and high cases. Footnote: [1] The projections consist of both available capacity (currently supplying electricity to the grid) and installed nominal capacity (available, but not currently supplying electricity to the grid).

Philippines, Dec. 3 -- Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) announced a joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to combat climate change. In a joint declaration, the MDBs committed to working together in six key areas considered central to meeting the goals of the agreement, which aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2degC, pursuing efforts for 1.5degC. The declaration was issued at the start of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. The MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC) had already pledged in December 2017 to align financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The MDBs plan to break their joint approach down into practical work on six core Paris Alignment areas-the building blocks-including: aligning their operations against mitigation and climate-resilience goals; ramping up climate finance; capacity building support for countries and other clients; plus an emphasis on climate reporting. This approach builds on the ongoing MDB contribution to climate finance, which, in 2017, amounted to $35 billion to tackle climate change in developing and emerging economies, while mobilizing an additional $52 billion from private and public sector sources. The MDBs will report back to next year's COP25 gathering on their progress under the six building blocks. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

Sept. 11 -- Bangkok, Thailand hosted a week-long intermediate session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) prior to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP-24 ) in Katowice, Poland in December. The conference, which ran from 4-9 September, allowed negotiating Parties to focus on moving forward the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP). IPIECA attended the conference, as an observer organization to the UN. Throughout the week, Parties concentrated on producing texts that clearly distinguished those elements that need to be agreed during COP-24 and those that can be handed over to the technical bodies for completion later. Deliberations continued late into the night on most days and made use of 'informal' consultations away from observer organizations. In a conclusive statement to the Bangkok conference, the Parties said, 'they are confident the progress agreed at this session provides a useful basis for further negotiations and a successful conclusion at COP-24 '. The chief negotiators are tasked with preparing a 'joint reflections' note identifying ways forward and preparing revised texts of the proposals by mid-October, well in advance of COP-24 , when negotiations will resume.

NEW DELHI: The special report on global warming by a UN body has set the tone for the upcoming climate conference in Poland where countries will now have to make efforts to align their pledges with the 1.5-degree celsius goal - a more stringent target than the existing agreement to limit average temperature rise within 2 degree celsius by 2100.The report of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released at Incheon in South Korea on Monday, clearly shows how half a degree of warming makes a big difference, adversely impacting global population and overall ecosystem through intense heat waves, sea level rise, melting of Arctic, erratic rainfall, reduction of farm yield and vanishing of living species.In fact, limiting warming to 1.5 degree celsius rather than 2 degree celsius could result in 420 million fewer people being exposed to severe heat waves, says the report.The report claims it's possible to meet the new warming target, provided nations together take "rapid and far reaching" transitions over next 10 to 20 years in land use, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities to cut emissions and reach 'net zero' around 2050 -- 25 years earlier than what they planned under the earlier 2-degree goal."India and many other countries are already facing impact of 1 degree celsius of global warming. It's therefore important for all the nations to make efforts towards limiting the warming. It's scientifically possible to do that. India has already taken several actions in the direction," the ministry of earth sciences secretary M Rajeevan told TOI.The report says the world will need an annual average investment of 2.4 trillion dollars between 2016 and 2035 (which is 2.5% of present world GDP) in energy system alone to limit the global warming to 1.5 degree celsius.Interestingly, it also talks about changes in lifestyles to enhance mitigation and adaptation options - the point India has consistently been flagging after getting it inserted in the preamble of the Paris Agreement."The new report from the IPCC has served as a final warning that we must get our act together -- now and quickly," said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science Environment (CSE) while asking the global communities to build a coalition to support the massive transformation required to achieve the 1.5-degree target.The IPCC's report was accepted by all countries, including India. Though the United States, which moved to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, too accepted the report, it has not endorsed it."By refusing to endorse the findings of the IPCC's 1.5 degree celsius report, the US has again given a clear signal that it would continue with its climate regressive agenda, which includes obstructing the work of the UNFCCC and promoting fossil fuels like coal and gas," said Chandra Bhushan, deputy DG of the CSE.Since the report examines pathways available to limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius and what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be, it will be a key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland in December, when governments review the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change.The Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 nations at COP21 in December 2015, included the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degree celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree celsius above pre -industrial levels." The reference period 1850-1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial levels.The governments have set a deadline for themselves to finalise the agreement's implementation guidelines at COP24 in Katowice (Poland). These guidelines will enable each country to act and contribute towards curbing emissions."In this sense, a successful outcome in Katowice will be a first and most crucial step towards achieving the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees and pursuing efforts towards 1.5 degree celsius," said the UNFCCC in a statement.

New Delhi, Dec. 03 -- The world is "way off course" in its plan to prevent catastrophic climate change, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday as the COP24 summit officially opened in Poland. After a string of damning environmental reports showing mankind must drastically slash its greenhouse gas emissions to avert runaway global warming, Guterres told delegates "we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough". The nearly 200 nations that signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal must this month finalise a rulebook to limit global temperature rises to well below two Degrees Celsius, and to the safer cap of 1.5C if possible. But the rate of climate change is rapidly outstripping mankind's response. With just one Celsius of warming so far, Earth is blighted by raging wildfires, extreme drought and mega-storms made worse by rising sea-levels. "Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption," Guterres said. Some of the nations most at risk from climate change will have the chance Monday to plead the case for immediate action. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji and president of last year's COP climate talks, said nations must act now to stave off disaster. "Or, God forbid, (we) ignore the irrefutable evidence and become the generation that betrayed humanity," he said. \</doc>

Brazilian farmers are working with nuclear scientists to utilize organic farming techniques to increase their productivity while at the same time reducing their carbon emissions in a project coordinated by the IAEA in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). They use stable isotope techniques to verify the effectiveness of their organic farming practices, reducing their costs, while helping the environment. Agriculture is a significant component of the Brazilian economy. The country is the worlds largest producer of coffee, orange juice and sugar and the second largest producer of soybeans and crop-based ethanol. Brazilian production of grain reached over 230 million tonnes in the 2016-17 growing season. Such massive agricultural production requires a heavy supply of nitrogen, which used to be added in the form of chemical fertilizer. Fertilizers contribute to climate change by producing large amounts of greenhouse gases during the manufacturing process and again when they are applied to soil in excess of what is actually consumed by the plants. Fertilizers containing synthetic nitrogen are also costly, so farmers in Brazil are moving towards the use of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). This technique, known as green manuring, involves the capture of nitrogen from the air, rather than from chemical fertilizers. Recent studies in Brazilian agriculture show that over 76% of all nitrogen in harvested grain and cereals is derived from BNF, and less than 20% is from synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, said Segundo Urquiaga, a research scientist at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation. The use of BNF via legume cultivation is now in full growth in Brazilian agriculture, particularly in central-west Brazil. Farmers plant various types of bean crops, including jack beans and velvet beans, that have bacteria in their roots which convert nitrogen from the air into a form suitable for consumption by other plants, fertilizing the soil. After the beans are harvested and the crop residue is left behind, primary crops such as grain and cereals are planted on the same field and benefit from nitrogen now in the soil, with only a minimal amount of chemical fertilizer required. The cost of organic manure in Brazil is estimated to be about US $1.00 per kg of N. If we consider not only the BNF associated to green manuring but all the economic benefits of BNF, that is, including soybean grain production, it is estimated that the replacement of chemical N sources by N derived from BNF in Brazilian agriculture can result in savings as high as US $13 billion per year, said Urquiaga. There has been a rapid growth of organic farming systems in Brazil, said Urquiaga. Limiting greenhouse gas emissions Though it is considered necessary to use at least some chemical fertilizer for crop production to be economically viable, integrating BNF into commercial farming operations has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by minimizing the need for such synthetic fertilizers. The Brazilian government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference . Given that agriculture accounts for 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the expanding implementation of these farming practices based on the use of BNF efficient plants will help the country meet this target. Addressing land degradation In addition to increasing crop production in a sustainable manner, green manuring helps prevent land degradation by improving the overall health of the soil. The green manures have been feeding the soil, which helps forestall its degradation, said Jose Donizetti, an agronomist at the green manuring company Pira Sementes in Brazil. A significant proportion of Brazilian soils are in an advanced stage of degradation due to intensive and improper use for agricultural activity in the past . THE SCIENCE To verify the effectiveness of green manuring, scientists use nuclear techniques involving stable isotopes. For example, scientists can track nitrogen-15 isotopes to confirm how much N is fixed by green manure or how well cash crops are absorbing nitrogen derived from green manuring. For this second purpose, they introduce samples of nitrogen-15 into the soil around the crops. Over a period of several months they observe how much nitrogen-15 is absorbed by the plants, which tells them how efficiently the plants are using the nutrients. Another example of a nuclear technique to evaluate the benefits of green manures is the analysis of the isotope carbon-13 to determine how much carbon from green manures will be recycled and transformed into soil organic matter after repeated growth cycles contributing then to increase soil quality. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland), Dec 7 -- Developed nations reduced emissions by 13 per cent in 26 years and since 2010 these have decreased by 4.4 per cent, likely due in part to climate actions that more than offset the impact of economic and population growth, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said The increasing levels of financial support provided by developed countries to developing countries could provide an incentive for a shift towards a low-emission and climate-resilient development pathway. The UNFCCC presented a new report at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) here that highlights both progress and gaps as developed countries implement climate actions to meet their targets in the period before 2020. The report titled 'Compilation and Synthesis' highlights that since 2010, emissions by these countries have decreased by 4.4 per cent, likely due in part to climate actions that more than offset the impact of economic and population growth. The report also finds that emission reduction measures by developed countries have increased and are paying off. This is an important foundation for accelerated climate action beyond 2020 under the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Financial support by developed countries reached $49.4 billion in 2016. This financial support increased by 13 per cent between 2013-14 and 2015-16 reporting periods. Additionally, technology transfer and capacity-building support is beginning to lay the foundation for developing countries' climate action beyond 2020. The report also clearly establishes that some developed countries are ahead of their targets, while others are behind. The full implementation of available measures and policies would be a critically important step for those countries to make progress. The report by the UNFCCC Secretariat is based on reporting that developed countries are obliged to undertake every two years. --IANS vg/in \</doc>

153 million for three major new UK aid programmes to help millions of farmers across Africa and South Asia affected by climate change and boost climate resilience in Ethiopia Foreign Secretary backs UK bid to host COP26, the United Nations climate change conference , in 2020 Speaking in Nigeria on a 5-day visit to Africa this week, the Foreign Secretary highlighted the vital role the UK is playing in tackling climate change, the most critical challenge facing future generations and which is ever more difficult to tackle in countries such as Nigeria, that face the additional threat of violent instability in parts of the country. Over the next century increasing temperatures and extreme weather across Africa will continue to have a profound impact on the lives and livelihoods of communities. That is why since 1990, the UK has reduced emissions and grown the economy at the fastest rate in the G7. It is important we continue international co-operation to tackle the causes of climate change, and prevent further potentially devastating consequences for regional stability, developmental progress and future prosperity. This is already being seen in the middle belt region of Nigeria, where the impacts of climate change are affecting grazing lands, and as such have become a driver of the violence between farmers and herders in the region. At a roundtable meeting in Abuja , the Foreign Secretary heard about the very real impact of climate change on people and communities across Nigeria, including the role it plays fuelling violent conflict in some parts of the country. In the Lake Chad Basin, desertification and land degradation caused by climate change have contributed to extreme poverty, one of the drivers of terrorism and the decade-long conflict that has left 10 million people without enough to eat every day and forced over 2.4 million people to abandon their homes. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: We know that if we dont work together to tackle climate change it will have a catastrophic impact on hundreds of millions of people across Nigeria, the Sahel and more widely across Africa, and indeed the world, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest. 9.6 million people living in Nigeria and the Sahel cant reliably get food and nearly 40% of people across the Sahel live on less than a $2 a day. Countries across the Sahel are among the most exposed to the consequences of climate change. We need to prevent the escalation of conflict and instability by tackling the root causes. Africa cannot be left to manage this crisis alone. Thats why the UK will lead efforts on climate resilience in the poorest and most vulnerable countries at this years UN Climate Summit, and has bid to host the vital COP26 in 2020. To help combat this threat, the Foreign Secretary has announced 3 major new UK aid programmes, totalling nearly 153 million, which will help millions of farmers across Africa and South Asia adapt to the effects of climate change and boost climate resilience in Ethiopia. Through the new Enhancing Digital and Innovation for Agri-food Systems and Livelihoods (eDIAL) programme, the UK will work in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and GSMA (the global network of mobile providers) plus other agribusinesses to develop digital solutions to improve returns for business and generate new evidence on how digital solutions can improve farmers productivity and resilience to climate shocks. The Strengthening Impact Investing Markets in Agriculture (SIIMA) programme will launch a new partnership with the Shell Foundation and Acumen to mobilise 125 million additional investment and encourage future investment, including from UK investors, in innovative agri-tech businesses. This will enable the scaling up of climate-smart technologies such as pay-as-you-go solar powered irrigation systems across Africa which will equip farmers with the tools they need to adapt to the effects of climate change. The UK government has pledged 57.5 million for both the eDIAL and SIIMA programmes. Finally, the UK will provide up to 95 million over 5 years (2019 to 2024), to support sustainable access to climate resilient clean water, improved sanitation services and good hygiene practices in Ethiopia. This programme will prioritise the drought-affected areas of the country, helping 1.2 million people by improving public health, education and nutrition. The UK is spending at least 5.8 billion on climate finance in 2016 to 2020 to help developing countries become more resilient to the impacts of climate change and support low carbon growth. Our co-leadership role on resilience and adaptation at the UN Climate Action Summit in September and recent bid to host COP26 next year demonstrate the UKs deep commitment to tackling climate change. \</doc>

- EBRD publishes report on vulnerabilities of major fossil fuel exporters like Kazakhstan in a future world that uses less oil - Kazakhstans fiscal revenues may nearly halve in next 20 years; public debt may surge - Policy responses include diversification, better management of revenues and spending, and longer-term fiscal planning Ahead of the major climate conference, COP24 , a new EBRD report looks at Kazakhstan, reliant on oil exports for about half of its revenues, and the implications for the countrys finances of a global shift away from fossil fuels. The changing dynamics in global energy markets are likely to put pressure on fossil fuel exporters such as Kazakhstan, the report says. These dynamics include the development of alternative energy sources, the falling costs of cleaner energy technologies, and countries commitments to achieving global climate goals. This will mean that export revenues may fall due both to lower exports and lower oil prices by up to 40 per cent in the next 20 years, leading to unsustainable levels of public debt in Kazakhstan. As oil is a major source of government revenue, this may in turn put pressure on the state budget. Therefore, good risk management on the fiscal side will be an important priority for fossil fuel-exporting countries. The first two scenarios would mean that the world falls far short of the goal to contain global warming to 2C; however, this may also mean that oil demand remains buoyant in global markets, in which case Kazakhstans fiscal position would not be under threat. However, if there is a worldwide shift to a greener economy, and oil prices settle in the region of US$ $65, then over the course of the next decade this could lead to depletion of the countrys national savings from oil. The most significant fiscal impacts are projected to occur in the late 2020s, suggesting that there is a window of opportunity of around a decade in which Kazakhstan could take action to address these impacts. Diversify revenue sources. Structural transformation that supports growth in the non-oil economy will reduce reliance on fossil fuels, building resilience to the fiscal risks of commodity price movements, strengthening the private sector and helping job creation. Manage the revenues from oil more effectively. Kazakhstan has built up large savings from oil in its sovereign wealth fund, which the country should now avoid depleting for current consumption, and should follow examples (including from Norway and Saudi Arabia) of investment in sectors not correlated with oil prices. Fiscal policies should exploit revenue-raising opportunities, providing incentives for economic development and cutting wasteful expenditure. As an example, distortionary fossil fuel subsidies may be reduced. The report is part of the EBRDs efforts to support green and inclusive growth in its carbon-intensive regions. The research was supported by the government of Kazakhstan and was developed with the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The new report builds on an earlier EBRD paper, published in 2015, Government assets: risks and opportunities in a changing climate policy landscape. Findings of the report will be discussed at an EBRD event at COP24 in Katowice, Poland. The EBRD is a leading investor in sustainable energy and green economic transition in its regions, with over 26 billion committed to projects in this area since 2006. The green economy is one of the Banks priorities in Kazakhstan. \</doc>

KATOWICE, POLAND: Days after US President Donald Trump called Paris Agreement "fatally flawed", his administration signalled its support for 'dirty fuels' backing a side event at the ongoing UN climate change conference ( COP24 ) promoting fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas.Though the event, showcasing "ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently" as possible, was marked by protests and short disruptions from civil society members, representatives of the Trump administration argued that the coal and other fossil fuels would remain in high demand across much of the developing world, and even in some developed countries throughout the century. They also emphasised that a rapid transition to 100% renewables is not yet feasible."All energy sources are important and will be utilised unapologetically," said Wells Griffith, international energy and climate adviser to the Trump administration. He argued that it was important to know how to utilise them in the most clean and efficient way, noting that the US has been doing a lot on carbon capture R&D and efficiency measures.A large number of civil society members started chanting "shame on you" and "keep it (fossil fuels) in the ground" the moment Griffith mentioned that "fossil fuels will continue to play a leading role" in eradicating poverty. Griffith earlier emphasised that "Alarmist should not silence realism ...We are here today to share our balanced approach". The discussions continued later when protesters, including an Indian woman activist, were allowed to make their points briefly. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

Dec. 6 -- On 6 December 2018, Jastrzebska Spoka Weglowa SA launches the operation of its hydrogen-powered bus. Guests may sign up for a ride to Katowice's historic Nikiszowiec district every day at the City of Katowice stand. The 75-passenger hydrogen-powered bus running a morning shuttle service for COP24 delegates will be available to take conference guests for a short journey every day at noon to the most historic mining district of Katowice from the city center. 11 December will be the only day when the journey will not be available due to the Hydrogen Day for the media with a scheduled demonstration of refueling the vehicle with hydrogen. The City Smile Ursus Bus is the first such vehicle manufactured by a Polish company that combines the advantages of the diesel technology and the electric vehicle technology. It is equipped with a pair of fuel-cell modules that use hydrogen stored in roof tanks to fully charge its traction batteries. This state-of-the-art technology makes the vehicle very quiet and environmentally friendly, because the combustion of hydrogen generates almost entirely water vapor. JSW SA is involved in the development of clean hydrogen technologies. The company has enormous potential in this area due to the prospect of using hydrogen separated from coke oven gas generated in JSW's coking plants. Purified hydrogen may be put to use, among its other applications, in hydrogen cells for emission-free generation of electricity, environmentally friendly public transport and powering electrical devices.

BERLIN, Oct. 24 -- The programme for the 16th International Conference on Renewable Mobility "Fuels of the Future" at http://www.fuels-of-the-future.com http://www.fuels-of-the-future.com Negotiations on the global climate agreement in Katowice in December 2018 ( COP24 ) mark a further milestone on the path towards the ambitious goals of limiting global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. How can the transport sector, drawing on the full range of affordable technological developments, contribute to attaining climate change mitigation objectives? The increasing diversification of drive technologies, along with production and use of renewable fuels, constitute challenges for sustainable renewable mobility, yet also provide the key to achieving the targets. The extensive programme offers a variety of topics with relevance for increasing climate protection in individual and heavy goods traffic, as well as in the fields of aviation and shipping. On the opening day, the focus will be on mobility, set between the conflicting priorities of climate protection, economic efficiency and user acceptance. In the plenary session, representatives from the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the European Parliament, European agriculture, the petroleum and automotive industries and the scientific community will discuss future prospects for the transport sector. On the second day of the conference, 11 forums will examine a broad spectrum of topics from all areas of renewable energy in the mobility sector: German and international experts will present news on technical developments, research, certification, market analysis and trade flows, as well as entering into discussions with conference participants. These forums, like the exhibitor forum with exhibition stands, will also offer scope for professional exchanges and networking. Source: German Bioenergy Association \</doc>

Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammeds closing remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the informal high-level Leaders Dialogue on Climate Change, in New York today: This has been a very rich discussion. I thank you for your contributions and concrete suggestions on how to increase ambition and accelerate climate action. Your presence sends an enormously powerful signal that we are all together in our battle against climate change. All of you, without exception, reiterated commitment to implement the Paris Agreement. Be assured that the Secretary?General and I deeply appreciate your leadership. I would like to reflect on the way forward. The Secretary?General reminded us that we need to do much more and do it much more quickly to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. That means more ambition and more action. The President of Poland and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reiterated the importance of implementing the Paris Agreement. Some of you have already hosted UNFCCC Conferences of Parties (COP). You know how important is for the negotiators that they are guided by clear political leadership. We need a successful outcome for COP24 and an agreement on the guidelines to make the Paris Agreement operational. We heard the sense of urgency, particularly from those of you in the most vulnerable parts of the world. Time is running out to keep global average temperature rise to well below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. 2020 may be our last opportunity to set the world on the path towards these goals. We need to close the gap between national commitments and emission reductions. We need a clear pathway towards net-zero emissions by 2050. All this calls for a deep transformation of our economies. Our energy, industry, agriculture and infrastructure need to become low-carbon and climate?resilient. This is particularly important for those countries that emit a significant percentage of global greenhouse?gas emissions. In addition to reducing the emissions, we need to increase our ability to adapt. This is a key instrument of prevention and risk mitigation. We are working closely with some of you to improve how we can assist your efforts. The most vulnerable countries depend on your decisions. Next years Climate Summit needs to reflect your efforts. Many of you have addressed the need to look at solutions to address climate change that are based on nature. We have to find a new way to shape our food systems, ensuring that they are not the drivers of deforestation, that we do not deplete our natural resources, including those of the oceans, and that we take care of our biodiversity. Tackling climate change can only work if it addresses and furthers the Sustainable Development Goals. To implement all these changes, we need adequate and predictable finance. Showing that finance is flowing in the right direction at the speed and scale required is critical to drive up ambition for both climate action and sustainable development. I thank France and Jamaica for their leadership of an initiative towards fulfilling the $100?billion?a?year pledge for climate action. Finally, I need to reiterate that this is not only a national effort. This is a global effort that needs partnerships with sub-national authorities, businesses, the finance sector and civil society. The swell of action that is happening at the city and regional level is fundamental in all the areas of transformation. We all need to push for more. I urge all of you to join the Secretary?Generals call for leadership and action between now and the 2019 Climate Summit. The challenge is enormous, but so are our capabilities when we act together. I look forward to working with you towards the next stop on our road map COP24 and then onwards to September 2019 and beyond. \</doc>

Canada recognizes and values the contributions of Indigenous Peoples to climate leadership at home and around the world. Their traditional knowledge and unique insights into the natural world are critical in tackling a challenge we must all face together: climate change. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, announcedin Katowice, Polandthat the Government of Canada will enable the creation of the Indigenous Peoples Focal Point at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to promote global Indigenous knowledge on climate change. This new position is the first of its kind and will be supported through an $800,000 investment by Canada over four years. The Indigenous Peoples Focal Point is a critical position for supporting the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, and it will enhance Indigenous Peoples participation and the consideration of their knowledge at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Focal Point will coordinate and lead work on issues related to Indigenous Peoples and climate change, promote awareness of Indigenous perspectives on climate change, and serve as a technical expert and advisor. Indigenous knowledge is a valuable asset the world can use to better understand climate impacts. In the lead-up to and at COP24 , Canada has been actively engaged in advancing the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform. Canada continues to encourage Parties to respect, promote, and consider their respective obligations on Indigenous rights when implementing the Paris Agreement. As part of its unwavering commitment to reconciliation, Canada will continue to promote and recognize the contribution of Indigenous Peoples in building resilient communities and tackling climate change. \</doc>

NEW DELHI: With countries gearing up to take part in one of the most complex UN climate conferences post-Paris deal, India on Tuesday made its view against historical polluters (rich nations) quite clear and reminded them of their responsibilities towards taking quick climate actions. "The developed countries seem to be shedding their responsibilities in pre-2020 period and delaying climate action, which is neither in accordance with the agreed principles of the UNFCCC nor the latest scientific findings (of the IPCC) on climate change," said India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan.He also made a case for developed countries to fulfil their pre-2020 commitments even in the post-2020 period.The IPCC had last month made a strong pitch for countries to make efforts to align their Paris Agreement pledges (emission cuts, adaptation measures and support mechanism) with the 1.5-degree Celsius goal, unlike the existing target to limit the global average temperature rise within 2-degree Celsius by 2100.The scientific findings of the IPCC had clearly shown how half a degree of warming makes a big difference, adversely impacting global population and overall ecosystem through intense heat waves, sea level rise, melting of Arctic, erratic rainfall, reduction of farm yield and extinction of living species.In the backdrop of such findings and the developed countries unfulfilled promises of their pre-2020 actions, the minister said, "This would not only put additional mitigation burden on developing countries in the post-2020 period but will also increase the overall costs and present greater economic challenges for us to make a transition to a low carbon growth pathway."Harsh Vardhan was addressing a ministerial meet of BASIC nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - here. The meeting assumes significance in view of the upcoming UN climate conference ( COP24 ) at Katowice, Poland from December 2 to 14 as a joint stand of these key four players along with other developing countries will play an important role in framing rules and guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement.Under Kyoto Protocol of the UN Convention, only rich nations (historical polluters due to their early industrialisation) are expected to cut their emissions and take other climate actions by 2020. But under the Paris Agreement (which is meant for post-2020 actions), the responsibility to cut emissions falls on all countries as per their voluntarily set targetsAppealing to all developing countries to prioritise pre-2020 agenda at upcoming COP24 as it would help build trust among nations and strengthen their faith in the multilateral process, Vardhan said, "Developed countries should be encouraged to fulfil their pre-2020 commitments even in the post 2020 period and this will form a strong foundation for post 2020 action."Other BASIC partners too sought actions from rich nations, underlining in their joint statement that the enhanced pre-2020 actions (of developed countries) are the foundation for post-2020 actions (under the 2015 Paris Agreement where all countries are expected to act). They underlined that the implementation gaps in pre-2020 actions should not put an additional burden on developing countries in the post-2020 period and urged rich nations to "close the pre-2020 implementation gaps by 2023 which can be a useful input for the first global stock-take".Referring to the developed countries' lacklustre approach towards their commitments on climate finance (to support developing countries), Vardhan said, "Developed countries are far from realising their climate finance commitment of mobilising $100 billion per year by 2020. They should not only make urgent efforts to honour this commitment but also progressively and substantially scale up their financial support in the post-2020 period."Stating that the finance is one of the critical enablers of climate actions in developing countries along with technology development and transfer and capacity-building support, the minister said, "Any regression or slow progress on these will hamper the progress of developing countries towards achieving higher ambition in their actions."We find that there is a considerable difference in what is communicated as climate finance by different countries. Public finance in the form of grants and concessional finance is required for climate actions." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), released the following statement regarding the agreement reached at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ): However, this agreement is not perfect. Unfortunately, it falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade. The entire world must be doing even more and setting even more aggressive targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change. While we certainly can and should be doing more, todays agreement gives me hope that bolder future agreements are possible. As the rest of the world sets off to meet their Paris climate targets, the Trump Administration has decided to forego the economic opportunities of a clean energy future and instead tie our economy to the dirty fossil fuels of the past. The path this administration is taking our country down is bad for our economy and disastrous for our climate. But we dont have time to wait for President Trump and other climate deniers to come to their senses. We must continue to push forward and work in Congress to make the changes that we know are needed to protect our planet. \</doc>

Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement after international negotiators at the United Nations Conference of Parties 24 reached a deal to adopt rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement. As part of the deal, every country will need to follow uniform standards for measuring carbon emissions. Ahead of 2020, countries will be required to raise ambition for reducing the emissions at the heart of causing climate change. Recent scientific reports showed a disturbing path toward global destruction due to climate change, but negotiations in Poland gave us a hopeful alternative roadmap for action, said Senator Markey. The rulebook agreed to at COP24 is a ray of hope despite President Trumps abysmal record on climate change. It will serve as a solid foundation for all nations to continue working toward the goals negotiated in Paris. Support from people around the world for the Paris climate agreement has never been stronger. Despite The Trump administrations giveaways to fossil fuel interests, the United States is still in, and we can make progress. From cities and states setting bold climate goals, to business and entrepreneurs developing clean energy solutions, the United States has the technological might to lead the world in emissions reductions. And now, with a new Congress set to begin, we must exert the political will to do it. In November of 2018, Senator Markey introduced a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. \</doc>

The Directorate of Environment and Ocean Affairs (DIMA), in association with the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, and with the support of the Ocean Conservancy and Ocean-Climate Platform, held on October 2 and 3 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the regional workshop "Because the Ocean: Opportunities to include the ocean in the NDCs in Latin America". The objective of this meeting was to make the countries of the region to incorporate the ocean in their Nationally Determined Contributions, in the context of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The aim was to discuss options for intraregional cooperation and other possible actions, including some for the COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. Representatives from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) participated in the workshop. At the national level, members of the Ministry of the Environment, the Undersecretariat of Fisheries and academia were also present, especially from the Climate and Resilience Science Center (CR) 2. The participants shared their visions, generating an enriching dialogue on the subject, including aspects such as policies for the adaptation of coastal-marine ecosystems, the role of the ocean as a gas sink, as well as fishing as an economic activity affected by climate change. This initiative is a continuation of Chile's interest in promoting the care of the ocean and its close link with climate change. This has been translated concretely in an active participation of our country in the Our Ocean Conferences, the leadership through the declarations "Because of the Ocean" made in the COP21 and COP22, as well as the formation of alliances and joint work with countries and non- state actors in the development of this agenda. \</doc>

An Indian private project, Help-UsGreen, which collects flowers from temples and mosques across cities/ towns in Uttar Pradesh and recycles them to produce natural incense, organic fertiliser and biodegradable packaging material, is one of 15 ground-breaking projects from around the world to win this year's UN climate action award. The Indian enterprise has been identified for its potential to clean up the Ganga and empower thousands of women by engaging them in eco-friendly recycling work round the year. The project, employing 1,260 women, helps prevent pesticides from entering the river through temple waste. Developed as the world's first profitable solution to the temple waste problem, HelpUsGreen's products are handcrafted by women who earlier used to be manual scavengers. The project aims to provide livelihood to 5,100 women and recycle 51 tonnes of temple waste daily by 2021. Over 11,000 tonnes of temple waste has been recycled under the project so far. Citing the initiative as a key ground-breaking project, the UN climate change body said HelpUsGreen could be easily replicated in any city. It currently works in Uttar Pradesh, with plans to expand to Bangladesh and Nepal. New products are in the works (including a biodegradable styrofoam alternative) and they are in talks with the government to scale up across the country. The other 14 projects which won the UN 'Momentum for Change' climate action award showcase how ideas, big and small, are successful in tackling climate change. These 15 game-changing initiatives from 14 countries were honoured with the award at a special ceremony at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) here on Tuesday evening. \</doc>

Africas Sahel region is sitting on a goldmine when it comes to renewable energy, the African Development Bank said on Tuesday at COP24 . The Bank noted that at a time when about 600 million Africans are without electricity, stable economies can be built by harnessing solar energy. Astrid Manroth, Director of Delivery and Impact at the African Development Bank, told a press conference on the sidelines of the Climate Summit in Katowice Poland that the African Development Bank has put energy in Africa at the top of its priorities. Particularly the integration of renewable energy does require stable grids and available grids for transmission and distribution to the end customers,. Manroth explained. We are working with utilities to strengthen the distribution networks, there is quite a nice example especially Kenya where we have partnered with utility where we strengthen the last mile energy connection within 600 meters of all substations. She added that Renewable energy is a priority in their(the Sahel region) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. With the Desert to Power Initiative, the Bank is collaborating in an innovative approach to catalyze solar investments from both the public and especially the private sector and institutional investors. This form of blended finance is intended to help fill in the shortfalls in capital resources manifested in renewable energy project cycle in Africa. The Initiative aims to develop 10GW of solar energy across the Sahel region by 2025, which could provide access to renewable electricity to over 250 million people, thereby solving many of the regions energy access challenges. By tapping into one of the worlds largest sources of solar power, this traditionally underdeveloped region could be dramatically transformed. The African Development Bank has partnered with the Green Climate Fund to see the project come to life. \</doc>

The 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will take place in Katowice, Poland, December 2-14, 2018. Judith Garber, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) at the Department of State, will serve as the U.S. head of delegation. U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher will represent the United States at the World Leaders Summit on December 3. The U.S. delegation will also include officials from the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The Administrations position on the Paris Agreement remains unchanged. The United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so. The United States is participating in ongoing negotiations, including those related to the Paris Agreement, in order to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests. During the Conference, the U.S. delegation will share successful strategies in growing the economy while providing affordable, abundant, and secure energy to Americans, promoting jobs, protecting the environment, and reducing emissions. U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions have fallen by 14 percent since 2005, even as the U.S. economy has grown by 19.4 percent. This world-leading achievement has been possible because of innovation and entrepreneurship that has led to the development and commercialization of innovative technologies across the entire U.S. energy portfolio. \</doc>

Poland, Dec. 12 -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has launched a new platform aimed at helping its developing member countries in Asia and the Pacific mobilize funding to meet their goals under the Paris Agreement. The NDC Advance platform will help countries mobilize finance to implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) regarding greenhouse gas emissions that each country has voluntarily committed to under the Paris Agreement. NDCs also describe priority actions for countries to adapt to climate change. The announcement was made at the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, which is aiming to finalize a rulebook for the Paris Agreement when it goes into effect on 1 January 2020. The agreement aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2&#194;&#176;C, while aiming for 1.5&#194;&#176;C. NDC Advance is funded through a $4.55 million grant from ADB and will have three aims: providing technical assistance that helps countries better engage with potential sources of climate finance and to make use of innovative finance mechanisms; identifying and prioritizing climate projects; and supporting countries in tracking how projects deliver against their NDC goals. The new initiative will help propel the climate actions ADB has committed to under its Strategy 2030 program. ADB earlier this year committed to ensuring that 75% of its operations will support climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030, while providing cumulative climate financing of $80 billion from its own sources between 2019 and 2030.

NEW DELHI, Dec. 10 -- The United States and oil- and gas-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait have not endorsed a report that warned of devastating consequences of global warming, casting a shadow on a climate meet in Poland that experts view as a make-orbreak moment for the planet. At the Katowice climate change conference ( COP24 ), these countries decided only to "take note", and not "welcome", the crucial Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in South Korea in October. The report said countries will have to make unprecedented transitions in all sectors to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century. It also said mega cities in India were going to experience severe heat-stress and air pollution if that was not the case. The US and the other countries were part of the deliberations in Incheon when the report was released, but their stand in Poland appeared to be a setback to scientists and activists who say urgent action is needed to fight climate change. In fact, IPCC scientists have predicted that a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature is likely as early as in the 2030s. In Poland, 195 nations, part of the Paris Agreement in 2015, are holding two-week talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed three years ago. Under the Paris pact, richer nations - responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions - are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access to make their economies greener. But negotiations under way in Katowice to evolve the rulebook for enforcing the Paris Agreement have made little headway a week into their duration amid persisting differences over key issues such as climate finance. Delegates to COP24 , as the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is known, are discussing a 307-page draft rulebook that will spell out how various provisions of the agreement kick in to force. Professor NH Ravindranath of Indian Institute of Science, who was a co-author of IPCC's fifth assessment report, said Saudi Arabia was a hard negotiator that hired the best people to protect the interests of oil-exporting countries. "The world will have to start cutting down on coal and oil consumption very soon...Climate change concerns will surely lead to increased use of electric cars, rails, metros, biofuels, improved efficiency...All this will lead to decline in demand for oil. So surely Saudis will not be happy," he said. Joyashree Roy, a professor of economics at Jadavpur University (on lien) and one of the Indian authors of the IPCC report titled 'Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees', said, "The special report was published on October 8, 2018, after it was approved by all countries. The Paris agreement was adopted by 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015...So, there is no question of further approval or acceptance..." Aarti Khosla of Climate Trends, a research and communications organisation, said the approach by Saudi, the US and Russia on the report could certainly serve short-term interests, but it would take the wind from the sails for several small and least developed countries, which are facing the worst impacts of global warming. "Limiting the worst impacts of climate change requires strong political will. At a time when extreme events continue to build, if nations go back and question fundamentals, there will be less hope for global collective climate action," she said. A senior official of the Union environment ministry said the US was present in Incheon when the report was approved and released. "I don't think this can be taken as a rejection of the IPCC report...They have decided not to welcome the report and applied Rule 16, which means the matter will be discussed again at the next COP. Let's see how the rest of the Paris rule book comes up and how soon." Developing nations and least developed countries have been asking developed nations, particularly the US, to take historical and moral responsibility for being one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters. Smaller nations have asked for equity in CO2 emission cuts to curb global warming, a time frame and funding from developed nations for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The US has been resisting large cuts in CO2 emissions. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) has said a lack of energy remains as a significant impediment to Africas economic and social development. As a result the AfDB has embarked on a huge desert solar initiative to make Africa a renewable power-house titled Desert to Power Initiative. This solar project is set to stretch across the Sahel region and expected to connect 250 million people with electricity by tapping into the regions abundant solar resource. According to AfDB, energy poverty in Africa is estimated to cost the continent 2-4 % GDP annually. Recently, the details of the Desert to Power Initiative were outlined as part of the Paris Agreement climate change talks at COP24 in Katowice, Poland. Energy is the foundation of human living our entire system depends on it. For Africa right now, providing and securing sustainable energy is in the backbone of its economic growth, recently said Magdalena J. Seol in the AfDBs Desert to Power Initiative. The Initiative aims to develop and provide 10 GW of solar energy by 2025 and supply 250 million people with green electricity including in some of the worlds poorest countries. At least 90 million people will be connected to electricity for the first time, lifting them out of energy poverty. Currently, 64% of the Sahels population covering Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea lives without electricity, a major barrier to development, with consequences for education, health and business. A lack of energy remains as a significant impediment to Africas economic and social development. The project will provide many benefits to local people. It will improve the affordability of electricity for low income households and enable people to transition away from unsafe and hazardous energy sources, such as kerosene, which carry health risks, added Seol. Construction of the project will also create jobs and help attract private sector involvement in renewable energy in the region. According to AfDB, many women-led businesses currently face bigger barriers than men-led enterprises to accessing grid electricity so the project has the potential to increase female participation in economic activities and decision-making processes. The project has been launched in collaboration with the Green Climate Fund, a global pot of money created by the 194 countries who are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to support developing countries adapt to and mitigate climate change. The program is designed to combine private sector capital with blended finance. If you look at the countries that this initiative supports, theyre the ones who are very much affected by the climate change and carbon emissions from other parts of the world, said Ms Seol. Given this, the investments will have a greater effect in these regions, which have a greater demand and market opportunity in the energy sector. Women are usually disproportionately negatively affected by energy access issues. Providing a secure and sustainable electricity creates positive impact on gender issue as well. The African continent holds 15% of the worlds population, yet is poised to shoulder nearly 50% of the estimated global climate change adaptation costs, according to the Bank. These costs are expected to cut across health, water supply, agriculture, and forestry, despite the continents minimal contribution to global emissions. However, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Africas renewable energy potential could put it at the forefront of green energy production globally. It is estimated to have an almost unlimited potential of solar capacity (10 TW), abundant hydro (350 GW), wind (110 GW), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW) and a potential overall renewable energy capacity of 310 GW by 2030. Other renewables projects in Africa include The Ouarzazate solar complex in Morocco, which is one of the largest concentrated solar plants in the world. It has produced over 814 GWh of clean energy since 2016 and last year, the solar plant prevented 217,000 tons of CO2 being emitted. Until recently, Morocco sourced 95% of its energy needs from external sources. In South Africa, the Bank and its partner, the Climate Investment Funds, have helped fund the Sere Wind Farm 46 turbines supplying 100 MW to the national power grid and expected to save 6 million tonnes of greenhouse gases over its 20-year expected life span. It is supplying 124,000 homes. COP24 is the 24th conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year countries are preparing to implement the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the worlds global warming to no more than 2C. \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 12 -- India's Gujarat state got a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) award for women's leadership with low cost and sustainable technology to tackle storms. The Gender Just Climate Solutions Award of the Women and Gender Constituency, one of the nine stakeholder groups of the UNFCCC, was given to Gujarat at a side event of the ongoing 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland in the technical category. The award mentions that Gujarat, prone to short periods of heavy rains and flooding, followed by long droughts, has combined women's leadership with low cost and sustainable technology to tackle the severe impacts of excessive rainwater from storms. This technology protects groundwater via a filtration system and increases soil fertility by reducing salinity. The units conserve one to four million litres of runoff water and can irrigate 22 acres during the dry season. While women still do not own the land, by owning the technology they help their community double their harvest which in turns has a tremendous impact on their role in the community as decision-makers. Since 2011, more than 3,500 units have been installed in India and also increasingly abroad, in Ghana, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Each installed "Bhungroo" provides food security for 30 to 100 people, generating an additional income of about $5700 per year, a statement by the UNFCCC said. Established in 2009, the Women and Gender Constituency now consists of 28 women's and environmental civil society organisations, who are working to ensure that women's voices and their rights are embedded in all processes of the UNFCCC framework.

The Trump administration joined with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait to vote against accepting the findings of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report during the COP24 UN Climate Negotiations. The report projects that the catastrophic effects of the climate crisis could include food shortages and droughts by 2040. The United States refused to welcome the scientific findings, claiming that including that language would constitute endorsing the report. This news follows Washington Governor Jay Inslee introducing a 100 percent clean energy bill, Colorados Xcel Energy announcing it plans to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, Cincinnati, Ohio becoming the 100th U.S. city to transition to 100 percent clean energy, and 2018 being on track to be the second-biggest year for coal plant retirements since 2010, with over 17 gigawatts expected to be taken offline. The annual UN climate negotiations are currently underway in Katowice, Poland, and yesterday, the Trump administration hosted a pro-coal side event at the climate conference. In response, Steve Herz, Sierra Clubs International Climate and Energy Campaign Director, released the following statement: Donald Trumps denial of the reality of the climate crisis has done nothing but threaten the health of everyone on this planet and has only succeeded in further isolating the United States from the vast majority of the other countries of the world that are actively working to combat the climate crisis. The Trump administration is shamefully trying every tactic in the book in their attempt to derail climate solutions, but local leaders across the United States have and will continue to put the health and safety of people and communities first. \</doc>

At one level there is relief that it is all over. We now have a rulebook that operationalises the Paris Agreement. At another level, there is the stark realisation that we are in a deep trouble. The Paris rulebook is completely inadequate to contain the worst impacts of climate change. I have just returned from Katowice, Poland, where the 24th Conference of Parties ( CoP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held. The negotiations went into extra time. But such delays are not always for valid reasons; they are also by design. Some big powerful countries drag negotiations and tire out negotiators from small/developing countries. As these negotiators cannot sustain the pressure indefinitely, they ultimately acquiesce to a weak agreement. That is what exactly happened in Katowice. In the first week, the US, Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia-all fossil fuel-dominant economies-held up negotiations on the matter of "welcoming" or "noting" the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report Global Warming of 1.5C. Words matter in international treaties. "Welcoming" the IPCC report would have meant that countries had accepted the findings of the report, and hence, would be guided by its conclusions. "Noting", however, meant that countries had taken note that such a report existed and they could use its conclusions as they wished. At CoP24 , both these words were not accepted and a list of fuzzy words was used to marginalise the IPCC report. This meant that the CoP24 could not start a process to increase the ambition of countries to cut emissions. Therefore, the Katowice negotiations will be best remembered as an anti-science CoP for its failure to take into account the findings of the IPCC's special report on 1.5C. But it will also be remembered for coming out with a rulebook that undermines the global effort to combat climate change. Everyone deeply involved with climate negotiations knew it all along that the Paris Agreement will not meet its own goal of "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels". However, given the fading interest in multilateralism, it was adopted to keep all the countries together in the international process. In such a case, the rulebook of the Paris Agreement had to be strong enough to hold countries accountable to whatever they had agreed under the treaty. Unfortunately, the rulebook further dilutes the Paris Agreement. Let me elaborate. The Paris Agreement is a combination of bottom-up and top-down features. The bottom-up features are those which countries can decide on their own. For instance, countries can decide what they want to do to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change. These domestic measures are called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The top-down elements are those where countries are bound by the rules of the treaty-countries are bound by the rules on reporting requirements, stocktaking of the collective action, design of the carbon market and finances. Some of these top-down rules have been significantly diluted. Reporting and transparency: Under the Paris Agreement, countries must report on their progress on NDCs. At Katowice, a certain flexibility was given to developing countries-which have lower capacity to collect and analyse information-to provide less rigorous information. But developing countries will have to provide "self-determined" time frames to improve the quality and quantity of reporting. Overall, while developing countries agreed to the overall transparency framework, developed countries diluted the framework of their financial contributions. Financial contribution: In the Paris Agreement, developed countries had agreed to provide $100 billion each year by 2020 to developing countries. The rulebook had to define what constituted "finance", and how it would be reported and reviewed. At Katowice, rules on finance were significantly diluted. Firstly, developed countries have the choice to include all kinds of financial instruments-concessional and non-concessional loans, grants and aids from various public and private sources-to meet their commitments. Secondly, rules on reporting of financial contributions and its reviews for adequacy have been significantly weakened. Developed countries now have the freedom to "self-determine" the kind of financial resources they want to give and do this without any strong mechanism of accountability. Global stocktake (GST): GST was the most important top-down element in the Paris Agreement to increase ambition of countries. It was supposed to measure global progress, identify barriers and give recommendations. However, the GST rulebook has been watered down to a non-policy prescriptive process. That is, this process will neither give any recommendations to individual countries or a group of countries, nor will it give any prescriptive policy. The result is that a lot of technical information will be collected without any clear recommendation to increase ambitions of mitigation or finance. Carbon market: The Paris Agreement allows emissions trading markets between two or more countries (such as the EU Emissions Trading System), as well as a unified market for all countries (which succeeds the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism). It also provides for a non-market mechanism to reduce emissions and enhance sinks in forests and land. But, in Katowice, there was virtually no progress made on non-market mechanisms, while all big countries, developed and developing, seemed to have great interest in trading carbon credits. It is important to remember that carbon trading in the past had major problems, including cheap carbon credits from dubious projects, and corruption, which has put a big question mark on the overall emission reductions. Under the Paris Agreement, these drawbacks were to be removed so that real emissions reductions could be achieved. However, the rules made so far indicate that many of the problems of the past are likely to remain. For instance, the rulebook has different rules for different markets, which is non-transparent and makes emissions reductions unverifiable. Similarly, trading has been allowed for sectors which are not covered in a country's emissions targets. This will dilute the overall mitigation effect. Moreover, many technical issues of the market mechanism have been shifted to the next CoP in 2019. Post Katowice, the Paris Agreement is all about "self-determined" processes and carbon markets. So the UNFCCC is now simply a platform to collect and synthesise information. It doesn't have the tools to drive global collective action to combat climate change. In such a situation, one needs to seriously question the raison d'etre of the UNFCCC. The bottom line is that countries are now on their own to mitigate, adapt as well as pay for the costs of climate impacts. But this "self-determined" framework cannot keep the global temperature rise below 2C. So, we have to quickly find ways to bridge the gaps that the Paris Agreement has created. Can this gap be filled via sectoral and regional platforms?Can we develop platforms that would allow large-scale diffusion of transformational technologies across the world? Or, do we scrap the Paris Agreement and start all over again? These are questions of our time. I will dwell on them in subsequent columns.

NABARD will support rooftop solar power in India with the Green Climate Fund of $100 million to fight the challenges of climate change The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has signed an agreement with Green Climate Fund (GCF) to infuse around $100 million on a project that is targeted to install solar photovoltaic (PV) power capacities across India. NABARD, in an official statement, said that Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd, an investment service provider, would execute the $250 million project. It added, "Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd. will receive the GCF support through NABARD, which is the National Implementing Entity (NIE) for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)." The latter promotes fund that supports the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the ongoing COP24 in Katowice, Poland. The GCF had approved this $100 million line of credit for the development of solar rooftops by NABARD in March this year. Rooftop solar PV funds Over the past few years, the government as well as private entities have been investing in boosting the rooftop solar PV capacity of India. The country has set an ambition of creating about 100 GW solar power capacity. And, to accomplish this, several projects have been initiated, some of which are in the process. Last year the solar industry witnessed a slew of investments. The State Bank of India and the World Bank announced Rs. 23.2 billion in credit facilities for seven Indian solar companies to be used to develop grid-connected solar rooftop PV projects with an aggregate capacity of 575 MW. The World Bank had also announced an additional Rs. 4 billion for private developers to install 100 MW of grid-connected rooftop solar projects in India. NABARD has been extending its support to solar power projects and installations under several programmes in India. \</doc>

Global emissions continue to be high as most countries are not on track to cut their carbon footprint as per their pledges of climate action, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said in its flagship 'emission gap' report on Tuesday. Highlighting the gap in their actions, the report said countries must raise their ambition by 3x (three times) to meet the 2\'b0C target and 5x (five times) to meet the 1.5\'b0C target as continuation of the current trend was likely to result in global warming of around 3\'b0C by the end of the century, with continued temperature rises after that.  If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is extremely unlikely that the 2\'b0C temperature goal can still be reached (by 2100), the report said in a warning to countries in the backdrop of the recent IPCC special report which quantified how disastrous the situation would be if the world didn't take urgent, drastic and large-scale action to keep warming within 1.5\'b0C by 2100. Evidence outlined in the report, released in Paris four days before the start of the UN climate conference ( COP24 ), showed global emissions had reached historic levels at 53.5 GtCO2e, with no signs of peaking  the point when emissions switch from increasing to decreasing. Authors assessed that only 57 countries (representing 60% of global emissions) were on track to do so by 2030. Its findings offer the latest accounting of national mitigation efforts and the ambitions countries have presented in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which form the foundation of the Paris Agreement.

LAUSANNE: As world leaders gathered at the UN Climate Change Summit in Poland ( COP24 ) appeared headed for yet another failure in attempts to implement the Paris Agreement to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) offered a positive counter. The IOC has taken on a leadership role in the new UN Sports for Climate Action Initiative, which aims to drive climate action across the sports community. The initiative was launched Tuesday by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in partnership with the IOC, at a high-Level event of the summit. It aims to set the course for the sports world to address climate change through concrete commitments and partnerships, while applying verified standards to measure, reduce and report greenhouse gas emissions - in line with the Paris Agreement. "Addressing climate change is everyone's responsibility, and the IOC treats it very seriously - as an organisation, as the owner of the Olympic Games and as the leader of the Olympic Movement," said IOC president Thomas Bach. "Sport is about action, and today the world needs urgent action to limit the rise of global temperatures. The Olympic Movement and the sports community at large are committed to making their contribution to the Sports for Climate Action Initiative." "The IOC is proud to have taken on a leadership role in the Sports for Climate Action Initiative," said Prince Albert II, chair of the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission, speaking at the event. "With its global reach, universal appeal and the power to inspire and influence millions of people around the globe, sport is uniquely placed to drive global climate action and encourage crowds to join in. As countries here in Katowice prepare to turn their climate commitments into reality, we stand ready to leverage the power of sport to support their efforts." Sport is already being heavily impacted by climate change. Unreliable snow and warm winters are threatening winter sports, and rising summer temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns are increasingly challenging for summer sports athletes, event organisers and spectators. The Sports for Climate Action Framework calls on the sports world - including sports federations, leagues and clubs - to jointly develop a climate action agenda for sport, adhering to five principles: promoting greater environmental responsibility, reducing overall climate impact, educating for climate action, promoting sustainable and responsible consumption, and advocating for climate action through communication. The Initiative also aims to use sport to drive global climate awareness and action. The IOC, the organising committees for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, and sports organisations such as World Sailing, the World Surf League, Roland Garros and Forest Green Rovers - a UK-based, professional football club dedicated to "greening up" football - have all signed the framework. Athletes from around the world have sent words of support for the Initiative. As part of its leadership role, the IOC will support the signatories in understanding and implementing the guiding principles of the initiative. To support the framework, the IOC released two practical guides: "Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games", which provides detailed guidance to the organising committees on how to measure the carbon footprint of the Olympic and Paralympic Games; and "Sports for Climate Action", published in collaboration with the UNFCCC, which aims to provide the Olympic Movement at large with a general understanding of the issues related to climate change and managing carbon emissions. Sustainability is a working principle of the Olympic Movement and one of the three pillars of its strategic roadmap for the future - Olympic Agenda 2020. Climate change has a prominent place in the IOC's sustainability work: it is one of the five focus areas and a cross-cutting theme of the IOC's sustainability strategy. The IOC's long-term strategic intent for 2030 is to put in place effective carbon reduction strategies for operations and events, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. As owner of the Olympic Games, the IOC now requests the organising committees for the Olympic Games to develop carbon-management plans, including action to promote low-carbon solutions and compensate greenhouse gas emissions. As an organisation, the IOC has put in place carbon-reduction measures that are being compensating by Olympic TOP sponsor and official carbon partner, Dow. The IOC is also providing one-on-one guidance and support on climate-related issues to international sports federations and national Olympic committees. The UN Climate Change Summit ( COP24 ) is taking place from 2 to 14 December in Katowice, Poland. During the summit, countries were expected to finalise the Paris Agreement Work Programme, which is needed to implement the Paris Agreement and limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5C, but that looks dead in the water, primarily due to the machinations of the developed countries, led, no prizes for guessing, by the US. \</doc>

July 10 -- Electrification is the key to decarbonising Europe's economy, according to WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson, who was speaking today at a European Commission event on long-term emissions reductions. EU leaders asked the Commission earlier this year to update the EU's 2050 climate strategy. The current version, dating back to before COP21 in Paris, says the EU should cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in 2050. A revised version is now expected before COP24 in Katowice. WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson said: "According to the International Energy Agency, wind will be the number one source of electricity soon after 2030, providing more than 30% of Europe's electricity. But electricity is only 22% of the final energy needed by Europe's economy. Political momentum is starting to grow for an EU target of net-zero emissions in 2050 in the new strategy. To do this we'll need to electrify heating and transport, where the share of renewables is just 18% and 6% respectively. If we're serious about decarbonisation, changing that has to be the number one priority. "We also need to make sure we still have an EU industry that can deliver the equipment needed to make this happen. Over 260,000 people work in wind in Europe. In the face of rising international competition, Europe needs to keep an edge in the production of wind energy components. This requires a robust domestic European market so the industry has enough scale to keep reducing costs. An increased commitment to EU Research and Innovation funding for wind energy, including for onshore wind, will also be critical to Europe's competitiveness." Source: WindEurope \</doc>

New Delhi, Dec. 21 -- Will developing countries continue to pay for the sins they had not committed? Perhaps it is the case with major international agreements. Whether it is climate change or global trade, the burden-sharing commitments for addressing the existential challenges of the 21st century are invariably tilted. "Developing countries are not comfortable or happy...we need to see if developed countries have honoured their commitments (because) still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support (to poor nations)," Xie Zhenhua, China's chief negotiator, said two days before the curtains came down on the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in Katowice, Poland. The COP24 "Climate change is running faster than we are," said United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres last week. "This will allow us to have a regime that is fair and effective for all," he emphasized. "Climate change is the greatest challenge of mankind, in front of it no country is spared, and destinies are shared," argued Zhenhua. But the final deal reached in Katowice was a compromise between the world's three largest polluters-the US, the European Union, and China-according to a report in the Financial Times on 16 December. The three leading CO2 emitters had agreed to harmonize rules for measuring and reporting their climate targets for limiting global warming to well below 2 degree C. Effectively, the new agreement seems to have put paid to one of the most fundamental principles of climate change negotiations-that is, common but differentiated responsibilities between the developing countries on the one hand, and the developed countries on the other, due to historical responsibility of developed countries for their past emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, which was agreed in 1992, included equitable burden-sharing principles based on common, but differentiated responsibilities for addressing climate change. If countries lived by their Kyoto Protocol commitments, climate change would not have reached a tipping point. But it was sabotaged by the US Congress and, afterwards, countries chose to exceed their carbon budget. Thus the Katowice' first principles for implementing the Paris Agreement has turned a blind eye on the historical responsibility of the biggest emitters, while focusing largely on current and future emissions. The deal also includes a universal system for measuring and reporting emissions, where all countries abide by the same rules that will take effect in 2024. There is no clarity yet as to what would happen to the financing commitment of $100 billion by developed nations towards mitigation efforts in developing countries. With Donald Trump's administration having walked away from the Paris Agreement, all promises made on financial commitments to address climate change remain only on paper. In short, developing countries are asked to pay for their mitigation and adaptation efforts without the promised assistance coming by. It is a strange coincidence that even on the trade front, a similar exercise is currently underway if events during the last fortnight are any indication. Under the banner of "reforms" of the trading rules at the World Trade Organization (WTO), attempts are being made to dilute or eliminate the special and differential treatment for developing countries and deny the "policy" space for further industrialization. Like the Katowice deal struck between three dominant polluters, the WTO reform proposals are also seeking to arrive at trade deals with the participation of two or more countries, a la plurilateralization. Without addressing the real life-and-death issue of the likely disappearance of the highest adjudicating body for enforcing trade rules, the Trump administration is calling the shots at WTO almost along the lines of what it did at Katowice, where it had hosted a pro-fossil fuel event on the sidelines of the talks. "The reform proposals on the table (at the WTO) are not acceptable to the developing countries," Rob Davies, South Africa's trade minister, said on 7 December in an interview. "These proposals for modernizing WTO will make an unbalanced multilateral trading system even worse by bringing differentiation and by curtailing the policy space for industrial and economic development."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has welcomed the declaration released on Saturday at the conclusion of the 2018 G-20 meeting, which reaffirms a commitment to raise ambition in the fight against climate change. Guterres, in a statement released on Sunday, picked out three key messages from the statement, Xinhua news agency reported. "Support for the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the UN's global blueprint for a fair globalisation that leaves no one behind, is reaffirmed in the document, along with a pledge to use all policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth," said the secretary-general. As well as stressing the need to raise ambition in the fight against climate change, the G-20 leaders express their very strong support of countries that are signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement, to implement their commitments set out in their nationally determined contributions, the UN chief added. The G-20 declaration states that the leaders look forward to "successful outcomes" of the COP24 climate change conference, which begins in Katowice, Poland from December 3. In the declaration, said the UN chief, G-20 leaders also recognise the importance of a multilateral approach to trade and of the reform of the World Trade Organization, and renew their commitment to a rules-based international order. The secretary-general concluded with a reminder that the G-20 comprises the world's leading emitters of environmentally harmful gases, and that the declaration "provides hope" for a solution to a global challenge that he has described as a direct existential threat: "these agreements by the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies, which also contribute the largest share of global green-house gas emissions, can help rally the international community to make sure that climate change is a race we can win." G-20 leaders concluded a fruitful summit Saturday, exchanging in-depth views on building consensus for fair and sustainable development. The group issued a declaration after the two-day summit, sending a positive signal to the international community and market. \</doc>

New York, Sept 10 (IBNS): Climate change talks wrapped up in Bangkok today, leaving several issues still to be resolved. The talks were part of series of meetings set up to develop guidelines for countries to implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement, an important element in ensuring transparent and practical climate action across the globe. Work on preparing the guidelines has been ongoing since 2016, the year after the Paris Agreement was signed by practically every country in the world. The guidelines are due to be adopted at the annual climate change conference, COP24 , to be held in the Polish city of Katowice in December. If that goal is to be reached, urgent work is needed in the coming weeks, said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change: In Bangkok, there has been uneven progress on the elements of the climate change regime that countries are working towards. Clearly, we need to increase climate action significantly. Clearly, fully implementing the Paris Agreement is the way to do this in a balanced, coordinated manner that leaves nobody behind. Country representatives have been working on ways to increase action to deal with the impacts of climate change, increasing support for developing countries in the form of finance, technology cooperation and capacity-building and, crucially, limiting global temperature increase this century to well below 2C, ideally limiting the increase to 1.5C through emission reductions. Key concerns include the way in which actions are regularly and transparently communicated, clarity on financing the actions, and how to reflect the contributions and responsibilities of developed and developing countries. On this point, Espinosa was clear that the Paris Agreement strikes a delicate balance to bring all countries together: We must recognize that countries have different realities at home. They have different levels of economic and social development that lead to different national situations. she said. The negotiations are taking place at a time when the world has witnessed flood-related deaths, livelihoods wiped out by droughts and expensive infrastructure lost across large stretches of the developed and the developing world.

Katowice, Dec 9 -- A smart campus cloud network -- a set of guidelines for starting climate action -- was launched at the ongoing UN climate action summit in this Polish city to make the university campuses green, an official associated with the project said on Sunday The Climate Neutral University Campus was launched along with a toolkit and water guidelines at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 , TERRE Policy Centre for the smart campuses Chairman Rajendra Shende told IANS. The kit and the guidelines that are meant to initiate the actions on the campus are part of the tool-box for similar actions for clean energy, waste management, sustainable transport and afforestation. The results of the activities in the campus would be shared through cloud network with other universities in the network and linked to UN's Sustainable Development Goals, he added. India-based TERRE Policy Centre is a non-profit, non-partisan and independent organisation dedicated to sustainable solutions to developmental imperatives. "The smart campus cloud network is a bespoke approach to empower and support students and faculty to begin action on climate change urgently," UN Global Compact's former senior advisor Frederick Dubee said. Speaking at the launch function, Dubee said the smart campus cloud network, supported by the Unesco, leverages an asset to address the climate emergency. Cornell University-US student Zeyu Hu presented his university's sustainability achievements. By sharing the successes and challenges through the cloud network, the campuses would generate positive competition. "Campuses are the right places to trigger the emergency actions laid out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report of 1.5 degrees Celsius," Shende told IANS. "Campuses would not only make youth Sustainable Development Goals ready but would also make them climate-resilient," he added. --IANS vg/in \</doc>

On this World Environment Day, France underscores the urgent need for international mobilization on the global environmental crisis that threatens our prosperity and our security. Such a situation calls for a profound change in our practices and must also translate into effective multilateral action. The speed, scope and consequences of the environmental crisis being experienced by the planet are unprecedented. The continued rise in greenhouse gases is sparking a change in the climate whose consequence are incalculable to health; agriculture; biodiversity, which is in decline, and threatened by the pressure on our ecosystems; and our oceans, which are increasingly polluted, notably by plastic waste. Responses to these global challenges must be concrete and driven by multilateral cooperation. France is working with its international partners on strengthening the implementation of the instruments and common objectives in support of biodiversity and the preservation of the environment. The Paris Climate Change Agreement now ratified by 177 parties proves that it is possible to work together for a healthier environment. France hereby commits itself to the Agreements implementation on French territory and internationally. The next meeting will be the COP24 , to be held in December and chaired by Poland. It must come up with implementing rules that are robust, ambitious, and operational. To codify, consolidate and disseminate the major principles of international environmental law, we are also working on the adoption of a global pact for the environment under the auspices of the UN. France hopes that the negotiation of this pact, whose first procedural resolution was adopted by a very large majority on May 10, will be guided by the sense of responsibility and urgency imposed on us by the current environmental crisis. This effort will be fully meaningful only if all rally behind it to create a global momentum to develop concrete, local, national, and international solutions. \</doc>

The 24th conference of the parties of the United Nations Climate Change Convention ( COP24 ) opened Monday in Katowice, Poland, with the participation of Morocco. The climate summit is bringing together around 30,000 delegates from almost 200 countries, top state officials, representatives of business and NGOs, at this southern Polish city. Talks will focus on implementing the provisions of the Paris agreement of 2015, towards the reduction of global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Paris agreement, all countries have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the global average rise in temperature to well below 2C, and as close as possible to 1.5C. Well over 100 events will highlight action in transport, water, land-use, energy, the fashion industry, to name a few, representing the wide spectrum of climate action. They will include CEOs, mayors, governors and other leaders from civil society at large. \</doc>

Royal Dutch Shell caved in to growing investor pressure over climate change today with plans to set short-term targets for reducing its carbon footprint. BP and Total have already set short-term targets, but Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden had previously resisted setting hard goals, saying it would be "foolhardy" to expose Shell to legal challenges. Shareholders had criticised Shell for last year setting long-term "ambitions" to halve its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050, which lacked binding targets for implementation. Shell, which did not specify any targets on Monday, plans to link these targets and other measures to its executive remuneration policy. The revised remuneration policy will be put to shareholders for approval at its annual meeting in 2020. "We are taking important steps towards turning our Net Carbon Footprint ambition into reality by setting shorter-term targets," Ben van Beurden said in a statement. The move comes as governments meet in Poland for a conference hosted by the United Nations COP24 which will lay out a "rule book" to implement a 2015 climate accord. The Paris agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures. Shell signed a joint statement with a group of 310 investors with over $32 trillion of assets under management, dubbed Climate Action 100+, outlining the targets and review process. "When it comes to meeting the demands of the Paris Agreement on climate change, we believe it is necessary to strengthen partnerships between investors and their investee companies to accelerate progress towards reaching such an ambitious common goal," Peter Ferket, Chief Investment Officer of Robeco said in the joint statement. \</doc>

In Africa, where many countries are exposed to risks of climate-change induced natural disaster, it is imperative to create integrated joint risk management strategies. This is because the economies of many African countries depend upon climate-sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, infrastructure, forestry, and fisheries. On Wednesday 5 December 2018, the African Development Bank held a session on the sidelines of the 24th world climate summit, COP24 , in collaboration with the African Centre of Meteorology Applications for Development (ACMAD) and the African Risk Capacity (ARC), on the management of natural disaster risks in Africa, the role of meteorological and climate services to defend against such risks, and insurance to meet the costs of extreme weather events such as storms, droughts and floods. Hydrometeorology: anticipating, alerting and guarding To manage the risk of natural disasters, meteorology and climate information services are essential. But there are few of these in Africa, and those that exist often perform poorly due to a lack of staff and experts, faulty equipment and funding problems. Nearly a decade ago, the African Development Bank issued a warning about the insufficient number of weather stations in Africa, pointing out that the continent had the lowest density of such stations in the world, at one per 25,460 km2 or one eighth of the standard recommended by the World Meteorological Organization. More recently, in 2016, the World Bank stated that only 10 of the 54 African countries provided adequate weather-forecasting services. At the same time, food security is increasingly under threat from climate change, warned Taniaa Osejo of the World Food Programme (WFP). "The challenges are enormous and that is why we need an integrated approach to fit the needs of communities to the meteorology instruments and services." Osejo calls for scientific and meteorological information to be adapted to suit the particular experiences of communities and for "smart" investments to promote food security to be launched. o "There certainly are programmes and institutions that provide meteorology services, but these services lack coordination and are therefore not very effective." added World Meteorological Organization director Filipe Lucio, citing the Global Climate Risk Index drawn up by the NGO Germanwatch, the 2018 edition of which was unveiled at COP24 . Launched in June 2015, the Hydromet Africa programme focuses on meteorological, hydrological and climatological services on the African continent in order to improve them: modernisation of the observation infrastructure, interpretation of data and the provision of services to offer reliable and timely weather and climate forecasting services, especially with regard to risks of imminent disaster. Its ultimate goal is to ensure that countries and communities, especially farmers economic operators and the different regions of the continent strengthen their resilience to climate and natural disasters. The programme plans to invest some $600 million in 15 countries and strengthen early warning and intervention systems for the benefit of more than 100 million people. Hydromet Africa benefits from the support of a dozen development partners: African Development Bank, African Union Commission, World Meteorological Organization, African Ministerial Conference on Meteorology, World Bank Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Reconstruction, United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, Agence Francaise pour developpement, European Union, Climate Risks and Early Warning Systems Initiative, Government of Japan, and Green Climate Fund. Weather forecasting services and early warning systems vital to the protection plans needed to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. More investment is needed, and studies have shown that the return on investment is likely to be very profitable. For every dollar spent on hydrometeorological services, the yield in terms of economic development would be at least five times higher. The collection of weather and climate data and their analysis and dissemination are a value chain. "The links of this chain come from different institutions, and are mostly uncoordinated," said Filipe Lucio. "We cannot progress by providing support for just one link at a time. We need to support the entire chain, in a coherent and integrated way." Reliable weather and climate information enables policy makers to review and amend their national adaptation plans; permits communities to conserve and strengthen their means of production; and encourages local economies to grow, among many other benefits. Insurance and mutual funds, financial cover against natural disasters Weather and climate services are also essential for providing disaster risk transfer solutions, according to Assia Sidebe, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) regional coordinator. Ms Sidebe spoke about the purpose of the ARC, launched in 2012 by 20 African countries under the aegis of the African Union. The countries also benefit from African Development Bank support: to provide them with shared financial cover against the risks of drought, flood and cyclones in Africa; to remove their individual responsibilities for climate disaster management; and to reduce their dependence on international donations. To perform risk assessments and for the payment of claims, the ARC uses global satellite and human development index data. Over the period 2014-2015, the ARC disbursed nearly $43 billion in claims payments, more than half in Senegal and Kenya. The ARC's goal, to be achieved by 2020, is for 150 million people in 30 African countries to be covered against climate risk. The African Development Bank has recently launched the Africa Disaster Risks Financing Programme (ADRIFI), the very first climate risk management programme in Africa. \</doc>

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Prince Mohammed bin Salman here and stressed the importance of having stable and predictable energy prices. They agreed to set up a mechanism to look into the possibilities of concrete action in terms of investment, technology, manufacturing and defence, with the Crown Prince stating that Saudi Arabia will be finalising an initial investment into India's National Infrastructure Fund. The discussion on Thursday also touched on how Saudi Arabia can enhance its investment across a number of sectors in the next two to three years. Modi, who arrived here on Thursday to take part in the G20 meeting, also met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Talking to reporters, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said Modi's first bilateral meeting was with the Saudi Arabia Crown Prince and it was "very cordial and warm". "The Prime Minister, in particular, stressed upon the importance of having stable and predictable energy prices. Some discussions took place between the two leaders on how Saudi Arabia can contribute and help in stabilising energy prices, particularly for India." He said the Crown Prince spoke of India "as an important partner" and there was specific discussion on how it can enhance its investment across various sectors. "The Crown Prince (said) Saudi Arabia will be finalising an initial investment into the National Infrastructure Fund. He also referred to future prospects for investment in the technology sector, energy sector and agricultural sector," Gokhale said. He said the Crown Prince was especially mindful of the contributions that Indians have made in building Saudi Arabia over the years. Gokhale said that during Modi's meeting with Guterres, the main subject of discussion was the forthcoming climate change meeting in Poland ( COP24 ). The UN Secretary General hoped that India will egg the developed and developing countries to come up with certain solutions which would eventually feed into the climate change summit that the UN Secretary General is planning in 2019. \</doc>

India, July 23 -- "Only rubble, deserts and refuse". Speaking last week at a Vatican conference actually meant to celebrate the third anniversary of his eco-Encyclical Laudato Si' and at which several Indians including myself were present, Pope Francis can hardly be accused of sugar-coating the potential future of our world if climate change continues to grow in severity. All hope is not lost, however: we have the future of the planet in our hands, if only humanity - including India - takes the opportunities presented to us this year and beyond. We do not need convincing that climate change exists - we have fallen victim to it too many times for that. Each of the last four years has seen record-breaking heat. The decade from 2008 to 2017 was the warmest decade on record in India. This, coupled with mismanagement of water reserves, has led to more drought and water shortages: Shimla, for example, has recently seen its worst-ever water crisis, in turn leading to a 30% drop in flights and hotel bookings compared to last year, bad news for one of India's most popular summer tourist destinations. Indeed, the World Bank recently identified climate change as one of the greatest threats to the growth potential of the Indian economy, and predicts a fall in living standards for nearly half of Indians because of changes in temperature and precipitation. Our country and its people deserve so much better than this torturous future. To add insult to injury, the major contributor to climate change - the burning of fossil fuels, and especially coal - provokes a myriad of other problems that cause suffering to Indians, not the least air pollution. In many parts of India today, the irony is that every life-giving breath of air we take increasingly also contributes to our deaths. This mostly used to be a problem during the winter and around individual weather events - now, in places such as Delhi, toxic air is a threat all year round. More people died of air pollution in India in 2015 - 1.81 million - than anywhere else in the world. Closing our eyes to this reality is to avoid the gaze of our conscience. So much for the empty half of the glass. The good news is that the solutions to this crisis are still very much in our hands and the hands of our global allies. Solar and wind energy - reliable methods of generating electricity that contribute neither to climate change nor to air pollution - are now cheaper than coal in our country. The argument that coal is the fastest or most sure-shot road to development simply doesn't add up anymore, even before taking into account the money needed to treat patients with respiratory problems from harmful power plant emissions, rebuild cities after more intense flooding from climate change, or feed farmers whose crop fails due to more severe droughts, all negative consequences of using fossil fuels. India is already moving from coal to renewable sources of energy, and is becoming renowned as a solar leader globally - the quicker we phase out coal completely, the better. In his Friday address, the Pope also identified the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) taking place in California in September, as well as the United Nations COP24 climate conference taking place in Poland in December, as two key milestones for tackling climate change this year. They are both also golden opportunities for nations to cooperate with each other. At GCAS, Indian businesses and banks are coming to the table with pledges to reduce the emissions associated with their production and investments that prove they are serious about climate change. At COP24 , the most important climate summit since the Paris Agreement was signed, India should push hard for a rulebook that ensures the Paris Agreement is implemented in a fair and ambitious way by all countries, and prepare to increase the ambition of its own national climate plan to make sure the goals we signed up to in Paris - and on which the lives and livelihoods of large sections of our population depend - are met. As Pope Francis added in his speech, "challenges are not lacking!" The scale of the Pope's call - and the calls of the scientific community - can sound daunting. On Friday, I heard Pope Francis appeal for a massive "financial paradigm shift" and "systematic and concerted efforts aimed at an integral ecology" that put human dignity and care for of our common home at their heart. But opportunities are not lacking, either. And huge challenges are something our country has a proud history of meeting with huge courage.

Dec. 4 -- Who must take responsibility for climate protection? Citizens, business or politics? The majority of Europeans say: every citizen should and can do something for himself. But the majority of the self-proclaimed 'climate protection world champions' in Germany see responsibility in politics and business. This is the result of a representative survey conducted by the market research institute puls on behalf of E.ON in the run-up to the climate conference COP24 in Katowice. Europeans rely on their own initiative Europeans see it as their duty to combat climate-damaging greenhouse gases. Of the 7,200 people surveyed from Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary, 42.3 percent believe that each individual bears the greatest responsibility. More than a third see the economy and industry as driving forces in the reduction of CO2 (34.6 percent), followed by politics (23.1 percent). "Climate change is one of the greatest challenges for our society. Every individual can reduce his CO2 emissions through his individual behavior - be it by switching to green electricity, purchasing an electric car or more energy efficiency at home. We help our customers with the right products and services to put their own standards into practice," says E.ON Board Member Karsten Wildberger, commenting on the results.

Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) today announced a joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to combat climate change. In a joint declaration, the MDBs committed to working together in six key areas considered central to meeting the goals of the Agreement, which aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2C, pursuing efforts for 1.5C. The declaration was issued at the start of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. "The global development agenda is at a pivotal point," the joint declaration says. "There is international consensus on the urgent need to ensure that policy engagements and financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development." The MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC) had already pledged in December 2017 to align financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. "To realise this vision, we are working together to develop a dedicated approach," the joint MDB declaration adds. The MDBs plan to break their joint approach down into practical work on six core Paris Alignment areas-the building blocks-including: aligning their operations against mitigation and climate-resilience goals; ramping up climate finance; capacity building support for countries and other clients; plus an emphasis on climate reporting. This approach builds on the on-going MDB contribution to climate finance, which, in 2017, amounted to US$ 35 billion to tackle climate change in developing and emerging economies, mobilising an additional US$ 52 billion from private and public sector sources. The MDBs will report back to next years COP25 gathering on their progress under the six building blocks. The nine MDBs are: The African Development Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank Group, the Islamic Development Bank, the New Development Bank, and the World Bank Group (World Bank, IFC, MIGA). \</doc>

NEW DELHI, DEC 05, 2018: Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, yesterday released a Discussion Paper entitled "3 Essential "S"s of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection" on the sidelines of COP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, Poland. The Discussion Paper examines analytically the scope, scale and speed required in climate finance. While the financial requirements of developing countries run into trillions of Dollars, the commitments made by the developed countries for enhancement and support in relation to climate finance is not clearly translated into reality. Equally important is the issue of reporting and tracking of climate finance. The Discussion Paper finds serious concerns with the various numbers on climate finance reported by the developed countries. Definitions of climate change finance used in various reports were not consistent with the UNFCCC provisions. Methodologies used were also questionable. This Paper attempts to identify the essential elements, step by step, for a robust and transparent accounting of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Climate change issues have taken centre-stage in the recent times with various scientific reports pointing to the serious effects of climate change and global warming. The urgency for global climate action cannot be overemphasised. While the developing countries like India have been taking many actions against climate change and adapting to its adverse effects best to their own abilities and national circumstances, as mandated in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, the climate actions of developing countries have to be supported by climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Yet the progress achieved is not quite satisfactory. The Parties at CoP 24 in Katowice in December, 2018 need to address these important questions on climate finance. While India will continue to play its constructive role at CoP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, it is hoped that this Reflection paper will be of utility to stakeholders during deliberations therein. \</doc>

In observance of the 2018 Global Warming and Climate Change Consciousness Week, Senator Loren Legarda emphasized the importance of inciting and sustaining local climate action. "At the global stage, we are forging a bold, strategic vision for adaptation. But we must then contextualize our discussions on our efforts on the ground: climate action is local. For us in the Philippines, adaptation is a matter of survival. We have been urging both our public and private sectors to embrace adaptation and to work together for a secure and resilient future," Legarda said. As organized by the Climate Change Commission, this year's celebration, which will run from November 19 to 23, 2018, underscores the whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach to climate action towards a low carbon and climate-resilient economy, informed by the latest climate science, technology, knowledge and best practices on climate change adaptation and mitigation. With the theme: "The 1.5C Climate Change: Survive and Thrive Together," the first day commenced with opening plenary sessions and a forum on the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP). The National Water Security Conference and the Climate Science Youth Congress, which launched the search for Young Outstanding Climate Scientists, were held the following day. On day three, November 21, the National Business Climate Action Summit was held, carrying a theme of "Transforming Industries and Sectors towards Carbon Neutrality." The fourth and fifth days of the CCC Week will be entirely devoted to the conduct of the 2nd National Convention on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction, which will serve as a collaborative multi-stakeholder platform for knowledge exchange on climate change and disaster risk reduction policies, programs, innovation, best practices, and resources to pave the way for increased national and community resilience. "This December, there is a tall order from all countries to finalize the work programme of the Paris Agreement in COP24 in Katowice, Poland. I hope that through these activities we also amplify our call for scaled up climate finance and inspire greater climate action from all nations," Legarda concluded. \</doc>

Katowice (Poland): At the ongoing 24th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) here, the striking debate of 'fair share' remains to be critical, with developed countries pushing for laying down indicators of equity. In the context of climate debate, equity refers to maintaining a balance of taking responsibility between the countries suffering from climate change and those which contributed to it. Ever since the Paris Agreement in 2016, the main argument has been that national pledges made by countries should take into account that the developed countries have contributed more to the global emissions.According to delegates, some developed countries have hinted towards framing indicators for equity in the recent negotiations. "Talks have been going on about introducing parameters to categorize countries. The indicators will most likely be based on historical and current emissions," said a senior negotiator from India.Whether it is historical or current emissions, there are high chances that India will find itself "less responsible" compared to other nations. "India's current emissions per capita and gross domestic product (GDP) are very low. If the developed countries decide on these lines, we will welcome the decision. This means that emerging economies like us will have to bear less responsibility and less stringent accounting measures," the negotiator added. Climate experts, however, offer a word of advice. "The indicators of equitable distribution of emission will be based on income per person. The higher the income of a country, more is the share of its per capita emissions. Rather than hiding behind the poor, India should hold the rich accountable by imposing tax and incentivise the poor part of the population to reduce its emissions," said Sanjay Vashist, director of Climate Action Network (CAN), South-East Asia. Stating that the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of the developing countries are higher than the developed ones, Vashist added, "Equitable distribution of responsibilities should be the bed rock on climate negotiations. Developed countries are running away from their historic responsibilities and have left no stone unturned to shift their burden of emission reduction on developing countries."

India, Nov. 20 -- The union Environment Minister, Dr HarshVardhan, today said that India India has been working on its own role in Climate Change and is fast in this direction. "We need to ensure that the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) is prepared in accordance with the agreed principles of Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) as enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement", said the minister. In addition, anchoring the COP 24 outcomes in the vision of equity will help deliver climate justice not only to the present but also to our future generations. He said this in his welcome address today, at the ministerial meet of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) Countries, being hosted by MoEFCC . Lack of ambition of developed countries and their unfulfilled promises should not place additional burden on developing countries to further enhance the level of ambition of their NDCs. We must ensure that the progress on NDCs at COP 24 does not yield an outcome that is Mitigation-centric but it should address all elements including mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building, he added. We need to explore possibilities to fund research and development of climate friendly technologies and shorten technology deployment cycle in absence of which transformative development would be delayed. India looks forward to constructive engagement and meaningful outcomes from the Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue at COP 24 that will pave a way for a better starting point in 2020 for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Dr. Vardhan added."

New Delhi, Dec. 13 -- China has demanded the inclusion of sustainable and low-carbon bamboo in the ongoing climate talks as it can provide valuable opportunities for the green development of developing countries along the Belt and Road. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Office for South-South Cooperation and China's Special Climate Envoy on Wednesday jointly pushed the need to include bamboo in the climate change discussions. The issue was raised at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) here and threw the spotlight on the need to include natural resources in the ongoing climate change negotiations. Bamboo, a grass plant, can be an important way to "green" infrastructure drives as it can store up to 1,000 tonnes of carbon per hectare. Studies say bamboo plants and products can store more carbon than certain species of tree and provide a year-round, climate-resilient form of income for millions of people around the world. Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Representative on Climate Change, said the grass plant "can provide valuable opportunities for the green development of developing countries along the Belt and Road". He also raised the possibility that bamboo could become part of China's new Emissions Trading Scheme, the largest in the world, as a way for polluting companies to offset emissions. With a bamboo sector valued at over $30 billion, China is the leader in bamboo innovations. UN Office for South-South Cooperation Director Jorge Chediek said he was "inspired" by China's uses of bamboo. UNFCCC Director of Policy and Programme Martin Frick said: "For me, bamboo is one of the things where the Sustainable Development Goals agenda and the climate agenda really can go hand in hand." He said Swedish homeware company IKEA was also investing heavily in bamboo and urged other companies to "think bamboo" as a means to green their manufacturing and construction processes.

On December 13, 2018 in Katowice (Poland), within the framework of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), a round table of the Russian Federation "Russian investments for development with low greenhouse gas emissions" was held. Event attendees included Special Presidential Representative on Climate Issues Ruslan Edelgeriyev, representatives of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy, the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom, JSC "Gazprom", Hevel Group, JSC "RusHydro", OK "RUSAL". Participants discussed the current state and prospects of the corporate climate policy of Russian companies in the energy and industrial sector, as well as state support and measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Deputy Director for Global Business Development at Rosatom Boris Arseev participated in the round table. He spoke about the role of nuclear energy in achieving sustainable development goals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear generation helps solve a wide range of problems, including preserving the environment, strengthening economic growth and fightingagainst poverty. In 2017 alone Russian-designed nuclear power plantsprevented 294 million tons of CO2 emissions. At the same time, we recognize the importance of renewable energy sources and actively develop a new direction wind energy. The sun, wind, water and the atom, complementing and strengthening each other, should form the green square, which will be the basis for the future of the global carbon-free balance, he said. According to expert forecasts, energy consumption in the world is anticipated to grow by about 40% by 2040. It is impossible to meet the growing energy demand and country commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without increasing the share of nuclear energy in the structure of energy consumption. In a year of operations, one 1 GW nuclear power plant (NPP) prevents 9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to annual emissions from 2 million vehicles. Rosatom carries out a large-scale NPP construction program both in the Russian Federation and abroad, making a significant contribution to the achievement of the UN sustainable development goals. \</doc>

Mountain regions occupy about one-quarter of the earths land surface and are home to 15% of the worlds population. Their influence extends far beyond their ranges: they provide goods and services, most notably water, to over half the global population making them not only crucial for people living in mountains, but also for those living downstream. But while the world is becoming increasingly aware of the impact of climate change on different ecosystems, current policies offer a very limited focus on the importance of climate change adaptation in mountainous regions. In a bid to underscore the growing demand for climate change action in developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems, UN Environment is launching its 2018 Mountain Adaptation Outlook Synthesis report today, coinciding with World Mountain Day. The publication is presented on the sidelines of COP24 in Katowice, Poland, together with a report focusing specifically on adaptation in the Hindu Kush Himalaya. Climate change is increasingly impacting mountain regions, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Executive Director at UN Environment. Mountain ranges are extremely complex ecosystems home to some of the most marginalized and vulnerable communities. It is critical that we focus on helping these communities adapt to changing climate in mountain regions. The reports examine the existing adaptation policies in some of the worlds largest mountain ranges, and is part of a series covering the Carpathian Mountains, the Hindu Kush Himalaya, Southern Caucasus, Tropical Andes and mountain ranges in Central Asia, Eastern Africa and the Western Balkans. Mountain societies are experiencing a disproportionately high number of disasters compared other environments and the need to adapt is becoming an urgent task. Nonetheless, the rapid and unprecedented rate of climate change is challenging this adaptive capacity, as is evident through the already widespread impacts being felt across mountain regions. Zeroing in on the lack of specific strategies to deal with the effects of climate change on mountain ecosystems, the report developed by UN Environment in partnership with GRID-Arendal provide an in-depth discussion on trends, key risks and common policy gaps for adaptation to climate change both within and across different mountain regions. \</doc>

India, Dec. 5 -- Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on Tuesday released a Discussion Paper entitled "3 Essential "S" s of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection" on the sidelines of COP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, Poland. The Discussion Paper examines analytically the scope, scale and speed required in climate finance. While the financial requirements of developing countries run into trillions of Dollars, the commitments made by the developed countries for enhancement and support in relation to climate finance is not clearly translated into reality. Equally important is the issue of reporting and tracking of climate finance. The Discussion Paper finds serious concerns with the various numbers on climate finance reported by the developed countries. Definitions of climate change finance used in various reports were not consistent with the UNFCCC provisions. Methodologies used were also questionable. This Paper attempts to identify the essential elements, step by step, for a robust and transparent accounting of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Climate change issues have taken centre-stage in the recent times with various scientific reports pointing to the serious effects of climate change and global warming. The urgency for global climate action cannot be over emphasised. While the developing countries like India have been taking many actions against climate change and adapting to its adverse effects best to their own abilities and national circumstances, as mandated in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, the climate actions of developing countries have to be supported by climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Yet the progress achieved is not quite satisfactory. The Parties at CoP 24 in Katowice in December 2018 need to address these important questions on climate finance. While India will continue to play its constructive role at CoP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, it is hoped that this Reflection paper will be of utility to stakeholders during deliberations therein.

Ms. Ingrid Johansson, Ambassador of Sweden to Pakistan called on Advisor to Prime Minister on Climate Change Mr. Malik Amin Aslam at his office today at Islamabad. Mr.Malik Amin Aslam apprised Ms. Ingird Johansson about Pakistan's efforts in environmental protection and his upcoming visit to Katowice,Poland for 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change( COP-24 ). COP-24 meeting he would represent Pakistan efforts on adaptation, mitigation, climate finance and billion tree plantation project he further highlighted the hazardous impact of global warming on glaciers in Pakistan. He said that these melting glaciers results in Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) which are very dangerous and occurs when the ice walls containing the reservoir fail, sending entire lakes down to inhabited ares blow and during such emergencies, there is severe loss of lives and physical assets. Sweden Ambassador Ms. Ingrid Johansson conveyed her pleasure to Mr. Malik Amin Aslam for leading Pakistani delegation at COP-24 at Katowice,Poland and further briefed the Adviser Mr. Malik Amin Aslam about socio-political situation in Sweden and highlighted the efforts of Sweden in environmental protection and pollution reduction by transforming the energy sector form non-renewable sources to renewable sources like solar and wind energy. She further added that Sweden is in the lead in the European Union league in exporting renewable energy to the neighboring countries which gives a substantial boost to the GDP. Highlighting the European Union Legislation on Environment, which envisages the reduction of Greenhouse Gases emission below 40%, she said that Sweden is strictly complying with the European Union protocol on environmental protection. Ms. Ingrid Johansson reiterated that Sweden is a small territorial country with population of ten million but has a higher GDP than Pakistan because we set on quality education, capacity building and sustainable development. She said that Sweden is very keen in investing on education, academia, business development sector, Information Technology and telecom sector to further enhance the bilateral relation and assistance to Pakistan. \</doc>

During the last leg of negotiations at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) this week in Poland, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu an island nation of about 11,000 people located in the South Pacific acutely threatened by climate change has called on the Commonwealth to leverage its 53-strong membership for climate action. The Commonwealth as a body is in a very strategically important place to leverage the voices and amplify the concerns of member countries, particularly those small island states, said Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga. Im grateful for the work of the Commonwealth on small states and their unique vulnerabilities, but we need to push on and leverage other communities and other groups of like-minded countries. Nearly 200 nations are gathered in the Polish city of Katowice to discuss a common rulebook for implementing climate commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Negotiations have been challenging, especially around issues of climate finance, transparency, and the special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which calls for far-reaching efforts to keep global temperatures below 1.50C. We need to review the pledge that we did in Paris three years ago, particularly whether we are delivering on this or not. What we are seeing is that there is no delivery in fact, there is serious backtrack on that, influenced by the decisions of one country, said Hon Sopoaga. Referring to the United States decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, he said it must not derail others, given the dire consequences of inaction: The impacts are already being felt by the people there is a serious erosion on the islands, particularly low-lying atolls like Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Maldives and the Marshall Islands. We are already feeling the intrusion into food crops and vegetation on the islands, droughts, and also the bleaching of the corals in the oceans and the disturbance to the stocks of tuna and fisheries Its not something thats going to be a threat in the future it is already threatening the livelihood of the people. \</doc>

Costa Rica concluded on Tuesday its participation in the enlarged troika of the Climate Vulnerable Countries Forum (CVF) and its sister financial platform, Vulnerables 20 (V20), after the transfer of the presidency of the Ethiopian Group towards the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The event was chaired by the Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, Gemedo Dalle. The Forum brings together 48 highly ambitious countries in climate action, whose joint work was key in defining the overall goal of the Paris Agreement to prevent global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees centigrade. Otherwise, the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change like Costa Rica will suffer catastrophic consequences. Likewise, it has set objectives such as achieving 100% renewable energy, increasing climate action and raising the voice for the benefit of the most vulnerable. In addition, renowned actor Leonardo di Caprio has joined the list of defenders and promoters of the interests of the most vulnerable countries and is committed to supporting the energy efforts of Ethiopia and Costa Rica. The V20 platform also holds important talks with the G20 Presidency on issues relevant to climate finance. Costa Rica joined the troika later since its Chairmanship of the Forum in 2011 and although it formally leaves the governance body, it will continue to be co-Chairman of the Working Group on Climate Accounting of the V20, together with Nepal. In addition, he pledged to contribute to the success of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Forum, which will take place on November 22 of this year. This will be the first fully online global summit that will last more than 16 hours and will feature panel discussions and interviews, as well as key messages from multiple global leaders, including Christiana Figueres. The country will also support the work plan of the new Presidency, facing the COP24 on climate change and international efforts to ensure global agreements that benefit climate-vulnerable countries. \</doc>

The Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations, Ambassador Mara Emma Meja, deposited the instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement. With this act, Colombia ends a process of several years and reaffirms its commitment to contribute to the solutions of climate change, the biggest global problem facing humanity. The Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). The Agreement represents one of the milestones of multilateralism because, for the first time in history, a universal instrument was reached with legally binding commitments for all Parties that aims to strengthen global responses to the threat of climate change. Colombia played a key role in its negotiation as part of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (Ailac). Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the country has made significant efforts to establish the enabling frameworks that will allow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to projected 2030. The Paris Agreement had previously been endorsed by the Congress of the Republic and the Constitutional Court, and with ratification, Colombia joins the group of 178 countries that have ratified the instrument to date. COP24 , it is expected to finish negotiating and adopt the package of rules that will allow the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Likewise, countries are expected to increase their ambition regarding emissions mitigation efforts, bearing in mind that the next decade will be decisive in achieving the objectives set in the Agreement. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 30 -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Prince Mohammed bin Salman here and stressed the importance of having stable and predictable energy prices. They agreed to set up a mechanism to look into the possibilities of concrete action in terms of investment, technology, manufacturing and defence, with the Crown Prince stating that Saudi Arabia will be finalising an initial investment into India's National Infrastructure Fund. The discussion on Thursday also touched on how Saudi Arabia can enhance its investment across a number of sectors in the next two to three years. Modi, who arrived here on Thursday to take part in the G20 meeting, also met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Talking to reporters, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said Modi's first bilateral meeting was with the Saudi Arabia Crown Prince and it was "very cordial and warm". "The Prime Minister, in particular, stressed upon the importance of having stable and predictable energy prices. Some discussions took place between the two leaders on how Saudi Arabia can contribute and help in stabilising energy prices, particularly for India." He said the Crown Prince spoke of India "as an important partner" and there was specific discussion on how it can enhance its investment across various sectors. "The Crown Prince (said) Saudi Arabia will be finalising an initial investment into the National Infrastructure Fund. He also referred to future prospects for investment in the technology sector, energy sector and agricultural sector," Gokhale said. He said the Crown Prince was especially mindful of the contributions that Indians have made in building Saudi Arabia over the years. Gokhale said that during Modi's meeting with Guterres, the main subject of discussion was the forthcoming climate change meeting in Poland ( COP24 ). He said Guterres acknowledged India's role in climate change negotiations and its concrete steps towards addressing challenges of climate change. The UN Secretary General hoped that India will egg the developed and developing countries to come up with certain solutions which would eventually feed into the climate change summit that the UN Secretary General is planning in 2019. \</doc>

The latest winners of a New Zealand and CCAFS-funded international PhD scholarship have been announced following a three-fold increase in applications. Agriculture Minister Damien OConnor and Climate Change Minister James Shaw say the increased demand clearly demonstrates the value countries place in the programme, which provides scientific solutions to reduce greenhouse gases in food production. A total of 212 applicants from more than 50 countries applied, compared to 65 applicants from 23 countries in the previous round earlier this year. Students will research rumen microbiology, rice production, soil science, and rangeland management, among other topics. The strong interest in the scholarships reflects the global desire to ensure food production systems are economically and environmentally sustainable in the face of an ever hungrier world, Damien OConnor said. As an agricultural economy, New Zealand understands the importance of getting this right and the vital role that science will play. Many around the world are now looking at what agricultural expertise can deliver in terms of low-emissions food production to feed the worlds growing population, Damien OConnor said. Twenty-seven scholarships will be awarded to students from 17 countries who will be hosted by institutions in 15 countries, with winners announced at the UN climate talks in Poland, where Minister Shaw is attending the final week of talks at COP24 with New Zealands delegation. Were really pleased that New Zealand is able to support this vitally important programme, says James Shaw. We also want to acknowledge the support of many of our fellow GRA members and partners, particularly CCAFS, for providing exciting opportunities for these students, James Shaw said. New Zealand provides core funding to support the scholarship programme, which allows early career scientists to undertake 4-6 month research exchanges at institutions of GRA members and partners, including CGIAR Centres. Notes to editor: The PhD scholarship programme, CLIFF-GRADS, is a joint initiative of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA) in which New Zealand has a leading role and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research Programme (CGIAR) for Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). \</doc>

July 17 -- The European Commission has launched a public consultation on a strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction. All interested citizens and stakeholders can send their contributions by 9 October 2018. In March 2018, EU leaders asked the European Commission to present, within 12 months, "a proposal for a strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction in accordance with the Paris Agreement". This followed a similar request form the European Parliament. The public consultation will feed into the Commission's deliberations for a strategy that will reflect on a long-term vision for a modern European economy for all Europeans and the opportunities and challenges that a long-term decarbonisation implies. The consultation aims at:  Collecting views and opinions on the technological and socio-economic pathways that should be explored for a long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy;  Gathering factual information, data and knowledge, including drivers, opportunities and challenges relevant to the long-term strategy. The consultation covers the views of citizens and other stakeholders on the types of transformations required, level of ambition and key actions to achieve it - including interactions with other ongoing transformations, the societal and economic opportunities and challenges, the role of the consumer and the need for investment and innovation. It will also address technical questions on the potential of some mitigation options. The consultation follows a high-level stakeholder consultation event held in Brussels on 10-11 July 2018. The Commission aims to put forward its strategy proposal ahead of the next UN climate conference ( COP24 ) taking place in Katowice, Poland in December 2018. The EU is on track to achieve its 2020 targets and is currently putting in place policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% in 2030 and achieve high level of ambition in energy efficiency and renewable energy (the so called energy and climate framework for 2030). The policies, legislative instruments and support programmes from the European budget will put the EU on a trajectory compatible with the Paris Agreement, but further measures are needed for the time after 2030.

New Delhi, Jan. 21 -- The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) was held last month in Katowice, Poland. The Katowice Climate Package is designed to operationalize the climate change regime contained in the Paris Agreement (2016). It sets out how countries will provide information about their national contributions that describe their domestic climate action, including mitigation, adaptation, and financial support for developing countries. Though multilateralism is under threat in many areas, including trade and foreign policy, it is the only way forward to combat climate change. While COP24 has clearly set out the rules in many areas of climate action, it left out discussion of some key issues, particularly those arising from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that predicted serious consequences if temperatures were allowed to rise just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (they have already risen about 1 degree Celsius). Transport emission accounts for a quarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It has risen for the last three decades and continues to rise today. To meet the 2050 Paris climate commitments-essential to limiting the temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century-automobiles must be completely decarbonized. This requires ending the hegemony of the internal combustion (IC) engine in the next dozen or so years and replacing it with electric cars. Many do not realize that the electric motor is as old as the IC engine and Nikola Tesla's (yes, the original Tesla) patent for an AC electric motor predates the Ford Model T by two decades. There are currently two important sources of power to drive the motor in an electric vehicle (EV). The first is a lithium-ion (LI) battery and the second a hydrogen fuel cell. LI is widely known and is the source of EV power for the Tesla range of cars (manufactured by Panasonic in a Gigafactory joint venture with Tesla in Nevada). It is fast replacing the nickel-metal hydride batteries used in the first generation of hybrid cars. Hydrogen power is available in a few cars like the Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cells use an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, catalysed by platinum, to produce energy. The only exhaust is the combination product-water. The challenge is to produce hydrogen in an energy-efficient manner, transport it to distribution points and store it in gaseous or liquid form in a car. The debate over fuel cells vs LI batteries has produced much heat and a lot of gas. Believers in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) claim that any excess electricity generated in a grid, particularly that which comes from renewable sources, will make the production of hydrogen not only cheap but also GHG neutral. Hydrogen production is currently possible through electrolysis or a thermochemical reaction-and both require energy. In the future, it may be possible using solar energy or a biological process that uses significantly less energy. There is much debate on what is called the "well to wheel" analysis of energy efficiency and the GHG impact of EVs and FCEVs. That analysis favours LI battery technology today and supporters like Elon Musk call the alternative "fool cells". Having become world leaders in LI, China is hedging its bets with a giant investment in the full ecosystem of FCEVs in the Yunfu Industrial Park. Attracted by generous government subsidies, a range of companies covering the full supply chain have now set up shop. China will provide about $12 billion in subsidies to this effort. There is not much discussion about FCEVs in India. What should India's approach be? India, like China, is dependent on imported energy. Therefore, EVs make a lot of sense for the future. There is remarkably little original R&#38;D being done in India on either EVs or FCEVs. The only electric vehicles in the market-both using LI and produced by Mahindra and Tata Motors-have a long way to go in terms of range and quality. At the same time, the vehicle market in India continues to grow at nearly double digits and with it grows automobile GHG emission. India does not provide a meaningful subsidy for either EVs or FCEVs. The government has proposed an increased subsidy under a scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME II ). The aggregate budget is said to be Rs.5,500 crores but exactly how that will apply to individual vehicles is not clear and the bill has not yet been passed in Parliament. . India must make a concerted attempt to incentivize both EVs and FCEVs. Even before the commercial use of these vehicles on the roads, it calls for research and development under Indian conditions with a particular focus on affordability. The technology and adoption call between LI and fuel cells may be too early to make, but it appears likely that both will have a role to play in India's electric vehicle road.

New Delhi, Dec. 4 -- A discussion paper entitled "3 Essential "S"s of Climate Finance - Scope, Scale and Speed: A Reflection" was released by the Department of Economic Affairs on the sidelines of COP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice in Poland. The discussion paper examines analytically the scope, scale and speed required in climate finance. While the financial requirements of developing countries run into trillions of dollars, the commitments made by the developed countries for enhancement and support in relation to climate finance is not clearly translated into reality. Equally important is the issue of reporting and tracking of climate finance. The discussion paper also finds serious concerns with the various numbers on climate finance reported by the developed countries. Definitions of climate change finance used in various reports were not consistent with the UNFCCC provisions. Methodologies used were also questionable. This paper attempts to identify the essential elements, step by step, for a robust and transparent accounting of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Climate change issues have taken centre-stage in the recent times with various scientific reports pointing to the serious effects of climate change and global warming. The urgency for global climate action cannot be over emphasised, it added. According to the paper, while the developing countries like India have been taking many actions against climate change and adapting to its adverse effects best to their own abilities and national circumstances, as mandated in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, the climate actions of developing countries have to be supported by climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. Yet the progress achieved is not quite satisfactory. The paper said that the Parties at CoP 24 in Katowice in December, 2018 need to address these important questions on climate finance. While India will continue to play its constructive role at CoP 24 to UNFCCC at Katowice, it is hoped that this reflection paper will be of utility to stakeholders during deliberations therein.

Dec. 7 -- The potential was made clear by delegates and speakers at Energy Day, on the African Development Bank pavilion at COP24 in Poland. Sessions such as 'Unlocking Commercial Finance for Small-Scale Renewable Energy in Africa' covered the African Development Bank's "Facility for Energy Inclusion" (FEI) - a $500 million debt platform for small-scale renewables that aims to provide senior and mezzanine debt financing to small-scale projects and off-grid solutions, whilst a panel of speakers shared news about the 'Desert to Power' initiative, which seeks to harness the sun of the Sahel region across 11 countries in one of the biggest solar projects in the world. A later session drew lessons on energy efficiency in Africa; despite the huge renewable generation potential, this is still a critical element in the sustainable future for the region. Africa has an almost unlimited potential of solar capacity (10 TW), abundant hydro (350 GW), wind (110 GW), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW). The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that renewable energy capacity in Africa could reach 310 GW by 2030; which would put the continent at the forefront of renewable energy generation globally. There is huge scope for Africa to build a climate-resilient and low-carbon continent, with attractive investment opportunities in climate-resilient infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and the sustainable management of natural resources. The Ouarzazate solar complex in Morocco is one of the largest concentrated solar plants in the world. It has produced and delivered over 814 GWh of clean energy through the national electric grid since 2016. Last year, the solar plant saved 217,000 tons of CO2. For Morocco, which until recently sourced 95% of its energy needs from external sources, this project is part of a drive to diversify sources of production and generate value from renewable energy sources. It is hoped that the country will increase its share of renewable energy to the total energy consumption to 42% by 2020. The Ouarzazate solar complex project uses an innovative financing structure, which pools the capacities of independent power producers, who then sell the generated power back to the government in a public-private partnership. The project's financing support mechanism will reduce the capital cost of solar power to levels comparable with traditional technologies and the wholesale cost of power in Morocco. Africa needs a renewable energy revolution: the continent holds 15% of the world's population, yet may have to pay nearly 50% of the estimated global climate change adaptation costs. These costs will cut expenditure on health, water supply, agriculture, and forestry, despite the continent's minimal contribution to global emissions. And that's not to mention the energy deficit that continues: most of the 600 million people without access to electricity live in Sub-Saharan Africa. This energy poverty across the continent holds back African economic development, and is estimated to cost the continent between 2% and 4 % of GDP annually. Speaking about the 'Desert to Power' project in the Sahel region, Magdalena J. Seol, the African Development Bank's representative for the initiative, has noted that: "Without energy, it's impossible to imagine economic growth. A lack of energy has been one of the key factors that has hindered the economic development of the region." In order to catalyse the transition to renewable energy, the African Development Bank has placed energy at the top of its High 5 priorities and launched the New Deal on Energy for Africa with an overarching goal of universal energy access in Africa by 2025. This will be achieved through expanding grid power by 160 GW, and connecting 130 million people to the grid. Additionally, the Bank aims to connect 75 million people to off-grid systems and provide 150 million households with access to clean cooking energy. The African Development Bank is also working with African countries to transform their energy utility sectors and attract investment in new energy markets. Joao Duarte Cunha, Manager for Energy Initiatives and Partnerships at the African Development Bank said, "We provide support along the entire project development continuum, providing resources from seed capital to technical assistance, debt finance and investments in private equity funds to build a renewable energy pipeline for Africa. We also work closely with governments to understand and tackle policy issues to create the right enabling conditions for this sector to thrive." In a final closing statement in the Unlocking Commercial Finance for Small-Scale Renewable Energy in Africa' session, Dean Cooper - Energy Sector Market Development Manager at SNV, a non-profit international development organization founded in the Netherlands - said: "Energy... makes things happen - we need to always keep this in mind". Thought of the day from COP on Energy Day As Energy Day at COP24 comes to a close, it is clear that every country around the world must play its part in securing a safe and sustainable future. If Africa can achieve its renewable energy potential - and find the funds to do so - the continent could make a significant contribution to securing a safe and sustainable future - not just for itself, but for every other region and country in the world.

Approximately 64% of the African Continent is found within a transboundary river or lake basin, or sits on a transboundary aquifer, containing 805 freshwater resources. As climate change exacerbates challenges already inherent in Africas hydrological cycle, and affects different parts of a watershed differently, it is clear that there is a need to highlight the importance of transboundary perspectives in adaptation and decision-making, and support efforts to include these within states planning and actions, including finance activities. Whilst states are the most important actors for addressing climate change at a global level, there are risks that their own actions, designed to address local challenges, may result in additional challenges on neighbouring states, potentially leading to maladaptation. This means that transboundary organisations, such as lake commissions or basin authorities are highly important participants in integrated water resources management. The initiation and use of transboundary organisations are important to foster knowledge generation and provide a platform for discussion between basin states. Recognising this, the African Development Bank hosted an experts workshop on Supporting transboundary actions to address Climate Change within the African Development Bank Pavilion on 7 December 2018, at COP24 Katowice, Poland. Experts from a range of agencies presented different perspectives on transboundary challenges, including bringing in the private sector within basin wide management, dealing with governance and water use in transboundary aquifers, and recent successes in obtaining climate finance in transboundary projects. Jonathan Barnes from the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility (CRIDF) said High-quality data is important and can provide a catalyst for building trust and decision-making, and is important for ensuring private sector interest. The theme of high quality data was also taken up by Dr Sarra Touzi from the Global Water Partnership Mediterranean and Dr. Abdou Guero from the Niger Basin Authority, who both discussed its necessity for improving the enabling environment for making water investments. The increasing interest in the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) by African states was also noted in discussion, with the Republic of Chad the first country in Africa to accede to the Water Convention this year, followed by Senegal in the coming month. Up to 20 African States have indicated interest in joining the Water Convention, and to support transboundary actions in regard to climate change. \</doc>

The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has been highlighting the importance of early warning systems to the hurricane prone region, at COP 24 the Climate Change Conference taking place in Katowice, Poland. The CARICOM Secretariats Assistant Secretary-General for Human and Social Development Dr Douglas Slater joined an international panel discussion at the Conference on Tuesday to address the question, After the devastation from last years hurricanes, how is the Caribbean recovering and how important are early warning systems for the region? The 2017 hurricane season included the high-impact Category Five hurricanes Irma and Maria, and officials say the widespread damage and tragic loss of life they caused could have been worse without forecasts and warnings. The Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative a partnership between the World Meteorological Organisation, World Bank and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) for enhancing climate resilience has been collecting and compiling lessons on the effectiveness of the regions early warning systems for the 2017 hurricane season and these were presented at the event. COP 24 , which runs from 2 14 December is seeking to advance the practical implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \</doc>

United States, Jan. 15 -- The World Bank Group launched its Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience. Under the plan, the World Bank Group will ramp up direct adaptation climate finance to reach $50 billion over FY21-25. This financing level-an average of $10 billion a year-is more than double what was achieved during FY15-18. The World Bank Group will also pilot new approaches to increasing private finance for adaptation and resilience. The increase in adaptation financing will support activities that include: &#194;&#183; Delivering higher quality forecasts, early warning systems and climate information services to better prepare 250 million people in at least 30 countries for climate risks; &#194;&#183; Supporting 100 river basins with climate-informed management plans and/or improved river basin management governance; &#194;&#183; Building more climate-responsive social protection systems; and &#194;&#183; Supporting efforts in at least 20 countries to respond early to, and recover faster from, climate and disaster shocks through additional financial protection instruments. In addition to boosting finance, the Plan will also support countries to mainstream approaches to systematically manage climate risks at every phase of policy planning, investment design, and implementation. The Action Plan builds on the link between adaptation and development by promoting effective and early actions that also provide positive development outcomes. For example, investing in mangrove replanting may protect a local community against sea level rise and storm surges, while also creating new opportunities for eco-tourism and fisheries. Early and proactive adaptation and resilience-building actions are more cost-effective than addressing impacts after they occur. The Action Plan also includes the development of a new rating system to create incentives for, and improve the tracking of, global progress on adaptation and resilience. The new system will be piloted by the World Bank in FY19-20 and rolled out to projects in relevant sectors by FY21. The Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience forms part of the World Bank Group's 2025 Targets to Step Up Climate Action which were launched in December 2018, during the UN's COP24 in Poland.

The decision of the Council implies a reduction of CO2 emissions for car manufacturers of 15% in 2025 and 35% from 2030, with respect to the targets that were for 2021, both for new cars and vans. The adopted agreement will allow the Council to begin negotiations with the Parliament (EP) and the Commission (EC) to agree on the final regulation, which must be agreed before the end of the European Legislature. Spain has supported "a progressive and ambitious agreement of 35% upwards, that is, thinking more about the final decision is between 35% and 40%," said the minister. Ribera stressed that the decision adopted will allow the automotive industry "to launch a road map consistent with the community objectives, which makes visible how this sector anticipates and prepares to innovate and make the necessary transition towards a clean and respectful mobility with the environment and health. " "This agreement is an opportunity for the automotive industry to lead the transition towards mobility free of CO2 emissions, the main gas causing global warming," said the minister. "Spain can not live on the fringes of a process of change so deep in mobility, nor of the demands of air quality and public health," he added. Ribera maintains that the road towards the decarbonisation of transport is already underway, and it is convenient that Spanish manufacturers position themselves in the production of zero emission vehicles to maintain their competitiveness if they do not want to lose competitiveness in the future with respect to Asian manufacturers. Climate Summit Regarding the common European position towards the next climate summit in Katowice ( COP24 ), Spain has placed special emphasis on the importance of the EU being in a position to respond to the "clear call" to accelerate the climate action that reflects has made the latest IPCC report on the impacts and decarbonisation paths that must be adopted to prevent the planet's temperature from rising more than 1.5C compared to the pre-industrial era. \</doc>

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has launched a new platform aimed at helping its developing member countries in Asia and the Pacific mobilize funding to meet their goals under the Paris Agreement. The NDC Advance platform will help countries mobilize finance to implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) regarding greenhouse gas emissions that each country has voluntarily committed to under the Paris Agreement. NDCs also describe priority actions for countries to adapt to climate change. The announcement was made at the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, which is aiming to finalize a rulebook for the Paris Agreement when it goes into effect on 1 January 2020. The agreement aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2C, while aiming for 1.5C. Through their NDCs, our developing member countries have made ambitious commitments to respond to climate change, said ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Mr. Bambang Susantono. We need to ensure that countries are able to mobilize the needed financing to deliver on their commitments. NDC Advance will help countries devise investment plans to tap financing from a variety of sources and to implement priority projects effectively. NDC Advance is funded through a $4.55 million grant from ADB and will have three aims: providing technical assistance that helps countries better engage with potential sources of climate finance and to make use of innovative finance mechanisms; identifying and prioritizing climate projects; and supporting countries in tracking how projects deliver against their NDC goals. The new initiative will help propel the climate actions ADB has committed to under its Strategy 2030 program. ADB earlier this year committed to ensuring that 75% of its operations will support climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030, while providing cumulative climate financing of $80 billion from its own sources between 2019 and 2030. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing. \</doc>

The Minister of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica, Carlos Manuel Rodrguez, participated in a high-level panel organized by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, in order to promote climate action that respects the human rights of the people. The Costa Rican Minister participated with Bachelet; the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinoza, the Special Envoy for Climate of the Secretary General of the UN Antonio Gutrres, Luis Alfonso De Alba, and other distinguished speakers. Minister Rodrguez referred to the Escaz Agreement , highlighted the impact of this political and diplomatic achievement, and urged those States that have not yet done so, to join it. He also referred to the Strategy of Decarbonization of the Economy carried out by the Alvarado-Quesada Administration, and the Costa Rican initiatives related to this humanistic approach, such as the Coalition for All and the Geneva Commitment for Climate Action (Geneva Pledge). Regarding the latter, he commented that it is the aspiration of a group of States, of which Costa Rica is a party, that the human rights perspective be applied to actions to combat climate change, as stipulated in the preamble to the Paris Agreement. He also stressed that Costa Rica has promoted increased ambition in actions to address climate change; and a greater appropriation on the part of the States in this effort, as well as the perspective of human rights, including gender considerations, which are transversal to the governmental and inter-institutional management in Costa Rica. In the context of COP24 , where the Action Plan of the Paris Agreement is defined, said Minister Rodrguez, the great challenge and the opportunity now is to take action and present concrete examples in the implementation of national policies, where human rights are taken into account for, for example: carrying out the indigenous consultation, addressing issues of gender, biodiversity, etc. Finally, he commented that countries should begin to operationalize this commitment of the Paris Agreement, and that Costa Rica is very well positioned for that purpose, given the internal mechanisms we have to lead by example, especially in the human rights approach in climate action, and called on countries to include this perspective in their internal policies and processes. \</doc>

Indonesia and Poland agreed to focus on concrete cooperation directly impacting on people of both countries. This was conveyed by Indonesian Foreign Minister, Retno LP Marsudi, after a bilateral meeting with Poland's Foreign Minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, in Jakarta (26/11). Foreign Minister Retno conveyed that Indonesia and Poland have many similarities and the potential of extensive cooperation. Several sectors of cooperation currently focused on and which will be pushed are trade and investment, maritime, defense industry, energy, and people-to-people contacts," She said. Bilateral trade between Indonesia and Poland is about USD 400-600 million per year and having a positive trend annually. At present, Poland has total of investment project in Indonesia reaching 54 projects from year of 2016 until September 2018. Poland's biggest investment project that stands out today is in the energy sector, namely the construction of hydropower stations in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, with an investment of around 80 million Euros. In the field of tourism, the two countries also have a direct Aviation cooperation from Warsaw to Denpasar since 2016 and which has proven capable of driving up an increase in the number of Polish tourists to Indonesia. Both countries are currently developing cooperation in the maritime sector, including fisheries management and ship building. In multilateral forums, the two countries agreed to work together on global issues by optimizing their respective status as UN Security Council Non-Permanent Members in 2019. Other issues also discussed at the meeting were climate change, especially COP24 in Katowice, Poland, including about sustainable palm oil management in Indonesia, ASEAN and the EU, as well as the idea of Indonesia's partnership with the Visegrad Group or V4 (V4 is an acronym for Visegrad Countries, 4 countries in Central Europe: Poland, Hungary, Czech and Slovakia). During his visit to Indonesia, in addition to meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Minister Czaputowicz also met with the Governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X in Yogyakarta, the Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia, and the Deputy Secretary General of ASEAN.

New York, Oct. 2 -- Scientists from the United Nations-run Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and representatives from its 195 member governments, are meeting in South Korea, to reach agreement over a key summary for policymakers into the impact of a 1.5 degree Celsius increase in global warming, above pre-industrial levels In 2015, the Paris Agreement to combat climate change set a long-term goal of keeping global average temperatures to well below 2C, and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. With relatively little known about the impacts back in 2015, the IPCC, which is co-sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), was commissioned to prepare a report that would define the likely risks and challenges of living in world which is either 1.5 degrees warmer, or 2 degrees. Opening the week-long meeting, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said Three weeks ago in New York, the UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres described climate change as the great challenge of our time. But, he also noted that, thanks to science, we know its size and nature. Science alerts us to the gravity of the situation, but science also, and this special report in particular, helps us understand the solutions available to us. Underscoring the importance of climate action, South Korea, which is hosting the meeting, has experienced its hottest summer on record, with temperatures in some parts of the country topping 40C for the first time on record. Addressing the delegates, WMO Deputy-Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova said, This year is, yet again, expected to be one of the warmest years. We have witnessed extreme weather ranging from record heat in northern Europe and historic flooding in Japan, India, southeast Asia and the southeastern United States. The consequences were devastating, but advance predictions helped save many lives. Subject to approval, the IPCC will release the Summary for Policymakers of the report at a press conference on 8 October. The full report is due to published in time for this years climate conference, COP24 , due to be held in Katowice, Poland in November.

New York, Sept 27 (IBNS): As governments prepare to meet later this year for the next round of climate talks, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres today underscored the need to speed up action on an issue that is "the absolute priority" for the United Nations. Climate change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment, the Secretary-General said at the Informal Leaders Dialogue on Climate Change, held on the margins of the annual high-level debate of the General Assembly. [] we have many priorities in the UN peace and security, human rights, and development but I would say that this is the absolute priority. Guterres recalled that when world leaders signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change three years ago, they pledged to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to work to keep the increase as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. These objectives were agreed, he noted, as the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The commitment was universal but we are nowhere close to where we need to be to meet these minimum targets, he stated, adding that a UN study found that the commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. We need to do more and we need to do it quicker: we need more ambition and accelerated action by 2020. Todays meeting takes place amid what is known as New York Climate Week and comes on the heels of the Global Climate Action Summit, held in San Francisco earlier this month. It also follows a landmark speech delivered by the Secretary-General this month in which he warned that the world risks crossing the point of no return on climate change and highlighted the need to speed up action to tackle this global threat. To mobilize greater action and finance, the Secretary-General will convene a Climate Summit in September 2019 to focus on the heart of the problem. Only a significantly higher level of ambition will do and the Summit will be an opportunity for leaders and partners to showcase their ambition. A key moment on the road to next years Summit will be the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) known informally as COP24 that will be held in December in Katowice, Poland. \</doc>

San Jose, December 14, 2018. Costa Rica welcomed the scope of the "Declaration on Gender Equality and Climate Change", which was presented within the framework of the World Summit on Climate Change ( COP 24 ). place in Katowice, Poland. The Declaration recognizes the leadership and fundamental work of women, and seeks to include the gender equality approach in climate action in a comprehensive manner. The initiative, promoted by Peru and Costa Rica, was announced during the United Nations Conference on the Parties on Climate Change ( COP 24 ), and joined by Belgium, Chile, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. Societies are affected by the effects of climate change, but in particular women, who are among the most marginalized groups. In this sense, "the Declaration will constitute a vigorous management tool to promote public policies that recognize this impact on women," declared the Foreign Affairs Minister of Costa Rica, Lorena Aguilar, a renowned environmentalist. In promoting the Declaration, Costa Rica "reaffirms its leadership in the international debate on gender equality in environmental processes," added the Costa Rican Minister, who said that "the incorporation of a gender approach to combat climate change is a priority, since that this ensures the inclusive and fair participation of all in actions that have a direct impact on the lives of Costa Rican women and men." \</doc>

Correction steps of the Indonesian Government in peat management have become a reference for international knowledge. As a country that owns peatlands in South America, the Republic of Peru faces almost the same problems as Indonesia, concession permits on peatlands, damage to ecosystems and fire threats. For this reason, Peru wants to learn about peat management to Indonesia. Represented by Minister of Environment Fabiola Marthan Munoz Dobero, Peru met with the Minister of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, Siti Nurbaya on the sidelines of the UNFCCC COP24 World Climate Change Conference, in Katowice, Poland, (11/12) to share experiences, related policies and technical peat management. Siti Nurbaya Indonesia explained that he had taken corrective measures for sustainable forest management. Learning from the 2015 forest and land fires, Indonesia has tidied peat through governance policies, peat mapping, protecting peat hydrological areas, and keeping the water level wet. "We have developed many instruments for managing peatlands," said Minister Siti. Among them, through the permit moratorium policy on peat land and primary forest, issued Government Regulation (PP) No. 57 of 2016 concerning Protection and Management of Peat Ecosystems, to consistently enforce environmental law. Minister Siti revealed that in the field, sustainable peatland management does not only involve the government but all stakeholders, including local communities, global communities, and the private sector. "This is to prevent peat fires, as happened in 2015 when around 800,000 ha of the 2.6 million hectares of land burned was peatland," said Minister Siti. The map shows that the total area of ??Indonesia's peat ecosystems reaches 24.14 million ha, of which around 9.16 million hectares are located in Sumatra; 8.39 million hectares in Kalimantan; 60 thousand hectares in Sulawesi; and 6.53 million hectares in Papua. After conducting an inventory, an area of ??around 2.5 million hectares of peat ecosystems has been targeted by the government for recovery in 2020. "Restoring peatlands, we not only improve the biophysical aspects of peatland management, but also the livelihoods of people living around peatlands and the sustainability of businesses run by licensed companies," explained Minister Siti. Fabiola was amazed by the improved improvement of Indonesia's peat governance. "We will learn a lot about peat management in Indonesia, both from a policy and technical perspective," said Fabiola. In the future, Siti Nurbaya invited Peru to join ITPC, build cross-sector cooperation in peat management, and build capacity building. \</doc>

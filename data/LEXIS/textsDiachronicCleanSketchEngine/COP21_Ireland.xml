The Government is to lobby the EU for a lower cut in the State's greenhouse emissions than the proposed 40 per cent target Brussels is seeking. While the EU has committed to an overall 40 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005, the reduction for each member state will vary and will be individually negotiated next year. As pioneering climate change legislation completes its passage through the Oireachtas this week, senior Government sources have said it would be difficult to achieve the target due to Ireland's dependence on agriculture and the impact of the recession. "We will have difficulty meeting our targets for 2020 as it is [20 per cent compared to 2005]," said a source. "We are not well placed for 2030 as things stand." In March this year the EU agreed on a new overall 2030 framework for climate and energy which was submitted to the United Nations. This is ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 21 ), which begins in Paris in late November. COP21 hopes to get commitments from more than 190 countries to keep global warming below 2 degrees.\~ Climate Bill The report stage of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill was debated in the D\'e1il yesterday, the last phase of the legislation. While the Bill has been sharply criticised for setting no targets for 2050, significant amendments have been accepted by Fine Gael, including a commitment to "climate justice" as well as the guaranteed independence of an expert advisory committee on climate change. It also commits the Government to abide by targets agreed at EU level. In its negotiations with the EU, the Government will argue the EU should have regard for the recession and the constraints it placed on investment to reduce emissions. The latest estimate is that Ireland will fall short of the 2020 target by 6 per cent. The inclusion of a "climate justice" clause came as a surprise as Fine Gael had originally argued against it. However, Taoiseach Enda Kenny agreed with Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan in the D\'e1il last month that such a clause should form part of the Bill. Climate justice attempts to address perceived injustices caused by climate change. Its addition is seen as a concession by Fine Gael to Labour. Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth said the Bill had improved but remained weaker than it should be. "While the biggest gap is the absence of an explicit 2050 target, the Bill does refer to the Government's national policy objective of 80 per cent reductions in emissions from electricity, transport and buildings and carbon neutrality in agriculture. Meanwhile . . . this Government will go through its term without adopting a national action plan to reduce emissions." Paris conference Objectives The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 To that end, it seeks a commitment from each country to ensure that global temperature will not increase more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Last weekend, the diplomat heading the French secretariat to COP 21 , Laurence Tubiana, said she was 70 per cent confident agreement could be reached in December. \</doc>

Sir, - Your editorial ("Ending the age of fossil fuels", December 14th) captures the exhilaration, frustrations and enormous opportunities and challenges we face in the coming decades. When what was to become the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in December 1997, there was a similar outburst of exhilaration and frustration among the participants. But we had momentum and early instruments that allowed the progression, often hesitant, of what has come to fruition in Paris last week. Today we have an extraordinary agenda to develop and we need to focus on the policies and measures that will be implemented by governments and peoples to achieve climate balance in a more just and sustainable future. We have a unique convergence on what our final destination is. We are much better equipped for the journey than we were 18 years ago. Since we are not in a "command and control' world, we will only arrive with the consent of public opinion across the world. To create this support we need to respect the genuine differences in means and policy options and to create a fellowship on our journey that will maintain the critical political and social momentum needed in the difficult years ahead . To those who have toiled in arriving at the COP21 agreement many thanks, and to future actors take courage in this noble endeavour. - Yours, etc, KEVIN LEYDON, Kraainem, Belgium. \</doc>

Warming of Earth's climate system is "unequivocal", and the human influence on changing it is now clear, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In its 'Fifth Assessment Report', the IPCC found that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are "unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years". These greenhouse-gas emissions will need to fall to zero by 2100 if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming below the potentially dangerous threshold of 2 degrees. The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the past 1,400 years in the northern hemisphere, while last year alone was the hottest worldwide since records began. Tackling climate change will require "substantial and sustained reductions" in emissions to limit risks of "severe, widespread and irreversible impacts" globally by 2100, the scientists say. As predicted by the economist Nicholas Stern, in an analysis for the British government in 2006, the IPCC says delaying action will "substantially increase the challenges" to limit global warming below 2 degrees. Heatwaves are likely to occur more often and last longer, and extreme precipitation events - such as devastating typhoons in Southeast Asia - will become more intense and frequent, the IPCC says. If the average temperature were to rise by more than 4 degrees, "substantial species extinction" would occur, as well as food insecurity, slower economic growth, endemic poverty and mass migrations. Emissions can be "substantially reduced" through changes in consumption patterns, switching to renewable-energy sources, such as solar or wind, and adopting simple energy-saving measures. 'The Irish Times' at COP21 Daily reports from Paris The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , aka COP21 , takes place at Le Bourget, just outside Paris, from November 30th to December 11th. It aims to achieve a legally binding agreement on climate from all the nations of the world.

Just over a year ago, as the UN Climate Summit met at United Nations headquarters in New York, 400,000 people took to the streets of the city for the People's Climate March, the largest-ever climate-change demonstration. Now, as Paris prepares to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which starts on November 30th, Irish nongovernmental organisations are uniting for a series of People's Climate Marches in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Galway on Sunday, November 29th. Groups such as Tr\'f3caire and Oxfam, which are chiefly concerned about the impact of flooding, drought, disease and food scarcity on developing countries, will join Friends of the Earth and Stop Climate Chaos campaigners. Together they are seeking community renewable-energy projects, sustainable, liveable cities, the phasing out of fossil fuels, and "decent work for all in the transition to a low-carbon society". Trade unionists, church-goers and youth groups will walk the streets together, calling for national and international action on climate change. "The crucial thing is that we are the last generation who can do something to limit the amount of greenhouse-gas emissions to keep global temperature below the catastrophic 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels," says Bernie Connolly of Cork Environmental Forum, one of the main organisers of the People's Climate March in the city. "The pope's encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si' , has meant that we are reaching a much wider constituency through Eco-Congregation Ireland" - an interdenominational group that helps churches be environmentally aware in the context of their Christianity - "and parishes who want to do something positive to limit the damage we are all causing." The marches in Ireland will help to create an impetus for the smaller group of campaigners that will then travel to Paris, either to observe negotiations or to protest. Ciara Kirrane of Stop Climate Chaos, a coalition of civic-society organisations, says, "We see Paris as a beginning rather than an end. It's an opportunity to start connecting people's demands for justice, equality, food, jobs and rights and to strengthen the movement, to force governments to listen and act in people's interests and not in the vested interests of elites. Paris will launch us into 2016 as a year of action for people's demands and solutions to take centre stage. For instance, we need Ireland to have a national mitigation plan to reduce our emissions now." Key issues Prof John Sweeney, the Maynooth University climatologist, has provided Irish NGOs with a briefing document, Preparing the Road to Paris , in which he outlines the scientific, ethical and political background to the conference and explains key negotiating issues, such as whether countries will pledge money to the UN's Green Climate Fund from their development budgets or from new funds, or whether emission-reduction agreements will be legally binding. Among other things, this technical knowledge will allow NGO protesters to tailor their banners to how negotiations go at the Paris conference (which is also known as Cop21 , as it's the 21st annual conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992). The legacy of failed climate-change talks in Copenhagen in 2009 has made NGOs more cautious about the importance of any single event and more focused on the bigger picture. Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth will attend the leaders' event on the opening day of the Paris conference. "The political negotiations are just the framework; the real action has to happen afterwards, in terms of changes to industry, buildings and energy," he says. "The problem with Ireland is that while we are in talks about emissions targets for 2030, we won't reach our 2020 targets. The Irish Government's approach has been one of short-term special pleading. When Enda Kenny speaks about climate change I don't get the sense that he sees it as a real threat to our lives. I will be embarrassed to be Irish in Paris." An Taisce will also be represented in Paris. John Gibbons of the heritage organisation says: "Our role is to apply pressure to those involved in the negotiations and to inform the media, the public and politicians here that the Irish Government is going to Paris with nothing. "Most political effort here has been to water down our commitments. Ireland is a first-world country which is too interested in growth and business as usual to act in a climate-constrained world. We will be looking for whatever pledges the Irish Government makes to be honoured." Climate finance Campaigners from organisations such as Oxfam Ireland will attend the negotiations as observers. David Healy, the charity's policy and advocacy officer, will spend five days there. "We will circulate our briefing to the negotiators in advance, outlining our key priorities, and then we will comment and advise on the textual proposals as they emerge. "It can be a remarkably frustrating process, but we will be working with the wider Oxfam organisation. Our key issue is climate finance. We need to ensure that climate finance meets the adaptation needs of the developing countries as part of the agreement." Healy is one of the few campaigners who was at the Copenhagen summit in 2009. "It's a different dynamic to Copenhagen. The national pledges had to be made in advance of Paris, whereas in Copenhagen they were brought to the table at the last minute, and no agreement was reached. "In Paris there won't be the same emphasis on a final agreement but on figures that will have to be ratcheted up in the next few years. It's not liable to failure in the same way." Jerry MacEvilly of Tr\'f3caire, will also follow the talks for their full 12 days. "My role is to make clear any weaknesses in the negotiated text and make sure the voices of our partners in the developing world are heard. The protection of human rights needs to be a central part of the binding agreement, as some climate actions can impact on food security." Stop Climate Chaos is organising a bus of 50 activists to go to Paris to join thousands of others from around the world for the final days of the UN conference, which will be followed, on Saturday, December 12th, by an international day of action in the city. Climate conference What exactly is Cop21 ? Cop21 is the 21st annual conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Cop21 will be held just outside Paris, at Le Bourget exhibition centre, between Charles de Gaulle airport and the city, from November 30th to December 11th. It will be attended by political leaders and negotiators from more than 190 countries. About 20,000 delegates, 14,000 observers and 5,000 media are expected. It will be the largest diplomatic event that France has hosted, as well as one of the largest climate conferences ever held. The French government has encouraged NGOs to be involved in Cop21 , and about 2,000 organisations are expected to attend. Le Bourget will include Climate Generations, a civic-society space, also open to the public, where the groups can share their ideas, campaigns and proposed solutions to climate change. "The world will be struck by the intensity and diversity of involvement by civic society at Cop21 ," says the French ambassador to Ireland, Jean-Pierre Th\'e9bault. As France's former ambassador for international environmental negotiations and sustainable development, he has met many of the Irish NGOs in the build-up to Cop21 . \</doc>

Sir, - Since the COP21 global summit in Paris started, some of the coverage amounts to little more than laying most of the blame on the farmers. If they got rid of their belching cows everything would be all right, or so the argument goes. Surely there is more to the debate than that. The agri-food sector in this country involves over 230,000 jobs. It includes approximately 600 food and drinks firms throughout the country that export 85 per cent of our food and seafood to more than 160 countries worldwide. Those exports are worth EUR 10 billion or more to the citizens of this country. If we are to curtail that industry in order to meet our global targets, as advocated by many non-agrifood lobbies, then the consequences in terms of the economics, the employment and the social infrastructure of many areas in this country need to be examined. - Yours, etc, A LEAVY, Dublin 13. Sir, - In his article " COP21 : Five technologies that could help - and five that will not", December 9th), Paddy Woodworth rightly says that "if ecology teaches us one lesson, it is that everything in our world is connected to everything else". Microbes are what connects "everything" to, well, everything else in ecology. Understanding, and harnessing, the microbial world is a critical component in addressing our energy and climate problems ("Human waste biogas could power millions of homes, says UN study", November 3rd), but they are rarely mentioned in the climate debate. - Yours, etc, Dr GAVIN COLLINS, School of Natural Sciences, NUI Galway. Sir, - I agree wholeheartedly regarding the need for a genuine effort by Ireland to decarbonise our society. Indeed we have practical examples to follow in the cases of France, Sweden and Ontario. All of the above decarbonised their energy systems by scaling up nuclear power for electricity production. No examples exist where renewables have achieved the same outcome . Dr James Hansen, formerly chief climatologist with the Nasa Goddard Institute, has made a submission with other climate experts at Paris for the adoption of a strongly pro-nuclear policy in our battle with climate change and ocean acidification. In fact at this point it is fair to say that an anti-nuclear environmentalist is an oxymoron. - Yours, etc, Dr PAT MORRISSEY, Adare, Co Limerick . \</doc>

Sir, - Taoiseach Enda Kenny calls the European Commission's target for a 20 per cent reduction in emissions in 2020 compared to 2005 "unrealistic" and "unachievable" (" COP21 : Kenny criticises 'unrealistic' climate targets", December 1st). However, the most recent research by the European Commission projects the region will achieve a 24 per cent reduction. Unfortunately, Ireland is just one of four countries projected to fail to meet its burden-sharing target. Mr Kenny also blames the previous administration, which included the Green Party, for this failure. Again, however, the facts suggest otherwise. The European Commission and the European Environment Agency's 2015 report on climate targets notes that in Ireland "current policies appear to be insufficiently effective at overcoming obstacles to generate sufficient emissions reductions". By contrast, when Mr Kenny took office in 2011, the same organisations found that the country was on track to meet its 2020 target. It is not surprising that Mr Kenny would choose to play politics and try to deflect blame for his administration's failings both on the European Commission and on the previous government. It is disappointing, however, that he would choose to do so with a matter as important as climate change. - Yours, etc, PAUL SAMMON, Islington, London. Sir, - I see we are again aiming to "save the planet", according to many media outlets. What we are actually aiming to do is to save ourselves. The planet and many other species will still exist even if humanity is wiped out in some apocalyptic future scenario. Making the issues more personal to ourselves and our future may help to focus the minds of everyone. - Yours, etc, BRIAN DUFFY, Sandymount, Dublin 4. \</doc>

The opening day of COP 21 , the 21st annual UN climate conference, the 11-day event hosted by France and the United Nations, hopes to get a legally binding agreement to limit global warning for the first time. Representatives from 193 countries are attending and 170 representing 97% of global emissions have made pledges that undershoot the target and would allow the world to warm by up to 3.3 degrees. More than 150 national leaders made speeches filled with pledges, aspirations and warnings. While their speeches gave a good indication of where each country stands in its attitude to tackling climate change, the real work will take place over the coming days. Global warming has already increased by 1C and the effects are being felt, especially by poorer nations of the world, interfering with food production and with storms, droughts and floods causing devastation they cannot afford. Mr Kenny focused in on agriculture, but with a very different problem from that of poorer countries. While this conference is expected to agree to cut greenhouse gasses, the EU has said it will cut them by 40% by 2030 and the individual national cuts will be decided at the EU level. Ireland and three other countries were set the highest targets for 2020 of cutting by 20%, something Mr Kenny said was an over estimate of what could actually be delivered given a third of the country s emissions come from agriculture, mainly the national herd. However, because of the unrealistic target and the economic crisis Ireland is not in a position to reach the goal and if another target is to be added to that for 2030, that will create a real problem, he said. Under the EU rules if Ireland fails to achieve the targets it would have to buy carbon credits to make up for them, which could be very costly. The European commission is now discussing the targets for the individual countries which will be released next year. Mr Kenny said that the country is now among the most advanced in carbon foot-printing its beef and dairy farms, driving economic and environmental efficiency, and contributing to research including feed that can be shared with other countries, he said. Ireland maintained its humanitarian aid, and will contribute to the Green climate Fund next year, Mr Kenny added. \</doc>

Paul Melia ENERGY use has fallen slightly for the second year in a row, despite pronounced economic growth. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) says that while the economy grew by 5.2pc last year, energy consumption fell by 0.5pc with emissions down by 1.2pc. The use of renewables to produce electricity has avoided spending (EURO)255m a year on fossil fuels, the 'Energy in Ireland 1990-2014' report says, and has helped reduce emissions by 2.6 million tonnes a year. UN conference on climate change , COP 21 "The analysis shows us clearly where we are still too dependent on fossil fuel fuels and where we are becoming less so," he said. "It has been so positive to see economic recovery in Ireland, and it is hugely encouraging to see that this growth has been achieved with an overall reduction, albeit modest, in energy use." Transport remains the largest consumer of energy at 42pc, followed by residential (23pc) and industry (21pc). We spend (EURO)5.7bn a year importing fossil fuels. Friends of the Earth said that despite progress, the energy system was too reliant on fossil fuels and that Ireland may not meet EU targets to increase renewable energy production. It was "madness" to subsidise peat and gas power plants, but not provide help for solar electricity or for communities to develop renewable energy projects, Kate Ruddock, policy and campaigns manager, said.

Real turning points in human history are rare indeed, but it can already be said with some confidence that the Paris Agreement, adopted by acclamation at the final plenary session of COP21 on Saturday night in Le Bourget, is surely one of them. Never before have all 195 countries in the world - large and small, rich and poor - pledged that they would fight global warming together, for the sake of future generations "in a world we will not see", as French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande eloquently put it. After 20 years of UN climate conferences, two weeks of hard negotiations in Paris - led with great finesse and determination by French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, as COP21 president - and many sleepless nights, a deal that everyone involved could live with was finally struck. Its most important element is the highly ambitious long-term goal to hold the rise in average global temperatures to "well below 2 [degrees] above pre-industrial levels" and even to "pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees." Of course, the Earth will not be "saved" from the ravages of runaway climate change by the adoption of this overarching goal alone, without the means to achieve it. Disappointingly, no specific targets have been set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by quantified amounts between now and 2050; instead, parties aim to reach global peaking of emissions "as soon as possible" and to achieve what would amount to carbon neutrality "in the second half of this century". But the temperature target - a considerable victory for vulnerable small island states and other low-lying countries threatened by rising sea levels - carries its own clout; it will become the benchmark by which the voluntary pledges made by countries to cut their emissions will be judged over time. So far, 189 of these "nationally determined contributions" have been submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, and they will now have to be updated every five years under the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, $100 billion per year in aid by 2020 to help poorer nations cope with the challenges - first promised by developed countries at the abortive Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 - has now been set as the "floor level" for this flow of funding, to be reviewed in 2025. Also significant is the survival in the Paris Agreement of a "loss and damage mechanism" to help deal with displacement of people in the least developed countries as a result of severe storms and other extreme weather events. Overall, the Paris Agreement sends out a clear signal to the wider world, including capital markets, that we are now witnessing the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era and the transition to a cleaner energy future, already under way. \</doc>

President Michael D Higgins arrived in Paris yesterday to attend the Summit of Conscience for the Climate, organised by President Fran\'e7ois Hollande. The purpose of the day-long event is to raise consciousness of the threat posed by global warming, in the run-up to the COP 21 UN conference on climate change , which will be held in Paris in December. Mr Higgins was accorded a one-to-one meeting with Mr Hollande at the Elys\'e9e Palace before the dinner for the main conference speakers. Speakers at today's conference are an eclectic and colourful mix, ranging from an astrophysicist to the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. They include religious leaders from all the world's main faiths. Human dimension Mr Hollande is eager to show that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is about more than mathematical commitments to reducing greenhouse emissions; that there is a human, ethical, and philosophical dimension to the problem. Mr Higgins's talk is called The Power of Ideas for Climate: Making a New Beginning . Other speakers will include former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the UN special envoy for climate change and former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson. Mr Higgins is expected to stress links between fighting climate change and the UN millennium development goals, the weight of European responsibility and the need for solidarity. He decries what he sees as the selfishness of state-led policies and negotiations, and calls for a return to the post-second World War belief in multilateralism and the common interest. \</doc>

Le Bourget is on the outskirts of Paris on the way to Charles de Gaulle airport. It's an exhibition centre and the biggest domestic event it hosts is an aviation show. That's a bit of an irony, given that aviation and marine emissions remain outside the scope of current emissions agreements. The centre is massive and has been milling with thousands of people, between government delegations, the United Nations, environmental organisations and the media. The only inkling that it is in Paris is a mini Eiffel Tower that has been erected at the end of the main walkway (yep, called Champs-\'c9lys\'e9e). There are some impressive exhibitions that have been mounted by governments. These include the US offering: a suspended globe with animated graphics on the map of the effect of climate change over past (and future) centuries; it's like looking at an Imax movie in miniature. There are lots of people from smaller countries in indigenous costume. Many do traditional singing and dancing. The joy disguises the concern of their delegations as they will be the first to suffer with an increase in global temperature.

Paul Melia Environment Editor MORE that 25,000 people a year will die from malaria, heat stress and starvation as early as 2030 unless climate change is tackled. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that global warming is the "defining issue for the 21st century" and has called on world leaders to strike a deal to reduce emissions and help improve human health across developing and firstworld countries. According to WHO estimates, climate change is already causing tens of thousands of deaths every year due to shifting patterns of disease, extreme weather events, including heatwaves and floods, and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation. In 2012, WHO estimated that seven million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the largest single environmental health risk. The upcoming United Nations climate change conference ( COP 21 ), which takes place in Paris later this month, offers the world an "important opportunity" to not only reach a strong international climate agreement, but also to protect the health of current and future generations, it said. "WHO considers the Paris treaty to be a significant public health treaty, one that has the potential to save lives worldwide," it said in a statement. "Implementing proven interventions to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane from achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, would be expected to save approximately 2.4 million lives a year and reduce global warming by about 0.5C by 2050. "It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 25,000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps." While countries have committed to reducing emissions in advance of the talks, the United Nations says they are not sufficient to limit warming to 2C, which scientists consider a tipping point. "If countries take strong actions to address climate change, while protecting and promoting health, they will collectively bring about a planet that is not only more environmentally intact, but also has cleaner air, more abundant and safer freshwater and, as a result, healthier people." it said. WHO has launched a set of climate change and health country profiles for 14 nations, which show that an additional seven million people in Bangladesh will be exposed to coastal flooding each year between 2070 and 2100 as sea levels rise, but this would reduce to 14,000 with strong action. In Nigeria, some 70,000 premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be prevented from 2030 onwards, it global emissions fall. More country profiles will be published in December and in early 2016. \</doc>

The heir to the British throne has long been a passionate campaigner on environmental issues and linked the conflict which has left hundreds of thousands dead, created millions of refugees and seen the rise of IS, with drought in the Middle Eastern nation. In the interview with Sky News, filmed before last week s deadly Islamist terrorist attack in Paris that left 130 people dead, Charles talks about his belief that there are links between climate change and terrorism. Charles told the broadcaster: We re seeing a classic case of not dealing with the problem. Some of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn t tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move. And, in fact, there s very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land. Asked if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, he added: It s only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening. The difficulty is sometimes to get this point across that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short-term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we re doing to our natural environment. The interview came ahead of Charles travelling to Paris to deliver a keynote speech at the November 30 opening ceremony for Cop21 , the UN conference on climate change which will attempt to reach a new international agreement to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees. Charles has been a strong advocate of taking action to protect the environment for many years. In 2007 he set up the Prince s Rainforest Group to find a solution to save the world s threatened forests. He addressed a UN international climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and the following year he gave a keynote speech to the Oslo Climate and Forest Conference. \</doc>

As Paris recovers from the shock of the recent horrific attacks, the City of Light also stands as a beacon of hope for the world as it prepares to host a historic meeting of world leaders. This event provides a level of optimism not witnessed before, providing the possibility of a global energy technology revolution over the next 40 years. The much-anticipated United Nations conference on climate change, which runs from November 30th-December 11th, will see global leaders and thousands of others (up to 30,000 people are expected) to gather in Paris. It is called Cop21 as it is the 21st gathering or "Conference of the Parties" to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to the UN, Cop21 is where governments will reach a new and universal climate change agreement. While uncertainties remain regarding the precise impact - in time and place - of climate change, the growing body of scientific evidence has demonstrated that climate change is happening, and that it is being caused by human activities - notably our addiction to fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas to provide our heating, transport and electricity needs. The energy transition required to limit the damage caused by climate change offers huge potential for innovation, a technology revolution, economic activity and resulting jobs. We have had agreements before so why is this one so significant? At the first such event in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (subsequently called the Earth Summit), 154 countries signed a contractual agreement to collectively prevent dangerous, human-induced climate change. This has now been signed by 195 countries (Parties to the Convention). At the (Cop3) meeting in Kyoto in 1997, industrialised countries (including Ireland) agreed specific limits to the growth of harmful greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 (caused when we burn fossil fuels, as well as from belching cattle and other sources). This agreement was called the Kyoto Protocol but some significant countries were not included - the US, China and India. It was at the Cop16 event in Canc\'fan in 2010 that world leaders committed to a specific limit for global warming, ie limiting climate change so that global warming caused by human activity does not increase by more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. But it is during Cop21 in Paris that the ambition agreed thus far is expected to become real and significant, moving from agreed aspiration to a negotiated plan to deliver. The hope is that we will achieve a deal on the 'how' part, ie a global agreement on who does what in order for the limit in global warming to be achieved. This is the focus of Cop21 . We have previously seen expectations build up only to result in disappointment, most notably the Cop15 meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 which failed to deliver. Why is Cop21 different? Firstly, recent evidence of changes happening on the ground around the world is striking. In 2014 energy-related greenhouse gas emissions did not increase, despite a 3 per cent growth in economic activity. Also, nearly half of all newly installed electricity-generating capacity came from renewable energy, in other words more additional power coming from wind, hydro and solar than from coal or natural gas. This was led by growth in China, the US, Japan and Germany. More significantly, the UN has received this year, in advance of the Cop21 event, pledges (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs) from 168 countries around the world for emissions reduction. This is unprecedented, being the first time that so many countries have declared what their own specific ambition is for a low-carbon future and how they plan to deliver on it. It provides a much stronger political basis for the two weeks of negotiations than any previous climate change event. The anticipated Cop21 climate change agreement will cover many dimensions, including targets for 2030; plans for how to transition to a low-carbon future; the mechanisms for investing in low-carbon technologies; cost-sharing between those who have been polluting for many years and those who wish to ensure the correct balance is struck between countries' competing goals. The opportunity is huge. The International Energy Agency estimates an investment of nearly EUR 13 trillion is needed between now and 2030 to facilitate the energy part of the transition to a low-carbon world. For Ireland, this is a challenging and exciting development. The time to plan is now. The time is also right to tease out where the specific opportunities lie for us from this global opportunity - to tap into the growing potential for energy efficiency solutions, for renewable energy technologies, for communities to benefit, to move beyond the buzzwords of smart energy systems and big data towards harnessing the potential that the energy transition provides.

A Belgian-born mother of two living near Newtownmountkennedy, Co Wicklow, has started a crowd-funding campaign on Facebook for a legal action against the Government on the basis that not enough is being done in Ireland to tackle climate change. Mieke Vanfleteren, whose partner is Irish, cited the example of a group of concerned citizens in the Netherlands who recently won a similar case against its government. As a result of this court ruling, she said "a faster transition to a carbon-free economy will now be necessary". Last year, some 10,000 people in Belgium became co-plaintiffs in a legal action against its government "because of the lack of sufficient action taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions", Ms Vanfleteren said. That case, known as Klimaatzaak, has yet to be determined. "We need to avoid a 2 degree Celsius temperature rise at all costs if we want to avoid losing coastal assets and more floods in Ireland," she said. "There are other advantages to shifting to renewables quickly: safeguarding our water, the air and health of our children as well as ending our dependency on oil. "The Irish Government does not have an ambitious programme to make the transition to a fossil-fuel free economy."She started a Facebook group called Climate Court Case Ireland that already has more than 400 members. "I set up a crowdfunding website to pay for legal fees necessary to bring this case to court." See: gofundme/aeaed3ak \</doc>

The 21st United Nations Conference of Parties on climate change, known as COP21 , will begin one month from today. As president of the conference, France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius has staked his legacy on its success. "My task is to achieve an ambitious compromise, and the two words must be taken together," Fabius said in his office on the quai d'Orsay. "It must be a compromise for everyone to accept it, but it has to be ambitious, because if we compromise at the expense of our goals we will not have done our job." Fabius is caught in a contest of wills between the resentful but often justified demands of the developing world, and rich countries reluctant to sacrifice in the interest of the planet. He is helped by the Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, whose mandate as president of COP20 technically runs until November 30th. "It's extremely useful having one country from the north and one from the south," Fabius said. Tension between the G77, comprised of 134 developing and emerging countries, and the developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), came to the fore when 1,500 negotiators of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action - known as the ADP - met in Bonn from October 19th-23rd. It was their last chance to approve a draft treaty before COP21 . "The G77 said the text was 'unbalanced' and to the detriment of developing countries," Fabius said. "That was their principal argument. We had to build a new text which is longer and with more options, but the structure of the first text is preserved . . . Ideally, we would have put forward a very short project with few options left to be decided." The final pre- COP21 draft treaty runs to 51 pages. Where negotiators could not agree, options are presented in brackets. Some paragraphs in article 3, regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, contain 16 different options. When ADP negotiators resume work in Paris on December 1st, they will have one week to boil down the unwieldy text. They will present it to Fabius, who will work with ministers for foreign affairs and the environment to agree on a final treaty by December 11th. Some 80 ministers will attend a "pre- COP21 " summit in Paris from November 8th-10th. Asked whether it would not be preferable to abandon the ADP process, Fabius replied "there is nothing wrong with being a little diplomatic". Eighty heads of state and government have accepted an invitation from President Fran\'e7ois Hollande and himself to attend the opening day of COP21 on November 30th, Fabius said. Their presence is supposed to create "political impetus" for the negotiations that follow. Barack Obama, the Chinese and Indian leaders Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Matteo Renzi have accepted. Vladimir Putin has not yet replied. Despite its disappointing results, the last Bonn session made progress on important issues, Fabius says. The mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation, away from carbon fuels and towards more reliance on renewable energy, are the two pillars of the fight against global warming. The OECD estimates only 16 per cent of finance has been devoted to adaptation. As the developing countries demand, "Bonn arrived at a broad consensus on the necessity of devoting more resources to adaptation", Fabius said. In advance of COP21 , 155 of 195 countries have submitted "intended nationally determined contributions" or INDCs, indicating how they will reduce their carbon output. Together, the 155 account for 90 per cent of global emissions. But when added up, their promised cuts will not limit the rise in the world's temperature to 1.5 or 2 degrees by 2100. The Paris treaty will avoid the "catastrophic scenario" of a 4, 5 or 6 degree rise in temperature, but at present levels of commitments, the temperature is still likely to rise 3 degrees, Fabius said. This has strengthened the French foreign minister's argument for periodic, upward revision of INDCs. "I have personally insisted for a long time on the necessity of a revision clause," he said. "Bonn strengthened support for this mechanism, which is important." Fabius said there was also "a move towards convergence" on follow-up to assess whether countries fulfil commitments to reduce emissions. However, he added, the expression "non-intrusive mechanism" comes up often. Binding agreement Asked what would represent a successful conference outcome for him, Fabius said, "The first criterion of success is a legally binding agreement, approved by all 195 countries - which has never happened - saying we commit ourselves not to go beyond 1.5 or 2 degrees." The above-mentioned revision clause is Fabius's second criterion. The manner, date and periodicity of revision are all under discussion. "We would be extremely disappointed if the question was not resolved positively," he said. Developing countries have stated they will not sign up to an agreement if the $100 billion which developed countries promised in annual aid for adaptation is not forthcoming, or if it is not extended beyond 2020. The OECD reported this month that developed countries spent $61.8 billion on helping the developing world adapt to global warming in 2014. The G77 contested the validity of the OECD study. Though finance and the transfer of technology may not be included in the Paris treaty, they are a prerequisite for its success, Fabius said. Carbon pricing and the need to diminish $500 billion in annual subsidies to the fossil fuel industry will not figure in the treaty either, but they will be discussed in Paris. \</doc>

This week's historically unprecedented gathering of 147 heads of state or government for the COP21 climate change conference in Paris underlines the overwhelming importance now being attached to the gravest environmental threat facing humanity and the Earth itself. But their often stirring rhetoric from the podium has not been reflected in closed-door sessions where negotiations are taking place with a view to concluding a meaningful, credible and universal agreement by the end of next week to show the world its leaders are committed to curbing global warming before we reach a dangerous tipping point. The traditional divisions between developed countries that got where they are today on the back of burning fossil fuels and their poorer counterparts, which have yet to achieve a similar level of prosperity, are all too apparent at the heavily guarded conference venue in Le Bourget. The fact that so much of the negotiating text - on issues such as the long-term goal, the pace and scale of cutting emissions, and finance to enable developing countries reduce their own emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change - remains in square brackets clearly indicates that ministers representing 195 nations face long hours in back rooms if they are to strike a deal. Yet there is strong momentum behind the process, generated by cities, regions, companies and universities divesting potentially up to $3 trillion from climate-polluting fossil fuels in favour of promoting renewable energy worldwide. A new focus on more sustainable forms of transport, energy-efficient buildings and economy-wide measures to reduce the carbon footprint of countries has also emerged - though there are still disputes over whether wholesale "decarbonisation" by 2050 or later should be an explicit objective of the Paris accord. One way or another, it is evident that the drive to achieve a low-carbon future is now happening and may become unstoppable. Where does Ireland stand in all of this? On shifting sand, it would appear. In his speech, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: "I hope that we are serious about putting in place a legally binding agreement on climate change that will underpin our actions on the goals already agreed and enhance our ability to reach them. This requires action by everybody - big and small." The problem is his real agenda is to seek an exemption for Irish agriculture in the context of EU targets to cut emissions by 40 per cent by 2030. If that is the case we must make meaningful commitments on other fronts such on eliminating peat and coal-burning power plants and on fossil fuel extraction including fracking - for starters. As Friends of the Earth noted, Mr Kenny "had one story for the world leaders gathered here in Paris and a completely different story for Paddy back home". Such double-speak is utterly indefensible. \</doc>

When world leaders begin negotiating a new climate deal in Paris at the end of the month, a new study showing Africa's temperatures have risen at twice the global rate ought to be crucial to their deliberations. Released in September by South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the findings from the computer-generated climate modelling of the continent's weather data from 1961 to 2010 provide a stark warning of Africa's future if the right deal is not struck. Last month, Laurence Tubiana, the main French negotiator for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), told The Irish Times Tubiana is head of the general secretariat for the conference, which hopes to get commitments from more than 190 countries to keep global warming below 2 degrees. However, the predictions in the CSIR paper entitled Projections of Rapidly Rising Surface Temperatures over Africa under Low Mitigation , suggest such a target would not save Africa's tropics and subtropics from the ravages of climate change. Local weather systems According to Fran\'e7ois Englebrecht, the CSIR project's lead scientist, by the end of the century both zones could witness further warming of at least 1\'bd times the global rate because of how climate change is expected to interact with the local weather systems. "In our modelling we look at the evidence and temperatures over the last five decades and it shows that climate change is already taking place in Africa at a rapid rate compared to the global rate," he says. Englebrecht also says data analysed by his team show Africa's subtropics' temperatures are rising by at least 2 degrees per century over the review period when globally surface temperatures increased at a rate of up to 1 degree per century (see panel). The African subtropics are warming up more quickly than everywhere else because of how climate change interacts with the region's semi-permanent high pressure weather systems, Englebrecht says. "When increased climate change is added to this type of weather pattern, the effect is that cloud-making is suppressed. This reduction in cloud cover over the land means more sunlight is reaching the surface area and drastically increasing its temperature," he says. While the subtropics of Australia and South America have a similar weather situation in terms of increasing surface temperatures, Africa's experience is more severe because its affected land mass is much bigger the others. The average temperature in Africa's subtropics is 30 degrees. Englebrecht says that, under a scenario where global temperatures rose by 3 degrees or more, parts of the continent were looking at a future where the average temperature is as high as 36 degrees. The impact of such increases on the agricultural and biodiversity sectors would be significant, says Englebrecht, and they will stem from extreme events such as heat waves, wild fires and drought. According to crop modelling, which helps to estimate yields when certain weather and soil conditions are applied, drought will decimate staple foods under a low mitigation future, especially important ones such as maize, which are needed for food security. Wild fires The enhanced temperatures expected in Africa imply the continent will have more wild fires. These usually happen in the savannah which provides grazing for domestic and wild animals. "Wild fires release CO2 into the atmosphere and trees thrive on this gas much more than grass does. So in the savannah trees are getting the upper hand at the expense of grassland, which adversely affects agricultural animals' and wildlife's grazing potential," he says. Englebrecht and his co-authors also say in their paper that general reductions in soil moisture across the continent as a result of the increased levels of evaporation that occurs in response to rising surface temperatures is a plausible reality in the future. "In the subtropics, this effectively implies a longer burning season and a shorter growing season," he says. If world leaders fail to secure a legally binding framework and emissions agreement in Paris that fully responds to Africa's more precarious position when it comes to rising temperatures, the continent's future looks bleak. "The decisions we make now will determine our energy future," says Englebrecht. "They will lock us into a certain type of climate future for the next century or more." \</doc>

While Ireland pledges to back a binding global agreement on reducing carbon emissions at the COP21 summit, a Connemara observatory which plays a key international role in monitoring climate change is facing an uncertain future. Lack of long-term funding for the Mace Head atmospheric research station is forcing reliance on goodwill to provide data underpinning the science at COP21 . Currently it has less than one full-time technician from NUI Galway (NUIG), and relies on PhD students and transient researchers to fulfil an escalating body of work. Critics say it falls between funding models due to a State policy which demands commercial job generation at the expense of basic research. The 56-year-old observatory, perched on the edge of the Atlantic, is one of a network of eight such "super-sites" in Europe ranging from the Alps to north Finland. However, Mace Head's isolation means it measures some of the continent's cleanest air. Regarded as one of the most sophisticated facilities of its kind in the world, it provides climate and air pollution data in "real time" every 10 minutes, and its information on volcanic eruptions like that of Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\'f6kull in 2010 has been crucial to safe air travel. The work of its scientists - among the world's most influential - is published regularly in journals lsuch as Nature . As Prof Colin O'Dowd and Prof Andy Shearer of NUIG's school of physics explain, the pressure on Mace Head to fulfil research contracts has escalated in recent years. Instrumentation "We have over EUR 10 million worth of instrumentation, and we are attracting EUR 2 million annually in research grants," they said. The Environmental Protection Agency, European Space Agency, Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority and the British department of environment, food and rural affairs are among research customers "The Mace Head atmospheric research station is at the forefront of understanding global climate change," Prof O'Dowd says. Few if any were talking about climate change when university physicist Dr Tom O'Connor discovered the location during a cycle around Connemara in search of an exposed site with minimal human influence. The headland's abandoned coast watch station - used to watch out for second World War submarines - was ideal, lying right in the path of mid-latitude cyclones traversing the north Atlantic. In 1986 it was selected as the site for major international projects, and it has been a baseline station for a UN agency, the Global Atmosphere Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation, since 1994. Scientists from more than 100 universities and institutions in 20 countries have drawn on the resource for national and international projects. A review by Norwegian and Swedish scientists two years ago described its sustainability as "wafer thin due to a very small number of experienced staff on soft-money contracts of variable duration" or no contracts at all. "A core number of experienced staff need to be employed in a more robust and secure framework," it said, recommending employment of at least two full-time technicians. Even an allocation of EUR 100,000 a year could make an enormous difference if part of a guaranteed operational budget, the NUIG scientists say. Not be drawn However the Department of the Environment would not be drawn on this . It said that both it and the EPA "recognise the global regional and local importance of Mace Head" and had provided long-term support through funding "research projects and scientific support for activities". "We look forward to the further strategic development of the site by NUIG which will ensure that it can continue to work at the cutting edge of atmospheric research," the department said. \</doc>

The UN requested that each leader speak for three minutes, although many spoke for considerably longer about the perils the planet faces due to climate change. French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande: I am not choosing between the fight against terrorism and the fight against global warming. We must leave our children more than a world free of terror, we owe them a planet protected from disasters. The greatest danger is not that we aim too high and we miss but that we aim too low and only do that. Christiana Figueres, executive director of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: Never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few. President Barack Obama, who spoke for 14 minutes, told delegates: We are one of the first generations to feel the impact of climate change and one of the last to do something about it. Prince Charles: If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago. You, ladies and gentlemen, have the power to put her on life support, and you must surely start the emergency procedures without further procrastination. German Chancellor Angela Merkel: This is a question of environmental necessity, but also of economic common sense... our very future as humankind hinges on this. Billions of people are pinning their hopes on what we achieve here in Paris. President Vladimir Putin: Climate change has become one of the gravest challenges that humanity is facing. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the presence of world leaders in Paris was proof that terrorism can not hold back mankind s efforts to address climate change and pursue a better future . Leaders of smaller nations also took the chance to stress the importance of addressing climate change. Anote Tong, president of Kiribati, a small island state endangered by rising sea levels, said Fiji has offered to accommodate the people of Kiribati if climate change renders our homes inhospitable . Baron Waqa, president of the small island state of Nauru, said: We have a choice: We can pay in human misery or pay investing in a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future. Bolivian President Evo Morales said: Saving Mother Earth to save life that is our endeavour. \</doc>

A chara, - Your editorial "Time to share the pain - no excuses" (April 23rd), dedicated to the signing of the UN climate change accord, eloquently described how the 175 countries that have pledged to reduce emissions must now "walk the talk" and, in doing so, avoid any special exemptions being placed on Ireland in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Rather than being framed as a burden, Ireland's move to a low-carbon economy can more appropriately be framed as an opportunity for Irish enterprise to accelerate the development of new products, technologies and services that can stimulate competitiveness and allow industry to enter new markets. Ireland has an ICT skills base, significant natural resources, and a vibrant entrepreneurial environment, and we have the benefit of an all-island market to test technologies on our grid. The question remains how to best engineer a transition to a low-carbon economy. Economists will argue for having an appropriate carbon tax, but pricing itself has historically rarely, if ever, driven large-scale energy transition. Europe's, and Ireland's, industrial base needs to be phased out and replaced with new technologies and practices that require a suite of policies, regulatory reforms and investments to spark this shift. A proactive government stimulating the development and diffusion of such clean technologies is required. Yet, while Europe leads the world in variable renewable energy, investment has stalled, providing a significant gap between the promises made at the COP21 global climate summit in Paris and the action that needs to implemented. Clean energy investment in Asia is thriving to the point where developing countries are out-investing developed countries in terms of clean energy technologies. Europe has an excellent research base but is not transferring its research into products. As Ireland moves to domestic ratification of the climate treaty, it must seize the opportunities from full implementation. This requires an acknowledgement that the challenges are interdisciplinary, and require collaboration across academia and with industry. Applied research remains critical to Ireland's ability to meet its future commitments arising from COP21 . Irish academic institutions are reorganising and cross-pollinating disciplines to meet this challenge, as highlighted by TCD's planned engineering, energy and environmental institute. The aim of reducing emissions from our agriculture, buildings and transport sectors presents overwhelmingly difficult challenges as we translate aspirations into action. While there are significant opportunities for Ireland, and Europe - including energy storage, low-carbon heating and cooling, energy efficiency, market integration, marine renewable, and distributed generation - further applied research into energy technologies can enable our sectors to become more sustainable. We also need more examples of energy citizen engagement, such as CorkCiti Engage. As US secretary of state John Kerry stated upon signing the COP 21 climate deal, "None of what we have to achieve is beyond our capacity technologically . . . The only question is whether it is beyond our collective resolve". - Is mise, Dr MATT KENNEDY, International Energy Research Centre, Tyndall Institute, Cork. \</doc>

Thousands of people in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Belfast will take to the streets tomorrow to put pressure on the Government and world leaders ahead of the COP21 climate change summit in Paris. The marches, coinciding with similar events all over the world, are organised by Stop Climate Chaos - a coalition of 28 non-governmental organisations and other groups including Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Tr\'c3\'b3caire, and supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. One of the groups, People's Climate, said the "horrific and tragic" events in Paris recently meant French civilians could not express their fundamental right to demonstrate, "which means we in the global movement and in Ireland must mobilise with even more determination than before". Protests are banned under France's state-of-emergency legislation. Fracking The groups are calling on the Government to commit to producing a climate action plan next year, to pledge "adequate finance" to the Green Climate Fund, to ban fracking and to commit to reducing pollution. Climate justice In Cork the event begins on Grand Parade at 2pm. Organisers there say they will be marching in the name of "climate justice, clean energy, sustainable cities, a fossil-fuel free future and green jobs". Community group Transition Galway is helping to organise the Galway Carnival for the Climate in the city tomorrow. It invites all those taking part to dress up to help add to the carnival atmosphere, and wants street performers, drummers, musicians and singers to take part. The gathering starts in front of The Skeff at Eyre Square at 12.30pm, leaving at 1pm to go down Shop Street and Quay Street to the plaza in front of the Galway City Museum at the Spanish Arch. The Belfast march starts at Donegall Street at 2pm, and participants will gather at Writer's Square for what they plan to make the "largest-ever climate gathering" in the city. Organisers want the Northern Ireland Assembly to introduce an "ambitious climate change Bill" and to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors. They are also calling for community ownership of renewable energy. \</doc>

A POINT of information to begin with: Energy usage in Kerry is responsible for the emission of 1.22 million tonnes of CO2 per year. That breaks down as 8.8 tonnes for every man, woman and child in the county each year. THE 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 'Stop Climate Chaos', a group who have been to the fore in arguing for more action and less talk on climate change, argue that is important for the Irish Government to ensure that Ireland does its fair share and moves decisively towards a low-carbon economy. To this end they should implement the 'polluter pays' principle and immediately bring in a climate change law which provides for an annual 'carbon budget', analogous to the annual financial budget, and 3% year-on-year reductions in Irish greenhouse gas emissions. All sectors of Irish society would have to contribute to keeping within this budget, and allocations would therefore probably be made sector by sector. The carbon budget would be given similar political importance to the conventional budget with all government departments having a role to play in keeping emissions within the limits set. Based on the scientific evidence, and the lead responsibility that should be taken by rich countries, the carbon budget should be set in line with a total average annual reduction in Irish greenhouse gas emissions must reduce from this year. greenhouse gas emissions of at least 3%. It should be noted however that the level of annual reduction rises with each year of delay, and that it must in any case be kept under review to reflect the latest scientific analysis of the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gas concentrations. In order to achieve the required pollution reductions, the Government will need to introduce a range of policies that support and incentivise innovation in public services, private enterprises and personal behaviour. The implementation of the polluter pays principle endorsed at the Rio Earth Summit will have to be central to that effort. Putting a price on carbon across the whole economy can be a clear and fair way to encourage individuals and organisations to make choices which reduce pollution. The carbon pricing system can and must be designed in a way that ensures the social protection of the most vulnerable people in our society. Failure to act will exacerbate the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable people on the planet. The Irish Government need to take the lead, and push for an international agreement to keep the rise in global temperatures to two degrees Celsius or less. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that global warming must be capped at two degrees Celsius or preferably substantially less, this. In the past few weeks it has been announced that we are half way there already. If we fail to contain global warming, hundreds of millions of people across the globe will lose their lives and livelihoods, up to a third of landbased species may become extinct, immense political instability will occur as people migrate to avoid droughts and floods and compete for scarce resources, and great economic damage will be caused by increasingly extreme weather. There is also the grave danger of insecurity and conflict from the continued expansion of fossil fuel use. Only a set of binding targets, within a global framework, will deliver the necessary reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. If the two degrees Celsius ceiling is not to be breached then global emissions must peak this year and then irreversibly decline. This will require the industrialised countries, who still contribute disproportionately to global emissions and who historically have been responsible for the bulk of the emissions now changing the climate, to adopt and meet exacting emissions reduction targets. The rest of the world must also be brought within a framework of binding targets, but the latter must occur via a process that allows them to meet their developmental needs. \</doc>

Some 150 heads of state and government, including US president Barack Obama and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, urged each other to agree in two weeks of talks to steer the world away from fossil fuels. They arrived at UN climate change talks in Paris with high expectations and armed with promises to act. After decades of struggling negotiations and the failure of a summit in Copenhagen six years ago, some form of landmark agreement appears all but assured by mid-December. Warnings from climate scientists, demands from activists and exhortations from religious leaders such as Pope Francis have coupled with major advances in cleaner energy sources like solar power to raise pressure for cuts in carbon emissions. Most scientists say failure to agree on strong measures in Paris would doom the world to ever-hotter temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts, and rising sea levels as the polar ice melts. Facing such projections, the leaders of nations responsible for about 90% of the world s greenhouse gas emissions have come bearing pledges to reduce their carbon output. Over the next two weeks, negotiators will hammer out the strongest international climate pact yet. What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realisation that it is within our power to do something about it, said Mr Obama. Security has been tightened after Islamist militant attacks killed 130 people on November 13, and Mr Hollande said he could not separate the fight with terrorism from the fight against global warming . Leaders must face both challenges, leaving their children a world freed of terror as well as one protected from catastrophes . On the eve of the summit, an estimated 785,000 people from Australia to Paraguay joined the biggest day of climate change activism in history, telling world leaders there was no Planet B in the global warming fight. The US and China have both determined that it is our responsibility to take action , Obama said after meeting Mr Xi. That partnership has been a balm for the main source of tension that characterised previous talks, in which the developing world argued that countries that grew rich by industrialising on fossil fuels should pay the cost of shifting all economies to a renewable energy future. Now even China, once a leading voice of that club, has agreed to contribute to a Green Climate Fund that hopes to dispense 94.5bn a year after 2020 as a way to finance the developing world s shift towards renewables. \</doc>

At least 17 people drowned and four more were missing when torrential rains flooded the C\'f4te d'Azur between Cannes and Nice overnight from Saturday to Sunday. The prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department of southeastern France said there was "limited hope" of finding the missing people. Rescue workers found it difficult to reach some areas, and it is feared the death toll could rise. Residents of the area spoke of the extraordinary violence and rapidity of the storm, which uprooted trees on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, carried cars from the streets of Cannes into the Mediterranean, and severely disrupted air, rail and road traffic. The largest number of victims were in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, a suburb of Cannes, where seven people went to underground car parks with the intention of moving their vehicles to higher ground. Their bodies were found floating near the entrances to the car parks. 'Not disciplined' The mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, lamented that people were "not always disciplined", adding that "we had people who seemed very concerned about their cars, when they should have saved lives". Three elderly women drowned in their ground floor room at the Clos Saint-Gr\'e9goire retirement home in Biot. Two employees managed to save some 20 residents to a higher floor. A family of three drowned in their car at Vallauris-Golfe-Juan, after ignoring warnings not to enter a tunnel. At least two people died in Cannes. An Englishwoman drowned in at the Pylone campground in Antibes. "She came every year and was so happy that she stayed after the summer," the camp manager told BFM television. Nine looters were arrested in Cannes when they stole merchandise from shops whose windows were blown in. Rescue mission Some of the 105 helicopter rescue missions were to hoist campers from the roofs of caravans in campsites at Antibes. Helicopter images showed the coast to be a picture of desolation, with roads blocked by mudslides, fallen trees and cars that piled up with the force of the torrent. Fire trucks pumped water from flooded buildings. President Francois Hollande toured the area with interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve and promised to declare it a natural disaster zone at Wednesday's cabinet meeting, so that indemnities will be paid within three months. He also promised compensation to shopkeepers and artisans. Mr Hollande linked the catastrophe to climate change, saying: "We must take decisions. That is what is at stake at COP21 ." The 21st UN conference on climate change will take place in Paris in December. 'Solidarity' Pope Francis called for "concrete solidarity" with the victims in his angelus. At the height of the storm on Saturday night, 70,000 homes were without electricity, and 15,000 remained without water or electricity last night. The tourist season had not completely ended, and some 500 tourists, including many Britons and Danes, slept in Nice airport overnight. Flights resumed normally from Nice and Hy\'e8res yesterday. Thousands of people were stranded overnight in trains. All trains between Nice and Toulon were cancelled yesterday and the SNCF railway company said traffic would be severely disrupted today. Weather forecasters said that although the storm was predicted, it was impossible to know it would be so severe. "You have to realise that 107 litres of water fell on every square metre of a zone that was only 15km by 15km," Jean- Charles Rivrain of M\'e9t\'e9o France told La Provence newspaper. "We don't have the tools to predict on such a small scale." \</doc>

Whatever suspense remained over the COP21 climate conference that will take place in Paris from November 30th to December 11th evaporated this week, when representatives of 70 of the 195 participating countries met in Paris for a "pre-COP". "There will Figueres spoke at a press conference with France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will preside over COP21 , and the Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal, who ran last year's COP20 in Lima. Reports published during the "pre-COP" had driven home the gravity of the situation, Fabius said. He quoted the World Bank's finding that 100 million more people are in danger of falling into extreme poverty by 2030 unless there are immediate reductions in carbon emissions and the report by the World Meteorological Organisation that greenhouse gas emissions broke all records last year. Before 2020 The "pre-COP" addressed four themes: the level of ambition of the Paris accord; the issue of equity and differentiation between industrialised and developing countries; continued financing to help developing countries elaborate low-carbon strategies once the Paris accord comes into force in 2020; and action to be taken before 2020. Fabius said the ambiance at the "pre-COP" was "excellent" and that it made progress on five issues. Climate financing for the developing world and promises to reduce carbon emissions will be reviewed every five years. The idea, contained in a recent Franco-Chinese joint statement "has moved ahead to the point where it is accepted by everyone," Fabius said. There was also agreement on the principle that there can be "no back-tracking" by any country on its "intended nationally determined contributions" (INDCs), which must be increased over time. Regarding the goals of COP21 , "everyone agrees on an objective of 2 degrees", Fabius said, referring to the promise not to allow global temperatures to rise more than 2 degrees by 2100. Vulnerable countries complain that even at 2 degrees, the consequences will be drastic. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Sudan marked the "pre-COP" by submitting their INDCs, meaning that 160 of 195 countries have now made voluntary commitments. "With the INDCs, we've avoided the scenario of a 4, 5 or 6 degree rise in temperature," Fabius said. "We're at around 3 degrees. We must go downward, towards 2 degrees, and ideally towards 1.5 degrees." Developing countries have pledged to increase the funds they donate to climate adaptation in the developing world annually, reaching $100 billion (EUR 93 billion) in 2020. "The question is still open for after 2020," Fabius said. "The notion that $100 billion has become a kind of threshold and that there can be new sources of finance was something we hadn't discussed in such a clear way before." Accord text Finally, the "pre-COP" agreed on the schedule for the conference: 117 heads of state or government have promised to attend the opening session on November 30th. Negotiations on the text of the accord will resume that evening. Fabius has asked that UN negotiators give him their draft text by noon on December 5th. He and national environment and foreign ministers will then have six days to resolve outstanding details. President Fran\'e7ois Hollande's proposal for an "environmental security council" during a seminar at the Coll\'e8ge de France on Tuesday was not likely to reassure countries that are wary of meddling in their internal affairs. Hollande said he hoped that "binding rules" would emerge from the Paris agreement. "The next step is to have an organisation, a form of environmental security council, to decide what is acceptable, that your behaviour is dangerous . . .," Hollande said. "If the climate is such a danger for mankind, then we need an international body to take decisions . . . Which also means what sanctions we will apply when a country or a group, industrial or other, goes against what we have decided. The next step is to organise laws . . ." Asked about the president's proposal, Fabius said that while "France supports strengthening world governance on the environment, this is not a subject for this COP. Our priority is to reach a universal accord in Paris. The Paris accord will, however, include a control mechanism, Figueres said. "It's called MRV - monitoring, reporting and verification. It's going to be a peer-based system where countries will report their compliance with INDCs to their colleagues." Old-fashioned selfishness may be the greatest motivator. "The INDCs are in the interest of the countries presenting them," Figueres said. "National interest is more powerful than a punitive system or legally binding compliance. The law is good, but self-interest is just as good or sometimes better." Achieving transition Fabius and Figueres both emphasised the importance of civil society in achieving a transition to carbon-free development. The UNFCCC's Nazca (Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action) portal has registered more than 6,000 commitments to climate action by companies, cities, subnational regions and investors. A whole day of the conference - December 5th - will be devoted to "non-state actors" and Fabius predicted "extremely spectacular commitments". "There is no such thing as 'Waiting for Godot,'" Figueres said. "Godot is already here. The turning point is already under way. The Paris agreement will only mark and accelerate it." \</doc>

With only a few months to go before France hosts the COP21 conference on climate change, the presidential palace offered a sneak preview of events from November 30th to December 11th. The \'c9lys\'e9e's lavish reception rooms were filled with high-ranking officials, scientists, business executives, artists, representatives of NGOs and media. The half-day session was intended "to demonstrate the mobilisation and the unity of France's team in the last stretch", the president's office said. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, opened the meeting with the usual warning that "the survival of our planet is at stake", that the first seven months of this year were the hottest ever recorded, and that "if we continue this tendency, temperatures will increase four or five degrees by the end of the century, which would be an ecological, economic, humanitarian and security cataclysm". In a week dominated by the migrant crisis, the statement by France's environment minister, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, that half the world's migrants were fleeing encroaching deserts and evaporating water supplies struck a chord. "If no substantial measures are taken, we won't be dealing with hundreds of thousands of refugees but millions over the next 20 or 30 years," President Fran\'e7ois Hollande said. Emission pledges "It's late. It may already be too late," Hollande said. Only 58 countries have volunteered quantified pledges of reductions in emissions. The deadline for national contributions is October 1st. Hollande, France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, will put pressure on heads of state and government at the UN General Assembly on September 27th and 28th. Fabius hopes to receive the text of a "pre-accord" from negotiators by early October. At the autumn session of the World Bank and IMF in Peru, from October 9th to 11th, Fabius's finance minister, Michel Sapin, will try to rustle up contributions to the $100 billion annual Green Climate Fund. Fabius intends to hold a "pre-COP" in early November, and the November 15th-16th G20 summit in Turkey will provide a last opportunity to tie up loose ends. The French are determined to avoid sleepless nights of fruitless negotiations, as happened at Copenhagen. Presiding over COP21 was so risky, Hollande joked, that France was the only candidate for the job. There were nonetheless "positive signs", including the fact that "the largest emitters - the US, China and the EU, who together account for 50 per cent of greenhouse gases - have presented ambitious road maps". High finance "has begun to integrate climate change into their calculations and investment choices", a sign not so much of hope as of the fact that reality has sunk in, the French president said. St\'e9phane Troussel, president of the council of Seine-Saint-Denis, said he hoped " COP21 will help us change the image of our department". The conference will take place at the Le Bourget exhibition park, on the sometimes dangerous RER suburban train line that runs from the Gare du Nord to Charles de Gaulle Airport. The government will distribute free public-transport passes to the 20,000 delegates attending the conference in the hope of avoiding mass traffic jams. Another 20,000 members of the public are expected, along with 3,000 journalists, for a total of 43,000. An extra 70,000 bus and train seats will be provided each day. Electric minibuses will ferry visitors around the vast site at Le Bourget, which will become a veritable town, complete with post office, bank and restaurants. The conference is expected to cost the government EUR 170 million, but it should also bring in EUR 100 million for businesses in the Paris region. Philippe Salle, who heads the catering company Elior, described COP21 as a showcase for French gastronomy. Chefs will use fresh, local food for the 412,500 snacks and meals served at Le Bourget. There will be no strawberries flown in from South America. Video messages The \'c9lys\'e9e's presentation at times resembled an evangelical tent meeting with stand-up testimonials. Valls announced that France would no longer provide export credits for coal-fired power plants, a longstanding demand of environmental groups. Chief executives from several of France's largest companies promised to slash greenhouse-gas emissions from their factories. The head of Michelin said he would find a way to reduce the energy required to rotate tyres. v\'e9lo g\'e9n\'e9rateurs and solar panels will ply the streets. On December 5th a drummer, composer and producer, Marc Cerrone, will produce a Supernature 2015 sound and light show at the Arc de Triomphe. "I was always moved by the beauty of the planet which is our mother," Cerrone says. "That night, the most beautiful images of our planet will be the star." \</doc>

Only immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can hope to prevent massive impacts on marine ecosystems, warn the experts. Researchers compared the fate of the oceans under two scenarios, one a business-as-usual approach and the other involving drastic cuts in emissions. Their analysis showed that business-as-usual would have an enormous and effectively irreversible impact on ocean ecosystems and the services they provide, such as fisheries, by 2100. Even after curbing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) enough to prevent temperatures rising by more than 2C compared with pre-industrial levels, many marine ecosystems would still suffer, they said. The international team led by Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, from the Laboratoire d Oceanographie de Villefranche in France, wrote in the journal Science: Impacts on key marine and coastal organisms, ecosystems, and services from anthropogenic (man-made) CO2 emissions are already detectable, and several will face high risk of impacts well before 2100, even with the stringent CO2 emissions scenario. These impacts are occurring across all latitudes and have become a global concern that spans the traditional north/south divide. Any new global climate agreement that fails to minimise the impact on oceans will be incomplete and inadequate , stressed the scientists. The findings are intended to inform the forthcoming 2015 United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris. By 2050, the loss of critical habitats such as coral reefs and mangroves was expected to contribute to substantial declines for tropical fisheries, on which many human communities depended, said the researchers. This was the case even under the 2C emission cutting scenario. While Arctic fisheries may benefit from warmer temperatures at first, the scientists pointed out that this region was a hot spot of ocean acidification. It also contained communities that were highly reliant on the sea. The research was based on experiments, field observations and computer simulations. \</doc>

WHEN you consider that we now live in the Doomsday scenario where a Nato country has downed a Russian jet, it's only fitting that so many of the world's political players have gathered this week to discuss a perilous, pressing development. Then, when you consider the 130 people killed in Paris in multiple terrorist attacks, it's only fitting that they chose to meet in that city. What is not fitting, surely, is that they gathered at a massive conference to talk about the weather, or, as it's better known, COP21 . And, as is now the tradition at any global gathering, it also allowed the usual rag-bag of extremists and violent anarchists to riot against the French police, desecrating a memorial to the recent terror victims in the process. Forget, for a moment, the usual debates about whether climate change is man-made or not - it would be absurd to presume that we can constantly pollute the planet without serious ramifications. Forget the fact that the glaciers are growing, not shrinking, as we were previously warned. Forget even that global warming has stalled in the last decade, much to the baffled chagrin of the Chicken Littles who have been busy telling us the sky is falling. These are mere trifling details which matter not a jot to the zealots and cranks who have been banging the climate-change drum for years but details, like facts, are simply inconvenient truths which must be dismissed as quickly as anyone making the points is demonised. For all Obama's high-falutin' rhetoric about this being our last chance to save the planet and the sense of obviously fake urgency that characterised the speeches of the last few days, this is a remarkably safe conference which has achieved precisely nothing - but how could it? The world's developing countries produce 80pc of carbon emissions and neither India nor China, the two greatest polluters, are going to do anything to endanger their massive economic and industrial growth - a fact proved by the news that they will face no consequences if they breach their already generous carbon allowances. Instead, 14 days will be spent on hearing submissions from groups like the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network, which promises such delights as: "Powerful women from around the world sharing stories, struggles, solutions and action plans on climate justice mobilisation." That's all very worthy, I'm sure. But as recent opinion polls show that the general public's patience with climate scaremongering is wavering, it appears that fewer people are unthinkingly swallowing the climate-change Kool Aid than previously. There is the inevitable hypocrisy, of course, but that is to be expected - with an average round trip to Paris of 14,000km per delegate, the two-week shindig will produce 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and even the most ardent climate change activist would surely admit that there is something grimly amusing about all that hot air being used to discuss the problems caused by hot air. But this conference is ultimately nothing more than a distraction; a way for governments to pretend that they are doing something when they are actually doing nothing. People are perfectly entitled to think that climate change is a greater threat to world peace and security than global terrorism. But they are wrong and deep down, they must realise that fact. But it is a lot easier to gather so many countries together and then angrily shake your fist at a problem that has no obvious villain - apart from the nasty West, obviously - than it is to confront the clear and very present danger posed by terrorists and expansionist Islam. It was quite striking to see the most disappointing US president in living memory display so much emotion and passion during his speech on this topic when he has proved to be so aloof and removed from virtually every other problem he faces, particularly ones where he might be forced to make a moral judgment. The Obama who spoke the other day looked like a president on a mission - what a pity he has picked the wrong mission. People are justifiably more concerned about their safety than they are about reducing emissions, that out is either denounced as a 'climate denier' (which some countries want to criminalise, the way Holocaust denial is already a crime in Germany) or a racist who is simply terrified of foreigners with dark skin. This has been Obama's finest achievement - a monumental, global, three-card trick which allows him to spout the platitudes in which he so revels while parts of the world are literally burning. In a largely secular West, the rigid dogmatism of climate change consensus is as close to an organised religion as we have and anyone who dares to question the official orthodoxy is denounced as a heretic. Most people can accept that fluctuating climate patterns are, to one degree or another, man-made. But that position also fails to take account of the fact that industrialisation is the route to prosperity for developing nations and more industrialisation means more pollution and carbon emissions. So - protecting the earth or saving the starving? The two, unfortunately, are mutually exclusive. In the meantime, Isil having been warned by Obama that COP21 would be £ severe rebuke' to their activities, have presumably laid down their weapons and decapitation-swords to have a long, hard think about the damage they have done to Mother Earth. So - protecting the earth or saving the starving? The two, unfortunately, are mutually exclusive \</doc>

Taoiseach Enda Kenny struck a slightly different note when, while supporting a comprehensive deal, he sought support to allow Ireland to miss its targets in agriculture in 2020. The reality of what the world is facing was graphically spelt out by the prime minister of the Bahamas, Perry Christie, when he said his collection of islands is already suffering from a 1C rise in global temperatures. What would be a normal tropical storm last month developed into category-5 Hurricane Joaquin in 36 hours, causing $100m ( 94.6m) worth of damage, equivalent to 10% of the country s national budget. Other leaders of small islands doomed to disappear if the climate rise reaches 1.5C over pre-industrial levels appealed to national and industry leaders to be more ambitious, reduce fossil fuel use, and develop new mechanisms to allow growth and development for the poorer countries. Many national leaders talked about future generations and how they would not understand if the hard decisions were not taken now. Mr Kenny, one of 150 prime ministers and presidents addressing the first day of the 11-day conference, said: Let us not deprive our successors and our children of a real future before they are born. UK prime minister David Cameron said they could not argue cost, since the coming generations would compare the required $100bn ( 94.6bn) climate fund to the $5tn ( 4.73tn) under management in the City of London. The mood music from Xi Jinping, the president of China, now the world s leading carbon emitter, was also more positive, driven by pressure from his own people, suffering the effects of pollution in its major cities. He and Mr Obama gave a joint press conference where the latter said they were both in agreement that it is our responsibility to take action . Some countries, led by India, are not so positive, as they say they were not the historical creators of climate change and so, developing countries should not have to take action that would limit their economic growth. There will be announcements from businesses, and the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, pledging to invest in developing technologies to help fight climate change.

A grimy, ramshackle exhibition park in a Paris felt like the headquarters of world government yesterday when President Francois Hollande opened the COP21 UN climate conference by telling 10,000 delegates, "The hope of all mankind rests on your shoulders." In their speeches, the heads of state and government revisited the same themes: the urgency of reaching an agreement, their criteria for what would constitute a good agreement, and a collective mea culpa on the part of developed countries for having brought the world to such a condition. "I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognises our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it," President Barack Obama said. Kyoto Mr Hollande played to the developing and emerging countries who have the power to scupper an agreement. "How could we accept that the poorest countries, those who emit the least greenhouse gases, be the most vulnerable and those most affected?" he asked. "It is in the name of climate justice that I come before you today." The French foreign minister and conference president, Laurent Fabius, recalled an old woman in Bangladesh who had been flooded out of her home nine times, the "apocalyptic" disintegration of glaciers in Greenland and the dismay of a Bolivian farmer in Cochabamba. Mr Obama had seen dramatic evidence of climate change in Alaska, "where the sea is already swallowing villages and eroding shorelines; where permafrost thaws and tundra burns". Most boasted of the efforts they are already making. "Our country is taking the lead," Vladimir Putin said in a deadpan tone. "We have gone beyond the commitments in Kyoto. By 2030 we plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent." Though China is the world's leading polluter, the Chinese president Xi Jinping enjoyed immense goodwill at Le Bourget for China's tardy conversion to the crusade against climate change. "Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind," he said. Mr Obama said he believed, like Dr Martin Luther King Jr, "that there is such a thing as being too late. And when it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us." Mr Hollande was doubtless the most ambitious speaker. There were shades of President Michael D Higgins when he said that "our greatest challenge is to move from globalisation based on competition to a model based on co-operation, where it will be more profitable to protect than destroy. . . We must establish a pact of equality between north and south, a partnership between man and nature." More prosaically, the UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon asked the heads of state and government to bring their national negotiators into line. Climate change talks have taken on a life of their own, and diplomats complain that some of the 1,500 negotiators who drew up the 55-page draft accord have become obsessed with detail. "I urge you to instruct your negotiators to choose the path of compromise and consensus," he said. "Bold climate action is in the national interest of every single country represented at this conference. The time for brinkmanship is over." Bataclan There was an almost sheepish admission that the developing world has not yet coughed up the $100 billion in annual aid for adaptation and mitigation which it promised six years ago. "We must show that we will deliver on what we promised in Copenhagen," said the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Ban also confirmed his wish to see a key demand of developing countries fulfilled at COP21 . "Developed countries must keep their pledge to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020. This same amount should serve as the floor for post-2020 finance commitments." At the moment, the developed countries have mustered pledges for only $85 billion. Before coming to the conference, several world leaders went to Paris's 11th district, to pay their respects to the 89 people slaughtered at the Bataclan concert hall. Accompanied by Mr Hollande, Mr Obama had gone directly from Orly airport to the makeshift memorial on Sunday night, to lay a white rose on the pile of flowers. "We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on," the US leader said in his speech. It was, he added, "an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children". "Through our presence here today, we show that we are stronger than terrorism," Mrs Merkel said. \</doc>

French national and local authorities are facing a huge bill for security at next summer's European championships. The president of the local organising committee Jacque Lambert has said that there is a great deal of work to be done just to get to the stage where it is clear what is actually required Lambert said that the tournament organisers had spent a great deal of time studying the events of Friday, November 13th, in order to draw conclusions on how to prepare for the tournament next summer. He said that with the French authorities preoccupied by the United Nations Climate Change conference , and some local authorities still getting to grips with the scale of the changed security landscape, there is a lot of work to be done. He insisted, however, that there is enough time to do all that is required. City authorities had expressed a strong desire to proceed with the planned 'fanzones', he said, despite concerns that these might be vulnerable to attack. "The various governments expressed the wish to have the crowd gather in one place rather than be scattered around towns," he said. He said that perhaps the most important aspect of the preparations would be to ensure that the police and military security provided by government works closely and effectively with the private security companies being hired by the tournament organisers. The task of working to prevent attacks at such an enormous event - Paris alone is expecting three million visitors while the tournament is on - is daunting. Security Earlier in the day, the deputy mayor of Paris with responsibility for tourism and sport, Jean-Fran\'e7ois Martins, said that the security measures being taken would overshadow those at any previous tournament. "I cannot sign a 100 per cent guarantee for you. Nobody can do that because you cannot know what will happen, but we will do all that we can do to make it the safest Euros ever, I think. No Euro competition has had the sort of security that we will have for this one in Paris ... and in France." \</doc>

Electric vehicles from the Renault-Nissan Alliance shuttled more than 8,000 VIP delegates, media and negotiators and traveled at least 110,000 miles during the Paris climate talks -- without emitting any CO2 tailpipe emissions and without using any petroleum whatsoever. The fleet of 200 electric vehicles, which transported delegates during the two-week United Nations' annual climate change conference in Paris, saved nearly 182 barrels of oil or 18 tons of CO2 not emitted while driving. COP21 , which ran from Nov. 30 through Dec. 11. The Alliance EV fleet was the world's largest electric-vehicle fleet ever provided to an international conference. The EVs made more than 3,800 transfers shuttling accredited delegates to and from hotels to the Bourget conference venue north of Paris. The fleet featured the Renault ZOE subcompact car, the Nissan LEAF compact car and the 7-seater Nissan e-NV200 van. Renault and Nissan employees volunteered as drivers and electric vehicle ambassadors for the cars, which were available to COP21 delegates as a complement to public transportation. COP21 marked the first time the U.N. used a 100 per cent electric fleet for its entire passenger-car shuttle at a climate summit. COP21 also resulted in the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change Call for Action, an agreement that aims to increase EVs and their charging infrastructure. The Renault-Nissan Alliance signed the action plan, which aims to keep the transport sector in line with the COP21 promise to reduce the impact of climate change. \</doc>

China has issued 155 coal-fired power plants, generally blamed as one of the chief reasons for the country's dire pollution problems, environmental permits in the first nine months of this year. Although last year saw the first decline in China's coal output after 15 years of consecutive growth, coal still accounted for 66 per cent of the country's energy consumption. The fall was accompanied by record increases in power generation from hydropower, wind, solar, nuclear and gas, along with slower power consumption growth. However, power companies are investing in coal-power plants because so much of the economy is built on investment in infrastructure such as power plants. The plants will add to a severe overcapacity problem and add to the burden of public debt, the environmental group Greenpeace has said. If they do go into operation, however, the plants would have significant environmental and health impacts, and Greenpeace East Asia has called for an immediate ban on permits to new coal-fired power plants. "As coal consumption declines and China steps up its climate commitments, state-owned companies are blindly investing in a polluting, water-intensive and outmoded form of power generation," said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior global campaigner on coal. "Money which should be invested in renewables is simply being poured down the drain," she added.The report comes as China's northeast again wrestles with terrible pollution. Beijing has been badly polluted for days and in the city of Shenyang readings were about 50 times higher than considered safe by the World Health Organisation. Some 66 out of 74 cities in China fell short of government standards for concentrations of pollutants. The report comes just weeks before the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. President Xi Jinping and US president Barack Obama have agreed they will make a deal where China's CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and China has focused on developing renewable alternatives. But coal remains cheap and easy and it is hard to convince local governments to look at alternatives. Energy targets China has set strict energy targets for 2020 and has also introduced a number of air pollution action plans for 2017. According to an investigation by Greenpeace East Asia, the total expenditure on the 155 projects could reach 470 billion yuan (EUR 69 billion) and add up to 40 per cent of the state-owned firms involved. According to Greenpeace projections, the yearly CO2 emissions from the 155 projects would be equal to 6 per cent of China's current emissions, or to the total energy-related emissions of Brazil. Over an assumed life of 24 years, the plants would emit 1.4 times China's annual emissions. The toxic particulate emissions from the projects would be larger than the emissions from all the cars in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing. \</doc>

Organisers of the COP21 UN climate conference and environmentalists are deeply divided over the role of the fossil fuel industry. A group of NGOs submitted a petition yesterday to Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It wants big polluters to be "kicked out" of climate policy-making in much the same way that a firewall was established between public health officials and the tobacco industry. Activists question Figueres's impartiality. She was climate change adviser to Latin America's largest energy company, Endesa, before she became the UN climate chief in 2010, and strongly believes in working with the fossil fuel industry. Figueres's spokesman Nick Nuttall, said it was "totally unfair" to reproach her for having worked for Endesa. He acknowledged that Figueres "will constantly try to engage with the fossil fuel industry". "We have to deal with the reality of the world in which we live, and therefore we have to deal with the reality of the corporations that operate on this planet, and bring them all in common cause towards bringing down emissions. Lobbying " COP21 COP21 . A pamphlet published by the CEO defines "greenwashing" as "companies that pollute the planet, destroy the climate and the means of subsistence of the populations affected, while at the same time declaring themselves to be friends of the environment and promoters of social progress". Some 40 corporate sponsors have contributed EUR 26 million to the French government's EUR 187 million budget for COP21 . Their logos are displayed throughout the conference site. Environmentalists particularly object to the presence of Air France, the mostly state-owned electricity company EDF, the gas company Engie and BNP Paribas bank. Aviation is the fastest growing sector for emissions, and Air France, along with the International Air Transport Association IATA, lobbies against stricter climate regulations. EDF is a giant in nuclear power. Sabido says, contrary to its claims, nuclear power is not a low-carbon industry. Engie is deeply involved in the coal and gas industry, and lobbies for the development of shale gas and oil in France. Fossil fuel companies now claim that natural gas, including shale gas released by hydraulic fracturing or "fracking," is "low carbon". Not so, says Sabido. Methane leakage from gas is more destructive to the atmosphere than coal. Power plants There has been a rush by banks and other investors to get out of coal. However, BNP Paribas - a sponsor of COP21 - persists. The Pinocchio Climate Awards, organised by Friends of the Earth France, cites BNP Paribas's role in the construction of the Medupi and Kusile coal-fired power plants in South Africa. "Together they will emit 60 million tonnes of carbon every year, increasing South Africa's greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent," notes the group's website. Sabido predicts that the "carbon bubble" will burst in spectacular fashion, not unlike the housing bubble in 2008. "If 80 per cent of fossil fuels have to be left in the ground, assets will lose all their value." COP21 To improve their image and forestall disinvestment, companies including BP, Shell, Statoil, Total and Saudi Aramco launched their Oil and Gas Climate Initiative at the UN in September 2014. The French oil company Total was centre stage at a business and climate summit at Unesco last May. But the two largest oil companies in the US, ExxonMobil and and Chevron, want no part of "greenwashing". "We don't intend to participate in that coalition," Chevron's chairman John Watson told a shareholders' meeting in May. "We're not going to be disingenuous about it. We're not going to fake it," Exxon chairman Rex Tillerson told reporters in Dallas, also last May. He strongly implied that his European competitors were "faking" their newfound ecological fervour. For environmentalists such as Sabido, the presence of a "Gallery of Solutions" - a business trade show - at COP21 , and "Solutions COP21 ," which will open at the Grand Palais in central Paris today, are further examples of greenwashing. For fees ranging from EUR 30,000 to EUR 250,000, companies can display their climate change credentials before the public. Defence systems Some 200 companies from 17 countries are exhibiting at the Gallery of Solutions. Thales, a French company which specialises in defence systems but also in software for civil aircraft, trains and satellites, is at COP21 to explain its research to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by aircraft. Jui Wen Chen, an inventor from Taiwan, shows his system for filtering carbon dioxide and other pollutants from air and rain water. The system is used in hundreds of towns in Taiwan and the People's Republic. Environmental groups argue that such innovations are false solutions intended to distract attention from the big polluters. The question is put to Olivier Lavastre, a French scientist who is working with the Taiwanese company JW Pavement Eco Technology. The battle on climate change must be an accumulation of small steps, he replies. "Little streams come together to make a big river." \</doc>

At this time of year churches begin to be busy preparing for Christmas. Preparations are going forward for carol services, and for those Sundays of Advent that lead us to the festival of Christmas Day itself. It is also a time when churches plan to bring gifts to people in need, locally and in other countries. This column has space to mention only a few of these activities, but they are representative of many. Monday sees the 1,400th anniversary of the death of St Columbanus, the Irish saint who exercised ministries in Burgundy, Gall and Bobbio. It is being celebrated in Bangor, Co Down. Celebrations began yesterday in Bangor Abbey. There will be talks and storytelling sessions this morning in St Columbanus's Church at Ballyholme and this afternoon in St Comgall's Church, Bangor. This evening 'Songs of the Scribe' will be the theme in First Bangor Presbyterian Church. The concluding events will be in Bangor Abbey tomorrow at 3.30 and 6.30pm. Tomorrow afternoon in Rathgar Methodist Church on Brighton Road, William Dowdall (flute) and John Feeley (guitar) will perform music by Schubert, Ravi Shankar and de Bromhead. It will begin at 3pm. Tickets are EUR 15 and concessions EUR 10. Christmas appeal The Newtownabbey Methodist Mission is looking forward to a busy Christmas. To raise funds for its Christmas appeal it is holding an evening of contemporary Christian music, testimony and praise in the Mission premises at Rathcoole Drive. Praise will be led by the One Accord Choir. Under the title Celebrating Christmas Together, the event will begin at 7.30pm on Saturday, November 28th. Admission is free but there will be a retiring collection. The Leprosy Mission is raising funds to replace the outpatients department at Karigiri Hospital in India. This treats about 120,000 patients each year. One of its fundraising events will take place at Newtownmountkennedy in the Parkview Hotel on Thursday, December 3rd. It will take the form of a cabaret dinner at which Bob Drury will trace the career of Neil Diamond and perform some of the songs he composed. Tickets are EUR 40 from leprosy.ie. Christian Aid Ireland are planning three climate marches to draw attention to the need for action now to bring about climate justice, community energy and a carbon free future. All three marches will start at 2pm on Sunday, November 29th - the day before the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. In Dublin, supporters are asked to assemble outside the Custom House; in Cork the venue is the library on Grand Parade; and in Belfast the park opposite St Anne's Cathedral. Our church in Armagh has recently started a series of monthly soup lunches in its hall. They will happen on the first Wednesday of each month throughout the year. The light lunch suggests a measure of sympathy with those who have even less to eat every day in other countries, and proceeds will go to Christian Aid for the relief of hunger. \</doc>

As the dusk descends on Dublin this afternoon I will board a bus with 33 environmental activists for a 28-hour voyage to Paris, via Rosslare.The trip, which was planned months ago by Stop Climate Chaos - a coalition of 28 Irish NGOs and campaign groups - is going ahead despite the state of emergency law introduced by French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande following the Paris terror attacks. Why go ahead? There are many answers to that, but one is the army of lobbyists from fossil fuel and other "dirty" industries already at COP21 . (Imagine tobacco lobbyists at a health policy summit.) This is literally a corporate- sponsored summit - big business has stumped up a fifth of the EUR 170 million cost of staging COP21 . France's state of emergency will not impede the efforts of these forces to capture government and stop a meaningful deal being reached (as documented by Corporate Europe Observatory) and so it should not deter us from making the trip. Another reason to go is to connect with global activists and to show solidarity with those from the global south who are suffering most from the effects of climate change.

A chara, - While your coverage of the COP21 climate change agreement in Paris rightly focused on the diplomacy, sustainable development pathway and agreed goals, little attention has been placed on the potential opportunities that arise for Irish industry, both multinationals and small and medium enterprises. While business has been engaged for many years in the climate change negotiations, it has largely been ignored. While hoping for an ambitious agreement, private-sector expectations were low given the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's pedigree of past underperformance, notably in meeting expectations (for example, the Kyoto protocol, the Buenos Aires plan of action, the Marrakesh and Copenhagen accords, the Bali road map, the Canc\'fan agreements, the Durban platform and the Doha Climate gateway). Boardrooms are now assessing the impact of the Paris agreement in terms of what it will mean for their bottom line. COP21 embraced business. It acknowledged that the pledges of $100 billion per year, through the Green Climate Fund, will predominantly be provided for technology demonstration and capacity building within developing countries. The binding component of the agreement committed to a funding of environmentally sound technologies and emphasised the role of innovation in terms of a co-operative approach to research and development (R&D) and access to clean technologies. This copper-fastens the role of the private sector in terms of countries pursuing policies and plans (intended national determined contributions or INDCs) for each country in terms of creating "bankable" projects that investors feel comfortable supporting. The COP21 The past five years have witnessed a fall in prices for renewable energy technologies, meaning policymakers are now considering options to decarbonise their systems. International financial institutions are divesting from fossil to clean energy. Even before Paris, we witnessed significant investment in technology transfer, with $62 billion moving from north to south in global terms. Now almost 190 countries have submitted plans (with nearly 11,000 commitments) outlining future action. Opportunities resulting from carbon pricing will be significant as over 90 of these countries have included carbon pricing schemes in their pursuit of country plans post- COP21 . COP21 agreement has surpassed expectations within government and business, identifying significant investment opportunities for the private sector. It has sent a clear signal to markets and investors that the future growth is one based on a decarbonisation of energy. The coming months will see a comprehensive debate surrounding interpretation of the agreement and countries will make additional commitments as they pledge and review in 2018. The agreement has been broadly welcomed by business, and Irish companies are well placed to engage in new opportunities that result from new market mechanisms, from managing resources sustainably and a greater deployment of sustainable energy technologies and services. These companies can be the change agents in this new climate economy, providing action, innovation and investment in solutions. - Yours, etc, Dr MATTHEW KENNEDY, International Energy Research Centre, Tyndall Institute, Cork. \</doc>

WEXFORD Library played host recently to a very informative and educational talk on the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris. Former EPA Director Padraic Larkin and George Hussey, a climate specialist at the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government put COP21 under the microscope. The conference was seen as crucial because of the absolute necessity of securing a binding new international agreement on climate change, applicable to all, to keep global warming below 2\'b0C. Padraic opened the talk with a retrospective look at the whole issue of climate change. The first real acceptance of the presence of global warming as a consequence of human activities was seen early in the last century. Scientists were aware in the early 1900s that increased levels of CO2, Methane and Nitrous Oxide in the atmosphere might lead to global warming through the process of 'heat trapping'. Fast-forward to the 1970s and we have experts acknowledging that there will be further global warming - a rise of 4 degree Celcius on pre-industrial levels is seen as being the worst case scenario. One consequence of global warming is melting of the polar caps contributing to drastic increases in sea levels, anything up to five metres. George Hussey took a different tack to Padraic in looking at the business of formulating and implementing agreements on climate change. George, a statistician in the Climate Policy Section of Department of Environment, and a member of the Irish delegation to COP21 , is a battle-scarred veteran when it comes to such events. He spoke of the protocol, the pecking order, the pleadings, the compromises, the frustrations and the late nights. And of how next morning you got up and did it all again! \</doc>

On one side would be the three out of four farmers in the survey who disagreed when asked if Irish farmers should cut back production in order to reduce global warming. On the other side would be the more extreme environmentalists who want the world to eat less meat. The environmentalists may ignore the fact that ruminants are the only animals that can give us food from grasslands which cover about one third of the world s surface. But farmers who don t want to cut production are out of line with fellow taxpayers who will pick up the bill when the Irish Exchequer has to purchase carbon credits to keep up with EU obligations. Nor does Irish farmers refusing to cut back production to reduce global warming does not go down well when G7 leaders have agreed to abandon fossil fuels by the end of the century; and more than 5,000 mayors across Europe have all pledged to meet the EU s carbon reduction objective. Producing food to the highest environmental standards to feed a growing world population, while limiting the impact of global warming and climate change, is the farmer s task. Irish farmers, in their defence, can point to the carbon footprint of Irish-produced food being among the lowest in Europe or the world. But at the very least, farmers who don t want to cut production have to relentlessly focus on farm efficiency and on low-carbon animal production systems, said Teagasc scientist Prof Rogier Schulte at the recent Agricultural Science Association conference. That means improving animal health, better nutrient management, better grassland management and improving breeding and genetics. Prof Schulte, who chairs the FAO steering committee on benchmarking the environmental performance of livestock systems, and leads the Teagasc working group on greenhouse gas emissions, held out hopes of a big break for Irish farmers, in the form of recognition of the carbon sequestration value of forestry to offset emissions. In the 2015 Irish Examiner ICMSA farming survey, the most support for cutting farm output to reduce global warming came from farmers aged over 65. Tne message for younger, more ambitious farmers is that the climate change challenge has utterly changed the context for agricultural expansion, said Trinity College economist Prof Alan Matthews, a member of the National Climate Change Advisory Council, addressing the ASA conference. He has advised farmers to look out for developements such as a carbon levy on their emissions, if they are unwilling to cut back production in order to reduce global warming. The proceeds of such a levy would be recycled back to the farming sector, and it would be a powerful demonstration of commitment to environmentally sustainable production. If introduced across the EU, it would increase the competitive advantage for Irish producers. Or there may be targeted subsidies to encourage farmers to build up carbon stores in soils and biomass, to offset their emissions. The picture will become clearer after the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which starts on November 30, to to agree on action to keep the global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. The EU will pledge a binding, economy-wide emissions reduction target of at least 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

Solar farms might become part of the landscape in the southern half of the country in the next decades as part of a policy to cut down reliance on fossil fuels. Once associated with warmer countries closer to the equator, solar power farms have been approved in more than 300 locations in Britain in recent years, mainly in Cornwall and Devon, following improvements in the technology. On the eve of the publication of the Government's White Paper on energy, which will set out the energy policy roadmap for the next decade, it is understood solar farms will form part of the complex range of renewable energy solutions designed to replace the State's high dependence on fossil fuels. Most of the farms are expected to be located in the southern half of the country. None is expected to be larger than 10 hectares but if a sufficient number are approved solar can provide a complementary sources to wind energy. During his visit to the COP21 summit in Paris last week, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Alex White said the White Paper, to be published tomorrow, would set out how Ireland would achieve a low- carbon energy system. Separately, the Government is now expected to delay until the new year a key decision to increase its funding for climate change in poor and developing countries. Since the global summit in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries including Ireland have agreed to pledge $100 billion in collective funding each year to the Green Climate Fund. After being criticised for not contributing anything to the fund until 2015, the Government announced in the budget last October it would contribute EUR 2 million for 2016. No commitment However, as yet, it has made no specific commitment for the years beyond 2016. Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly have said the sum would be significantly increased but have not said by how much. It was expected the Taoiseach would announce the funding for 2017 and beyond when he addressed the COP 21 \</doc>

Chairperson of Friends of the Earth Ireland, Dr Cara Augustenborg, is a climate change lecturer in UCD. She was part of the Irish NGO delegation at COP21 . COP21 , she expressed concern about Ireland s approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement. In Ireland, reducing our emissions from transport, electricity, and buildings are the quickest ways to improve so we should be addressing those immediately, but the Government s commentary has been dominated by COP21 s implications for agriculture, she said. [Agriculture Minister] Simon Coveney said no rethink of the State food plan is required . However the Paris agreement and the Low Carbon Development Act require a rethink of everything, especially Coveney s ambition to add 300,000 more methane-producing cows to our national herd. Dr Augustenborg adds: The Paris agreement refers to food production in Article 2. Our leaders have latched onto these words as a justification to increase beef and dairy production in keeping with their Food Wise 2025 ambitions. However, they re ignoring all the words that go before food production in the agreement. "It says we must increase our ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that does not threaten food production. "Article 2 is about resilience to climate change in our food system, not increasing food production to suit national economic interests. COP21 also refers to a need to address food security. But food security involves providing adequate supply and access to nutritious food. In Ireland, we produce beef, which the World Health Organisation has reported we need to reduce our intake of for health reasons, she said. We also produce dairy, which is increasingly being turned into infant formula for the Chinese market. Minister Coveney has said Irish food exports are about developing premium products for premium markets . Dr Augustenborg also said recent flooding of farmland has shown the importance of climate resilience. Farmers need greater diversification to protect them from climate shocks and from the economic volatility of the dairy sector and low profit margins of the beef sector. There is great potential in forestry and agroforestry and renewable energy production. Any plans we ve made in Food Wise 2025 are outdated and must be reviewed in light of the new direction the world is moving, she said. \</doc>

Toaiseach Enda Kenny has reiterated his government's commitment to reducinggreenhouse gas emissions - in tandem with Ireland's EU partnersby - by at least 40 per cent by 2030. He claimed that meeting international targets would be particularly difficult for Ireland because of the 'lost decade' of the recession. Speaking at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last night he said it was the country's objective to substantially cut CO2 emissions by the middle of this century, "while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production. "One really significant area for Ireland is our valuable and already efficient agriculture sector," he said. 'Through a series of programmes, like carbon foot-printing 43,500 beef farms and 18,000 dairy farms, we are driving economic and environmental efficiency in agriculture and achieving results that we believe are both transferable and scalable." He said that Ireland recognises how vulnerable communities need considerable assistance in adapting to climate change. "Despite recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland provided public climate finance of E34 million in 2014, including support for the Least Developed Countries Fund. "These funds support adaptation in agriculture, food and energy systems, and help to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa."

The EU, once the leader in UN climate negotiations, has been "sidelined" at COP21 in Paris by major players such as the US, China and India, Oxfam International has claimed. "EU member nations often express positions in line with those of vulnerable countries, but solidarity is more than just words. It needs to be measured by whether the EU stands for a strong deal here in Paris," Ms Craeynest said. However Luxembourg climate attach\'e9 Sarah Blau, representing the European Council, denied the claim, saying the EU was "definitely participating" in the negotiations and playing its "traditional bridge-building role". Elina Bardram, speaking for the European Commission, said there was "no room for complacency". The hard work of negotiating had just started, and the EU was pressing for a shorter and sharper text before ministers arrived next week. Right deal Ms Bardram said the EU was "actively exploring a middle ground" between the competing demands of different blocs at COP21 and wanted to ensure "we get the right deal to put the world on a path to avoid dangerous climate change". Speaking at a press conference earlier hosted by the Climate Action Network, Ms Craeynest said the French presidency of COP21 was playing a key role at the conference, but "shouldn't let its eye off the ball" regarding the EU's role. Otherwise, she warned that there was a danger of the EU becoming an "absent player" in the negotiations and "could end up as a deal-taker, rather than a deal-maker" - with the risk that the deal itself would be a weak one. On climate aid for developing countries, she said the EU "can make a difference by supporting strong anchors for finance in the agreement, particularly for adaptation", as well as moving next week to adopt a tax on financial transactions. US climate envoy Todd Stern said COP21 was "getting down to business" after being given "a great deal of positive momentum" by US president Barack Obama and other world leaders. "We are off to a good start, even though we have issues that are still challenging," he said. Mr Stern said the US was seeking a "durable, lasting agreement" and that the pledges made so far by 180-plus countries - "an almost unbelievable number" - should be reviewed every five years or so to ensure that the world "remains on track". The negotiations had now entered their "sausage-making phase", in the words of veteran observer Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists after the momentum created by Monday's series of speeches by world leaders. Vulnerable countries "Progress is mixed, and it's clear that several key issues will be left to ministers to resolve next week," Mr Meyer said. "Finance issues continue to be the most difficult, with little movement forward as negotiators continue to hold their chips close to their chest." He said the "atmospherics" in relation to a loss-and-damage mechanism for vulnerable developing countries "seem to have improved on the heels of a productive meeting between Mr Obama and leaders of small island states". \</doc>

As the dust settles on COP21 , the global charter to tackle climate change, serious thought is being focused on what the Paris agreement will mean for the food industry.\~ In all, 196 countries pledged to keep a global temperature rise, this century, under 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels the threshold scientists predict will result in irreversible warming and planetary change; and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C. Many food companies made voluntary commitments to cut carbon footprints, and commitments to sustainable resource management, and to finance climate action. These companies included Cargill, Carrefour, Coca-Cola, Danone, Delhaize, Diageo, General Mills, Grupo Bimbo, Hershey s, Kellogg s, Mars, McDonald s, Mondelez, Monsanto, Nestl\'e9, PepsiCo, Sodexo, Starbucks, Tesco, Tyson Foods and Walmart. In 2013, Bord Bia launched Origin Green, a sustainability pledge that mirrors the goals of COP21 .\~ Irish farmers are buying into its goals, participating in Bord Bia s quality assurance programmes for beef and dairy, measuring all of the eco impacts linked to their part in the food production chain. Interestingly, the ICSA is calling for enhanced supports for biofuel crops and forestry; such grants would encourage Irish farmers to reduce by 5% the numbers of livestock on Irish farmland. This is interesting on several fronts.\~ It shows Irish farmers want to cut carbon emissions, want to share the costs of eco-action, and, at the same time, want to increase awareness of how these eco-actions will impact on the livelihoods of food producers. And those companies are echoing the global desire of consumers to minimise the environmental impacts of their consumption choices.\~ Viewed in this context, the ICSA in calling for better supports for low-profit biofuel crops, like miscanthus is batting the ball back to the rest of society. If all of these eco-exercises are to be more than posturing, then all sides must share the cost. Nobody expects big food firms to keep rolling out higher-cost, organic, low-emissions products, if the consumer keeps choosing the cheaper, longer-life, additive-laden, eco-unfriendly option every time.\~ And nobody expects the farmer to pick up all of the costs relating to heightened social awareness. The 196 signatories to COP21 have made pledges, and set targets to be reviewed every five years. Developed countries have vowed to give at least US$100bn per year, from public and private sources, to help developing countries mitigate, and adapt to, climate change by 2020. The food industry is responsible for a third of global GHG emissions between agriculture, food production and food waste.\~ But is there a risk that food companies will seek to kick the can, and the blame, onto the producer? Already, some food groups have said their suppliers are responsible for two-thirds of their total-product carbon footprint.\~ Their vow, to focus on supplier sustainability and sustainable sourcing , may not bring any comfort to farmers. But at least farmers are not taking all the blame. A post- COP21 And they are not kicking the can into the developing countries where most palm oil is produced. This is where the $100bn annual fund comes in. It is to be spent helping developing countries mitigate, and adapt to, climate change. This will help companies to address climate-change risk in their agricultural supply chains and drive down their global carbon footprint, states Paula Savanti.\~ But it is clear extra financing will be required in moving towards the sustainable sourcing of commodities, much of which is in developing countries. Savanti also expects food manufacturers and retailers to cut back on the 1.3bn tonnes of food which is lost, and wasted, annually, between farm and fork, producing the equivalent of 3.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide each year. The carbon cost of food waste will become increasingly intolerable; the public and governments will look to food companies for solutions, she says.\~ Many companies submitting voluntary commitments include objectives on food waste and increasing the number of plants that send zero waste to landfills. While the ICSA s biofuel crops vs livestock suggestion is just one brushstroke in the evolving post- COP21 big picture, it will be interesting to see if any authority from here to Brussels picks up the challenge to share the real-world costs that come with pledging to reduce carbon emissions. \</doc>

HARRY McGEE Ireland faces fresh pressure from EU member states and the European Commission over its high level of agricultural emissions, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said ahead of the climate talks opening in Paris today. The Taoiseach said while Ireland secured a unanimous commitment by the European Council last year that its dependence on agriculture would be acknowledged in the calculation of EU emission targets, this was now being interpreted differently by the commission. Speaking in Brussels on the eve of the COP21 summit, he said he had communicated to French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande that Ireland would sign up to "measurable and achievable targets". But he said there was "quite a deal of technical challenge ahead" for Irish officials in Paris to ensure the outcome was "fair and balanced and sustainable in Ireland's case". Special treatment It is understood a number of member states, including east European countries such as Hungary, raised concerns in recent months about special treatment for Ireland. The commission also raised questions about the interpretation of the deal, according to officials. France deployed 120,000 security force personnel nationwide for the duration of COP21 . Nearly 3,000 police are stationed at the summit site at Le Bourget. The French government had hoped to avoid violent demonstrations by invoking the state of emergency declared in the wake of the November 13th attacks. But dozens of men wearing dark clothing and hoods threw stones, bottles, flower pots and candles that had been left at a memorial for the November 13th victims at riot police, who used tear gas and charged the demonstrators. More than 170 people were detained overnight. An unprecedented urgency surrounds the 12-day conference, because if action is not taken, it will become impossible to limit the rise in global temperatures to two degrees compared to the pre-industrial era. "This COP21 will not be a real success unless the 195 countries gathered in Paris reach a universal and legally binding accord on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions," said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister and president of the conference. "That is the most complicated part." The word "binding" has created friction with the US and other parties to the conference. President Barack Obama would face stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress to a compulsory treaty requiring ratification. "The fact the accord must be 'legally binding' is not contested," Mr Fabius said, "even if there can be different degrees of obligation." Committed The Taoiseach is one of more than 150 heads of state and government attending the opening of opening of COP21 . In his speech, Mr Kenny will confirm Ireland is fully committed to the EU target of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. However he will insist the accord not "compromise our capacity for food production". Agriculture accounts for 30 per cent of Irish emissions. In what was hailed as a significant breakthrough for the Government, Ireland secured commitment at the EU summit of October 2014 that the "multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector, with their lower mitigation potential", should be acknowledged in EU targets on climate change. Ireland argued that the country's forests, boglands and other habitats that absorb carbon should be accounted for in the calculation of emissions to compensate for the high level of agricultural emissions. \</doc>

WITH the departure of world leaders, the real business of the climate summit begins - negotiating a global deal to reduce emissions. But there's a concern among observers that the fine words spoken by heads of state on Monday's plenary may not translate into concrete action to limit warming. Taoiseach Enda Kenny's speech is a case in point. He told COP21 that Ireland was committed and called for the conference to "send the signal the world is waiting for". But just hours earlier he told reporters that while the Government would step up to the plate, it would not be to the detriment of our growing agriculture sector. He added, in effect, that the economic collapse caused by the previous administration meant we were too poor to commit to meaningful action. As Oisin Coghlan, director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, noted, it was a classic example of doublespeak. "It was a case of one story for Paris, and one story for Paddy. If other leaders are saying one thing in the conference hall, their fine words won't translate into world action," he says. "I don't think anything make or break happened at a global level. The signs are it was the right decision to get the leaders to come at the beginning. "We can only hope their messages of concern and commitment will translate into their negotiators doing a deal." COP21 is among the biggest-ever gathering of world leaders, and their visit to Paris is a positive step. But the heavy lifting has only started. Key issues include financing adaptation measures in poorer countries, and how much each country will contribute. There's the question of mechanisms to verify emission reductions - will the US, Russia and China allow for independent checks? - and, crucially, the question of climate justice. Eamonn Meehan, executive director of Trocaire, says the last point is among the most important. "One of the worrying things is there seems to be a dumbing down around human rights and food security. "There needs to be a clear and strong statement on human rights. It's not about greening the economies of wealthy countries, it's about ensuring people have a right to food, a home and their environment. "But there's quite a bit of opposition to human rights being included ... and that would be a worry." Whatever about Ireland producing food more sustainably than other countries, our beef and dairy won't feed the world's poorest. Around 80pc of global food is currently produced by small-scale farmers, and it's that sector which needs help to solve the global food crisis. "It's one thing for rhetoric about the poor needing a future, but that requires action," he says. "There's also been a lot said about food production, but what is much more important is the concept of food security. "Climate legislation hasn't even completed its journey through the Oireachtas, and we're being prepared by the Taoiseach to be treated as an exception. If you listen to the Taoiseach, we don't want to be leaders on climate change. We're probably going to be dragged (into this) kicking and screaming." The stance taken by developing nation India, one of world's highest emitters, will be crucial to the success of COP21 . Unlike China and the US, there has been no pre-arranged deal to reduce carbon. Oisin Coghlan makes the point that India is insisting richer countries, which have caused most pollution, should move first. French sources said it remained committed to striking a legally-binding agreement, but it could prove problematic. "We won't compromise ambition, but a legal form of deal may be difficult," one said. "But the President of COP21 (and French Foreign Affairs Minister), Laurent Fabius, has taken the subject as 'his' - and he's a heavyweight. "He's a former Prime Minister and won't have second thoughts to call on leaders if needed. "Whatever will be needed, he will do it." \</doc>

Every day this week, as commuters poured into central Paris, I joined the thousands trekking out to the Le Bourget banlieue for COP21 , the UN climate change conference. The train emerges above ground after the Gare du Nord. Satellite dishes sprout like mushrooms from high-rise housing projects. Walls are covered with graffiti. The path to Le Bourget is littered with burned-out cars and uncollected rubbish. I briefly wondered why the French government had not embarked on a massive beautification campaign, like those Third World dictatorships who prettify slums along the airport road in preparation for visits by foreign dignitaries. The Le Bourget exhibition park, the site of the Paris air show every second year and home to the national aviation and space museum, is two stops after the Stade de France, where three suicide bombers blew themselves up on November 13th. It is also just a few kilometres from Saint-Denis, where three people, including the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks, were killed when security forces stormed a jihadist hideout on November 18th. The shuttle bus that takes you from the RER train station to the conference passes Turkish and Pakistani restaurants, women in long robes and headscarves and the occasional man wearing Salafist attire. Local residents are mostly African, Arab and Asian, like many of the passengers on the shuttle buses. Except that the locals are poor immigrants, while passengers in the brand new hybrid buses are members of the global elite, a caste of well-travelled diplomats, journalists, academics and UN officials. Globalisation I mention to Pierre-Henri Guignard, secretary general of COP21 and the French diplomat entrusted with the task of organising the conference, that I covered the 1982 G7 summit at the Palace of Versailles. The country has changed a lot since then. Globalisation may have raised standards of living elsewhere, but for France it has meant a serious downgrade. Guignard was assigned to organise COP21 on returning from Washington in mid-2013. The Le Bourget site had already been chosen; the UN said it was the only place big enough for the conference. "I'd spent much of my career abroad, and Le Bourget was a France I didn't know," Guignard says. "But this is the reality. What do you expect us to do? Versailles again? This is where we need to do things. It's good to show France as she is. Remember, when we won the World Cup in 1998, everyone talked about ' La France black blanc beur ' [black, white and Arab]. We're in that frame of mind. There's a large foreign population here. There's no reason to hide it." Best possible image A phalanx of mostly African and Arab youths greet you off the RER train with a cheery "hello" in several languages. Gendarmes with assault rifles stand behind them. The youths are among the 600 underprivileged teenagers recruited by Guignard to help with COP21 . Their training included English lessons from the British Council, and they will receive job placement after the conference. "At COP20 in Lima, everyone smiled all the time," Guignard says. "It had me worried, because I thought, 'We're going to do this in Paris, France, where people have a reputation for being unpleasant?' In training, we insisted that they convey the best possible image." A forest of white columns with the name and flag of all 195 UN members stands outside the entry to COP21 There was something touching about the pride of Palestinians taking pictures of each other. Only two months have passed since the Palestinian flag was allowed to be flown at the UN. One enters the conference through an enormous hangar resembling an airport terminal. There are queues in front of dozens of metal detectors. The procedure is the same as for boarding a plane. The UN dispatched 106 "blue guards" from cities as far away as Bangkok, Nairobi and New York. They supervise local security subcontractors and scan the barcode on your COP21 badge, which is also scanned on departure. France has temporarily relinquished sovereignty over the "blue zone", signifying UN control. French security forces are poised outside the centre to intervene, should the UN request it. The main street of the blue zone is called the Champs-\'c9lys\'e9es. It looks like an industrial zone with factories lined up on either side. Larger than life, brightly coloured animals in translucent plastic provide a touch of colour. Framed squares of ivy, moss and other plants hang vertically on the sides of six giant warehouse-like halls. At the end of this Champs-\'c9lys\'e9es, there is a red Eiffel Tower, made from folding chairs. It twinkles in the evening, just like the real one, and is a rendezvous point for the conference. It took 60 construction firms 45 days to build the conference centre, a small town populated daily by 45,000 people. The toilets are the cleanest I have seen in France. Conference president and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius took an interest in every detail, Guignard says. "He said, 'One judges a man by his shoes and a house by its toilets'." Annexes are meant to associate civil society and the business community with COP21 . People are searched between each venue. A European space shuttle and ageing French fighter aircraft are parked behind the exhibition halls like discarded toys. There is an unspoken dress code at COP21 : neo-hippie for the NGOs, tailored for national delegations. Indigenous North Americans, Amazonian Indians and Buddhist monks stand out, with feathered head-dresses, shaved heads and robes. Some 4,000 journalists populate the media centre in Hall 5, where the workspace reflects our position on the food chain. Television networks enjoy closed offices. Radio journalists work two to a cubicle. Print journalists are lined up at assembly line tables. You receive more than 100 emails daily, but nothing on paper. "Your problem is there is so much going on. How do you even begin to report?" UN climate chief Christiana Figueres told a press conference. Except that most of the "theme days" and worthy briefings - on agriculture, forests, women and climate change, the power of youth, carbon-pricing, etc - have little or nothing to do with the text of the agreement. Climate neutral Meanwhile, 1,500 negotiators haggle in groups and spin-off groups behind the closed doors of 35 conference rooms. They have chewed over the same arguments for years: should the accord limit the rise in temperature to 1.5 or 2 degrees? Who will pay the $100 billion (EUR 95 billion) promised to developing countries? The words "renewable energy" were kept out of the draft agreement at the demand of the Saudis. Even the substitute "decarbonisation" was deemed too strong and replaced this week with "climate neutral". Tension runs so high that one of the diplomats known as a "facilitator" encouraged negotiators to insert smiley symbols in their texts. The atmosphere is serious, but lacks intensity. Thousands of people seem to roam aimlessly, as if at a fair, among colourful national pavilions. 'We're watching you' At lunch-time the other day, a dozen youths wearing Guant\'e1namo orange jumpers emblazoned with the words "X Divest" and "#Keep it in the ground" stood in front of the red Eiffel Tower shouting: "Real leaders divest from fossil fuels." Several had drawn circles around one eye, signifying "Zero carbon" and "We're watching you". They were trying to put pressure on negotiators, a Canadian student told me. Katie Dagg (23), a student of international relations from Dublin, was hired to distribute "welcome kits" comprised of a recycled bag that says, "This was a sweater", a reusable water canteen and a biro. Like her, I was disappointed it contained no food. Dagg spends her breaks talking to academics, people from NGOs and delegates. "I have the impression there are a lot of ethical people here. They want to do good," Dagg says. "The conference is raising awareness of climate change, but I'm afraid in the end we're just going to put it off again." I ask Dagg if it is disheartening to be young in a world blighted by jihadist massacres and climate change. "Not at all," she replies. "I want to change the world." \</doc>

THE COP21 Global Climate Conference has finally ended after two weeks fraught in controversy, pessimism, optimism and infinite solutions at unsustainable cost. The world's climate experts have united to try solving the impossible - Planet Earth will continue to revolve, dissolve, evolve and replenish as it has been doing for millions of years. For the "seconds of eternal time" that human forms as now exist on this planet have still left, they should be enjoying the benefits rather than tampering with its maintenance. Our consuming interest should be in getting rid of all toxins and CO2 gases to make the planet a more hygienic and better place to live on. To me, the most valuable outcome of COP21 is the evidence of global unionism on strategies and proposals for funding. It is for those reasons I suggest that of all the energy sources solar is the most sustainable, inexhaustible and consistent in existence. Mother Earth assures us the Sun will bombard us with 9,000 times more power than is needed to run every car, heat every home and energise every electrical gadget and factory on this planet. All Europe's requirement could be provided by lining 0.2% of the Sahara desert with concentrated solar power technology. A European Union solar energy company could administer, develop and operate an inter-Euro grid, supplying power to all members at fixed price. JAMES GLEESON By email \</doc>

The food industry is our biggest employer in Europe and is essential to maintaining strong domestic food production, he said. COP21 , due to take place in Paris in December. The deal we reach must recognise the relative limited potential to reduce greenhouse gases in agriculture but acknowledge its critical role in food security, said Mr Kelly. We must ensure coherence between the EU s food security and climate change objectives. Our milk and meat production has progressively become less emission-intensive in the EU and this trend of course should be strengthened. However, we have a level of efficiency that is higher than several of our competitors. For this reason, we must be cautious, as putting in place overly severe mitigation actions that would displace EU production would clearly be counterproductive. The COP21 Mr Kelly was appointed in April to the role of leading the European Parliament s committee on Industry, Research, and Energy in the discussions and will play a key role in the coming months. \</doc>

One hundred community energy co-operatives have signed a proclamation calling on the Government to incentivise locally based projects that improve energy efficiency and replace fossil fuels with locally generated renewable power. The Community Energy Proclamation is to be launched today, as Minister for Energy Alex White meets energy ministers from around the world at COP21 in Paris to discuss reducing greenhouse gases. The proclamation calls for an Irish "transition to a clean, secure energy future" in line with what its backers see as the aims of the COP21 . Environmental campaigner Duncan Stewart said fears that small, locally produced power could destabilise the grid were no longer valid. He said new smart micro-energy grid technology could be one of the most significant developments in the move to a low carbon economy. The proclamation calls for realistic financial supports for solar energy and a "fair price" for excess energy which would be "exported" from community schemes to the national grid. They also want a "renewable heat" incentive which includes communities generating their own district heating. The 100 organisations signed up to the proclamation say the money saved could be retained in the community and used to finance jobs in renewable energy projects. \</doc>

The world's biggest banks are ill-prepared for the effects of climate change and lenders are making insufficient effort to fund a transition to a low-carboneconomy, an industry report said on Thursday. Of the world's 10 largest banks, only Bank of China and Citigroup were among the top 10 ranked for climate management in a report by investment manager Boston Common Asset Management. A major criticism of the banks surveyed was that many fail to assess adequately the climate change risk to their portfolios and no bank currently measures its carbon footprint. "Banks are tied to every market sector through their lending practices, making them uniquely vulnerable to climate-related risk," Boston Common said. "We believe banks are not adequately measuring, managing and disclosing these risks." Governments around the world are preparing for the United Nations COP21 climate change summit in December, which aims to agree a deal to curb global greenhouse gas emissions. A global transition to a low-carbon economy will cost around dollar 4.8 trillion, according to estimates given by 55 countries to the U.N. ahead of COP21 . Banks have a critical role to play in funding this transition, but most lenders assessed do not have quantitative targets for increased financing of energy efficiency or renewable energy projects, the report said.

A joint statement on climate change signed by France's president, Fran\'e7ois Hollande, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, this week has been hailed as a major step towards agreement at the November 30th-December 11th COP21 climate conference in Paris. China is watched closely by developing countries which are eager to replicate its rapid economic growth, while avoiding environmental damage. The November 2nd statement "could inspire compromise", says a source close to France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, who will preside over the conference. "China is a really important player in this game," says C\'e9line Ramstein, head of the COP21 project at SciencesPo. "To have them signing on is a powerful political symbol." The 21-article text painstakingly respects the delicate balance between the interests of developed and developing countries. The French are determined not to repeat the Danish mistake at the last climate change summit in 2009 of attempting to impose its own text at the conference. China has positioned itself as an arbiter between the G77 (in fact, 134 developing and emerging countries) and the developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In the past, Beijing refused to consider any deadlines before 2030, when it has promised its carbon emissions will peak. In a major breakthrough, Xi this week signed on to a review clause that would require all parties to increase their commitments every five years. The clause is one of the main ambitions of the French, because without it there is no hope of limiting the rise in world temperatures to two degrees by 2100. Opposition The review clause is opposed by India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but with the EU, US and China supporting it, they may be forced to concede. If an accord is announced on December 11th, it will not take effect until 2020. Paris also obtained Chinese acceptance of a "facilitating dialogue" to take stock of progress in 2017-18. China's endorsement of the call for a "legally binding" accord is also seen as significant progress. Article 5 begins to break down the rigid delineation between developed and developing countries, as defined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Until now, only developed countries had obligations, while developing countries were asked to act on a voluntary basis. The Franco-Chinese statement foresees that the latter will "progressively orient themselves towards quantifiable reductions or limitations in emissions". In other signs of compromise, China allowed an OECD report which was rejected by the G77 to be mentioned, and supported the position that funding for energy transition in the developed world must be private as well as public. The joint statement "didn't just happen", notes the source close to Fabius. The French foreign minister has visited China 12 times in 18 months. In the run-up to the Beijing signing, he received Chinese negotiators twice in person, then had two 45-minute sessions on the telephone with them, going through the text, word by word. "It was touch and go," says the foreign ministry source. The day after the joint statement, the New York Times revealed that China has for years underestimated the amount of coal it burns by up to 17 per cent. French officials see the news in the context of the Franco-Chinese call for "improved transparency". "The International Energy Agency said that in 2014, global emissions did not increase, for the first time," notes a French diplomat. "The main reason is because China is slowing its coal carbon emissions." Verification measures At the same time, Chinese statisticians are improving their methods. "What happened in China will strengthen the debate [at COP21 ] on verification measures," the diplomat predicted. "The Chinese want to be dealmakers at COP21 ," she continued. "They've been positioning themselves for the past year. "They were telling us for a long time that they wanted to make a really substantial joint declaration that would create a decisive impetus." Xin Wang, China researcher at SciencesPo's COP21 project, notes that China has adopted a much more assertive foreign policy under President Xi. However, severe air, ground and water pollution is the main motivation for the country's recent espousal of an "ecological civilisation", enshrined in the Communist Party's five-year plan. "Pollution has become a threat to social stability, which is the leading concern of the party," Wang says. China's economic slowdown is also a factor. "The transition to a low carbon, green economy is considered a sustainable driver for economic growth." The Chinese public are being reminded that nature was respected in ancient China. "It makes the idea more acceptable, because people say, 'This is something from our ancestors'," says Wang. Ramstein says the Chinese feel aggrieved to be constantly denounced as the world's leading carbon emitter when, on a per capita basis, they rank seventh. In a related debate, she asks: "Can we really blame China for the emissions they create producing goods we consume?" \</doc>

Paul O'Donoghue However, the share of revenue as a percentage of the total tax take dropped from an average of 6.9pc to 6.3pc across the 28 member states. IRELAND took in (EURO)4.4bn in environmental taxes in 2013, an increase of over (EURO)1bn compared to a decade earlier, new data reveals. The percentage share fell in a majority of EU states with the largest drops recorded in Cyprus (-3.8pc from 2003 to 2013), Portugal (-3pc) and Malta (-2.5pc). Environmental taxes are made up of taxes on energy, transport and pollutants. The data from statistics agency Eurostat showed that in the European Union, environmental taxes amounted to just over (EURO)330bn in 2013 compared to (EURO)272.1bn in 2003. Ireland was one of the few countries that increased its environmental levies as a percentage of the total tax take. The overall take increased likely decrease will be between 9pc and 14pc. In his speech to the the United Nations climate change conference in Paris last week, Taoiseach Enda Kenny criticised the EU's target of a 20pc cut in greenhouse gas emissions from their 2005 levels by 2020 as "unrealistic" and "unreachable". With the EU committed to a 40pc reduction in emissions by 2030, the Taoiseach said that Ireland would need "time and space" to meet these targets.

The overall take increased from (EURO)3.3bn, or 7.9pc of the country's total tax and social contributions in 2013, to (EURO)4.4bn, 8.5pc of the total tax take in 2013. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, which adopted a series of growth and development targets for the union in 2010, the objective for the EU is to reach a 10pc share by 2020. Other countries that increased their proportion of environmental taxes included Estonia (up 1.9pc to 8pc), Slovenia (up 1.8pc to 10.5pc) and Bulgaria (up 0.6pc to 10.1pc). Levies on energy costs accounted for 62pc of the environmental tax revenue in Ireland while charges on transport were responsible for 37pc. However, the revenue generated by taxes levied on pollution and resources were not significant, contributing just 1pc of the total revenue raised, well below the EU average of 3pc. The low contribution from taxes on pollution and resources comes despite the State taking in more than (EURO)1.6bn from the carbon tax on fossil fuels since its introduction in 2010. The tax was introduced to encourage people to use renewable or alternative sources of energy, such as heating their homes with wood pellet stoves or using public transport where available. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has previously admitted that Ireland is unlikely to meet its carbon emission reduction targets. Figures from Revenue Commissioners released earlier this year shows the tax bill from 'carbon tax', added to motor and heating fuel, cost consumers (EURO)385m in 2014 - up from (EURO)354m in 2012 and (EURO)223m in 2010. The rate of tax, which was increased in stages, is (EURO)20 per tonne of CO2 emitted by the fuel concerned. Under European Union commitments, Ireland is obliged to reduce its carbon emissions by 20pc from 2005 levels by the year 2020. However the EPA found the \</doc>

The plans were launched by Energy Minister Alex White as he failed to rule out challenging T\'e1naiste Joan Burton as leader, should the party lose power. Under its pre-election policy document which does not contain any reference to the recent COP21 world climate change commitments Labour intends to set up a 1bn green infrastructure fund, half of which will be paid for by selling 25% of the State s AIB shares. This money will be used to set up a subsidised cycle-to-school scheme, replace public transport buses with more environmentally friendly alternatives, and retrofit 225,000 homes. Mr White dismissed concerns that the COP21 agreement is not referenced on every page , saying that it is the driving force behind the document. The green economy policy document launch also saw the energy minister repeatedly questioned over his leadership ambitions. For more election news, analysis and general banter join us HERE Mr White said he and Ms Burton have a terrific relationship but did not rule out the possibility. After Environment Minister Alan Kelly said last weekend, you re your own boss really, Ms Burton responded by joking that Mr Kelly is an incredibly obedient employee . Asked if he should expect the same response, Mr White quoted Margaret Thatcher, saying Ms Burton is primus inter pares or first among equals. \</doc>

Clear choices now face ministers at COP21 on all of the key issues - including whether to set the long-term goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees, or a more ambitious 1.5 degrees - following the publication of a much sharper negotiating text by the French presidency of this crucial climate summit. The latest text is shorter, at 29 pages, and has 75 per cent fewer square brackets indicating areas of contention than the turgid 54-page document that delegates were presented with at the outset. That, in itself, is a real measure of the substantial progress made by delegates at Le Bourget. Released by the French presidency of COP21 , the current version shows that agreement has yet to be reached on whether to aim to limit the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees, "well below" 2 degrees or below 1.5 degrees - bearing in mind that it's already up by 1 degree above pre- industrial levels. Linked to this - indeed, inseparable from it - is how any of these "options" are to be achieved, in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, where there is also a range of options relating to the depth of such cuts and the timetable by which they might be achieved, either by 2050 or the end of the century. The very fact that a 1.5 degree target is still mentioned in the text is quite a coup for countries most vulnerable to climate change. "I feel very energised," said President Anote Tong of the Pacific atoll state of Kiribati. "There is now a very good chance of coming away [from Paris] with a positive agreement." Enele Sopoaga, prime minister of threatened Tuvalu, was also "very encouraged by the inroads we've managed to achieve in Paris", saying: "We are all singing one song, to really address climate change, and we need to sing that song louder because there is still a big push in front of us [to conclude an accord]." Loss and damage A mechanism to deal with "loss and damage" as a result of climate change also survives in the latest text, although the US delegation has made it clear that it will only go along with this if the most vulnerable countries are prepared to undertake not to sue the rich developed countries for compensation. US secretary of state John Kerry referred to the "tough conversations" that are going on behind closed doors at Le Bourget. But given that it was all "about the future of the home we share", he said the task was clear: to "get the job done." Kerry's announcement that the US would double its aid to developing countries to $800 million (EUR 730 million), to enable them to adapt to the impacts of climate change, has been greeted as a very positive move. However, even this is a small contribution towards ramping up climate finance to $100 billion (EUR 92 billion) annually in 2020. Climate Action Network Europe director Wendell Trio agreed that COP21 was now "at a crossroads" in terms of whether it would produce an ambitious deal or one that was "extremely minimalistic". For example, the latest text contains no mention of emissions from international aviation and shipping. Decarbonisation But at least the word "decarbonisation" survives, even though it remains in square brackets. This is anathema to oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and to others such as Australia with large reserves of coal; they would be the last to accept that such fossil fuel resources should be "left in the ground". The NGOs are all calling on the EU to "go out of its comfort zone" (as Trio put it) by embracing more ambition to cut emissions, show real solidarity with the more vulnerable countries and step up its own efforts over time. After all, Europe has already exceeded its own 2020 target to cut emissions by 20 per cent. Given that the climate pledges made by 180 countries (including the poorest of the poor) are not adequate to achieve a 2 degree target, never mind an even more ambitious 1.5 degrees, one of the key issues yet to be decided is how these commitments can be revised over time - starting even before 2020. The World Wildlife Fund has warned that if there isn't such an early revision of the pledges the world would be "locked into a trajectory of 3 degrees Celsius for at least 10 years". And this would undermine all the hopes invested in COP21 . \</doc>

President Barack Obama's prominent role during the first two days of the COP21 UN climate change conference will help to consolidate his legacy as a "green" president. "I actually think we're going to solve this thing. If you had said to people as recently as two years ago that we'd have 180 countries showing up in Paris with pretty ambitious targets for carbon reduction, most people would have said you're crazy, that's a pipe dream. And yet, here we are." It was all a question of US leadership. In Beijing in November 2014, largely because of the measures he had taken domestically, Mr Obama said he was able to persuade President Xi Jinping to make a joint declaration that the world's two biggest polluters would dramatically reduce carbon emissions. "And once we were able to get China involved, that gave confidence to other countries," Mr Obama continued, drawing a direct link between the US-Chinese initiative and the willingness of 184 countries to propose emissions reductions plans at COP21 . Alluding to his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, Mr Obama said: "I am an island boy. I understand both the beauty but also the fragility . . . These nations are not the most populous nations, they don't have big armies . . . but they have a right to dignity and sense of place . . . and their voice is vital in making sure that the climate agreement that emerges here in Paris in not just serving the interests of the most powerful." Clean power Since taking office in 2009, Mr Obama has trebled wind power in the US and multiplied solar power 20 times. He has doubled fuel efficiency standards for cars, and in August announced a clean power plan to reduce emissions from electricity generation by 32 per cent. On November 6th, he cancelled plans for the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Mr Obama's energy policies have been bitterly opposed by Republicans, who accuse him of using the Environmental Protection Agency to circumvent Republican-controlled Congress. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Post on the eve of COP21 , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell warned Mr Obama's international negotiating partners to beware "because commitments the president makes there would rest on a house of cards of his own making . . . His successor could do away with [an agreement] in a few months' time." Republicans are also trying to block the Obama administration's $3 billion contribution to the $100 billion fund to help developing countries adapt to climate change. Mr Obama was asked what will happen to the accord that is likely to be reached in Paris if a Republican wins next year's US election. The president joked that he anticipates a Democrat will succeed him, saying, "I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front". But "even if somebody from a different party succeeded me" they would realise that the rest of the world "is taking climate change really seriously" and understand how important the issue is to US influence throughout the world. Citing an opinion poll that showed two-thirds of Americans want the US to sign any agreement addressing climate change in a serious way, Mr Obama said "politics inside the United States is changing, as well." The impossibility of getting Congress to ratify a climate change treaty has created tension with the French hosts of COP21 . On November 12th, secretary of state John Kerry told the Financial Times the Paris accord "is definitively not going to be a treaty . . . They're not going to be legally binding reduction targets". The agreement "will be legally binding or there will not be an accord," President Fran\'e7ois Hollande snapped back. In Paris, Messrs Obama and Hollande seem to have found middle ground. Diplomats from both countries now say the accord could contain both legally binding and voluntary provisions. Surveillance of the decarbonisation process and periodic reviews would be legally binding, Mr Obama said yesterday. "There's a single transparency mechanism that all countries are adhering to, and . . . those are legally binding," he said. \</doc>

Governor Jerry Brown of California has been one of the most colourful figures in US politics for at least 40 years. He trained as a Jesuit priest, but became a lawyer instead. He dated the singer Linda Ronstadt and successfully sued Standard Oil, Gulf Oil and Mobil Oil. At a seminar on "subnational leadership" at the UN's COP21 climate summit yesterday, Brown (77) was cantankerous and outspoken, calling Republican climate sceptics "the mindless opposition", "knuckleheads" and "troglodytes". At COP21 , one often has the impression that local and regional leaders and civil society are streaks ahead of the negotiators. Two organisations co-ordinating a worldwide movement to withdraw investments from fossil fuels, 350.org and Divest-Invest, have received pledges from 500 institutions to disinvest, representing more than $3.4 trillion in assets. Some 1,000 mayors from cities around the world have embraced the long-term goal of using 100 per cent renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent over the next 35 years. Mass momentum So who needs the plodding negotiations? "They're doing all these things because of this process, because the 2015 deadline was set as the moment when we would come together and agree on a binding outcome," says Liz Gallagher of the London-based environmental think tank E3G. COP21 has created "mass momentum", she adds. "We need to sustain this momentum over the course and increase it." As members of the "Pacific Collaborative", California, Washington state and British Columbia did not wait for an international agreement. California was once the dirtiest state in the US. Thanks to former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger - and Brown, his successor - it is now one of the cleanest, with the most aggressive environmental policies in the country. Schwarzenegger established a cap and trade system, whereby polluters buy allowances. Brown has set up a carbon market with Quebec, and is negotiating similar deals with Chinese provinces. China has just adopted California car emission standards, the strictest in the US. Brown says small businesses "pooh-pooh climate change because they don't realise it's a huge threat to California and the world . . . they think it's a left-wing idea. They think requirements for zero-emission vehicles and renewables portfolios are government regulation, which is bad according to their ideology." Busting myths "On the Pacific coast we're rocking on the issue, joining up with other Pacific states and eventually the rest of the country," said Washington state governor Jay Inslee. "Those guys who argue that cleaning up the air is against job creation are wrong. My state creates more jobs than 47 others." Gregor Robertson, the mayor of the "green" city of Vancouver, said the Canadian city "busts the myth that the economy and the environment are at odds." Vancouver refused to accept a pipeline and oil terminals that would have brought petroleum from Alberta." Brown said: "We have regulation and we have tax [in California] but we are growing 25 per cent faster than the rest of the country. "Republicans say climate change is a job killer, but if world temperatures rise 3 degrees, it will cost trillions. Whatever we do to prevent a calamity is a cost-effective move." \</doc>

Preserving the Amazon and other tropical rain forests by halting their destruction must be a key element of any agreement at COP21 because of their vital role as "carbon sinks". Indeed, this could cut global carbon emissions by an estimated five billion tonnes every year, helping to avert dangerous climate change. According to Richard Houghton, senior researcher at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, this finding adds to a growing body of scientific work indicating that a greater focus on tropical forests could be one of the world's best chances of staying below the threshold of a 2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise. Lead author of a study published in the latest issue of Nature Climate Change , he said "feasible improvements in tropical forest management could bridge the gulf between today's rampant fossil fuel emissions and a sustainable future", noting "indigenous forest peoples have a crucial role to play". Tropical forests can absorb and store huge quantities of carbon to offset a large proportion of global greenhouse emissions if they are protected, Houghton said. "The research also identifies a key way to make it happen - supporting indigenous forest peoples in their guardianship of their ancestral forests." Suffocating smog For decades, tropical forests have been under attack around their edges by timber logging, palm oil producers, pulp paper manufacturers and agribusiness interests seeking to clear land for cattle. Fires in degraded forests of Indonesia regularly cause suffocating smog and threaten the habitat of orangutans. "Tropical deforestation releases more greenhouse gases each year than the entire EU and destroys the world's most efficient system for carbon capture and storage," according to Nancy Birdsall, president of the Washington-based Center for Global Development and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former prime minister of Peru. "We need to re-imagine tropical forests as a public utility like electricity, producing a service people and governments, including in the rich world, want to buy," they said in a report called Look to the Forests . "The problem for the world is that forest destruction, often illegal, generates huge profits in the short term." But the ambition of halting deforestation is realistic, according to another scientific paper published in this month's DEC journal. It notes that Brazil - the guardian of Amazonia - managed to cut its annual forest emissions by more than one billion tons of carbon between 2004 and 2009. "Brazil shows it can be done, and done quickly," said Alessandro Baccini, one of the study's co-authors. "It requires strong political will, however, and that's an ingredient that too often is missing, not only in tropical countries but also in developed countries, which need to help finance the effort." Norway has contributed $1 billion to Brazil's Amazon Fund in recognition of its achievement in reducing deforestation in the Amazon region by 70 per cent over the past decade - without sacrificing agricultural output or economic growth - and pledged at COP21 to extend this aid programme until 2020. But Doug Boucher, of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said an 18 per cent decrease in Amazon deforestation in 2014 had been "wiped out" by a 16 per cent increase this year. "We're almost exactly back to where things were two years ago, with an annual deforestation level of 5,831sq km." Biodiversity At the core of forest negotiations at COP21 is the UN's concept of "REDD+", which involves payments based on emission reductions that have been measured, reported and verified relative to baselines and subject to various safeguards to protect biodiversity and the rights of indigenous forest communities. REDD+ (shorthand for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) got a major boost last week, with an announcement from Norway, Germany and the UK of additional commitments of $5 billion to pay tropical countries for "verified performance" under the programme. But there is not universal agreement on REDD+ at COP21 . On Monday, California governor Jerry Brown was accosted by two women from the Global Alliance Against REDD, which claims that it really stands for "Reaping profits from Evictions, land grabs, Deforestation and Destruction of biodiversity". Distributing cards saying "No REDD! No CO2lonisalism! No to the Privatization of Nature!", one of them shouted at Brown that California was backing a UN programme that was a "political and environmental nightmare". The governor replied: "If you know of any abuses, we will not tolerate that at all." Significantly, 14 tropical countries have signed up for the "Lima Challenge" to cut the rate of loss of natural forests globally by at least half before 2020 and strive to end natural forest loss by 2030. As deforestation accounts for 10 per cent of global emissions, it's in all of our interests that they achieve these objectives. \</doc>

? IT's not too often that the media applaud those hosting press conferences, but Cardinal Peter Turkson received such an honour yesterday. The Ghanaian led the drafting team of Pope Francis's call for climate and environmental action, 'Laudato Si', where the Pontiff memorably described the planet as beginning to resemble "an immense pile of filth". That language was evident in the cardinal's comments at COP21 . "We receive this Earth as a garden. We do not want to pass it on to those who come after us as a wilderness." Cue, applause all 'round. ? Away from the main COP21 venue is 'Climate Generations', a space for civil society where the atmosphere is distinctly more colourful. There's a solar powered sound system, which allowed a troupe of Greenland women sing songs about eating a whale (sustainably, of course); an opportunity to meet the "world's wisdom keepers" and activities for those of a spiritual bent, including 'yoga for the inner climate' and 'chant and meditate for the planet'. Nice piece from the archives of 'The New York Times' about a scientist who n re-examined a theory from the early 1900s about why the planet was warming. "According to a theory, which was held half a century ago, variation in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide can account for climatic change... the theory was generally dismissed as inadquate," Waldemar Kaempffert wrote in the paper in October 1956. But according to Dr Gilbert Plass, "the carbon dioxide theory stands up, though it may take another century of observation and measurement of temperature to confirm it." Seems that time has come. ? With all the talk about the enormous sums of money needed to combat climate change ($100bn a year), it's hard to get your head around all the figures. But 'Stop Climate Crime!' has come up with a bumper one. Some $650bn a year of public money, it claims, is used to support the development of fossil fuel energy. Our taxes are financing "the run towards climate chaos". And to add to the deep sense of depression, it seems we're paying to make good the damage too. "We are struggling to find the $100bn each year to finance climate change mitigation efforts... when fossil fuels are believed to be responsible for $6,000bn of environmental and health-related impacts". \</doc>

Sir, - Thank you for breaking the silence and stating the inconvenient truth that our Government has little or no interest in addressing the climate change challenge we face. ("Kenny lukewarm on climate change", October 19th). The Government fails to see that protecting our environment will be good for our economy and for our society. It is positioning our country as a source of the problem rather than being a leader in providing solutions. It is shaming us by the path it has decided to take. Last month the Government and Opposition parties voted through a Climate Bill in the D\'e1il. At the same time the Government was lobbying in Brussels to get us exempted from EU 2030 emissions reduction targets, Bord na M\'f3na announced they will keep burning peat for the next 15 years, major public transport projects were postponed for decades to come and Eirgrid abandoned plans to develop our electricity grid for a long-term low-carbon energy future. What did those deputies think as they clapped themselves on the back for putting a climate bill through? When it comes to climate action, the parties in the D\'e1il are just not for real. The UN climate meeting in Paris next month ( COP21 ) is unlikely to reach the sort of climate deal we need but it will be an important milestone where all the major countries start out on a common path to rid their economies of the use of fossil fuels. COP21 will be the start of an uncertain pilgrim journey where the path we have to follow is created by taking the first step. The sad thing is that the Irish Government will arrive in Paris and effectively say that we are going to drive the camino for the first week. That will not be good for us. It will not be good for our country or for our standing in the world. Thank you for your editorial which cut through all the hot air and recognised that we are now the best little country for everything, except for looking after this world. - Yours, etc, EAMON RYAN Leader of the Green Party Suffolk Street, Dublin 2. \</doc>

The mammoth task facing delegates from 195 countries at the COP21 UN climate change conference in Paris can be measured by wading through a 54-page negotiating text that contains no fewer than 1,617 instances of square-bracketed words, phrases, terms and even whole paragraphs. Each square bracket denotes an area of contention or even a flashpoint. More often than not, these tend to be between the developed world and those countries that are still developing, with much of the disputation over their "common but differentiated responsibilities" in tackling the problem of climate change. All of these glitches, some of which are monumental, must be ironed out in the hardball negotiations that COP21 president French foreign minister Laurent Fabius is determined to conclude on Friday, December 11th, with a comprehensive and credible agreement. The draft text, produced in advance of the summit, acknowledges that climate change "represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible co-operation by all countries" in finding solutions. In particular, it calls for their participation in "an effective and appropriate international response, with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions", recognising that "deep cuts...will be required to achieve the ultimate objective". However, there is no consensus on the extent of these cuts or on a timetable for implementing them. Nor is there any agreement on capping the rise in average global surface temperatures at a particular level, as shown in the text by the following convoluted paragraph: "Hold the increase in the global average temperature [below 2 \'b0C] [below 1.5 \'b0C] [well below 2 \'b0C] [below 2 \'b0C or 1.5 \'b0C] [below 1.5 \'b0C or 2 \'b0C] [as far below 2 \'b0C as possible] above pre-industrial levels by ensuring deep cuts in global greenhouse gas [net] emissions." There is also a wide gulf between delegates over how to achieve any of these temperature goals in accordance with the "best available science", by aiming for a low-carbon trajectory in the long term and the peaking of emissions by 2030, or even "as soon as possible". Decarbonisation Reference to "decarbonisation" of the global economy is also in square brackets even though the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that carbon emissions must be reduced to zero by 2100 if we are to have any chance of limiting the extent of global warming. Instead, bracketed text refers to a number of options, including reductions ranging from 40 per cent to 70 per cent by 2050 or setting a "global carbon budget based on climate justice", which is the option currently favoured by the most vulnerable countries at the front line of climate change. There is even disagreement over references to these low-lying, small island states and poorer countries in Africa and elsewhere, with their "urgent and immediate needs" also put in brackets, even though they are the climate equivalents of the proverbial canary in the coalmine. One measure these countries are insisting must be in the final accord is a "loss and damage" mechanism that would address negative impacts of climate change. This was quite a breakthrough at COP19 in Warsaw two years ago, but it appears in brackets in the Paris text. Largest share Also in brackets is a statement noting that the largest share of historical global emissions has originated in developed countries, while per capita emissions in developing countries "are still relatively low [and] will grow to meet their social and development needs". The cost-effective solution of putting a price on carbon to achieve the cuts in emissions required over the next decade is bracketed too. Indeed, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres has already conceded that a carbon price is not going to be one of the outcomes of COP21 . Agreement has yet to be reached over how this "global stock-taking" is to be done and when it might kick in, although "every five years" is mentioned - but in brackets. So is a reference to developing countries requiring aid from their richer counterparts to take further actions. Crunch point Also in square brackets is a requirement that developed countries "shall formulate low-emission development strategies with timeframes for achieving zero emissions", whereas developing countries are merely "encouraged" to develop low-carbon development strategies. Another crunch point is a requirement that developed countries "shall provide new and additional financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing countries in complying with their obligations". Brackets also surround the contentious notion that there should be an "enforcement branch" to ensure that developed countries are implementing their commitments and a "facilitative branch" to lightly police and assist compliance by developing countries. Even more fanciful is the idea (which is also bracketed) that the Paris deal would establish an international tribunal of climate justice to address non-compliance by developed countries on everything from mitigation and adaptation to finance, technology transfer and capacity-building. Between one thing and another, COP21 delegates at the heavily guarded conference centre in Le Bourget are facing into long days and nights of talking in contact groups and other negotiating sessions before the brackets can be lifted and some sort of agreement reached. \</doc>

Montreuil is a large suburb in eastern Paris where few tourists venture. It is predominantly working class. It is not very pretty, but has an edge, with many artists living here. Its politics are radical too, with green and communist mayors in recent years. You can take it that few of the VIPs and senior politicians attending COP21 have bothered to take a trip across the city to Montreuil from Le Bourget. For it is here that an impressive alternative event to the global climate change summit took place. With the support of the municipality, the People's Climate Summit has taken over the main public space of Montreuil as well as all of the side streets and halls. Hundreds of stalls meandered out from the centre; there are dozens of events, thousands of volunteers and many thousands of participants. It involved all the big environmental organisations as well as every imaginable fringe climate group imaginable. I wandered through the fair yesterday and the atmosphere was upbeat. There was a huge mix of people, although the young predominated, with a strong alternative vibe. It's not complementary to COP21 . It's a direct challenge to it, saying it is not doing enough. For these climate change campaigners the Montreuil event has allowed them make their case about the urgency and importance of the decisions to be made. To a certain extent it allows them vent their frustration at the (inevitable) disappointment that will accompany the final agreement at the other Paris event. London-born Alexis Rowell of Coalition Climate 21 said environmental organisations had been working towards this event for a year. It is broken into three parts: a climate forum; a peasant's market; and a village that attempts to collect all alternative solutions to the global crises in climate change, the environment, economics and politics. " COP21 "The problem with Le Bourget is it is governments sitting around coming up with pledges. There is no binding treaty or no verification or no way of penalising anyone who won't do what say they will do." At the corner of one street was a massive Statue of Liberty with acrid-looking smoke spewing from the raised torch. A comic troupe flung plastic out of a huge supermarket trolley. In a nearby hall, prominent writers and environmentalists Naomi Klein and Bill McKinney were the prosecutors in a mock trial against oil company ExxonMobil, which allegedly suppressed information over many years about the true environmental impact of fossil fuels. Sneak preview The trial is essentially a performance, but there are impressive witnesses, including a young woman from the Marshall Islands who reminds people the islands are only a metre above sea level. Klein tells the crowd to huge applause: "What we are doing here is stepping in where courts have failed. We firmly believe that this is a preview, that the prosecution of Exxon will happen in real courts very soon. Do not consider this a mock trial but a sneak preview of Exxon's future." Kate McNeely, a young artist and activist from New York, stands in front of the climate ribbon, a statue of a tree strewn with a rainbow-burst of ribbons. The idea behind it, she says, is that people write on to a ribbon the thing they love most that might be lost because of climate change. "The magnitude of what we are dealing with I don't believe can be solved by governments and by organisations inside Le Bourget. "We need a complete system change to deal with not just climate change but with racism, sexism and class differentiation. I believe civil society will make that change. I believe gatherings like this village in Montreuil are the way forward." \</doc>

Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister and president of the COP21 UN climate conference, announced that an accord had been reached at 4.30am Saturday. Then things fell apart. The Americans objected to the words "climate justice". Nicaragua objected to just about everything else. Hollande offered to telephone the leftist president, Daniel Ortega, in Managua. As the text was whittled down, the French noted with pleasure that the number of "shoulds" diminished, while the number of "shalls" increased, making the agreement more binding. Dangerous moment "The developing countries wanted 'shall,' but the Americans wanted 'should'," says a member of Fabius's staff. "It was a dangerous moment because other countries wanted to start renegotiating things. "The Turks had been very difficult. [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan kept calling Hollande, who told him Turkey could not have special status." Fabius defined his method as "listening, transparency, ambition for the agreement, and a spirit of compromise." Over three nights, he and his top negotiator, Laurence Tubiana, received small groups from problem countries. Fabius asked John Kerry, the US secretary of state, to ask Barack Obama to telephone Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. The Indians needed US reassurance on patents, royalties and technology transfers. It was like herding cats, but Fabius is the most experienced member of the French administration. Now 69, "Fabiulous," as some called him in the wake of the agreement, was France's youngest prime minister at the age of 38. He served seven years as speaker of the national assembly. Finally, at 7.30pm on Saturday, Fabius rose with his green, leaf-shaped gavel. "I look over the room, I see the reaction is positive, I hear no objections. The Paris accord for the climate is adopted!" he said, striking his gavel. Responsibility It had been a long road since Hollande promised to hold the conference, as a gesture to his ecologist allies, during the 2012 presidential campaign. No other country wanted the responsibility. The 2011 COP in Durban committed all 195 UN member states to reaching a universal agreement on fighting climate change by the end of 2015. "The big difference with previous COPs was the sheer number of parties involved," says Pierre Radanne, a veteran of 16 COPs and a climate adviser to governments and NGOs for three decades. "At Kyoto in 1997, only 38 developed countries made commitments." In September 2012, Hollande announced that France would host COP21 . "He had no idea what he was getting into," Radanne says. Fabius was appalled. "I discussed it with him at the Doha COP in 2012. He said, 'It's going to be very, very difficult. Extremely complicated. I don't know if we can do it." When Hollande travelled to Washington, Beijing and Berlin, the main question leaders asked him was: "What are you going to do with the Paris conference?" "Hollande realised that his place among the greats of this world depended on the climate question," Radanne says. Initially reluctant, Fabius threw himself into preparations even as he grappled with crises in Syria and Ukraine, and with Iran's nuclear programme. The most effective French foreign minister in two decades, Fabius clocked up the equivalent of an around-the-world trip every month. Strong contacts Good casting was essential to his success. In June 2014, Fabius appointed Tubiana, a highly respected political scientist and economist, as his chief negotiator. Tubiana has strong contacts in developing and emerging countries, as well as the UN. "The last time France held a big UN conference was in 1948, for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights," said Pierre- Henri Guignard, the career diplomat who Fabius asked to organise COP21 . "A lot of us didn't even know what a COP was." France's diplomatic network, which ranks second in the world after the US, was a big advantage. Ambassadors were instructed to wine and dine contacts to impress upon them the French seriousness of purpose. Fabius asked for monthly reports on climate policy and foreign opinion. And he avoided a major pitfall. "There was a huge risk that France, which has a high opinion of herself and of her place in history, would sin by arrogance," says Radanne. "France had to be very present, very active and very humble." Fabius and Tubiana invited the ministers who concluded the negotiations at Le Bourget to three Paris summits in the months preceding the conference. "It enabled the French to test ideas and to test people too," says Simon Roger, who covered COP21 for Le Monde . "They saw who they could rely on as 'facilitators' in the negotiations." There are reports that Fabius will soon leave the foreign ministry. "Having worked as hard as he has," says Roger, "he probably wants to leave with the stature of the man who, with president Hollande, saved the planet." \</doc>

Irish involvement with the climate change talks in Paris did not get off to an auspicious start 10 days ago when Taoiseach Enda Kenny made a special case for Irish agriculture. His unprompted defence of Ireland's biggest emitting sector caused a flurry of consternation at home. Environmentalists accused the Government of seeking a free pass for agriculture and the Opposition accused him of hypocrisy, saying one thing to a world audience and something different to a domestic audience. Others wondered why he had brought it up at all given that Irish agriculture emissions do not even enter the equation at COP21 . Ireland is a part of the EU bloc and is rowing in behind its key pledge of a 40 per cent cut in emissions by 2030. Contribute It will be spring before individual states begin to negotiate how much they will contribute to that 40 per cent. In general, Ireland's position tallies with that of the larger union on all the big issues - ambition, transparency, finance - and as such would be regarded as comparatively progressive. Ireland has been represented at the talks by a small number of officials from the Department of the Environment with expertise on climate. They are led by assistant secretary David Walsh and three senior officials who form part of the EU negotiation team: John O'Neill, Petra Woods and George Hussey. There is also a senior official from the Department of Agriculture and an experienced environmental lawyer from the Attorney-General's office at the summit. High-level talks He was initially involved with counterpart ministers from Austria and Romania in working on actions that needed to be taken before 2020. He was later involved in talks on emissions' trading between the EU and Brazil, which was due to be put to plenary. Besides the Government, there are representatives of many Irish environmental and aid agencies, including Concern, Tr\'f3caire, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. All have been critical of a lack of ambition and have said the EU should have done more. A number of other politicians have attended or are attending COP21 . Among them are Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, Fine Gael MEP Se\'e1n Kelly and Labour's chair of the environment committee Michael McCarthy, along with employers' body Ibec. \</doc>

There has been significant progress over the past 24 hours in the search for a global climate deal with growing support for the lower target of a 1.5-degree temperature increase. A new alliance between the EU and 79 vulnerable countries has added to a sense of optimism as the COP21 negotiations enter their final stages. The French presidency under foreign minister Laurent Fabius has won widespread praise for its handling of the negotiations. It will present a new, "clean" draft text at 1pm today which is expected to offer clear options to the almost 200 negotiating governments on key issues. Very positive "It is going very well," said Mohamed Adow, a senior figure with Climate Action Network. "At this stage compared to Copenhagen and other climate summits, it is all very positive. The politics of process has given way to the politics of substance." There is growing support among the bigger players to strengthen the text of the proposed agreement to include a reference to limiting the average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. It is still expected, however, that any legally binding target in the final agreement would be closer to 2 degrees. The EU, which has signalled support for the more ambitious target, last night announced that it had reached an agreement with 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific states on a number of key issues, which have been among the most divisive. Legally binding They include a commitment that the Paris accord be legally binding, that clear long-term goals are set out and that a five-year review mechanism is introduced. They have also agreed that the accord should include transparency and accountability systems to make sure that parties honour the pledges on carbon emission reductions. As part of the pact, the EU will pay EUR 475 million to support climate action in the 79 countries up to 2020. There are still some major issues to be resolved. The plenary session of COP21 heard last night that there is no clear agreement on the contentious issue of loss and damage, which covers the demand for compensation and liability by countries already severely affected by climate change. This remained a "red line" issue for parties, the session was told. There are also differences on key issues such as securing agreement between the 195 countries to commit to more ambitious targets in future that would involve early start dates, new pledges and mechanisms for regular and transparent reviews of those new plans. \</doc>

Two new draft documents on a possible climate change accord were published in Paris yesterday as negotiators reported tangible but slow progress in the search for a historic response to global warming. It came as ministers from almost 200 countries were set to arrive for high-level talks in the second week of COP21 , the UN climate change conference. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly and Minister for Communications and Energy Alex White will arrive at Le Bourget this weekend. Ahead of the visit, there were mixed views on how the talks had been progressing. Some environmental groups and representatives of poorer countries expressed frustration at the absence of a breakthrough on key issues. However, UN climate change head Christiana Figueres said talks remained on track. She told a media conference that no single issue had been finalised or cleared during the technical discussions involving officials. It was important to understand that no single issue could be advanced without others and that the document was "very much a balancing act", she said. A new, pared-down draft of the possible agreement was published yesterday morning. The document has been shortened to 38 pages, from a 50-page draft. A second document, known as a "bridging text" was also published. This contained suggestions by facilitators aimed at narrowing options and to help clean up the texts ahead of next week's high-level discussions. The disputed issues include setting a legally binding limit for the maximum increase in temperature; financing by richer countries of infrastructure needed by poorer countries; loss and damage issues; transparency of what measures are actually being taken; food security and climate justice; as well as discussions around more ambitious targets for the future. "We are just about halfway done in time and about 25 per cent done with our work," said Lou Leonard of the World Wildlife Fund. "There is a need to speed up progress." 'Fairly brutal' COP21 was getting "fairly brutal" as differences were exposed. "Realities are setting in and it is getting very political. At the adaptation session there was a bust-up. Rich countries are putting forward no text options and adopting a maximalist position," said Kelly Dent of Oxfam. Sven Harmeling of Care said Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia had blocked any substantive recommendations coming from a review group which was to give the best scientific recommendations to ministers. The conclusion, he said, was that limiting the average increase in global temperature to 2 degrees above preindustrial levels was not sufficient. "That is an outer defence line that we need to stay well below," he said. \</doc>

A sun-tanned, white-haired 81-year-old woman who has devoted her life to preserving the animal kingdom may well be the most impressive person to have come to Paris for the COP21 UN climate conference. The draft accord, which should be finalised today, merely notes "the importance of ensuring . . . the protection of biodiversity". But Jane Goodall, the British primatologist who is the world's leading expert on chimpanzees, says the agreement is crucial to their survival. "There used to be more than a million chimpanzees in the world; there are only 300,000 left," Goodall says. "The main threat to chimpanzees is deforestation, which destroys their habitat. The second is the live meat trade, and sadly there's a growing trade in live animals, where the mothers are shot and the babies are taken for sale." Sustainable management Deforestation is a major cause of climate change, as the carbon dioxide in trees is released into the atmosphere when they are cut down and burned. Article 3 of the draft accord encourages parties to the UN convention on climate change to "conserve and enhance" forests as "sinks and reservoirs" of greenhouse gases. The draft accord mentions the need to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, and to achieve "sustainable management of forests" in three separate sections. "Climate change affects us, of course, but it's affecting all the other animals too," Goodall says. "We are so arrogant to think that this one form of life, that is so horribly destructive, is more important than everything else." Goodall worked as a waitress to pay her fare to Kenya when she was 23 years old. Her mentor, Kenyan anthropologist Louis Leakey, sent her to Cambridge to earn a doctorate in ethology (animal behaviour). Today, she holds honorary doctorates from more than 45 universities. Goodall's reverence for animals contrasts with the attitude of some leaders at COP21 . US secretary of state John Kerry said in a speech last month the threat from global warming was not just the "harm that is caused to the habitat for butterflies or polar bears as some people try to mock it . . . Climate change is not just about Bambi." Goodall reminds us that the butterflies, polar bears and Bambi are important. In its most recent , the World Wildlife Fund reported that between 1970-2010, populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish around the world dropped 52 per cent. "People don't realise the ripple effect," Goodall says. "A small insect that disappears may be the main food of a certain fish, which may be the main food for a certain bird. There are examples where it has led to ecosystem collapse just because one link is taken out of the food chain. "In the rainforest, you learn about the interdependence of all life. I think we made a mistake calling it biodiversity . . . If you talk about the web of life, people understand." Azzedine Downes, head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare and an elephant expert, shared a stage with Goodall at a seminar. "There hasn't been a lot of discussion about the impact of climate change on animals at COP21 ," he said. Drought There were only 350,000 elephants left in the wild and 33,000 were being killed every year, Downes said. Climate change forces animals to migrate, as humans do. Drought in East Africa has forced elephants to become more nocturnal, to hide from the sun. "Many elephants leave dry areas and move towards wetter areas. That's a trap, because those are the countries where poaching is out of control." Stanford academic Ken Caldeira, who is cited by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction , says animals would have to migrate poleward by 30ft a day to keep pace with present temperature changes. Goodall spent decades on the Gombe reserve in Tanzania observing how much our closest cousins resemble humans. She discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, for example to "fish" edible termites from a mound. Louis Leakey wrote that, thanks to Goodall's research: "We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human." Goodall also discovered that chimpanzees, like humans, can be aggressive and violent. "When rainforests start shrinking, they will become more territorial and brutal," she says. "If a community is forced to move, they cannot just blend in with another community. There will be pitched battles." Goodall describes the rescue of a female chimpanzee in 2013 as "the most amazing interaction I've ever had . . . when we released this adult female from her travelling cage on to the island. She turned and embraced me." The clip can be found on YouTube. "She was a chimp we rescued from the bush meat trade. Her name was Wounda, which means 'close to death'." Goodall, a vegetarian, says carnivores "are going to have to change. Because in order to feed the billions of animals that are being raised for us to eat around the world, huge areas of rainforest are cleared to grow grain to feed them." Social media Farm animals produce methane, a more virulent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methane was not discussed at COP21 , nor did negotiators suggest people should eat less meat. Goodall spends 300 days a year on the road, campaigning for better conditions for farm and wild animals. The Jane Goodall Institute has 19 offices around the world, and its youth programme, Roots & Shoots, has 100,000 groups in 140 countries. Goodall admires Pope Francis and advocates the power of social media to denounce enemies of the environment. "Young people energise me," she says. "As long as I have health, strength and the ability to communicate, I'll keep fighting." \</doc>

LORNA GOLD, head of policy at aid agency Trocaire, perhaps put it best. Signing a deal is one thing, the test is what actions come next, she said. She was speaking shortly after almost 200 nations agreed to ratify the Paris Agreement to address climate change at the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). For two decades, the science has warned that our climate is changing. But national self-interest prevented a common approach to action, even as a series of increasingly alarming reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) spelt out in detail how the ice caps were melting, sea levels rising, greenhouse gas emissions reaching record levels and rainfall patterns changing. In 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, a deal slipped out of sight after the Danish hosts lost control of the process. COP21 was a second chance. French diplomatic skills were brought to bear, and incredible attention paid to detail to ensure the event ran smoothly. Staff couldn't have been nicer. The food at the conference venue was excellent, and the toilets spotless. Each person was given a re-usable water bottle to refill from coolers to help prevent waste, and delegates moved through airport-style security at the conference venue quickly. There were some wonderful, typically French moments throughout the week. On Saturday, when a deal was still in doubt, the parties broke for lunch before the final plenary which would dictate whether agreement had been reached. Earlier in the week this reporter, having finished a nice dinner in a city centre restaurant with a colleague, spotted a mouse running around. In Ireland, you'd refuse to pay and complain to the HSE. In Paris, it would be disappointing if a mouse wasn't present. The organisers also made access to the city and conference venue as easy as possible. Free travel passes were provided, allowing people access the extensive - and low-carbon - electrified Metro and RER train system. Public transport hubs had directions to the lines which would transport people to Le Bourget train station, where they were ferried by hybrid bus to the conference venue. Paris aims to have an electrified, low-carbon transport system before 2020, and what better place to show off the art of the possible than to a captive audience in the city to discuss climate change. But it was no holiday. The negotiating process was long and difficult, with many unsung heroes involved. Linguists were employed to help agree a form of words, as parties argued over whether 'should' or 'shall' were included, for example. The Irish delegation included officials from the departments of environment, finance, foreign affairs and agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Office of the Attorney General. They helped negotiate technical aspects of the deal over 12 days and three all-night sessions. By the end, they knew all about running on empty and surviving on sandwiches and coffee. Environment Minister Alan Kelly, who led the delegation, paid tribute to officials, saying the country should be "genuinely proud" of them. "At key moments late in the night, they were crucial in maintaining political momentum behind a deal," he said. "I was very proud to have them with me as minister. They have served their country and department well." Professor John Sweeney, from Maynooth University and who was part of the IPCC team awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize, said the potential in the agreement was 'huge'. "We don't want to go back moaning and groaning," he said. "Nobody got everything they wanted, but that always happens in negotiations. The potential of this agreement is huge, and the ratcheting up (of targets) is very positive. "It's historic because I don't know of any other agreement involving the 196 nations in the UN, certainly not in this area. It's quite an achievement when you think of all the disparate countries involved." There is disappointment that the agreement - as opposed to the preamble - doesn't make explicit reference to human rights, but it does include a reference to gender, an important addition as most of the world's farmers are women who are among the most affected by crop failure caused by climate change. Key to its success will be the response of business and investors. The Paris Agreement means oil, gas and coal have no longterm future, and it will be interesting to see what impact it will have on share prices in the short-term. There were many moments when it appeared the parties were moving further from a deal, rather than closer. Compensated Some fossil fuel-producing countries suggested they would have to be compensated for leaving their oil in the ground. There were calls for vulnerable countries to be compensated for loss and damage caused by climate change, which bigger emitters like the US opposed. Some of the left-wing Latin American states indicated they shouldn't have to do anything at all, as the West had caused the problem in the first place, and even right at the end Malaysia was threatening to scupper a deal, while Africa was arguing it was among the most vulnerable, meaning it was entitled to more finance. But, more than a day late, a deal eventually came. And with that, the tide of history had turned. What happens next will dictate whether those late nights were worth it. A series of legal changes had to be made to the text because it was drafted by lawyers functioning with little or no sleep \</doc>

The COP21 United Nations conference on climate change which begins today is being presented by French media as "two weeks to save the Earth". The gathering of 150 heads of state and government is the largest ever hosted by France. "Their presence en masse shows the necessity and urgency of action," said the French foreign minister and president of COP21 , Laurent Fabius. President Fran\'e7ois Hollande will begin greeting the heads of state and government in the Le Bourget exhibition park - usually the site of an air show - at 8am today. The conference will formally open at 11.00am, with a minute of silence in homage to the victims of the November 13th attacks. After the "family photo", the heads of state and government have been asked to limit their speeches to three minutes each. Because their number is so great, they will speak in two different conference rooms. The speeches will be interrupted for an all-organic lunch prepared by five leading French chefs. Mr Fabius said the meal "will reflect environmental and French excellence, since diplomacy does not exclude conviviality - . We wanted to promote our gastronomy." All this week, the 1,500 negotiators who have hammered out a 50-page draft agreement will meet in groups and spin-off groups, behind closed doors. Their text will be finalised by Mr Fabius and the heads of 195 delegations between December 5th and 11th. At the same time, leaders will stage symbolic media events to launch initiatives intended to curb global warming. The three most important events today will be "Mission Innovation" led by Bill Gates and President Barack Obama. It will commit the 19 developed countries who represented 80 per cent of clean energy research to double their research and development budgets. The White House is uneasy about security within the UN zone and has chosen to hold events involving Mr Obama off site. He will be the guest of honour at dinner at the \'c9lys\'e9e Palace tonight. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi will launch a "solar alliance" of countries lying between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. More than 100 countries enjoy more than 300 days of sunshine annually, and believe they can lower the cost of solar energy through economies of scale. Finally, the World Bank will host a press conference with Mr Hollande and the heads of state of Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, Germany and Mexico to emphasise the importance of setting a price on carbon pollution. Mr Fabius has said "the struggle against climate change and the struggle against terrorism are the two greatest challenges of the 21st century". France "has been called to play a role in both," he added. "Is it an accident of history?" \</doc>

Eddie O'Connor, the wind energy entrepreneur, has warned the Government against taking a "sleeveen approach" on emissions targets, after the Taoiseach Enda Kenny complained at the COP21 global summit on climate change in Paris about "unrealistic" targets for Irish agriculture. Mr O'Connor, who founded and sold Airtricity and now runs renewables developer Mainstream Renewable Power (MRP), said the Irish Government should not seek "derogations". Mr Kenny had suggested at the conference that he supported legally binding emissions targets, but said some EU 2020 agriculture targets were "unreachable" because of a "lost decade" of economic malaise in this country. "There is no excuse. You can't opt out of global warming. There may be an issue with agriculture, but it is going to have to get dealt with," said Mr O'Connor. Leading role The businessman also said the Irish government should play a leading role in Europe to push for renewable energy, such as power derived from wind and solar, to quickly replace fossil fuels. He reiterated his call for a single European electricity market and a highly interconnected European "super-grid", where excess power derived from renewables could flow across borders to meet demand. "Nationalism is holding it up. Across Europe, you have monopolies in control of the grids," he said. "Politicians and their advisers here haven't thought it out. Yes, a small country like Ireland can only do so much, but this country can influence European policy when it wants to." Mr O'Connor insisted that renewables are "the cheapest form of electricity on the planet" and dismissed recent criticisms by some leading economists in Ireland that there is a bubble in the sector, and it is over-subsidised. He said an ambitious agreement at COP21 could also have a big impact on climate change. "Firstly, the costs of solar and wind energy have come down hugely. "Secondly, China is now taking a huge leadership role in tackling emissions. Both of those are game changers." Meanwhile, Mr O'Connor said MRP would probably float on the stock exchange in 2018. It would most likely be in New York and also possibly in the UK. Contract in Chile "We are examining where to float, but if our investment comes from the US and UK, it would be logical to float near our investors," he said. He said the company, which in a joint venture with Actis, recently won a $600 million State windfarms contract in Chile. It will also also announce several funding initiatives in the coming months. \</doc>

Almost 3,000 people have signed an online petition over the past two days criticising Taoiseach Enda Kenny's claim that emissions targets set for Irish agriculture were "unrealistic". The petition organised by three non-governmental agencies - Tr\'f3caire, Uplift and Friends of the Earth - called on the Taoiseach to show leadership on the issue. Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth said there was huge disappointment at what he described as the Taoiseach's "doublespeak" on Monday, calling for a global deal in the plenary session of the COP21 climate change conference, while telling reporters he wanted an exemption for Ireland. Playing our part "We think he misjudged the public mood. Irish people want to play their part in tackling climate change," he said. However, the Taoiseach's view was strongly supported by Meat Industry Ireland, which said climate change could not be decoupled from food security and economic competitiveness. Cormac Healy of Meat Industry said agriculture created a high proportion of emissions because it was a large sector of the economy and because there was little heavy industry in Ireland. "It would be foolhardy in the extreme to curb the production of beef in a country where we produce in an extensive grass-based system that is far more efficient and sustainable than elsewhere in the world," he said. Yesterday in Paris, Jerry MacEvilly, policy officer for climate justice at Tr\'f3caire, said the agency had serious concerns after five days of negotiations. Noting that Ireland has made no commitment to the Green Climate Fund other than the EUR 2 million pledged for 2016, Mr MacEvilly said the average per capita contribution from other EU states was 20 times higher than ours. Ireland and other EU member states were also urged at COP21 yesterday to "dramatically ramp up efforts" to phase out polluting coal plants. Coal-fired stations A study by Climate Action Network Europe and British think tank Sandbag revealed carbon emissions from Europe's ageing coal-fired power stations - including Moneypoint, Co Clare - will have to come down three times faster than the current EU rate to keep in line with global efforts to limit warming to 2 degrees. In 2014, Europe's huge "fleet" of coal plants released 762 million tonnes of CO2, accounting for 18 per cent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions, nearly as much as the entire EU road transport sector. Moneypoint is Ireland's largest single source of CO2, with emissions of 4.5 million tonnes annually. The study also found that 66 per cent of Europe's coal plants have been in operation for 30 years or more. \</doc>

LARA MARLOWE The historic agreement on climate change, adopted in Le Bourget at the weekend, is widely expected to herald the beginning of the end of humanity's high dependency on fossil fuels and usher in a new era reliant on renewable energy. Not since pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh landed at Le Bourget in May 1927, after making the first non-stop transatlantic solo flight from New York's Long Island, has the airfield - once the main airport for Paris - witnessed such a momentous landing as the 31-page Paris Agreement. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, who played a major role in preparing the ground for a successful outcome, hailed it as a "monumental success for the planet and its people", and praised rich countries for having "listened to the voices of the most vulnerable people" on the frontline of climate change. The agreement, which had been under discussion at UN climate conferences over the past four years, pledges to cap global warming at "well below 2 [degrees] above pre-industrial levels" and to "pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 [degrees]" - one of the key demands of Africa and low-lying island states. Hard negotiations After a series of positive speeches by almost 150 world leaders on the opening day, it still took two solid weeks of hard negotiations to reach a consensus at a temporary conference centre, purpose-built to house COP21 - the 21st Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Crowds took to the streets despite the anti-terrorism state of emergency rules that forbid large gatherings. People showed their determination with three street demonstrations in Paris. With catchy slogans, imaginative costumes and a palpable feeling of fraternit\'e9, the marches were certainly more fun than the proceedings out in Le Bourget. French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has called the ecological crisis "a crisis of meaning" and "a crisis of civilisation". Yet there was great hope in the chants of the demonstrators as they carried a 100m red banner down the avenue: "We are unstoppable. Another world is possible." Although the Paris Agreement's long-term goal on global average surface temperatures is more ambitious than anyone really expected, the means to achieve it - by substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide - are less specific, although these can be strengthened over time. No less than 189 of the 195 countries represented at COP21 have now submitted voluntary pledges to cut their emissions. Long-promised aid of $100 billion per year is to be provided by developed countries to poorer nations to enable them to switch from using fossil fuels to power their economies, and there is also provision to assist those who are displaced by the impacts of climate change. \</doc>

Twenty-three years after she represented France at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal is once again France's environment minister. Rio established the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under which 20 Conferences of the Parties, or Cops, have since been held. Royal will play an important role at Cop 21 , in Paris from November 30th-December 11th. Although Royal has been frustrated by the agonisingly slow negotiations, she also measures the distance travelled since Rio. "Twenty-three years ago, there was a debate about whether it was true," she said in an interview. "No one any longer contests climate change because everyone feels the effects. Today we have solutions to act efficiently and collectively for the planet." On August 17th, France enacted the "Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth", which Royal shepherded through 150 hours of debate and some 5,000 proposed amendments. The law, she says, "makes France the nation of environmental excellence" because "France is the first country to have translated into law its commitments in Cop 21 ". Defined goals The French believe, often naively, that legislation makes dreams come true. The energy law is based on goals defined by the EU for Cop 21 , but also sets specifically French targets, such as reducing reliance on nuclear energy from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. The law foresees an ambitious rise in the carbon tax on fossil fuel consumption, from EUR 14.50 per tonne at present to EUR 56 in 2020. The goal of concluding an agreement to limit the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2 degrees has been entrusted to mid-level diplomats meeting regularly in Bonn. Each session brings together 2,000 delegates and observers. Royal severely criticised the process last June when she told Le Monde that "UN negotiations are totally inadequate in addressing the urgency of climate change." Royal wanted heads of state and government to seize responsibility for negotiations. "Since then, a lot of people have come to the same conclusion, including the secretary general of the UN," she notes. Ban Ki-moon told Paris Match that he shares Royal's concern. "Even I think the negotiators talk too much, that the discussions take too much time . . . I tell the world's political leaders: Give clear orders to your negotiators . . . Stop haggling over technical details." Since Royal's broadside on the Bonn process, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has made it clear he will put maximum pressure on world leaders at the UN General Assembly to secure a "pre-accord" before the Paris conference. Royal believes the new "political impetus"coming from Ban and the leaders of China and the US, the world's big two polluters, will lead to agreement. Hollande said on September 7th that Cop 21 could fail over financing for the Green Climate Fund, which is supposed to provide EUR 100 billion annually to endow the developing world with the technology it needs to make the energy transition. "Anyone who thought the path to Cop 21 would be paved with a signed agreement, an immediate reversal of climate change and laurel wreaths for us is going to be disappointed," Hollande warned. The declarations regarding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions are sometimes spectacular, the president said, "but they're not always accompanied by cash. It all hangs by the financing. That's the key . . . If there's not a firm commitment to financing, there will be no accord, because the countries of the south will reject it." In a new twist, the governments of those countries suffering from climate change are demanding "loss and damage" compensation for the prejudice already sustained. Rivalry between Royal and foreign minister Laurent Fabius has complicated the organisation of Cop 21 . The bad blood goes back to 2006, when both were candidates in the socialist presidential primary. Royal was still with Hollande. "But who will look after the children?" Fabius allegedly quipped when Royal announced her candidacy. She lost the 2007 presidential race and separated from Hollande the same year. Asked about the division of labour between herself and Fabius, Royal said: "Laurent Fabius will preside over the Cop and manage the negotiations. I will show how France has undertaken the march towards a de-carbonised economy. I will continue to mobilise civil society, business and local government, as well as my European partners. "I will head the French delegation at Cop 21 ." Africa advocate Royal has become the de facto envoy to and advocate for Africa in climate change negotiations. While the rest of the government was on summer holiday, she spent two weeks in August visiting Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Ghana. "Africa is the most important continent for the climate change conference in Paris," Royal told African leaders in Libreville, Gabon, on August 28th. "With less than 5 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is not responsible for global warming." Royal promised that France will ensure that half the credits in the Green Climate Fund go to Africa. She cites the example of Namibia, whose wind and solar resources would make it self-sufficient if only it received the necessary technology. Royal saw evidence of climate change on her African journey. "A large proportion of beaches have disappeared in Senegal over the past five years," she says. "In Zambia, where 80 per cent of electricity comes from hydro-electric dams, the water level has gone down so far that there are power cuts." Royal is more optimistic than other French officials about the chances of Cop 21 . She believes the long-term effect will be to reduce poverty and rehabilitate the notion of progress. Inequality will diminish, she says. "Since the hot countries have the greatest potential in solar energy, if they benefit from technology transfer, they'll catch up with the industrialised countries who had to use fossil fuels." \</doc>

John Gibbons, a member of An Taisce s climate change committee, said Taoiseach Enda Kenny s admission that Ireland will miss its targets for cutting gas emissions from agriculture and blaming it on the economic crisis is not acceptable. The country would face huge fines as a result, and the agriculture industry should have to pay a levy to offset this, he said. The EU has warned that instead of cutting emissions by 20% from 2005-20, Ireland is likely to reduce greenhouse gases by just 3%, mainly due to agriculture and transport emissions. As one of 135 national leaders to speak at the opening session of COP21 , the biggest-ever climate change conference, Mr Kenny pleaded for special recognition of Ireland s plight. Mr Gibbons said: Ireland is acting irresponsibly we are planning to get a free ride on the basis that our neighbours have acted responsibly and will meet their targets. We want to exploit what we see as wriggle room. He said Ireland is attempting to be a freeloader at a time when we are being asked to show solidarity, especially with the poorest nations who are threatened with the worst effects of climate change, some facing complete devastation. We need to act with solidarity and instead we are showing we could not care less about the poor, Mr Gibbons said, adding that Ireland contributes just 2m to the UN s Green Development Fund. This amounts to about 50c per person, while the EU average is 10- 12 a person. We are set to become international pariahs, with further damage to our international reputation, said Mr Gibbons. The Government appears to believe there are no votes in dealing properly with climate change and instead has decided to side with the farm lobby, he said. Mr Kenny said Ireland could not afford the measures needed to reach the emissions reduction targets, 45% of which come from agriculture because of the methane-emitting national herd of cattle and sheep. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said cutting gas emissions and increasing GDP were compatible given that between 1990 and 2012, the EU s CO2 emissions fell 19% while GDP rose 45%. Mr Moscovici said: This clearly proves that climate protection and economic growth can go hand in hand. It is possible to implement public policies that support both GDP growth and ambitious action against climate change. The Government is making the case that since Ireland is producing food it should be given more time to reach the goals which are set for individual EU countries by the EU. A raft of initiatives were announced at COP21 to help poorer countries that are facing a drop in food production at a time when populations are growing. About 70% more food will be needed by 2050, according to the UN. Harold Kingston, the IFA s environment chairman, said new initiatives are making Irish agriculture sustainable at what is produced but it must deliver an increased economic return to the farmer. \</doc>

THE outcome of the 21st Conference of the Party ( COP21 ) talks in Paris will not dictate the future direction of Irish farming. That battle will be won, or lost, at the European Commission next year, when member states will agree the 40pc emission cuts required by each sector of the economy by 2030 - agriculture, industry, transport, buildings and, possibly, aviation and shipping too. The UN climate summit is solely concerned with high-level goals. COP21 is not concerned with how parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change make cuts in emissions. It only wants to see the necessary steps taken towards decarbonisation. The State will seek a special case for agriculture during the EU talks, arguing that Ireland's agri-food emissions should be treated differently than those in other members states. A number of reasons will be proffered. Our grassland-based system means food is produced more sustainably than other countries. If we are forced to reduce output, it will result in food being produced elsewhere at a higher environmental cost. It will also make the case the recession severely impacted economic growth and that growing agriculture will allow us to invest in research and development, and transfer this knowledge to other countries, a measure known as technology transfer. As outputs from Irish farms are monitored, we have already made enormous strides towards accountability, and the system allows us more readily identify issues which need to be addressed. But that might not be enough to convince our EU counterparts. The global agriculture sector is an enormous problem in relation to climate change, and has to be addressed. Despite our 'green' image, we have a lot of work to do. Although our emissions have fallen in recent years, largely due to the recession, they are still among the highest in the EU per head of population. Agriculture makes up the largest part of the total produced - 32pc. It is followed by energy (22pc), industrial and commercial (15pc), transport (19pc) and residential (11pc). If we are to argue for a special case exemption, we will have to dramatically ramp-up efforts in other sectors, something we have failed to do to date. IFA Environment Committee chairman Harold Kingston makes the point that we are a world leader in sustainable food production. Agriculture targets "No other country in the world monitors, measures and manages carbon from farm to fork. "This commitment to environmental improvement by so many farmers is verified by Bord Bia's Origin Green initiative," he says. The IFA is seeking support and incentives to innovate, and for money to be advanced to farmers in developing countries to make the transition. But the big political question is whether EU leaders will agree for Ireland's agriculture sector to be given less onerous targets. The difficulty is that if Ireland is given special status for agriculture, other countries will row in with demands specific to their own economy, and that could scupper the entire process. \</doc>

The Labour minister said he did not favour changing the guidelines for setback distances of turbines from homes. His comments come after a drawn out battle between his officials and those of Environment Minister Alan Kelly about reforming rules for windfarm projects. While Mr White insists Ireland has obligations to reduce its carbon emissions and must drive ahead with new turbine projects, Mr Kelly is under pressure to ensure communities can keep new windfarms at a distance from their properties. Speaking to RT\'c9 s The Week in Politics, Mr White said a paper on energy going to Cabinet this week would spell out what Ireland needed to do to decarbonise the economy. He said it is a challenge for Ireland and all signatories of the Paris deal. Ireland must double its renewable energy output by 2020 under the EU. Mr White said guidelines on the setback distances for turbines from homes would not be included in the white paper. Instead, they may be released at a later date. If you want to advocate a greater setback distance along the lines that some people are advocating...you will wipe out onshore wind in Ireland, said Mr White. Alternative State-owned lands are instead likely to be used for large windfarm projects. I will be able to show how we can actually identify lands in Ireland where we can have wind, which is not beside people s homes, lands in public ownership, [such as] Bord na Mona, Coillte owned, said Mr White. He said it was hoped agreement on new setback guidelines may be agreed in the coming weeks. However, amid suggestions the general election could be called early in the New Year, he added: But if we don t get new guidelines, we still have the old guidelines which are perfectly good. But I think we should deal with the issue of noise that does affect people, we should deal with the issue of shadow flicker. I m less convinced that we should have a greater setback distance. I don t think the evidence backs that. Sinn F\'e9in environment spokesman Brian Stanley said old setback distances existed for smaller turbines, not newer, bigger ones. He added that renewable energy needed to also focus on other resources, such as biofuels and solar power. Mr White said these would be addressed when the paper is published on Wednesday. The white paper comes after Ireland signed up to the new global climate deal in Paris. COP21 will move countries towards carbon neutrality and will have profound changes for Ireland s agriculture, transport and electricity industries. Many of these will emerge when the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is published by the outgoing government, which could be early next year. Under proposed changes, Ireland will commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 and match EU targets. Ireland and other nations at Cop21 agreed to limit global warming to 1.5% degrees Celsius, leading to full decarbonisation by mid-century. World: 9 \</doc>

EUROPEAN Commissioner Phil Hogan has said he does not expect the United States and China to follow through on their "rhetoric" at the climate change negotiations in Paris. Mr Hogan has suggested the world's two largest carbon emitters will not live up to the progressive language used by Barack Obama and Xi Jinping at the opening of COP21 . "It'll be interesting to see if the rhetoric of the United States and China, who are now promoting themselves as very strong in terms of ambitious legally binding targets, [will be followed] through on. "I don't expect they will," he said during a speech in Dublin yesterday. His comments came as Taoiseach Enda Kenny defended his performance in front of almost 150 other world leaders at the opening of the negotiations earlier this week. Leeway Mr Kenny has been criticised for saying Ireland would need leeway on targets for reducing emissions because of our reliance on the agri-food sector. "I want to make it clear that this country is not looking for any derogation. This country is not looking for an escape route. "This country is not looking for special treatment because we have signed on as part of the European community for a 40pc reduction by 2030," Mr Kenny told staff at LinkedIn's headquarters in Dublin. However, Mr Kenny said that the Government will argue "on technical grounds" that our targets should be "fair and sustainable for us". "When we allocated our targets we will achieve that target by 2030. If you hear anything to the contrary it's not accurate," he said. "We are well able to measure up but we want targets that are fair and sustainable and we'll argue that over the next 10 days." Environment Minister Alan Kelly is to represent Ireland at the COP21 talks next week where a series of targets will set as part of the effort to slow climate change. However, Mr Hogan has cast serious doubt over whether the outcome of the summit will make a real difference outside of Europe. "If you compare this week's press statement with the ones of the last three years I'd say they won't be largely different in terms of what they say. They will say 'excellent result', 'very ambitious', £ great opportunity' £nd we look forward to the follow through and implementation'," he said at a lunch for the Association of European Journalists. The Agriculture Commissioner, who has attended three previous climate change conferences, said Europe is taking "a very strong leadership position in trying to advance the cause to many of the countries that are good on rhetoric but not necessarily good on outcomes and follow through". He said that the negotiations tend to be "torturous" and it's "never easy" to get a result. Mr Hogan said that consideration would have to be given to countries like Ireland which have a large dependence on agriculture. "There are also countries that have specific problems with other sectors," he said, adding: "Agriculture will not get a free pass in relation to these negotiations. "As Simon Coveney has said in this country, in respect of Ireland, the Taoiseach has set out his priorities and ambitions but agriculture and forestry will play its part." \</doc>

Ireland's weather is changing and instances of flooding will increase as a result, according to two Cork students exhibiting at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. Ellecia Vaughan and Julie O'Donovan, of Sacred Heart Secondary School in Clonakilty, Co Cork, analysed flood water data collected in Bandon from 1991 to 2015, which included the latest data from last month's Storm Desmond. The results are very clear and support the view that climate change is under way, they said. "The findings show flooding is increasing in Ireland," Ellecia said. "It is obvious something is happening. Something does need to be done," Julie added. The two 17-year-old fifth-year students were an exemplar of what make the young scientist exhibition so important, as described by President Michael D Higgins as he formally opened the event yesterday. The President praised all students for their hard work and dedication. "Their work is of immense importance at a national and international level," he told the more than 1,100 students assembled in the BT Arena during the opening ceremonies. Mr Higgins described the exhibition as "full of curiosity" and said the students displayed great invention. Science had defined the climate change debate in the Paris COP21 talks last month, he said and science "can find the solutions to these great questions". COP21 climate change meeting in Paris, given its content. The two used statistics to analyse the impact of flooding in Bandon over the past 15 years. They chose Bandon because very little had been done to defend the town against floods since the record storms and flooding in 2009. They shied away from making a direct link with climate change but it was clear the "normal" rainfall statistics and the incidence of major storms was changing, they said. Topical focus Their project included data from no more than two weeks ago, and demonstrated the topicality and currency of many of the projects at the exhibition. There were a number of projects looking at the ongoing refugee crisis and its impact on countries across the EU. Niamh Liston (16) and Hannah Barrett (15), fifth years at Desmond College in Limerick, assessed the factors influencing refugee admittance to the EU. "We wanted to get the opinions of EU citizens and what influenced willingness to accept refugee admission," said Hannah. They looked at three factors, the level of democracy in the country, economic status and population density, she said. Niamh described how they set up an email-based survey method and attracted 203 responses from 16 countries. The majority of EU citizens polled felt the refugee crisis was being handled badly. Almost 11 per cent said their country was doing a good job on the issue but 16 per cent strongly disagreed with this view. The Paris attacks in November had an impact on their findings. Before the killings, 62 per cent strongly agreed that refugees should be accepted but this fell sharply to 23 per cent afterwards, they said. \</doc>

STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNTIL 00:01HRS, THURSDAY 1ST OCTOBER 2015 BROADCAST INTERVIEWS ONLY KATE HUMBLE INTERVIEW OPPORTUNITY :: Study sees parents and children asked to identify the UK's five most common trees :: Only 1% recognised all five (Ash, Birch, Oak, Horse Chestnut and Beech) :: Study part of a campaign supported by Kate Humble, to try and reconnect the UK with its love of trees and to raise awareness of forests, one of our most powerful defences against climate change Brits are out of touch with trees and have no idea of the crucial role they play in our everyday lives. That's according to a study in which families were asked to recognise the UK's most common trees (Ash, Birch, Oak, Horse Chestnut and Beech) with only 1% of parents and 1% of children able to recognise all five. The study of 1,000 families was undertaken by Unilever as part of its brightFuture campaign (#ForTheLoveofTrees), to raise awareness of the importance of trees and forests in the run up to the United Nation's Climate Change Summit, COP21 , later this year. It also reveals a huge knowledge gap in Brits' understanding of climate change and the role of deforestation as a key contributing factor to rising temperatures. The study reveals that: :: Only 1% of parents in the UK could identify all of the UK's most common trees :: 9 in 10 could not identify an Ash or a Beech tree :: One in five mums and three in ten children could not identify even one tree out of the UK's common five trees :: Children really struggle to identify Ash, Beech or Horse Chestnut trees :: Older children over the age of 10 have no better tree knowledge than younger children :: There is a direct correlation between the parent's lack of tree knowledge and that of our children's, which shows that tree knowledge is dying out This year, Unilever is working with WWF to raise awareness of deforestation and protect one million trees in the Indonesian and Brazilian rainforests as a gesture towards a future where trees are recognised as one of the most valuable defences we have against climate change. The study also throws into question the nation's knowledge of the wider issue of global deforestation and its impact on climate change. 80% of mums know nothing or little about climate change, only 38% realise that deforestation is responsible for more carbon emissions than all transport on the planet (every plane, every car, every boat, and every train), and only 18% have heard of COP21 . However, there is no denying that the effects of climate change today are more widespread and harder to ignore than ever before. Deforestation not only affects the climate by increasing the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide but also affects the environment by inhibiting water recycling, triggering severe flooding as well as having a devastating impact on plant and animal species.

The French leadership of the global climate change summit in Paris last night ramped up pressure for an early agreement with a new draft that removed hundreds of disputed issues. Almost six hours after it was due, the French foreign minister and president of the COP21 summit, Laurent Fabius, last night presented a 27-page document which had pared down the number of square-bracketed text (issues in dispute) to 50, compared to 361 in the text from 24 hours before. "We are extremely close to the finishing line, we need effort to find common ground," Mr Fabius told ministers from 195 countries when presenting the draft last night. "I think I will be able to present the final text tomorrow. I think, dear friends, that we will make it." There is what was described as significant progress in the new text. For the first time there is an undisputed ambition to hold the increase in global average temperature to "well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue effort to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius," he said. Major gaps However, there are still major gaps on the three big issues that have divided negotiators at the talks: transparency (ensuring countries and parties live up to their promises), differentiation (the respective responsibilities of rich countries developing countries) and long-term ambition. However, the text does includes political breakthroughs in the setting of a long-term goal, a mechanism for transparency, as well as a means of ratcheting-up ambition. To achieve aspirations to curb global warming, the agreement would require meaningful and specific commitments. The inclusion of five-year reviews - to encourage countries to make more ambitious pledges - is seen as a gain. It will also start from a relatively early date; 2019. "Coming into COP21 "In that context, the setting of long term goals, a transparency mechanism, and the ratcheting-up mechanism, which Saudi Arabia and India opposed, is a positive development." Environmental groups and aid agencies expressed dismay at what they saw was a considerable softening of the text, as well as the removal of some key goals from the main text. Considerably weaker "There is a row-back on some of the key principles. The provisions on human rights are now only in the preamble and not in the main body of the text, which, means they are not legally binding. What that means that any measures to enforce the climate agreement will not be bound by human rights standards." Her colleague Jerry MacEvilly criticised the EU for not pushing an ambitious agenda on this issue or on the issue of food security. The latest draft includes a specific long-term goal to move towards "greenhouse gas emissions neutrality in the second half of the century". While that is seen as lacking ambition by environmental agencies, others see it as much as could be achieved given the diversity of strong opinions among the 196 states attending the summit. \</doc>

? HELD in a series of exhibition halls stretched across a massive campus, the Le Bourget conference venue is as anonymous as any other in the world. Think the Red Cow without the Luas. But organisers of COP21 have attempted to give the venue a Parisien feel by naming the main thoroughfare between the exhibition halls the Champs -\'c9lys\'e9es, complete with a glowing mini-Eiffel Tower at the end. ? Lest any government attending the climate summit being in doubt as to the seriousness of the task facing them over the next two weeks, French organisers have erected a timely symbol of what is expected of them. 'Welcome, Defenders of the Planet' a 20-foot high, rotating pole proclaims in the middle of the Champs -\'c9lys\'e9es. No pressure. ? Taoiseach Enda Kenny wasn't just keen to discuss climate change when he attended COP21 . Killing two birds with one stone, indeed. ? In the midst of very technical discussions around finance and emissions, it's the people most affected by global warming which are often forgotten. But former President Mary Robinson, who is also a UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, said she was heartened to hear so many world leaders put people at the centre of their UN addresses. "I would like to hope this will carry through in the negotiations, a people-first approach," she said. It came as she announced a funding deal from 17 countries to encourage rural development without deforestation, and which will also see some forests restored. And although Ms Robinson doesn't like speaking about politics, she did note that all countries - Ireland included - should be more ambitious in tackling climate change. She said there was "room for improvement", and said developed countries had to be "clear" about their responsibilities. ? Mr Kenny was more than 90 minutes late addressing the climate summit, but nobody could claim that it was his fault. Despite having failed on numerous occasions over the last 20 years to deliver a deal, world leaders spent so much time talking about the need for action that most of them overran the three-minute time slot allotted. NGOs note that it's deeds, not words, required at this point. ? IRELAND has pledged at least (EURO)6m towards helping developing countries adapt to climate change. The State joins 10 other countries, including Canada, the US, France, Germany and the UK in committing to provide $248m ((EURO)235m) of 'new' money to support the most vulnerable countries on the planet. The money will be provided to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), a climate fund hosted by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). It will be provided between now and 2020 to help countries adapt to droughts, violent storms, sea-level rise and other impacts caused by climate change. Former President of Ireland and United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Climate Change Mary Robinson said the money would be used to support millions of people. \</doc>

At the RDS in Dublin last Thursday night, Naomi Klein asked the sold-out audience, "I was wondering if Danny Healy-Rae made it? I saw all kinds of people offering him tickets on Twitter." It is a privilege for Healy-Rae to be mentioned by Klein - one of the great minds of her generation - even if it is as a punchline. Klein was in town for the International Literature Festival Dublin, and spoke mostly about her recent book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs . Klein repeatedly criticised Irish governments for neglecting and "forgetting" climate change, but also cited several Irish examples that feed into the climate justice movement; the anti-fracking movement in Leitrim, water charges protests, the Shell To Sea protests. She said: "We need to divest from the infrastructure of the past, and invest in the infrastructure of the future." Klein spoke eloquently about the fact that up until now, the climate justice movement has suffered by being very much against things that were happening, and not necessarily being able to offer up the practicalities of what they are for. That is changing too. She is right in saying that what is happening to our planet is too important to leave to the environmental movement, and that alliances need to be forged everywhere to find solutions to save us from ourselves. Nonsense Nobody could be proud of Healy-Rae's performance in the chamber last week, shouting away to himself while talking absolute nonsense. He might feel like the big man with a platform, sticking the boot into Eamon Ryan - who actually knows what he's talking about on this issue - but perhaps, in time, Healy-Rae will come to realise that the cartoon version of a rural TD he is selling isn't in step or tune with those looking on. There was nothing to admire in Healy-Rae's bluster on climate change, even if you had voted for him and think the Healy-Raes are great value altogether. This was a new low, embarrassing posturing that served no one but wags on Twitter. "If we go back to the 11th and 12th centuries, this country was roasted out of it," Healy-Rae said, "and in the 13th, the 15th and the 16th centuries we were drowned out of it." He continued, "I believe that God above is in charge of the weather and that we here can't do anything about it. Indeed I will say to ye, this last government didn't do the things they were supposed to do, not to mind, not to mind to regulate or rectify the weather." By denying climate change, Healy-Rae is abandoning the interests of the very people he claims (repeatedly) to be representing. Denying climate change is anti-farming, anti-agriculture, anti-rural life, anti-reality. By denying climate change, Healy-Rae is saying that Kerry can go to hell in a hand basket, not to mention the rest of the country, and the world. You have to feel for the constituents of Kerry, especially farmers, who have someone who denies basic science representing them. Above anyone else, it is those who are in touch with the land who understand what is happening. Farmers aren't part of the problem, they are part of the solution. Irish cute hoorism is often applauded in politics. But in Healy-Rae's case his is devoid of tactical skill, and his particular brand of it - not as polished as Michael's - is stupidity dressed up as self-interest. Danny Healy-Rae is playing to his own stereotype, banking on the idea that nobody wants a change of tune and that if a Healy-Rae started banging a different kind of drum, the rhythm would throw the whole of Kerry off. Doing jigs outside Leinster House is one thing, and painting everyone outside The Kingdom as Gordon Gekkos ready to suck the life out of rural Ireland is another. But speaking as ignorantly as he did is something else altogether. It's easy to write off such Healy-Raeisms as colourful eejitry that make for good headlines on Waterford Whispers (although they outdid themselves with their story "Danny Healy-Rae suggests leaving Child of Prague under bush to combat climate change"). We can laugh, but perhaps Healy-Rae isn't putting this on. Maybe he does indeed not understand the difference between addressing climate change through policy that must be implemented in the aftermath of 2015 United Nations climate change conference , and in his own words a government tasked with "regulating" the weather. Difference Perhaps he doesn't understand the difference between "weather" - which is right now, and "climate" - how atmospheric conditions act longterm. Irish governments aren't in the business of cloud-bursting, but they are required to use policy to address the greatest threat to our planet. So does Healy-Rae care about the land of the farmers who vote for him? Will he choose prayer over policy when their fields are flooded? Or will he just posture in parliament and shake his fist at the sky? For a man who talks so much about the place he's from and the people who voted for him, denying the basic science of climate change has catastrophic consequences for his constituents. The people of Kerry deserve someone who understands environmental issues, because they will continue to be hugely impacted by those issues. \</doc>

ALMOST 200 nations are expected to strike a historic climate deal which will pave the way for a low-carbon future and limit global temperature rises to no more than 2C. Following 12 days and three nights of intense negotiations, the French presidency of the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) yesterday produced a final text which sets out ambitious targets to reduce emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. The deal commits developed nations to providing $100bn a year from 2020 to developing countries most at risk, with a mechanism to ramp-up investment. In a powerful speech, COP21 president and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the proposed accord was ambitious, fair, balanced and legally-binding, and urged nations to accept. "Our responsibility to history is immense. If we were to fail, how could we rebuild this hope?" he asked. "Success is built collectively. You will be deciding on a historic agreement. The world is holding its breath. It counts on all of us." The 'Paris Agreement', which will take effect from 2020, must be ratified by at least 55 parties, which account for at least 55pc of total global greenhouse gas emissions. It says that developed countries, which include Ireland, must play their part in moving to "sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production". Main points also include:  A commitment to keep average temperature rises to no more than 2C, with a goal to reduce these rises to 1.5C.  Emissions will peak "as soon as possible" and reach neutral levels in the second half of the century. This means emissions must be balanced by developing forests and other carbon sinks, which absorb greenhouse gases.  Countries will have to increase commitments, which will be reviewed every five years.  There is also a commitment to food security, indigenous people and gender, which were not in earlier drafts. Human rights are also referenced in the preamble.  Countries must provide "transparent" information on emission cuts delivered. This will be overseen in a "non-intrusive" manner.  Forestry is given also special mention, as is protecting all ecosystems including oceans. There is no reference to emissions from shipping and aviation, which account for some 8pc of global greenhouse gas emissions. There has also been criticism about clauses surrounding 'loss and damage', which involves mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable countries, including small island states. It also rules out compensating countries affected by climate change. However, it does commit to helping countries mitigate against damage, such as providing early warning systems and assisting in emergency preparedness. Friends of the Earth International said it was a "bad deal" and a "sham" and showed that developed countries had "totally erased their responsibilities" towards developing countries. But Greenpeace struck a more positive note, with executive director Kumi Naidoo saying it put the fossil fuel industry on the "wrong side of history". "There's much in the text that has been diluted and polluted by the people who despoil our planet, but it contains a new imperative to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. That single number, and the new goal of net zero emissions by the second half of this century, will cause consternation in the boardrooms of coal companies and the palaces of oil-exporting states," he said. "This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep." \</doc>

Simon Coveney, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, hs said he believes the Paris agreement on climate change is ambitious but will not require a review of Ireland's agri-food strategy. In Brussels, where is attending fish quota talks, Mr Coveney said a strategy was already being put in place by his department under the terms of the Government's new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill. COP21 talks were "not informed". Agricultural emissions had fallen by 10 per cent since 1990, whereas transport emissions had risen by 120 per cent, he said. "We are producing food more sustainably, and agriculture is often painted as a problem, when the facts don't bear this out." Mr Coveney said that the Government's Food Wise 2025 strategy had "sustainable production at its core". "The Paris agreement means that we just have to focus on what we said we would do - ensure food is produced sustainably. And ensure that afforestation of agricultural land gets recognition." Afforestation of farmland would reduce emissions by 15 per cent. \</doc>

CLIMATE change has been at the forefront of the news agenda both home and abroad over the last number of weeks. In this context the Wexford Lions Club will draw together a panel of speakers to discuss some key issues of climate change, with a focus on clarifying the state of play with Ireland's international obligations and to discuss what kinds of actions should be at the top of the government's priorities as we address this multi-faceted issue. The line-up of speakers is: Dr Padraic Larkin (Chair), Director of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (retired) - overview of climate science; George Hussey, Statistician Department of Environment Community and Local Government - COP21 and Ireland's international obligations; Professor John Fitzgerald, Chairperson Climate Change Advisory Council - The role of the CCAC in informing Irish Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Policy and future priorities and Ois\'edn Coghlan, Director Friends of the Earth Ireland - making the case for ambitious mitigation objectives in the context of a heightened awareness of the domestic need for adaptation funding. The presentations will be followed by a short question and answer session and debate. The event will take place in Claytyon Whites Hotel at 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 9. Admission is free but there will be a voluntary collection for the Wexford Lions Club. \</doc>

MAJOR traffic restrictions forcing thousands of French motorists out of their cars were in place across Paris as police locked down the conference venue for the UN climate change summit. Some 2,800 armed police were at the COP 21 (Conference of the Parties) site at Le Bourget north of the city, with only accredited delegates allowed enter the venue. Police armed with submachine guns were also stationed overnight at hotels located near the venue, conducting security sweeps and keeping traffic moving. The stringent measures were in place as almost 150 heads of state and government gathered for the first day of COP 21 . The French government said that "exceptional measures" were required following the Isil terrorist attacks on November 13 last which killed 130 people and injured hundreds. While the conference will continue as planned, NGOs and civil society groups have expressed annoyance that a series of planned climate marches in the French capital were cancelled due to security measures in the French HYPERLINK http://www.capital.No www.capital.No taxis or private cars were allowed at the site on Sunday or yesterday, with motorways also closed.

I keep hearing about a big climate change thing going on in Paris. What is going on? There is a big international conference that starts today, where 190 countries will try to reach agreement on stopping climate change. It has two short names so if you want to sound knowledgeable call it COP21 or CMP11, but its alternative name, the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, is easier to understand. The United Nations is behind it, and nearly every country in the world has said they will go. Ambitions are high given the goal is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change signed by all the nations of the world. That is not a small ask, and none of these big meetings ever tried to accomplish something as big as a universal agreement. Not climate change again. Why are we still talking about this? I thought we already had agreements on this? Climate change has been the subject of international discussions and negotiations for more than 20 years. There have been similar big meetings in Rio and Copenhagen and lots of smaller meetings, but the participants never manage to reach final agreements. Why not? Because having to do something about slowing or stopping climate change is going to cost really big money, and neither rich nor poor countries will want to spend money if they think it will harm their economies. It is easier - and cheaper - to do nothing . Given the meeting is taking place, I assume climate change is still happening? It certainly is. The World Meteorological Organisation only last week released data showing that 2015 is certain to go down as the warmest year on record. Ocean temperatures are at their highest, sea level rise continues apace as ice melts in Greenland, and glaciers disappear. This year we are likely to reach a milestone: average global temperatures will reach one degree above what they were in the pre-industrial era before humans began to release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in huge amounts. That doesn't seem like so much. What difference does one degree make? Scientific research indicates that we will cross a little understood threshold if average temperatures pass the two degree point. There are indications that it represents a tipping point where runaway climate change starts to happen. This will melt even more land ice at both poles and drive sea levels higher and higher. Countries such as the Maldives will be among the first to disappear beneath the waves and low-lying countries and coastal communities around the world will be in trouble. This includes Ireland, by the way. No one will escape. Why haven't we done anything about this if it is so bad? That is what these big international meetings are attempting to accomplish. Some have been better than others for getting things agreed. For example, the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997 was a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions but US president George W Bush decided the US would not accept it. The COP7 meeting in Marrakesh in 2001 brought in rules for bringing the protocol into force. But some things do get accepted over time and limits are set. That two degrees above pre-industrial temperature has been accepted internationally as a limit above which we cannot go. The question is will countries do what is necessary to stay below this limit? Holding to two degrees by 2100 means greenhouse gas emissions will have to be cut from today's levels by 40-70 per cent. So what are they going to try to agree at COP21 ? This will have an impact in Ireland. Either we will have to produce more renewable energy - which some communities are resisting because of windmills - or we will have to look at large emissions sources such as agriculture and transport, which are contentious issues here. Who else is promising to do something? If everyone agrees and if everyone sticks to the reduction plan then scientists believe this will hold temperature increases to 2.7 to 3 degrees by 2100. This is above the magic 2 degrees set by s scientists but if countries do nothing then we could see temperature rises of 5 degrees. That 5 degree increase is about the same temperature difference between the temperatures we have now and the temperatures on the planet during the last ice age more than 12,000 years ago. How are poor countries going to do anything about this? There will be lots of money needed to change things. Developing countries lobbied to bring about change. They argued that they weren't the authors of this mess and that the rich countries who were should help pay to clean things up. The meeting in Copenhagen, COP15 in 2009, accepted the idea and contribution levels were set. The promise was that by 2020 rich countries would be contributing at least EUR 90 billion a year to help poorer countries. By 2014 the level of funding reached EUR 56 billion so there is still a way to go. So should we expect big things from COP21 ? The challenge ahead - to stop climate change by 2100 - would be no small thing and no one attending the meeting will be under any illusions about how difficult it will be to achieve consensus. Yet doing nothing is not an option. Failure to act pushes us into unknown territory with runaway climate change a real possibility. If this were to happen then no country can feel secure in the face of major alterations to climate. It is an outcome too horrible to contemplate. \</doc>

THIS week we continue with the second part of our Climate Change quiz, in the lead up to the gathering in Paris in early December of 190 countries, to agree a deal on emissions. In the past year two further indications of worrying trends were highlighted, outlining the simple fact that time is running out - it's time for world governments to get moving on a binding agreement. The World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million - possibly the highest it has been in several million years. The second indication came from the UK Met Office who indicated that global average temperatures are going to surpass one degree Celsius this year. This passes the half way mark towards two degrees which has been set as the upper limit to avoid. All this as we come to the end of 2015 which is likely to be confirmed as the warmest year on record globally. Here are the questions (answers below): 1. According to NASA data, how many of the top ten hottest years occurred in the past ten years? 2. How many kilograms of carbon dioxide are released from the burning of 3.8 litres (one US gallon) of petrol? 3. What does COP21 refer to? 4. When and where is the next international Climate Summit? 5. How many nations are meeting at the next Climate Summit? 6. At the next Climate Summit, efforts are being made to create a legally-binding treaty. What commitments have already been made? 7. On current emission trajectories, our planet will warm how many degrees in the next century? 8. Who recently said in New York at the U.N. General Assembly that the upcoming 2015 Climate Summit is the "last chance to save the planet"? 9. From 1800 to 2012, atmospheric CO2 increased by how much? 10. April 2014 was the first month that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere went above what level? ANSWERS 1. Nine 2. Just over 9kg. This seems counter-intuitive because the quantity of petrol only weighs 2.7kg, but when it is burned it combines with oxygen molecules in the surrounding air, resulting in a greater weight of carbon being produced. 3. Conference of Parties meeting for the 21st time 4. Paris, December 2015 5. About 190 6. Known as INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) every country coming to the Paris 2015 Climate Summit ( COP21 ) is supposed to have one on the table. The U.S. will cut its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2025; China will lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 - 65 percent from 2005 levels; the E.U. will cut is emissions by 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030; and Australia will implement an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. 7. 7. 5 degrees. That may not sound like a big difference and day to day it isn't, but we are talking about annual averages. For perspective, the temperature difference between today's world and the last ice age was about 5 degrees (colder obviously)! 8. French President, Francois Hollande 9. 40 percent. Half of this increase in CO2 has been since 1970. The amount of methane, a much stronger greenhouse gas, has increased 150 percent! 10. 400 ppb. This is the highest concentration of CO2 the atmosphere has held in 800,000 years-and possibly in 20 million years. Scientists say we must keep levels below 350 ppb if we are to keep the planet from warming less than 2 degrees, the generally accepted level to maintain a healthy planet. \</doc>

'It always seems impossible until it is done." Thus spoke French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, quoting another author of the impossible, Nelson Mandela, when announcing that a climate deal had been done. There are reasons for cautious optimism. The Paris agreement binds all countries to reduce their emissions for the first time. It sets highly ambitious objectives of keeping global temperature to "well below" 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels and of "pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C". There is an unimpeachable moral case for 1.5-degree target. Even at this level of warming, many small island states and countries such as Bangladesh will be inundated. Yet the tragic reality is that limiting warming to 2 degrees would require a herculean global effort and drastically reduced emissions by 2030. Going beyond this and trying to limit warming to "well below" 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees may require developed countries to reduce their emissions to zero by 2020. For this reason, most experts consider the lower-range targets almost unreachable. However, there was also an excellent political and strategic case for the EU and the US to call for this lower target. It allowed the developed world to make common cause with many of the world's most vulnerable. Very poor countries and small island states had been the primary advocates of the 1.5-degree target for years. The so-called "coalition of ambition" negotiating group that emerged was a primary driver of the strong agreement. The rising economies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa were noted holdouts against the 1.5 degrees, as were oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Importantly Brazil defected from the group in the final day of the talks. Greater efforts National pledges to take climate action are at the heart of the Paris agreement. But there is a contradiction here. As the text itself acknowledges, "much greater emission reduction efforts will be required" than is contained within current pledges. Where will this extra effort come from? The litmus test of this agreement was always the extent to which it could bind countries into a process of increasing pledge ambition over time. A robust "ratchet mechanism" was what the EU really wanted. The early drafts of the agreement had done little to reassure in this respect, but the final text delivers. A "facilitative dialogue" will take place in 2018 to review collective efforts in light of the new long-term goal. This is as early as could have been expected. Every country must communicate a new pledge by 2020 and every five years thereafter. Crucially each pledge must be "a progression" and "as ambitious as possible". Pledges tend to use inconsistent and messy language, which makes understanding and comparing them challenging. This problem would not appear to have been fully resolved. But will pledges be implemented or will climate fall off the agenda as soon as leaders return home? History tells us that grandiose plan after grandiose plan for decarbonisation are shelved, generally for fear of alienating one or other special interest group. While parties are required to pursue domestic mitigation in line with their pledges, the international community has few tools at its disposal to intervene in national affairs. The text states that efforts to ensure transparency on national implementation will be "facilitative, non-intransitive and non-punitive", while respecting national sovereignty. It is clear that nation states, not the UN, are in the driving seat. Parties to the agreement must try and achieve a "peak" in emissions "as soon as possible". In a positive for Ireland, countries can use "sinks" such as forestry to balance emissions from other sources. Developed countries are required to take the lead on reducing emissions, but developing countries are also required to eventually move to emissions peaking and reduction "in the light of different national circumstances". This is key to reassuring these countries that their stage in the developmental pathway will be respected. Putting money on the table was also important. Developed countries have reiterated their commitment to mobilise EUR 100 billion to support the actions for developing countries in the period to 2020, and this commitment was extended to 2025. Beyond 2025, further finance will be provided "with a floor" of EUR 100 billion. Investment plans These are just some of the headlines from the agreement. The big question is how it will affect investor sentiment and the investment plans of countries and companies. Will it spur the development of new technologies and the deployment of low-carbon technologies we have already? The jury is out. Whatever we do now, the world is on a pathway for a lot of climate pain, as recent flooding events in the UK and Ireland demonstrate. It is to be hoped this agreement will do enough to prevent the most disastrous futures from becoming reality, but it is only a first step.

Ireland spends almost 200 times more on fossil fuel subsidies than it plans to contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund, a ratio tha is much worse than other developed countries, according to data from clean energy campaigners. New analysis released at the COP21 climate change conference shows that G7 countries along with Australia spend on average 40 times more on subsidies for fossil fuel production than they plan to contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund. The Government has to date pledged EUR 2 million to the fund, which is aimed at ameliorating the worst effects of climate change in developing countries. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly said this week he planned to seek Cabinet approval for an increase in this allocation. France has the lowest ratio of subsidies to pledged funding at 6:1 while Australia has the highest at 113:1. Ireland was not included in the study but Friends of the Earth estimates that the fossil fuel industry here benefits from about EUR 386 million annually in subsidies. This figure is made up of the share of the public service obligation (PSO) levy allocated to subsidising peat and securing gas supply, totalling EUR 169.2 million this year, combined with fuel allowance payments to low-income households of about EUR 217 million annually. The PSO levy is a charge paid by all domestic electricity customers to support domestic energy supply. Residential customers pay EUR 5.01 a month excluding VAT, a sum that is itemised on electricity bills. Kate Ruddock, policy and campaigns manager at Friends of the Earth, said fuel allowance payments were regarded in other European states as a fossil fuel subsidy, although she acknowledged that different methodologies could be used in different studies. European average A 2013 IMF study showed subsidies to the oil, gas and coal industries in Ireland as a proportion of government revenue were close to the European average but well below that of Australia and the US. Concern over the role of the fuel allowance as a fossil fuel subsidy is shared by the Society of St Vincent de Paul, whose head of social justice, John-Mark McCafferty, said there was a need to move towards "sustainable and affordable energy". While the organisation wished to ensure that people on low incomes were warm in their homes, "fuel subsidies can't stay as they are in the post- COP21 world". Money would be better spent on insulation and retrofitting, he said. The study of G7 nations, compiled by Oil Change International (OCI) and Climate Action Network (Can) Europe, shows that Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US together hand out about $80 billion (EUR 74 billion) a year in public support for fossil fuels, while their total pledges to the climate fund only amount to $2 billion per year. 'Crying poor' OCI senior campaigner Alex Doukas accused rich countries of "crying poor" on climate finance while paying billions to fossil fuel industries. In better news for Ireland yesterday, the country ranked in 12th place in a survey of the climate change performance of almost 60 countries worldwide, released by Germanwatch and Can Europe. Given that the first three places are vacant, because none of the countries surveyed are said to be doing enough to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland's position is effectively ninth place on the list. Although European countries still rank high, profiting from their early start in development of climate policies, the EU now "risks falling behind" as other countries "invest in renewable energy on a massive scale", the authors say. \</doc>

Can powerful words, can rhetoric, really make a difference to difficult political problems where opposing positions have become entrenched? I think history tells us that the answer is, sometimes; and so I will be joining countless others in listening to every word of the two major speeches which Pope Francis will be making this week in the United States. The Pope is going to address a joint session of the US Congress in Washington tomorrow - the first Pontiff to do so - and the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York on Friday, and both these orations are likely to contain material that may upset some of his American hosts, not least those on the Republican Right. For we already know what the principal concerns of this Argentinian Jesuit with a social conscience, formerly Father Jorge Bergoglio, are: the way capitalism is leaving the poor behind and the way the global environment is being trashed. This was made crystal clear in the remarkable papal encyclical published in June, Laudato Si, in which His Holiness's ferocious critique of consumerist values in particular raised eyebrows. Yet even more remarkable - if that were possible - was his radical reordering in Laudato Si of the Catholic Church's long-standing position on the environment. For centuries, Christianity - as opposed to Buddhism, say - had seen the natural world merely as resources to be exploited, backed by scriptural authority, including the famous Biblical verse of Genesis 1:28: "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth." The "ethic of dominion" that resulted, brutal and insensitive towards the Earth and its life, made the Church incapable of speaking with authority when the environmental crisis first arose. But in his encyclical Pope Francis explicitly rejected it and stated baldly that Genesis 1:28 no longer represented the Church's position. It was an astonishing aboutface. In future the Church was to champion the stewardship of the increasingly vulnerable, increasingly polluted planet. Claiming global moral leadership on the environment, which is what in effect the Pope did three months ago, is a move of immense resonance if you lead a religion of 1.2 billion adherents. But what may be its practical effect? The question arises because, in one or both of his speeches, the Pontiff will certainly address the principal environmental problem facing the word: can the international community reach an agreement on halting global warming at the forthcoming UN climate change conference in Paris in December? What you might call the "mood music" in advance of the conference (known in the jargon as COP21 ) is fairly good. For example, the two biggest carbon dioxide emitters - China and the US - are already broadly in agreement about cutting emissions, and President Obama is committed to a deal. But it is a different story in the actual pre-conference negotiations, the last session of which has just ended; they are pretty deeply bogged down. It is enormously, difficult. But it isn't impossible. What is needed is some sort of immense impetus to all the countries of the world so that governments may relax intransigent positions and tell their negotiators to reach agreement in Paris at all costs - otherwise the chance of a deal at COP21 will vanish. Could Pope Francis, in his self-appointed new role as global environment champion, provide such an impetus in what he says in Washington and in New York this week? Let's fervently hope so, for it's hard to see where else it may come from. \</doc>

A total of 175 countries have signed the Paris climate agreement at the United Nations, a record for a one-day signing of an international accord, the UN said. French President Francois Hollande was the first leader to sign the agreement, sitting at a special table set up in the UN General Assembly, he put his signature to the historic accord. He was quickly followed by the leader of the Marshall Islands. The moment in which @fhollande signs the #ParisAgreement as 1st country rep to do so. Well done, France! @ COP21 pic.twitter.com/pB9p27mabY  UN Climate Action (@UNFCCC) April 22, 2016 "This is a moment in history," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the opening of the formal ceremony at the UN General Assembly. The agreement commits countries to cut global greenhouse gas emissions and slow the warming of the planet to just 2 degrees, or 1.5 degrees if possible. 196 nations were party to the talks in Paris. The previous record was set in 1982 when 119 countries signed the Law of the Sea Convention. However, signing up to the landmark deal, on Earth Day, is just the first step - countries must then ratify its contents within national policies. 15 countries, mostly small-island states, have already ratified the agreement on combating global warming. \</doc>

The COP21 UN climate conference will begin on Monday amid uncertainty about the content of the final agreement, and nervousness over security in the aftermath of jihadist attacks that killed 130 people in Paris. But for Nicolas Hulot, President Fran\'e7ois Hollande's special envoy for the climate and one of the chief organisers, the gathering of 150 world leaders cannot be a failure. "This mobilisation is unprecedented in world history," Hulot told the Anglo-American Press Association. An environmental activist for more than 30 years, he says "The real question is will it be half a success, a full success or an absolute success." Hulot's yardsticks for measuring the success of the conference are: the strength of the commitment to limit global warming to 2 degrees this century; finance to help the developing world adapt to climate change, and a move towards universal carbon pricing. The World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva reported this week that the symbolic threshold of a 1 degree rise in temperatures since pre-industrial times will be crossed this year. If temperatures rise more than 2 degrees, Hulot says, it will be irreversible. The commitments made in Paris will be insufficient to secure the 2-degree goal. "The important things is that we put in place procedures that put us on a trajectory to 2 degrees," Hulot says. That is why France insists on a review process demanding periodic and ever-greater commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions. Actions not words Hulot's second criterion for success is "a real moment of solidarity, not just words, with countries who are victims of climate change". The necessity of helping the developing world adapt is much more present than in past conferences, he says. A promised $100 billion (EUR 94 billion) annual fund for this purpose has now reached about $85 billion, but Hulot believes $100 billion should be the minimum. It should begin before the Paris accord enters into force in 2020, and continue afterwards. Hulot pleads for "unorthodox" or "innovative" finance to fund adaptation, such as special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund, a tax on financial transactions or redistribution of a global carbon tax. COP21 does not make a commitment to a "carbon corridor" within which governments choose their carbon taxes, "the chances of tipping towards a low-carbon economy will be compromised". The draft accord that was drawn up by negotiators in Bonn still contains 1,200 sets of brackets comprised of multiple options, all of which will have to be resolved during the two-week conference. The 2-degree limit, periodic reviews, adaptation and carbon pricing are all in brackets. The other most important issues, according to Hulot's Foundation for Man and Nature, are damages and loss for those countries most affected by climate change, and whether the agreement will be legally binding. Hollande says it must be; US president Barack Obama, who faces opposition from climate sceptics in Congress, says it cannot be. Hulot regrets that there will be no provision to punish countries who fail to keep their commitments. "Some countries object to intrusions into national sovereignty," he explains. He is counting on peer pressure to hold them to their word, because "if anyone cheats, the entire world will pay for it". There has been some criticism of the fact that big polluters such as airlines, gas, electricity and oil companies are co-sponsors of the conference. "Economic actors have understood the question is no longer if we are going to leave fossil energies behind, but and how quickly," Hulot says. He believes it's impossible for big business to engage in "green-washing" - that is to say hide behind an environment-friendly image while continuing to pollute. "In a world where everything is visible, those who would attempt a travesty of reality, to paint themselves green when they're not, would be denounced instantly." Hulot points out the "incoherence" of the world's governments massively subsidising hydrocarbons while professing to want to diminish carbon emissions. "You see the difficulty of raising $100 billion for the developing world, while the developed world spends $450 billion on exemptions and tax breaks for fossil fuels," he says. "According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund, the cost of health and environmental consequences is more than $4,000 billion a year. So you're spending $450 billion to amplify a phenomenon that costs you more than $4,000 billion." All outdoor events for the conference were cancelled in the wake of the November 13th attacks. Hulot's foundation had planned to participate in a march on Sunday. Disappointed as he is, he says, "There were excellent reasons to cancel it . . . Everyone understands that it's impossible to ensure security . . .The fact that the COP is being maintained is very courageous on the part of the French authorities." Those who planned to march in Paris have started "march4me" campaign on the internet, so that volunteers march on their behalf throughout the world. They are also distributing green hearts for citizens to stick on windshields or wear on their clothing. Hulot is already thinking about what happens after COP21 . "International law is not adapted to environmental crimes," he says. His remedy? To integrate the concept of "ecocide". He would also like to see "the establishment of an international organisation to manage the world's common property - food resources, natural resources, the equilibrium of the ecosystem." Next step COP22 will take place a year from now in Morocco. Five-year reviews are likely. Are we facing a wearying and endless succession of conferences? "Things will go faster," Hulot promises. "Once we have changed scale, provoked carbon disinvestment and found financing, pension funds will understand they're better off placing assets in the low carbon economy. It can accelerate. "Paris is undeniably the start," Hulot concludes. "There will be a before and an after Paris. The only remaining question is: will it go fast enough?" \</doc>

US President Barack Obama joined French leader Francois Hollande to pay respects to the victims of the Paris attacks at the Bataclan concert hall early this morning, hours before the official opening of a UN climate conference. The two leaders, along with the mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, laid flowers at the music venue where 90 people were killed by jihadist gunmen and suicide bombers on 13 November. Helicopters flew overhead and police shut off the roads around the bloodiest scene of the Paris attacks, with security concerns running high as some 150 world leaders were due to descend on the French capital. The visit to the Bataclan was announced at the last minute after rallies ahead of the climate talks turned violent, as anti-capitalist protesters clashed with police. Police fired teargas at protesters, who pelted them with bottles and candles in Place de la Republique where a memorial had been set up for the 130 people killed in the Paris attacks. More than 200 people were detained. The clashes soured the mood before the start of the talks, known as COP21 , aimed at clinching the world's first universal climate deal to limit global greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also visited the Bataclan with his French counterpart, Manuel Valls, as did the premier of French-speaking Quebec, Philippe Couillard. \</doc>

LARA MARLOWE A bus carrying 35 Irish climate activists was stopped by French police in the port of Cherbourg for almost three hours yesterday. The activists, ranging in age from 20 to 72, are all involved in Stop Climate Chaos, an umbrella organisation comprising 28 environmental groups including Friends of the Earth, Tr\'f3caire, An Taisce, Concern and Christian Aid. They were travelling to Paris to take part in a protest organised to coincide with COP21 . As the bus disembarked from the ferry at 5.30pm (local time), it was stopped by police, who told the group they were not being admitted to France. Group members said they were also told they would be put on the ferry returning to Rosslare at 9pm last night. However, just before 8pm they were informed by police that they would be in fact be allowed to enter and continue on to Paris. No reason was given for the change of mind. State of emergency An officer with the French border police said the group had been stopped under French state-of-emergency legislation which bans demonstrations. Speaking before they bus had been let through, the officer said it was expected the group would be returned to Ireland as they were considered "likely to trouble public order in France". Asked how they knew about the group, the officer replied: "We were advised by the Irish authorities." \</doc>

Somewhere among the 50,000-plus crowd expected to attend the conclusion of the COP21 environment conference next Friday will be five enthusiastic, but a little tired, Irish cyclists. "We wanted to be in Paris but we didn't really want to fly over. I suppose it would be slightly hypocritical," said Anna-Mieke Bishop (25) who has organised the Pedal to Paris campaign with her sister Charlotte (29). People have volunteered couches via social media for them to sleep on along the 355km route. The group will document the six-day journey online, highlighting sustainable transport and other environmental themes. "Ireland is getting there but I don't feel there is a huge awareness and it's something we would love to work towards," said Ms Bishop. "We are raising awareness and hoping to inspire people to try and do things that might help the world more. "For that to happen it really needs people to mass together, whether it's protesting on the streets or contacting politicians." The Bishop sisters are being joined by Sean Prior (24) and brothers Nils (23) and Killian Sundermann (22), all committed to grassroots activism. The quintet set off on Sunday with "climate change themed bikes" . They can be followed at HYPERLINK http://www.facebook.com www.facebook.com / dublintopariscycle \</doc>

US President Barack Obama has said he will press ahead with a visit to Paris for climate talks, calling on world leaders to make a similar show of resolve. Speaking in Kuala Lumpar, Mr Obama said "I think it's absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business." World leaders will discuss plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels at the conference, which is to run until 11 December. Some 40,000 to 45,000 people are expected to attend the event, also dubbed COP21 , which will be held at Le Bourget, north of Paris, a conference management source said. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Monday that no foreign leaders had asked France to postpone the summit, a move he said would amount to "abdicating to the terrorists". \</doc>

Imagine the local average temperature increasing by 10 degrees in just a few decades. This would be an extraordinarily dangerous change, and is much larger than predicted by climate models simulating global warming. However, this kind of change has happened in the not-so-distant past on multiple occasions, demonstrating the fragile nature of the climate system in which we live and thrive. Unlike the current increase in global temperatures and sea level, which are owing to human induced greenhouse gas emissions, these past temperature swings were due to the natural variability of the planet's climate itself - but could happen again in the future. This will be outlined to the governments of 190 nations who will convene at COP21 - the United Nations Conference on Climate Change - next month. But how do we actually understand so much about the nature of past climate changes? The investigation of past climates is performed by combining our raw knowledge of the Earth with modern computational simulation and analysis. Since we have no thermometer readings - no observations - of past weather and climate, lifeless organic and inorganic matter found in ocean sediments and the ice caps are used as climate proxies for otherwise unknown climate details. A climate proxy is a recorder of past climate states. Well-known examples of these include the width of tree rings as indicators of good conditions for photosynthesis and plant growth, or the oxygen in ice cores as indicators of past temperatures. These planetary sources along with computer modelling today allow breakthroughs in our understanding of the changing climates of the geological past, and help us to understand the future. The extreme and abrupt 10-degree temperature changes mentioned above occurred during the last ice age - the period between 80,000 and 10,000 years ago. Humans occupied a lot of Eurasia during this time, and the sharp temperature shifts acted as an important driver of the migration of people across the northern hemisphere, throughout Europe and Asia, and to the Americas. What is startling about these abrupt climate changes is that, although not human induced, they were caused by relatively small changes, such as slight adjustments in the ice sheet height. For example, they did not require massive Arctic sea-ice melt, such as we now see annually. This sends a clear message to us that the climate system can respond massively to relatively small triggers, and could in the future drive massive human migrations which are likely to cause political instability and international tension on a scale comparable with, say, the past two world wars. Just think of the current European migration crisis. Multiply it by a thousand. So which particular past climates best represent our future?Well, it depends on which point in our future we consider - 50 years from now, 100 years, 500 years? If carbon emission rates remain as they are today, on an ever increasing trend, our future world will gradually experience steadily increasing degrees of warming which resemble past warm worlds, such as the Pliocene epoch (between 5.3 million years and 2.6 million years ago). However, unlike today, there were no human beings back then who had to deal with these massive changes.Moreover, we know that many past climate changes go hand in hand with mass extinction. The current ongoing mass extinction even has a name (the Holocene extinction), with some estimates outlining that the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year. Might the species homo sapiens eventually end up as such a statistic? The answer to that question depends highly on the outcome of COP21 , when international governments meet to hopefully grasp a major opportunity: for the first time in 20 years to hammer out a legally binding agreement on lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Let's hope they do so, because our current future pathway looks rather bleak indeed.

There is one conundrum related to climate change that has intrigued communications researchers for over 30 years. It can be summed up simply: given that climate change poses such a threat to our planet and species, why is it largely ignored by the media? Ignored, I can hear you snort? But you can't open a newspaper, browse social media or listen to the radio without hearing about melting glaciers or the upcoming Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) climate change conference in Paris. Research shows coverage of climate change peaks around international conferences and the release of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, this article being a case in point. Yet at other times it all but disappears, especially in Ireland. One survey shows it accounted for just 0.84 per cent of news coverage in The Irish Times between 1997 and 2010. My own research into Irish media coverage of climate change shows that, by comparison with Europe, coverage by the Irish national newspapers of climate change is low. In 2007, European coverage of climate change was almost three times that of coverage in Ireland, at 138.2 stories versus 47.5 per title per month. In the late-2009, early- 2010 period, European coverage had dipped to twice that of Ireland. Since then, the gap has widened again. Irish coverage The latest figures in my research show that by the end of last year, Irish coverage stood at 10.6 stories per title a month, compared to 58.4 in the rest of Europe. Why is the coverage of climate change so low? The answer is as complex as the question is simple. Some studies suggest the ideological orientation of news organisations themsleves inform their climate change coverage, so newspapers with a business- as-usual worldview are less likely to cover climate change in the first place, and when they do, they are less likely to advocate sweeping changes to markets and energy systems. Another theory is that environmental problems have a natural attention cycle among readers. The stages are: the pre-problem stage, the alarmed discovery and euphoric enthusiasm stage, the realising the cost of significant progress stage, and the gradual decline of interest stage. Climate change has been in the public eye for so long - it first gained widespread media coverage (as global warming) in 1988 - that it has probably gone through this attention cycle several times. A key reason for the media's relative lack of interest in climate change has to do with the nature of news itself. News likes unambiguous, discrete events, straightforward, one- off happenings rather than long-term social trends. And the media also likes negative news. Conflict and tragedy always make for good copy. News values Climate change struggles to meet many of these news values. Yes, climate change is generally bad news: more violent storms, flooding, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, destruction of ecosystems and dangerous temperature increases. But the very nature of climate change makes it an inherently difficult subject for journalists to cover. People generally equate levels of media coverage of a given issue with its importance, so low levels of climate change coverage have consequences in society. The Paris climate change conference at the end of this month will, if previous experience is anything to go by, see a spike in media coverage of climate change. This is because a conference such at COP21 meets some of those news values discussed above. It is a contained event and so the media can make better sense of it. Coverage is likely to focus on the politics of the conference - winner or losers - rather than the substance of the debate or outcomes. However, the real challenge for the media will come after the delegates have left on December 12th. Will levels of media interest decline sharply like they did after the last major climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009?

We don't want to get you too excited but this could be the new Volkswagen Microbus. VW has been threatening for more than two decades to sidestep the traditional Transporter van and bring out a retro-styled MPV that pays homage to the classic "Splittie" Type 2 van of the 1950s, and this could be it. It's a still-heavily-cloaked concept that will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January. Yes, while the rest of the motoring world converges for a traditional motor show in Detroit, VW plans to woo trend-setting tech heads at the CES, a strategy which has worked well for sister brand Audi in the past. Revolutionary There is no confirmation yet as to the exact style of the car and it's quite possible that it could turn out to be a more US-friendly SUV or crossover concept but we do know that it's both electric and potentially revolutionary in that respect. In the wake of the "dieselgate" saga, VW has promised to lean much more heavily on electric and hybrid car development and hot on the heels of the COP21 Paris climate accord, this could be a very good time for Volkswagen to be seen to be concentrating on battery cars. The concept "marks the beginning of a new era of affordable long-distance electromobility and it will demonstrate the benefits to the customer that VW will be able to deliver in the near future . . ." \</doc>

\£6 I don't always see eye to eye with Ian O' Doherty's points of view but I largely agree with his article in the Irish Independent, December 2, about the COP21 conference of world leaders held in Paris. Anyone who holds views contrary to the populist portrayal and hype about climate change - specifically global warming and CO2 emissions - is almost demonised. But as Mary Lou McDonnell would say, riddle me this: long before the advent of the motor car, industrialisation or intensive agriculture we had many ice ages and periods of global warming. For instance, during the Viking period (AD 1000) the earth was experiencing an episode of climate warming higher than that of the present time and during the "Little Ice Age" (1500-1700) the average temperature was two degrees lower than it is at present. We have been measuring CO2 in the atmosphere for 57 years, an infinitesimally small amount of time in the history of the earth's almost five billion years existence to conclude that human activity is the overwhelming cause of climatic changes. While not denying that modern human endeavour is increasing CO2 emissions, a far more plausible reason for climate change is related to solar activity, volcanic activity and the ocean currents. These variants have been around from the very beginning. It may be cold comfort but the facts point to the earth cooling rather than warming in the longer term, as interglacial periods have always been much shorter than the ice ages.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said his country would seek a "pre-agreement" for a UN climate deal as early as October, ahead of a year-end conference in Paris. "The goal is for us to reach a pre-agreement as early as October" in negotiations for a pact to tackle climate change, Fabius told a fresh round of climate talks in Bonn. To spur progress, Fabius said he would organise ministerial-level meetings on July 20-21 and September 7. He did not say which countries would attend. The Paris conference, from 30 November to 11 December, is intended to seal a historic agreement to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels. At the core of the planned agreement are national commitments to reduce levels of greenhouse gases blamed for damaging Earth's delicate climate system. But many areas of the accord remain to be negotiated. They include reviews of progress to ensure the planet stays on a two degrees C trajectory, the legal status of the agreement and finance for poor countries most exposed to climate impacts. Mr Fabius, in a speech at the start of an 11-day round of 195-country talks, said it was essential to lock in consensus before the Paris conference. "You know better than anyone that climate negotiations can be complex," he said. "It's not by waiting to the final minute of COP 21 that we will be able to prepare and obtain the ambitious and balanced agreement that we need." COP 21 is the name in UN climate jargon for the 21st Conference of the Parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Mr Fabius's words referenced the fraught outcome of the 2009 UN climate summit, which almost collapsed when leaders jetted in, expecting to bless a treaty, but instead encountered deadlock. \</doc>

COP21 opens in Paris on Monday with much higher expectations and hopes than the previous global effort in Copenhagen six years ago. COP stands for Conference of Parties and refers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Get used to the alphabet soup of acronyms: there will be a lot between now and December 11th. The ambition is extraordinary and almost unachievable. It is to get all 196 countries in the United Nations to agree to put measures in place in their own countries with the aim of confining increases in global temperatures to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. So far, 160 countries have signed pledges setting out what they intend to do. Some are conservative, others ambitious but achievable. On Monday many world leaders will gather in Paris for a leaders' day. With memories of the recent barbarity in the French capital, it is expected that that awful Friday will be marked in a formal way. Late on Monday Taoiseach Enda Kenny will set out Ireland's position on climate change to the conference. Reduce emissions Ireland will not go to the conference with a unique position. The European Union has submitted its plan and Ireland is a party to this. It commits the EU to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030. The issue of climate justice is never far away from COP conferences. There are low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean particularly vulnerable to being wiped out by flooding if global temperatures rise. There are other developing countries which do not have the resources to build the infrastructure to mitigate against climate change, or to adapt to its impact. To achieve equality, there has to be some transfer of either funding, technology or infrastructure from richer (mostly western) countries to these poorer countries. Burden Ireland is fully supportive of the EU position. Its share of that 40 per cent reduction will be determined during negotiations in Brussels in 2016. Obviously, the Government will be arguing that Ireland's proportion of that burden should be fair and equitable (ie, lower than 40 per cent). Ireland's Achilles' heel in this regard is agriculture, which comprises 45 per cent of the country's emissions (outside the manufacturing and power industries, which are included in the emissions trading scheme). When the Taoiseach gets up to speak on Monday, he will also be able to say that Ireland is one of the relatively small group of countries that has passed climate change legislation - the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill has just finished its passage through the D\'e1il. It attracted some controversy for not including specific long-term target but recent amendments have strengthened the law. In particular, a late amendment included a specific and explicit commitment to climate justice - an important concession. Negotiations Over the fortnight of talks, senior officials from the Department of the Environment will form part of the wider EU team in the negotiations. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly will arrive for the second week of negotiations and give political leadership to the team. Officials say that success would be "an ambitious legally binding agreement in Paris that ensure that all parties will participate in the global effort to combat climate change". A rise of more than 2 per cent in average global temperatures or more is not just an abstract concept. An Environmental Research Centre Report in 2006 summarised potential vulnerability for Ireland. This included a sea level rise; an increase in river flooding; loss of coastal habitats; increased incidences of coastal flooding; increased frequency of forest fires and pest infection; changes in distribution of plants and animals as well as more intense cyclonic and extreme precipitation events. That is why a successful outcome of COP21 is seen as urgent and necessary. \</doc>

RUSSIAN President Vladimir Putin is beginning to realise the limits of his military intervention in Syria and ultimately will join the US and other nations to help end the country's civil war and fight Isil, US President Barack Obama said yesterday. Since entering the Syrian conflict on September 30, Russian forces have accomplished little while suffering both military and civilian casualties, Mr Obama said at a news conference in Paris. He cited the Russian passenger plane that was brought down in Egypt shortly after Mr Putin's Syrian intervention, in an attack claimed by Isil, and a Russian military jet that was shot down by Turkish forces last week. "I think Mr Putin understands that with Afghanistan fresh in the memory, for him to simply get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralysing civil conflict is not the outcome that he's looking for," Mr Obama said. Mr Obama said that talks in Vienna among international diplomats, including Russia, to enact a ceasefire in Syria are "moving forward steadily." Russia and the US remain at loggerheads, however, over the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally who Putin is attempting to reinforce with his intervention in the war. The US insists that Assad cannot remain as the nation's leader in any political resolution of the conflict. Mr Putin also accused Turkey of secretly purchasing oil from Isil, and claimed that the decision to shoot down a Russian warplane last week was motivated by the desire to protect the flow of oil from the terrorist group. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, denied the allegations and said he would resign if it could be proved that Turkey had bought oil from Isil. Turkey and Russia have been engaged in a bitter war of words since Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border on November 24. Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan traded accusations as they took their respective turns at the podium at the summit on climate change in Paris. "We have every reason to think that the decision to shoot down our plane was dictated by the desire to protect the oil supply lines to Turkish territory," said Mr Putin. "We have received additional information which unfortunately confirms that this oil, produced in areas controlled by Isil and other terrorist organisations, is transported on an industrial scale to Turkey." The Russian president also refused to meet Mr Erdogan while both men are in Paris, and Moscow announced punitive steps including banning fruit and vegetable imports from Turkey. Mr Erdogan, for his part, warned Russia not to "play with fire" in Syria. "Mr Putin says he who applies a double-standard to terrorism plays with fire," he said on Monday. "I completely agree with that. Supporting state terrorism in Syria, which has claimed 380,000 lives, is playing with fire." Mr Erdogan has refused to apologise for the shooting down of the Russian jet, though he said on Saturday that he was "saddened" that it had taken place. That was insufficient for Moscow, which denies that the plane violated Turkish airspace and demands a formal apology. Turkey claims the jet, which had just completed a bombing mission over Syria, had entered its airspace and was given a series of warnings before being shot down. The US State Department announced on Monday that its analysis supports the Turkish version of events. Mr Obama has called on Turkey and Russia to reduce tensions over the downing of the Russian jet. After meeting with Mr Erdogan in Paris, Mr Obama reiterated America's support for "Turkey's right to defend itself and its airspace". But he added that Russia and Turkey should "de-escalate" tensions over the incident. Russian leader Vladimir Putin accused Turkey of secretly buying oil from Isil, while Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied the allegations \</doc>

When asked what is at stake in next December's COP 21 conference on global warming, Nicolas Hulot quotes a participant at a recent climate change gathering in Morocco. "In Paris, you will decide who will live or die," the woman told Hulot, who is French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande's special envoy for the protection of the planet. The UN's 21st conference on climate change will take place in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. The French government has declared it a Grande cause nationale and expects to receive 47,000 people at the conference centre at Le Bourget. The Paris gathering has raised hopes that world leaders will at last make a serious move towards a de-carbonised world. They've set themselves the goal of limiting the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2 degrees in this century. To do this, they would have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 70 per cent over the next 35 years. The other chief goal of COP 21 is to secure financing for the Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to provide $100 billion (EUR 89.4 billion) annually to help developing countries adapt to climate change. If carbon emissions continue unchecked, average temperatures could increase by 4.8 degrees in this century, says the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The level of the world's oceans could rise by up to 98cm. French scientist Jean Jouzel, a co-laureate of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change, outlined the impact of unchecked global warming at a June 4th seminar of the Economic, Social and Environmental council (CESE) in Paris. "All the red lights are flashing," Jouzel said. Effects of global warming include acidification of oceans, destruction of coral reefs, extreme weather, refugees from climate change, threats to food security, and biodiversity, and pollution. Despair, optimism The CESE seminar, Climate Change: Between Enduring and Taking Action , was attended by 1,600 people and addressed themes likely to be raised in December. Speakers alternated between despair that destruction of the planet has gone so far, so fast, and optimism that leaders may at last take action. "We are clearly headed for a darker future," said Dominique Bourg, a professor at the University of Lausanne. "We will need a miracle to reach the 2 degree target." A report submitted by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to negotiators in Bonn this week said there will be substantial risks to the environment if temperatures rise more than 1.5 degrees. "Between 1970 and 2010, half of the world's mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish disappeared," Bourg noted, quoting the World Wildlife Fund. Other speakers saw opportunity in the dire situation. "For the first time in the history of the world, there is a threat that concerns everyone, " Hulot said. "It's possible we'll pull together like a small, shipwrecked family in an infinite universe. This is our moment of truth. The only thing we recycle well are words and speeches; the same ones have been going round and round for 25 years." New awareness Asked why COP 21 "The US military now considers climate change to be a threat on a par with terrorism," he said. And in China, air pollution has reduced life expectancy by five years, putting huge pressure on the government. "It's unprecedented that Washington and Beijing will make commitments in Paris," Hulot said. The world doubles its consumption of energy every 25 years, said astro-physicist Hubert Reeves. "Today, each one of us uses the energy equivalent to 100 Roman slaves every day. Obviously, we will have to undergo major lifestyle changes. We won't take airplanes at the drop of a hat. "The important thing," he added, "is not to be optimistic or pessimistic, but to be determined." In the run-up to COP 21 , the engagement of the public, religious leaders and business community may be the greatest cause for optimism. Pope Francis, for example, is expected to publish an encyclical on "human ecology" at the end of June. At the Paris Business and Climate Summit last month, 25 worldwide business networks representing some 6.5 million companies appealed to policy-makers to enact carbon pricing and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, which amount to $550 billion (EUR 492 billion) annually. Tax carbon Six of Europe's biggest fossil fuel producers have asked to help out on a plan to tax carbon. They are, however, opposed by the two largest US oil producers, Chevron and ExxonMobil. The war on climate change has become fashionable. The French post office and railway companies boast of their green credentials. The French insurer Axa has promised to shed EUR 500 million in coal investments while tripling its green investments to EUR 3 billion. This week, home furnishing group Ikea said it would spend EUR 1 billion on wind power, solar energy and helping those most affected by global warming. \</doc>

ENDA KENNY IN PLEA FOR 'COMPREHENSIVE' CLIMATE CHANGE DEAL By Lesley-Anne McKeown, Press Association Delivering Ireland's national statement to the United Nations' convention, Mr Kenny will also urge agreement on limiting the rise in global temperatures and appeal for countries to make the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient future. He will also outline a policy framework aimed at tackling the spectrum of global environmental issues and set out Ireland's support for developing countries struggling to adapt to the effects of climate change and making the transition to low-carbon development. The 21st conference of the parties (known as Cop21 ) is due to open on Monday morning and negotiations are expected to run for two weeks. Central to an agreement will be efforts to limit global temperature increases to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Next year, individual targets for EU Member States will be agreed within the overall EU target. Last year Irish Aid provided 34 million euro to help countries in sub-Saharan Africa adapt to climate change and transition to low carbon development. On Sunday environmentalists staged demonstrations across Ireland demanding action. Hundreds of people took part in rallies in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Belfast. Stop Climate Chaos spokesman Oisin Coghlan said people needed leadership. ``(The Taoiseach) should be in no doubt that Ireland is mobilising for an energy revolution, one that leaves behind dirty fossil fuels and embraces clean, renewable, community-owned energy.'' Meanwhile James Orr, Friends Of The Earth Northern Ireland director, told protesters in Belfast that the Paris summit was the ``most decisive event in the history of humanity''. He said: ``Unless we act in 2016 to reverse global warming, we are staring into the face of global genocide.'' \</doc>

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit record levels during 2014 and will make the planet a more dangerous place for future generations, the World Meteorological Organisation has warned. The organisation yesterday released its 2014 report on concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases. It emphasised the major contribution to global warming made by water vapour in the air. Moisture in the air "amplifies warming", it says. A warmer atmosphere heated up by greenhouse gases means the air can hold more water vapour, causing further warming. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas - and the one that spends longest in the atmosphere - has now reached it highest level yet, with a global average of 397.7 parts per million (ppm). Peak Levels in the northern hemisphere peaked above 400ppm during spring 2014, a "symbolically significant" threshold, the organisation said. With the global average so close to this point already, it expects the average to exceed 400ppm as early as next year. With carbon dioxide levels so high, "we are moving into uncharted territory at a frightening speed", said the organisation's secretary general Michel Jarraud. His warning comes only weeks ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 21 , in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Questions remain as to whether the meeting will manage to deliver a unified international response to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, given the lack of progress made at previous conferences. Emissions While COP 21 Most of the warming effect comes from carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and, once released, all three remain in the atmosphere for a long time. Water vapour in the air is short-lived but its abundance helps to trap large amounts of heat while it is there. Further increases in carbon dioxide concentrations will lead to disproportionately high increases in warming from water vapour, the organisation said. Every year the report highlights rising levels for greenhouse gas concentrations and "every year we say that time is running out", said Mr Jarraud. \</doc>

Sir, - As an environmental NGO of long standing, advocating for our natural and built heritage since 1948, An Taisce welcomes the expanded Irish Times coverage of environmental issues, just in time for the pivotal COP21 climate change summit in Paris next month (Paddy Woodworth, "New environmental coverage in the Irish Times ", October 31st). However, we disagree that the focus of the "green" constituency to date has too often been too negative and too narrow. An Taisce, for example, runs many wide-ranging positive initiatives, such as the world-leading Green Schools programme, the Blue Flag, the National Spring Clean and regular nature walks which encourage citizens, particularly children, educators and communities to engage positively with nature. Rather, the message of environmental groups has too often been persistently portrayed as negative within the mainstream media as it inconveniently challenges the "business as usual" economic orthodoxy of growth without limits on a finite planet. Our recent successful court case in quashing the continued operation of Bord na M\'f3na's Edenderry power plant is a useful case in point, where a story about the destruction of our natural bogs, the disastrous policy of burning peat and transitioning to a post-fossil fuel future became widely reported as a story about short-term job losses. Lest we be in any doubt, two decades of sugar-coating environmental issues through the mantra of "sustainable development" has not slowed the unrelenting accelerating pace of anthropogenic climate change and global species extinction. Evoking a greater citizen engagement with the wonders of nature will prove a fruitless task unless we can also simultaneously politically reorient ourselves toward a positive future, a truer form of progress, which takes full account of the uneconomic costs of growth. - Yours, etc, JOHN HARNETT, Chairman, An Taisce, The Tailors' Hall, Back Lane, Dublin 8. \</doc>

The much-quoted motto in Paris since last month's attacks has been m\'eame pas peur , which roughly translates as "not a bit afraid". It's draped on the base of the magnificent statue of Marianne, symbolising the French republic, on the Place de la R\'e9publique, in the midst of countless floral tributes, candles, hand-written messages and posters signifying people's defiance of terrorism. But m\'eame pas peur joie de vivre . That's hardly surprising, given the enormity of what happened and the death toll wreaked by French-born jihadists. Restaurants, in particular, have been badly hit. During the COP21 climate summit, two of us visited Les Trois Crabes, a small, family-run Vietnamese place in the 12th arrondissement , after reading enthusiastic TripAdvisor reviews. Only one of the eight tables was occupied when we arrived, although a group of five came in later and took a table at the rear, next to the kitchen. The proprietor from Hanoi asked us where we were from and whether we we weren't afraid of being in Paris in the wake of the attacks. , we said. It was almost an issue of showing solidarit\'e9 . Had business been affected since? we asked. Yes, she said, it was down by about 70 per cent. Which is pretty devastating for any restaurant in a side-street location. She travels to work from Ivry-sur-Seine, on the southeastern outskirts of the city, and says she would open up the restaurant "even if there was only one customer". Quite heroic, really. Significantly, nearly three-quarters of the regular customers were from the neighbourhood; they were just not going out as much any more, after the carnage along Boulevard Voltaire. I've been to Paris at least 40 times since my first visit, when I was only 18. One thing I noticed this time was the appearance of French flags hanging from some windows or fluttering in flower-boxes. It's not widespread, but nevertheless remarkable because, previously, you'd only ever see the beautiful blue, white and red tricolour flying from public buildings or draped under the Arc de Triomphe. We had been to Paris the weekend before the attacks for a symposium on climate change, organised by the Skellig Foundation at the old Irish College, now the Centre Culturel Irlandais. Maeve Jennings, a good friend who used to work for Temple Bar Properties and is now a property consultant in Paris, said then that "people are waiting for something to happen" - some form of attack. We were dining out in Au Passage, a trendy restaurant on Passage Saint-S\'e9bastien, right behind the Bataclan Caf\'e9 and music venue, where 90 people were gunned down less than a week later. In rail stations, you could see heavily armed French soldiers with submachine guns, while CRS national police patrolled streets in the run-up to COP21 . In the Bois de Boulogne, a public notice read: "As part of the Vigipirate £ttack-alert' high-security plan now in force in the Paris region, the Jardin d'Acclimatation has put in place more stringent protective measures to guarantee your safety. Thus, before entering the Jardin, you will be subjected to a security inspection . . . We apologise for any inconvenience." During the climate summit at Le Bourget, some train drivers walked out in protest at inadequate security after a suspect parcel was found on one of the double-decker trains. It turned out to be harmless, but what if it had not been? As a result, only one out of every four trains on the line that serves Disneyland in Marne-la-Val\'e9e were running for a day. And yet, there is so much to celebrate in Paris. The city has the best public transport system anywhere in Europe. You rarely have to wait more than two minutes for a train on any of the 14 metro lines, or more than five minutes for the longer-distance RER. And while it's taking ages to renovate the fulcrum of Ch\'e2telet-Les Halles, I'm sure it will be lovely when it's finished. Whenever. I often think of GenDietrich von Choltitz, the last German military commander of Paris, who refused to obey Hitler's order to reduce the city to rubble in August 1944, as the Allied armies closed in.

Double-take A headline from the COP21 conference saying Nama was helping to keep carbon emissions down in developing countries elicited a double-take. Who knew the State's assets agency - currently embroiled in controversy over Project Eagle - was making such a mark on the global stage? Scrolling down through the text, however, it emerged the Nama in question was the National Appropriate Mitigation Actions. And, as far as we know, it is not being hounded by a shaggy-haired TD from Wexford. \</doc>

There are two major policy reasons for the current flooding - a failure of our planning policy over the past half-century and a policy failure in responding adequately to the threat of climate change over the last two decades. It is a bit ironic, therefore, to see politicians scrambling to show their concern for the latest victims of floods when much of the devastation could have been avoided by prompt political actions in the past. COP21 in Paris show the political attitude to long-term problems such as this remains the same: keep your head buried in the sand until you have no alternative. Flooding is a natural phenomenon and cannot be entirely avoided. However, what must surely add to the trauma of many of the victims is the thought that it might have been totally avoided if proper planning and development policies had been in place or implemented in some of the places recently flooded. Our planning and development system was formally put in place in 1963 with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act. Flooding was included in it as a non-compensatable reason for refusing a planning application. This meant if a local authority refused planning permission and cited the threat of flooding as a reason, the applicant had no grounds for claiming compensation for that refusal.The inclusion of this section shows there was an awareness of flooding as an issue for consideration in deciding planning applications. Engineering solutions Following this there is little evidence that flood risk was a major consideration in planning decisions until the late 1990s. In the interim the attitude to flooding seems to have been largely based on the belief that it could be managed by "engineering solutions". It is clear this ad hoc approach has led to flooding elsewhere in river catchments. Since the late 1990s there has been a growing recognition at "official" levels of national and local government of the problem and risk of flooding even if that is not always reflected at political levels. At least eight policy documents have been produced since 1997. Prior to 2004 the lack of definitive information on flood plains and areas at risk presented an added difficulty for planners who wanted to refuse zoning or planning in those areas. In many instances it was one person's word against another. As a result of the potential financial losses to landowners, local authorities and local representatives erred on the side of the landowner. National Flood Policy This changed in 2004 with the report of the Flood Policy Review Group led by the Office of Public Works. This gave definitive reliable information on areas at risk and led to the National Flood Policy. In 2009, section 28 of the 2000 Planning Act was used to issue guidelines on flood-risk management in planning. These guidelines are regarded as among the best in Europe and they are robustly policed by the Department of the Environment. This policing, sadly, is still essential as many local authorities seem to have learned little from past mistakes, judging by the number of times the Minister has had to intervene with local politicians and local authorities under section 31 of the 2000 Planning Act. The latter allows the Minister to issue directions to local authorities on their development plans. The power has been used about 30 times by various ministers in recent years. In many of these cases, ministers had to direct local authority members and officials to change their draft development plans because the guidelines on flood-risk management were being ignored. Some of the local authorities (among them Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Galway and Cork) feature prominently on the list of places with flooding problems currently. We now have a planning system and enforcement powers that can prevent a repeat of mistakes even if it is too late for many. The wider phenomenon of climate change and the effects it is having on our weather is a more recent issue. Places with little or no history of flooding are becoming victims of these changes. We were warned about this and urged to prepare flood defences nearly 20 years ago but little was invested until recent times. The OPW, despite the criticism levelled at it, is doing excellent work within the financial constraints imposed on it. There is evidence that those constraints are being lifted but, to ensure that 50 years from now we are not looking back at even greater disasters, politicians must live up to the fine words at COP21 and invest in the policies that they know will prevent such disasters.

International aviation and shipping have rightly been dubbed "the elephants in the room" at COP21 , and there is now a real danger they will escape yet again from any requirement to cut their prodigious - and growing - carbon emissions, just as they've done for the past 20 years. Galway-born Andrew Murphy, aviation specialist with the Brussels-based Transport & Environment lobby group, said the UN's objective of limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees would be "impossible unless we reduce emissions from these sectors". Aviation is responsible for 3 per cent of global carbon emissions, while shipping accounts for almost 3 per cent. Combined, they have an impact equal to Britain and Germany and are continuing to grow rapidly - up to 270 per cent by 2050. Despite these trends, not a cent in tax is paid worldwide on aviation fuel for commercial aircraft or fuel oil for container ships, passenger ferries or cruise liners. They are classified as "international bunker fuels" that cannot be attributed to any particular country and thus escape the tax net. Transport & Environment has called on COP21 delegates to include a "clear requirement" in Paris for the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to set realistic emissions reduction targets consistent with 1.5 to 2 degree objective and adopt measures to achieve them. Although the 1997 Kyoto Protocol mandated the ICAO and IMO to limit or reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping, neither body has yet done so. "In the 18 years since Kyoto, ICAO has failed to implement one single measure to limit international aviation emissions," Murphy said. Industry influence "The IMO did agree a design efficiency standard for new ships (EEDI) built from 2013 but it will take a generation to affect the global fleet and will merely limit the growth of shipping's carbon emissions, but not reduce them. Discussion on market-based measures has been on hold since 2011." While the ICAO and IMO talked, emissions from aviation and shipping increased 80 per cent between 1990 and 2010, compared to a 40 per cent increase for the rest of the global economy. "If this trend continues, it will undermine the efforts of countries and other economic sectors. "ICAO and IMO climate policies need a reset. While these organisations remain, for now, the appropriate venues to introduce measures, their complete lack of ambition, stemming largely from the overweening influence of industry in both bodies, must be addressed," according to Murphy. Both bodies were set up by the United Nations itself and nominally operate under its auspices. But they need to be required, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to adopt ambitious emissions reduction targets consistent with meeting the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees. Strong political message These targets, and measures to achieve them, must be subject to regular and transparent review by the UNFCCC. "The Paris agreement must send a strong political message to ICAO/IMO for them to start taking serious measures that would drastically increase their level of ambition," Murphy said. Referring to shipping, he pointed out that "the world's diminishing carbon budget means that a delay in reducing shipping emissions will require steeper emission reductions from this sector in later years, presenting a far bigger challenge to the industry which may then, in fact, impact world trade." According to research by EurActiv, one of the leading online media covering the EU, international aviation alone - largely the preserve of wealthier people - enjoys fossil fuel subsidies amounting to EUR 60 billion annually. Yet the impact of climate change will disproportionately affect the world's poorest. In a paper published last month, renowned economists Thomas Piketty and Lucas Chancel, of the Paris School of Economics, suggested a levy of EUR 20 per passenger for an economy air ticket and EUR 180 per passenger travelling in business class, with the proceeds going to climate aid for poorer countries. "We know that very few of the world's poor take flights", said James Nix, director of the Brussels-based Green Budget Europe and formerly of An Taisce. "Levying all flights will create a sustainable long-term fund for climate finance, providing an investment source which does not rely on ad-hoc year-to-year pledges". To head off such a grim scenario, the International Air Transport Association, which represents the airlines, has set itself the goals of achieving "carbon-neutral growth" from 2020 and halving emissions by 2050, compared to their 2005 levels - largely by switching from fossil-based aviation fuel to biofuels. \</doc>

Former president Mary Robinson has expressed sorrow at the "language of war" used by President Fran\'e7ois Hollande immediately after the November 13th Paris attacks. She has also called on Europe to plan for "circular migration", given that climate change would exacerbate forced displacement. She was speaking in Ballina, Co Mayo, where she hosted an international human rights lecture by Mozambican politician and humanitarian activist Gra\'e7a Machel. Mrs Robinson recalled that during her time as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, she had "pleaded" with the US administration of then president George W Bush to treat the 9/11 attacks as criminal acts against humanity. Referring to war "inflates those who cause these terrible killings" of civilians, she said. "It inflates them into being somehow warrior and [the concept] that being at war is not so bad, it's a status," she said at a press briefing. "And actually, if you say you are at war, human rights tend to be given much less attention." She noted that President Hollande's language had since "shifted slightly" to refer to the Paris attacks as "crimes". "It is very hard on young Muslims now in France, for example, because of the stigma of insecurity, whereas if we identify that there are radicalised young people, we understand some of the reasons for the radicalisation - but it doesn't excuse that activity." "Spirit of Paris" The attacks last January and in November had affected the "spirit of Paris", she noted, and there would be a lot of empathy with the French "because France for its own reasons first of all offered to host the COP21 summit". Mrs Robinson, who has flown to Paris to attend the UN climate change conference, expressed the hope there would be a commitment in an agreement to zero carbon emissions by 2050, with five-yearly reviews. Ms Machel, widow of former South African president Nelson Mandela and of former Mozambican president Samora Machel, spoke of the changing face of African women. \</doc>

If all coal-fired power plants in the pipeline were to be built, emissions from this sector would be 400 per cent higher in 2030 than what would be consistent with a two-degree pathway, according to new analysis released at COP21 . In many emerging economies, coal capacity is built to meet rapidly increasing electricity demand, while in the EU, new coal plants are mainly to replace existing capacity. Ireland's huge coal-fired power plant at Moneypoint, Co Clare, is now 40 years old. Pledges CAT looked at eight countries that plan to build more than 5GW of capacity: China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, the Philippines and Turkey, as well as the EU - nearly all of which have submitted climate pledges rated as "medium to inadequate". The estimated emissions impact of planned coal plants that have been announced and pre- permitted - ie not yet under construction - would be 3.5 gigatonnes, while cancelling these plants could lead to emissions reductions of two gigatonnes below current levels. Using updated Coal Swarm data, CAT revealed there were 2,440 planned coal plants around the world. These plants should be cancelled said Pieter Van Breevoort of environmental consultancy Ecofys. "Renewable energy and stricter pollution standards are making coal plants obsolete around the world, and the earlier a coal plant is taken out of the planning process, the less it will cost." Markus Hagemann of the New Climate Institute said the decreasing cost of renewable energy was likely to be a big factor. "It is unlikely that all of these planned coal plants are going to be built, especially when low-carbon alternatives are reaching price parity." If renewables take off as fast as is expected, he warned many of these planned coal plants could end up as "stranded assets". Not building them would be the cheapest option, he said. \</doc>

Green Party leader Eamon Ryan and Fianna F\'e1il sustainability spokesperson Barry Cowen TD discussed their respective parties' sustainable development policies at the 2015 Environment Ireland conference. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan and Fianna F\'e1il sustainability spokesman Barry Cowen TD took part in a panel discussion at the 2015 Environment Ireland conference, chaired by Irish Times' journalist Paddy Woodworth. The ensuing discussion allowed both politicians to debate their policies and views regarding Ireland's sustainable development priorities with attending delegates. In his opening remarks Ryan made it clear that our energy focus must change. Energy must switch to that of renewables. "For 40,000 years we were nomads, during which time mythology was the key driver behind mankind's rationale for living," he said. "Once agriculture rose to prominence, more settled communities became the norm with theology becoming the driver for cultural development. At around the same time communication went from script to print then went to ideology. This then led to the evolution of psychology in the 20th century." Ryan postulated that the current internet revolution, in tandem with the growing use of renewables will bring about a new global culture: one based on ecology. "Green thinking will be crucially important in this new world," he said. "The general public are angry with those politicians who try to serve up age old policies, which are not fit for purpose when it comes to meeting the sustainability challenges of the 21st century. The old conservativism is not working. Increasing numbers of people are becoming angry at the total lack of vision which the current government has when it comes to developing a sustainable future for Ireland.\~ "Green thinking is revolutionary. And the great hope, in this regard, is that a combination of digital and renewable energy technologies can be brought to bear in an interconnected way, thereby plotting a sustainable future for this country." Barry Cowen confirmed that everyone depends on the environment. "We need to use it, but it must not be lost to us," he said. "Politics is cyclical. We are currently at a crossroads, with regard to the advancement of energy policy in Ireland. And I recognise the great harm that can be done to the environment, if we get it wrong. The challenge of sustainability is not lost on Fianna F\'e1il. It is an issue that has already been reflected across a wide spectrum of our policies for the future. "The challenge of the environment straddles many government departments. But above all else, we need a clear and concise energy policy. One that's adds up financially while, at the same time, is wholly respectful of the need to maintain a sustainable environment. And I do not underestimate the scale of this challenge moving forward. Cowen refuted the suggestion that political parties do not see the issue of climate change as being of key importance and that Irish citizens have not been provided with clear policy options, where this matter is concerned. "The lack of binding targets with regard to climate change must be addressed," he said. "Fianna Fail is seeking to highlight this matter in very precise and effective terms. We need to get clear and binding targets built into government policy where greenhouse gases are concerned. And to do this we must look beyond the current legislation. The Green Party leader defended the actions taken by his party while in partnership government with Fianna F\'e1il. He pointed out that it is extremely difficult for a junior party in a coalition to effect major change across the entire spectrum of government activity. "Emissions reduced by 14 per cent during our years in government," said Ryan. "Admittedly, half of this was accounted for by the downturn in the economy. But the remainder was accounted for by government legislation."\~ Looking to the future Ryan said that policy makers must have the public fully on board when it comes to making decisions on Ireland's sustainable future. "And this must percolate right down to town, village and parish level. We need full public agreement on these matters that are of vital national interest. And everything is possible, public opinion is changing. The communications' revolution that is now taking place has the power to educate people more fully on their sustainability options for the future. And this is already happening. "Increasingly, the public recognise the benefits of green policies. But more than this, they also view sustainability as the only show in town. There is no Plan B. Taking the earth's resource without any recourse to maintaining their value for future generations has only one end point. And it's one that provides us with no future at all."\~ Commenting on the current fracking controversy, Barry Cowen said that the implementation of the technology is not compatible with the best interests of the Irish countryside. "And most members of the Fianna F\'e1il party feel this way. Our upcoming election manifesto will reflect this.\~ Cowen also pointed out that the world's dependence on oil must diminish. "The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference , taking place in Paris, will allow for a full and frank debate on this issue," he said. "Its clear objective will be to achieve a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world. And in this regard we must have India and the European Union fully on board. Eamon Ryan expressed the view that the world must become a zero carbon planet by 2050. "Oil is the most incredibly energy dense substance that is available to us. This is why it has become so entrenched at the very core of our economy and way of life. Renewable energy sources, however, are much more distributive in nature. This is why we must combine their development with a greater use of digital communication technologies. "All of this hinges on educating our young people properly. I was taken aback recently when finding out that questions on the anatomical structure of the earthworm still feature in Leaving Cert examination papers. I thought that we had left the 20th century behind us: but, seemingly, this is not the case. Both Cowen and Ryan agreed that D\'e1il members need to be more on top of what is happening at EU level. "So much of our national legislation is now based on agreements thrashed out in Brussels," stressed the Green party leader. "So it is crucially important for all our local politicians to get involved in the EU debate on sustainability at all levels." Ryan characterised Pope Francis' recent encyclical on the environment as a potential game changer where policies relating to global sustainability are concerned. "The upcoming Paris summit will be a turning point for the world," he said. "And the Pope's recent thoughts will form a fitting backdrop for the discussions that will take place amongst world leaders in a few weeks' time. "But, fundamentally, we need to make an evolutionary leap forward, where sustainability is concerned. This will involve putting a love of the environment at centre stage, with regard to everything that we do and we must be proactive. Doing nothing is not an option."\~ \</doc>

ITH 20,000 acres of land under water west of the Shannon, Taoiseach, Mr Kenny, was asked about our flood defences. W"We are required to set out the areas where action has to be taken remedially to deal with flooding, and there are 300 such locations. Clearly these can be quite complex, given the topography, the geography and the hydrological surveys that are necessary to be carried out," he explained helpfully. So once we sort out the "topography", "geography" and "hydrological surveys", we'll be grand. The people of Bandon are not greatly reassured. They have been waiting since 2010 for help, and with one month's rain to cope with in a two-day period, and more on the way, patience has been washed away. Simon Harris has pledged to have "shovels on the ground" by the middle of next year. Just as storms like 'Desmond' are given a name, pledges like that issued by the minister are also described in colourful terms, but they are not printable. As one business owner put it: "water has no mercy". There are many reasons why those hit by floods question Government commitments to deliver. Even when State relief is offered, businesses find that it is too difficult to draw down, and the process takes way too long. Only last week, Mr Kenny told the COP21 conference in Paris, that "big and small" had to take action to address climate change. He promised Ireland would play its part. But there was a caveat - as long as it didn't hamper growth in the agriculture sector. Mr Kenny's concern appears to be postdated until after 2020. Only then will the State be in a position to meet "aggressive targets" to reduce agri-emissions. But climate change is here and now. There may be nothing as unpredictable as the weather. Atmospheric disturbances will always be different, but there is nothing as predictable as State excuses. It's not credible to continually blame "abnormal" conditions which have long ceased to be so, as they repeat themselves every couple of years. \</doc>

T hasn't been declared but, with so much of the countryside inundated, we are rapidly facing a national emergency on flooding. What is so difficult for those whose lives are being destroyed is that promises made in the aftermath of the flooding of 2009 were washed away. They now find themselves stricken once again, and this time there is no insurance. Taoiseach Enda Kenny's advice last week for people to move to higher ground was maladroit. His ambivalence towards the UN COP21 summit on climate change in Paris, and his special pleading on his return, suggest a flippant regard for the scale of the challenges. Local interests can no longer take priority over national ones. Good governance is defined by getting things done. A central agency must be set in place to monitor water levels and flood management. The confusion created by too many competing agencies has led to dysfunction and inertia. Management of the Shannon has to be a priority. But all of the issues have to be addressed on a countrywide basis. Planning, irresponsible building on flood plains, poor drainage, failure to dredge rivers, have all been cited as contributory factors. The State must also put a fund in place to help those in areas where insurance is not available. The Coalition has not handled this crisis with either the resolve or sensitivity required. The stamp of authority has been missing. Leadership is defined by results, as opposed to good intentions. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that Government hopes of a return to power could ebb or flow depending on their response to these challenges. \</doc>

LREADY the small local acts of care and kindness since the floods hit the countryside have outstripped the mighty intentions of State and government. AWith so much land west of the Shannon and the midlands water-logged, nationally, we are seeing the harsh consequences of serial failures. The passage of time from as far back as Hurricane Charlie in the 1980s has merely served to strengthen the rural-urban divide. After the chaos left in the wake of "Charlie", in Dublin at least, immediate action was taken to strengthen the Dodder and Dargle river banks. Similarly, Fermoy and Clonmel - once flood blackspots - have been protected since defences were put in place. The devastation farming families and businesses are feeling around the country follows years of neglect by various governments that avoided introducing comprehensive winter action plans. Questions such as why the Shannon is not regularly dredged, or why so many different players are involved, need to be addressed. The destructive hand of climate change has also been key. The inability to come up with solutions in Paris at the COP21 conference underline how far we are from consensus internationally. Only one in four people canvassed in the EU believes they have personal responsibility for tackling it. But it is critical that the 150 heads of state gathered have more to offer the world than just hot air. As to our own dismal responses to date, one can not argue with the view of UCC geographer Dr Kieran Hickey: "The system for dealing with floods in this country is overly complex. There are too many competing agencies - often with different goals and strategies. And it is run by politicians who are only interested in the next election." The irresponsible re-routing of watercourses and poor shoring up of river banks has made matters considerably worse. We are reaping a bitter harvest for incoherent longterm planning in an era of unforgiving global warming which makes severe storms more frequent. A lack of planning and co-ordination between local councils, the OPW and central government is exacting a terrible price. Reputations should not be built on what one is going to do. \</doc>

A EUR 500,000 advertising campaign highlighting the benefits of wind energy is set to begin today. It will invoke former US president John F Kennedy's speech to the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1963 in which he said Ireland could become a country leading the way in the world. Entitled The Power to Power Ourselves , the campaign will highlight that 85 per cent of Irish energy is imported and that wind energy is a renewable source of energy that can reduce that figure. Billboards One billboard will be 85 per cent blank, while the rest of it will have the following message: "Just 15 per cent of this poster was printed as it was made using only energy produced entirely in Ireland. 85 per cent of our energy requirements are met through imports. Yet Ireland is surrounded by a clean and renewable resource that would vastly reduce imports to meet our energy needs, now and into the future." Fossil fuels Irish Wind Energy Association chief executive Kenneth Matthews said the campaign followed agreement at the Paris COP21 summit which mandated an end to fossil fuels by the end of the century. "We need to make sure there is a factual discussion around the energy situation that Ireland has at present and there are hard choices to be made," he said. He said a recent poll showed that most Irish people were not aware where the country's energy came from. He said that during high winds wind energy generated half the electricity in the country. "Recently we've seen a concerning escalation in false and misleading information about wind energy from some quarters," he said. "We're hoping this campaign will help create greater certainty while also instilling a sense of pride in what is one of Ireland's fastest-growing indigenous industries." \</doc>

The natural environment, the essential ground on which all our economic and cultural progress ultimately stands or falls, has barely been mentioned in the election campaign. It has taken an innovative social media campaign by an intern at An Taisce to draw even a little attention to what the Labour Party rightly describes in its manifesto as "the biggest single challenge facing humanity"; climate change. Yet the Taoiseach made a rousing speech to the UN's COP21 meeting on climate change in Paris last December. He called on leaders "to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability of generations of the future". He made a very different speech afterwards, pleading for Irish exceptionalism. He rejected any revision of the Government's programmes for expanding the beef and dairy sectors, which will significantly increase our greenhouse gas emissions. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly of the Labour Party backed him up energetically. This hardly equates to seriousness about the issue. Yet Fianna F\'e1il and Sinn F\'e9in have made no major challenge to this clash between rhetoric and policy. Neither have the Climate Bill nor the White Paper on Energy, for which the Government deserves some credit, featured in the campaign. Other critical environmental issues like flooding, uplands management, resources for conservation, damage to our peatlands and biodiversity loss have also been largely ignored. Some attribute this silence to the exclusion of the Green Party from TV debates. But we should not be dependent on a single party on such crucial questions. It is said that these topics are too technical, or too controversial, or both, for politicians to raise them at election time; that the electorate is averse to long-term issues. But the impact of environmental damage is no distant issue. We urgently need politicians to take into account the environmental costs - and benefits - of all economic and social policies. The treatment of the environment by most parties in the campaign represents a disturbingly symptomatic failure of political vision and leadership. \</doc>

Officials responsible for the COP 21 United Nations conference on climate change are attempting to inject a new sense of urgency into negotiations, in the hope of concluding a "global and ambitious" agreement during the Paris conference, which takes place from November 30th to December 11th. "There are fewer than 100 days left," the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference at the French foreign ministry. "We have only 10 real negotiating days. I sincerely hope negotiators will look beyond national interests." Negotiations by the ADP (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) are to resume, in Bonn, on August 31st. An earlier conference in Durban set December as the final deadline for an agreement to limit the rise in the world's temperature to 2 degrees. Insufficient Fifty-six countries responsible for two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas emissions have submitted their INDCs (intended nationally determined contributions). Mr Ban told Le Monde newspaper the "level of ambition" demonstrated by the 56 commitments was insufficient to limit the rise in temperature to 2 degrees. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who will preside over COP 21 , stood beside Mr Ban. (COP stands for the Conference of the Parties to an international convention.) The run-up to the conference is a "race against the clock", Mr Fabius said repeatedly. Greenhouse gas emissions are "the root of the problem" because some remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years. "We will never make up the time we lose," Mr Fabius said. "If we don't start soon, we can no longer win this race. There is no plan B. There is no planet B. By continuing to accumulate greenhouse gases, we will make it impossible to resolve the problem." Climate negotiations began in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. "We have negotiated and discussed without taking concrete action for 23 years," Mr Ban said. "This has taken too much time," said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the Peruvian environment minister who presided over COP 20 in Lima. "We have talked enough to take a decision." The climate debate, particularly the ADP negotiations, are bogged down in acronyms and process. Mr Fabius said the ADP must produce a draft agreement closer to 20 pages than the present 85. Mr Pulgar-Vidal said the climate conference must surpass formal process: "It is about our ability to take decisions." Mr Ban's incomprehensible French and Mr Pulgar-Vidal's challenging English seemed a metaphor for the negotiations. Mr Pulgar-Vidal promised COP 21 would not be a spectacular failure, like the 2009 COP 15 in Copenhagen, because: "We are in a very different process. We are building consensus based on confidence, working from bottom to top, giving the opportunity to countries to put their own INDCs on the table." Honour system But can a plan based on an honour system work when the prosperity of national economies is at stake? Everyone must understand climate change is their responsibility, Mr Pulgar-Vidal said. "This is not the time for accusations." Yet numerous countries continue prospecting for gas and petroleum, including the shale oil that has freed the US of reliance on the Middle East. Politicians are not trying to slow the burgeoning hydrocarbons industry that is in total contradiction with the fight against global warming. At Copenhagen, heads of state and government ran out of time. To avoid a repeat, French president Francois Hollande says he will summon leaders at the beginning, not at the end, of the 12-day conference. Mr Ban said the main obstacles to an agreement are different levels of ambition and responsibility; whether the agreement will be legally binding and enforceable; and the question of finance. Developed countries have pledged $100 billion for a Green Climate Fund to compensate the developing world for being asked to forgo the phase of intensive industrial development that would rely on fossil fuels. Some developing countries have made it clear they will not approve an accord in Paris unless the funds are forthcoming. The Green Climate Fund "was already a promise that was not kept. It must now be an obligation," Mr Hollande said earlier this week. "Without the hundred billion, there will not be an agreement." \</doc>

Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor of psychology, once said to writer George Marshall that if climate change was caused by eating puppies, millions of Americans would be massing in the streets. Marshall's book in which Gilbert is quoted is called Don't Even Think About it - Why our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change . Marshall talked to all sorts of people, including Gilbert, to figure out why most people feel vaguely guilty about climate change but do nothing about it. The research Gilbert and others have carried out suggests we are predisposed to respond to four triggers, for which he uses the acronym PAIN. These triggers stand for "personal", "abrupt", "immoral" and "now". "Personal" means we are highly attuned to identifying friends, enemies and detecting who is at fault in situations. However, the develop world's fossil- fuel addiction is hard to blame on any one identifiable and simple target. Climate change is also not abrupt: it is relatively slow. Speaking of slow change, contrary to myth, no sane frog will stay in a pot of water while the temperature slowly rises. Rather than sitting still while it boil, it will hop out as soon as it perceives the threat if there is any means of doing so. Unfortunately, human beings appear to be much more tolerant of slowly developing threats - we are quite happy to sit here as the temperature rises. Moral repugnance Nor does climate change trigger the sense of outrage or moral repugnance that eating puppies does. We are also notoriously bad at looking into the future and will discount all risks that are unlikely to affect us directly here and now. Even though developing countries feel the impact right now, we discount it because it is not happening to us. Despite his book's title, Marshall does not believe humans are incapable of grasping the threat and taking action. However, ladling out gloom and doom is counterproductive. Climate-change activists are working hard to create compelling narratives that inspire change, but they lack support from the media and most politicians. For example, a coalition of civil society groups including unions, business, church bodies and the environmental sector has been hosting what it calls Climate Conversations, with the aim of motivating people to take appropriate action. Another Climate Conversation was held last Wednesday in Trinity College in the wake of the COP21 talks in Paris. Some of the organisers were mildly disappointed that only about 250 people turned up. However, most political parties would be delighted with the turnout and age profile, particularly so close to Christmas. There were plenty of older people, but a significant number were young. There was lots of polite disagreement - a minority thought COP21 would be better described as Copout 21, while another minority thought it was a great step forward. The majority seemed to think that it was extremely flawed, but still significant. There was also a sense of developing momentum. Medi a bears responsibility As one participant put it, if even Saudi Arabia accepts the impact of fossil fuel consumption, we are getting somewhere. In my view, the media have to bear a huge amount of responsibility for the lack of a compelling narrative that motivates change. Look how journalists and presenters rallied behind the move to change the definition of marriage, to the extent that on the day of the result in Dublin Castle it was hard to tell the media from activists. The same is true of politicians. Imagine if a fraction of the passion that is expended on getting re-elected were spent on creating narratives that point to the brighter future that can result from caring for the environment. Vision matters. At times of challenge a sense of common purpose and of interconnectedness is essential. We need to see our planet as our beloved home in order to defend it with the passion that is needed. Even in dire situations, there are positive aspects that can be emphasised. For example, thousands of jobs could be created by incentives to retrofit houses so that they are more energy-efficient. There are local initiatives that are both good for the environment and our bills, such as district heating schemes for estates, which can reduce fossil fuel use by 90 per cent. Irish small farmers are understandably embittered and embattled at the moment, but imagine if there were concentrated efforts to help them diversify, instead of the assumption that family farms that are not massive agri-businesses are on the way out. Everyone can get behind the "Keep it in the ground" movement, which puts moral pressure on investors to divest from fossil fuel companies. Individual action is important, but community action is even more important, and political action perhaps most important of all. One thing every voter can do is to make this an issue when candidates come canvassing. Politicians believe there are few votes in this, that people fundamentally don't care that much. The forthcoming election is a prime opportunity to shake that complacency. \</doc>

A HISTORIC deal on climate change was agreed by world leaders in Paris on Saturday - but it is already being asked if Northern Ireland can meet the ambitious targets. Leaders from 195 countries signed the deal after two weeks of negotiations which the French President Francois Hollande described as a "step forward for mankind." The agreement makes a commitment to keep global temperature rises under 2 degrees celsius. The Environment Minister Mark H Durkan has welcomed the deal, calling it "a result for everyone, our planet and our future generations". But there is concern that Northern Ireland is falling behind on its carbon emission targets. Mr Durkan, who was in Paris as part of the UK delegation known as COP21 , said: "During my time in Paris I was encouraged by the willingness of everyone to engage in serious discussion on tackling climate change. "This milestone agreement shows that this was not just talk - real actions have been agreed that will make a real difference." He also praised commitments to offer billions of pounds in support for developing countries to meet their environmental goals. Sandra Overend, environment spokesperson for the Ulster Unionist Party, also welcomed the agreement, but blasted the Stormont Executive for falling behind on carbon emission targets. "While the Executive still claims to be committed to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, its actions suggest otherwise," she said. "In order to live up to its global responsibilities, Northern Ireland needs to do much more. The Executive has a target to reduce emissions by 2025, however, the latest projections are that it is going to miss that." "The Assembly has agreed twice with me to bring forward a climate bill and I now expect to see this as soon as possible. "We also need to take a long hard look at how we develop and invest locally in renewable energy and energy efficiency." \</doc>

The close of the international climate conference on December 11th could well be a cliffhanger. Newspaper editors may be tempted to prepare alternate front pages announcing "World Saved" or "World Doomed," as in the 1961 science fiction film The Day the Earth Caught Fire . The UN Conference of Parties started in 1992, and this will be the 21st session, hence the conference's name, COP 21 . Alarming predictions by experts and world leaders drive home how high the stakes are. "The ocean is dying, and it produces 80 per cent of the oxygen on our planet," Paul Watson, the president of the NGO Sea Shepherd told the Summit of Conscience for the Climate "If action is not taken immediately," the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan said, his grandchildren will endure "suffocating heat waves, severe droughts, catastrophic forest fires, rising sea levels and drowning cities; New York, Venice and small island states will be submerged." Pope's encyclical Twenty-seven years have passed since a scientist named James Hansen testified in the US Senate that man's addiction to fossil fuels was driving the planet to perdition. An overwhelming body of evidence subsequently proved him right. Awareness of the peril has grown this year, aided by Pope Francis's encyclical Laudato Si . It is hoped that India, which is also a leading polluter, will be spurred by China's example. Only 47 of the 195 states in COP 21 have made commitments. France, which will host the conference, is focused on securing more NDCs. Many countries are waiting to see others' proposals first. The goal of COP 21 If nothing is done, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande said on July 21st, temperatures will rise four degrees. "Based on negotiations and the commitments made so far, the agreement that appears reachable today would probably put us at three degrees." "Mitigation" and "adaptation" are the key words in the run-up to the December conference. The former means substantial reductions in carbon emissions. The latter refers to the transition from a fossil fuel-based energy system to renewable energy sources: solar, wind, marine and geothermal. The governments of developed countries spend huge amounts of money to encourage citizens to buy electric cars, and install insulation and solar panels. The challenge is greater in the developing world. For that reason, earlier conferences foresaw a $100 billion annual "green climate fund" to help the developing world make the energy transition. The fund is supposed to be operational by 2020, but who will pay, and how much, remains a major issue. It is perhaps the most absurd aspect of climate change that the governments who are too stingy to fund the "green climate fund" spend $5,000 billion to subsidise the fossil fuel industry annually, according to the International Monetary Fund. The absence of a transparent, reliable means of assessing carbon emissions and holding countries to their commitments is also an obstacle to an agreement. With just four months to go, negotiators are showing signs of fatigue. The UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has complained that negotiations are moving at "a snail's pace". "Taking account of the inertia of the negotiations, we must pull the levers of conscience, meaning and spirituality," said Nicolas Hulot, Mr Hollande's special envoy for the protection of the planet. At a preparatory meeting on July 20th, Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, took several minutes to regain her composure at the microphone, a diplomat who attended the meeting recounted. "Figueres couldn't speak because she was crying," the diplomat said. "Things are moving very slowly. The pressure is getting to them all. She seemed exasperated by the lack of urgency and momentum. She said that expressions of solidarity aren't enough; we need to see action in moving away from fossil fuels." Fossil fuels Mr Hollande says a climate agreement "means giving up 80 per cent of the fossil energy resources that are still at our disposal". It is as if there were two distinct processes: the plodding negotiations, for which Ms Figueres has overall responsibility, and a gathering wave of global opinion, encouraged by religious leaders, NGOs and social media. More than 40,000 delegates will attend COP 21 , and the 12-day conference will doubtless resemble Woodstock more than the Congress of Vienna. Already, many of the events have an all-embracing, warm and fuzzy feel to them. President Hollande's Summit of Conscience included a speech by a representative of the International Confucian Ecological Alliance, an exercise in meditation by a Buddhist nun and a classical concert by Israeli and Palestinian youths. "We're convinced that the challenges presented by climate change cannot be effectively met by states alone, but mainly through individual and collective mobilisation, today and for years to come," the representatives of the six main religions in France wrote to Mr Hollande on July 1st. But will it be enough to stop the seemingly inexorable warming of our planet? Mr Hollande says global warming constitutes a "crisis of civilisation" and a "crisis of meaning". France, he adds, "is a country . . . which sometimes opens new paths. I think that in December 2015, as in 1789 when the French Revolution produced immense hope in the world, the history of the world can be written in Paris." \</doc>

We will never know how many people would have participated in the great march for the climate on November 30th, the day the COP21 conference started, had French authorities not cancelled the demonstration in the wake of jihadi attacks that killed 130 people in Paris. But the fact that hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities around the world to send a message to the leaders and negotiators in Le Bourget, was cause for optimism. And despite the ban on public gatherings, thousands of protesters travelled to Paris, without knowing if their journey would serve any purpose. Many came on their own. Others, like 40 Irish people with the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, travelled in groups. French authorities wavered, initially turning the Irish around at Cherbourg, then sending them on their way. "We won't have our voices silenced," said Nicola Winters (32) as she stood in the Avenue de la Grande Arm\'e9e with a tricolour over her shoulders at the "red line" protest. There were three street demonstrations in Paris on Saturday, while negotiators put final touches on the agreement. Alternatiba, the group which organised the "state of climate emergency" demonstration at the Eiffel Tower, said police barricades prevented several thousand people reaching the Champ-de-Mars. Indigenous peoples - Amazonian Indians, Eskimos from Greenland, tribal chiefs from Papua New Guinea - started the day with drums and song, marching from Notre Dame to the Pont des Arts. The preamble of the agreement mentions the impact of global warming on these peoples, but they're disappointed their rights are not mentioned in the text. At the "red line" demonstration between the Arc de Triomphe and the Port Maillot, marchers wore red hats and scarves, and held aloft red flowers and umbrellas. "We have the last word, these thousands of us in the streets today," said Ciara Kirrane (31). "Regardless of what they do in Le Bourget, we'll continue to fight for climate justice." The term "climate justice" has entered the vocabulary of politicians and protesters alike. Fervour and conviction With their catchy slogans, imaginative costumes and a palpable feeling of fraternit\'e9 , the street marches were more fun than the proceedings out in Le Bourget. At the same time, I've rarely encountered more fervour or conviction among demonstrators. "This is the most important movement of our time," said Laurie King, a 24-year-old master's student from the University of Edinburgh. "The global environmental movement unites everyone across the globe, because the climate has no borders." Beware, oil companies and laggard politicians. Taoiseach Enda Kenny was criticised by demonstrators for giving higher priority to the economy than to climate change, for having "reassured vested interests" and for refusing to reconsider Irish farming policies that release substantial amounts of methane. There's a direct relationship between flooding and climate change, said Claire Lyons (35). "Enda Kenny wants to continue and expand farming practices. That means more cattle, more climate change and more flooding." Crisis of meaning French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has called the ecological crisis "a crisis of meaning" and "a crisis of civilisation". Yet there was great hope in the chant of the demonstrators as they carried a 100-metre long red banner down the avenue: "We are unstoppable. Another world is possible." Gone are the days when ecologist movements were considered quaint and eccentric, when French intelligence agents could sink a Greenpeace ship with near-impunity. As Bob Dylan sang in the 1960s, "The times they are a-changin'." The protesters distrust the Paris agreement because past accords, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, did not achieve what they promised. The global environmental movement will be there to keep the politicians to their word. As Irishwoman Sydney Weinberg (28) said: "Being here, you can feed off the energy and learn how to bring it back to Ireland." COP21 and the demonstrations raised consciousness, at a time when everyone is beginning to feel the effects of climate change. One no longer sees sparrows, robins or ladybirds in Paris. It hasn't snowed in the French capital for many years. Paris temperatures rose well into the 40s in the summers of 2003 and 2015. The fight to save the planet may be the only thing we can all agree on. It could give meaning to our time, as anti-Vietnam war protests shaped the 1960s and 1970s, and the anti-apartheid movement swelled until it eventually brought down the apartheid regime in South Africa. Donna Cooney (40) drew a different historical parallel. "We're coming into the centenary of the rising," she said. "I'm the great grand-niece of nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell, who carried the surrender flag out of the GPO. I know she would have been here with me." Most of the protesters I spoke to had flown to Paris. A few, like the Bishop sisters, Anne-Mieke and Charlotte, (25 and 29), found carbon-free transport, cycling from Dublin to Paris. Through social media, like-minded French people offered hot showers and sofas. The sharing economy is part of the energy transition. Habit may be the greatest threat to our newfound determination. "We have freedom to consume and pollute, and we want to continue," the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot (61) said as he stood in his furry white jumpsuit, part of a 10-strong "polar bear army" who staged humorous protests around Paris. \</doc>

The next government should introduce more severe sentencing for repeat offenders in an attempt to tackle crime in rural areas, the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said. At the publication of its pre-election submission designed to focus politicians' attention on the estimated 250,000 farming votes, the association leadership said communities urgently needed to feel the issue was being addressed. The document focuses on other key issues in the agricultural sector including reversal of cuts to disadvantaged areas, stronger Common Agricultural Policy budgets and bolstering "fair and viable" commodity prices. "It's almost unacceptable now to arrive after dark into a strange house, and to arrive at houses that are locked," he said. "That's such a change in rural Ireland's society in the last 10 years. There is a requirement for government to give a reassurance to people that this is being addressed." Mr O'Leary said there was a perception in rural Ireland, "particularly among older people, that they are not secure anymore". Recent statistics show the increase in burglary rates since 2007 have applied in the main to urban areas. Nevertheless, IFA national chairman Jer Bergin said it was "clearly a huge, huge issue, particularly over the last couple of years". "Clearly, [there is] demand on the legislation side for stiffer sentences, more direct action by the criminal justice system to deal with repeat offenders," he said. "Whether that's tagging, whether that's more consecutive sentences, all those sort of areas [should be considered] to keep people who are repeat offenders away from rural Ireland." In other areas, the IFA is pushing for annual expenditure of EUR 580 million, from national and EU funding sources, on farm schemes; the reversal of cuts to disadvantaged areas; and EUR 250 million for the low-carbon, agri-environment or Glas scheme. Robust defence In the aftermath of the recent COP21 environmental conference in Paris, the association said the next D\'e1il must pitch a "robust defence" of Ireland's interests in trade policy and climate change negotiations. Mr O'Leary said the farming community would embrace the demands of climate change policies so long as the onus was not placed on one industry. \</doc>

NOUR is six and she has a cleft palette. Her three younger siblings and their parents were living in Aleppo up until recently. They travelled to Turkey so Nour could be operated on. The operation was not a success so the family decided to head to Germany for treatment. When I spoke to them near the train station in Izmir they had just arrived in town and were beginning to have discussions with the many smugglers that can be found in the back streets of Turkey's third-biggest city. As we chatted, the children suddenly looked up at the sound of a jet passing overhead. In Aleppo, planes spell danger. Sick Are they refugees? Not really. Surprisingly, they intend to return to Aleppo once the treatment is complete. Perhaps you could say they are medical migrants. Looking at it from their point of view, they would not seek asylum in Germany if there was a temporary protection they could avail of to obtain medical care for a sick child. We spoke to Ahmed, whose family had fled from an area near Tartous in Syria and had made a number of attempts to cross to Greece. One attempt had resulted in them capsizing on exposed rock and spending the night there before being returned to Izmir by the Turkish coast guard. Again they were heading for Germany and it is their intention to go back to Syria as soon as possible. Abu Mohammed, also from Aleppo, has settled his family in Germany and is in Izmir working with refugees for the Turkish Red Crescent. He was arrested and tortured by the Assad regime, having been part of the early peaceful protests. Abu Mohammed has no intention of moving back to Aleppo now. He and his family have obtained refugee status in Germany, though he has a job and safety in Turkey. His wife arrived in Germany with false papers through a smuggling route. Finally, I went to a place an hour's drive outside Izmir used by smugglers to launch their dinghies. The road ran out so we parked up and made our way across some scrubland towards, where we thought the beach might be. In the distance, people started to emerge from the bushes. Maybe 500 people were coming from the beach to be fed by a local Turkish voluntary group. These were all Iranians and Afghanis. Too poor to stay in hostels in town, they were sleeping out in the open, waiting for their turn to embark on the short journey to Greece which could be seen just 7 km away. Some had been there for weeks. We continued on to the beach. People ask me if the things I see working for GOAL are sometimes harrowing. Sometimes it's the things you don't see that stay with you. The beach was empty but was strewn with the personal effects of the families that had begun their journey to Europe from here. Kids' shoes and clothes, backpacks and torn life-jackets were thrown everywhere. The smugglers order the passengers to ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load. It was here that six Afghan children had drowned the previous weekend. Afghanis have a much better chance of obtaining refugee status than Iranians. Yet they all mixed together here - all leaving behind grinding poverty and risking everything for a brighter future. Not being refugees, these Iranians must, according to standard definitions, be migrants. There is no internationally accepted definition of a migrant but the term is quaintly understood to cover cases where the decision to leave is taken for reasons of "personal convenience" and "without intervention of an external compelling factor". The grinding poverty they had left behind apparently doesn't count. It is these grey areas between refugee status and migration that the international system is not geared towards. There are two key agencies in this area. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) deals with those fleeing conflict while the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) deals with migrants. It is clear that the majority of populations on the move do not fit neatly into these two categories. The UN system needs to be more flexible to account for this complexity. A gobal summit is required to address these institutional issues and the issues of categorisation. A summit is required to contextualise the issue of solidarity. Only a global, multilateral approach based on the principle of solidarity has any hope of succeeding. Safe zone GOAL has argued for two years for a protected humanitarian safe zone in Syria. The failure to provide such relief has been a major contributor to the current crisis. This is an example of the kind of approach a global summit could address. However, lumping migrants and refugees together is not recommended - instead, we need to recognise that each journey has many and complex motivations. There are climate migrants, medical migrants, conflict migrants and many others on the move. There are the residents of Za£tari camp in Lebanon, who are not likely to go anywhere for a very long time. They and so many others like them are neither one thing nor the other. Ireland, of course, can play a role. Our history must inform a robust ethical approach as far as large movements of population are concerned, without having to ignore considerations of security, the integrity of sovereign borders and integration. Ireland's multi-lateralism has been under intense scrutiny lately both at the COP21 climate change conference and in the context of our corporate tax regime. The Government sought a permission slip at COP21 to resile from the principle of global solidarity in favour of narrow self-interest. A strong position on migration might conceivably serve as a counter-balance. Barry Andrews, GOAL'S chief executive, has just returned from Izmir. GOAL is working extensively in Syria \</doc>

SOMEONE is fooling someone! (maybe we are all being fooled?) I listened to a 'man-made climate change' alarmist on Newstalk radio today, when being interviewed about the COP21 Climate Change Political 'junket' taking place in Paris as I write. World leaders are making speeches to exhort a reduction in CO2 emissions (I refuse to call the phenomenon 'carbon emissions'.) She spoke the usual rhetoric of these people warning us plebs about the many possible effects of socalled 'climate change' if we don't change our wasteful-energy ways - sooner rather than later. She said that in the past ten years 'extreme climate events' were taking place every two years, when they used to take place every 20 years. I could hardly believe the woman when she said: 'Unless we do something, the sea levels will rise by two to three metres before the end of this century.' I was brought up in the small fishing village of Passage East, Co. Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. Passage was founded by the Vikings more than 1000 years ago and built on a sandbank of the River Suir, situated about seven miles from the Atlantic Ocean (aka. Celtic Sea). Back in the 1950s and 60s, I remember the village being flooded several times, up to a metre of water above the quays, during high spring tides (the flooding usually coincided with the spring or autumn Equinox and a strong south-easterly gale.) At one time the sea level reached the doorstep of the house where I lived, in Dobbyn Street, which is one of the highest streets of the lowlying village. On two occasions in the early 1960s our then-secondary school (Waterpark College in Waterford City) was inundated by those floods, when the river level exceeded the height of the sea wall that was protecting the school on Park Road, so much that classes had to be cancelled for that day at least. Nothing has been done since then to protect the school, and as far as I know, the river and sea level never reached those heights since. Fifty Years of my life have passed in the meantime. Surely, if the low-lying islands of the Pacific are to be flooded under water, Passage East will have become a home for the fishes long before then? So much for predicting sea levels rising three metres in the next 85 years. TOM BALDWIN, Midleton, Co. Cork. \</doc>

As an equatorial country, Malaysia's climate is relatively stable, with little variation in temperature throughout the year. As the country rapidly develops, the use of air-conditioning has become increasingly prevalent, leading to the running joke that Malaysia has two seasons: indoors and outdoors. A more accurate description would include the annual monsoons, which provide the country with the rainfall necessary for agriculture, particularly the water-loving rice that grows in the fields around my house. The National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia reports a marked increase in rainfall intensity in the past 40 years, with a rise in temperatures of 0.6-1.2 degrees during the same period. Flooding is the new norm in many parts of the country, further exacerbated by rampant deforestation, due to vast tracts of virgin rainforest being converted into palm oil and rubber plantations. The worst floods on record occurred last year in Kelantan state, with tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes. Almost a year later, many of these flood victims are still living in temporary accommodation. Other parts of the country face annual water rationing. It is not uncommon for the air force to carry out cloud-seeding in the hope of provoking rainfall to fill reservoirs. For the past two decades, Malaysia has had a new season: the "haze". Smoke from fires, set to clear land for palm oil plantations in Indonesia, is carried by prevailing winds across the Straits of Malacca. Langkawi, where I live, is usually spared the worst, but this year was exceptionally bad: visibility last month dropped to a few hundred metres and the smell of smoke filled the air. Respiratory problems are rife. Schools and even airports closed temporarily. Tourism was affected, with thousands of tourists stranded on Langkawi and thousands more forced to cancel their bookings. That Malaysia is one of only two countries in the ASEAN that has yet to submit INDC pledges for the COP21 speaks volumes about the importance it accords to climate change. But this is unsurprising, with an economy largely based on oil, gas, timber, palm oil and rubber, all of which have powerful lobbying influences on governmental policies. \</doc>

Last year marked the centenary of the general theory of relativity, but it appears Albert Einstein also showed great foresight when he said, "Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet." With the recent announcement by the World Health Organisation that processed meats are highly carcinogenic, and the success of last month's UN COP21 talks on climate change, it could be time to consider reducing meat consumption as a matter of both national and international policy. In October, the World Health Organisation published a report outlining that processed and cured meats such as bacon and sausages are among some of the most carcinogenic products, although the risk of actually developing cancer from them is low. Red meats were also indicated as a probable cause of cancer. The report outlines that colorectal, stomach, pancreatic and prostate cancers can all be linked to diets high in these cured and processed meats. It is also known that meat-rich diets might be a contributor to coronary heart disease, type II diabetes, and other conditions that reduce human life expectancy. An article last year in the journal , "Global diets link sustainability and human health", indicates that a fish-based diet reduces the risk of type II diabetes by 25 per cent, improving to 40 per cent for full-blown vegetarians. Pescetarians (fish eaters) and vegetarians also have a 10 per cent reduced risk of cancer compared with omnivores. The message is clear: processed and red meats increase our risk of life-threatening diseases. At the same time, as a taste for meat grows in emerging nations, the relatively recent rapid development of the meat industry has become a major contributor to climate change. The methane problem Global food production and agriculture account for about 25 per cent of all greenhouse-gas emissions. The clearing of areas for agricultural use reduces the vegetation that otherwise acts as a carbon sink (storage of carbon in the land rather than the atmosphere), and effectively increases carbon-dioxide levels. These land clearances also enact species extinction and are therefore considered a major environmental disaster. The same study in Nature shows that pescetarians and vegetarians are responsible for significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than their omnivorous neighbours. This implies that in a hypothetical exclusively vegetarian world, greenhouse gas emissions from food production would be substantially reduced. A vegan diet is responsible for even less greenhouse-gas emission. The article states: "There are plausible solutions to the diet/environment/health trilemma, diets already chosen by many people that, if widely adopted, would offer global environmental and public health benefits." According to lead author David Tilman of the department of ecology at the University of Minnesota, "We showed that the same dietary changes that can add about a decade to our lives can also prevent massive environmental damage." So the problem with meat is twofold, with negative implications for health, and for the climate and environment. This means that dietary change, specifically a move towards reduced-meat diets, is essential if governments intend to keep their populations healthy and global warming under the proposed safe limit of two degrees. A switch to reduced-meat diets appears to be a win-win situation, and in the long run would save governments massively on healthcare costs, and increase life expectancy. Therefore, to protect populations from cancer, and also to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, governments will need to develop initiatives to advertise the health benefits of a reduced-meat diet. Such initiatives might include taxation on meat products, as well as TV, radio and online awareness campaigns, perhaps even including new years' resolutions. Such dietary changes might become necessary if governments are to make any progress towards reducing cancer rates and the negative effects of global warming. For this reason, reduced meat economies, with increased emphasis on vegetable-based diets, should be included in global health and climate-change discussions, alongside smoking and obesity. And we need divestment from fossil fuels and investment in renewable energies. Dr Conor Purcell is a postdoctoral researcher at Prof Jennifer McElwain's programme for experimental atmospheres and climate at University College Dublin. He specialises in future climate change prediction Over the past 50 years the global meat industry has experienced massive increases in production. Between 1963 and 2014, meat production rose from 78 million tons to more than 300 million tons - a fourfold increase. Major causes are the growing markets for meat, particularly in Asia, where population expansion into urban centres has promoted the development of the meat industry on large scales. That's not to say that meat production hasn't risen in western nations too. Most people are unaware that food production and agriculture contribute to an estimated 25 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions, with a large part of this from meat production itself. Fifteen per cent of greenhouse gases are attributed to the global meat industry, and land use for livestock grazing amounts to more than 25 per cent of the Earth's ice-free surface. In particular, beef production is the main cause of these gas emissions - methane in this case, which is emitted by cows. This all means that our increasing appetite for meat is contributing enormously to global warming, and the problems associated with a changing climate. Last month's UN COP21 conference on climate change in Paris agreed on a united deal to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and to invest in renewable energies. It appears any significant step forward would include an action plan to reduce meat consumption and production. \</doc>

An enormous area of cold water in the North Atlantic is helping to keep Ireland cool while the rest of the world swelters. And its presence is protecting us from the record high temperatures that globally made 2015 the hottest year since records began in 1880. Average global temperatures were up by 0.13 degrees during the year but Ireland was about half a degree cooler than normal. The North Atlantic anomaly started more than a year ago, but what is causing it is not known, said Gerald Fleming head of forecasting at Met \'c9ireann. It ensured 2015 was not going to be a record warm year for Ireland. Even without the anomaly, Ireland's weather continues to keep us out of step with the heat experienced in other countries. Warming trend Although there has been a warming trend here since the 1990s, "we have a maritime climate" so that helped hold temperatures in check, said Met \'c9ireann climatologist Aidan Murphy. Our top three warmest years - 1949, 1989 and 1990 - are a complete mismatch with the top three as measured by the Nasa, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the two US bodies that compiled the data for 2015. They list 2010, 2014 and 2015 as the hottest. The closest we get to a match is our fourth hottest year, 2006, which Nasa and Noaa rank as the 10th hottest in global terms. The two bodies yesterday released their annual figures on global surface temperatures, which reflect data collected from thousands of weather stations, ships and buoys around the world. The steady rise in global warming underlines the continuing impact of human-induced climate change. The Earth's average surface temperature has risen by about 1 degree since the late 19th century. The 190 countries that attended the COP21 climate change talks in Paris last month agreed to keep the increase in global temperatures at less than 2 degrees above the pre-industrial average. 'Time to act' The figures "should make policy makers stand up and take notice. Now is the time to act on climate," said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. The underlying rise due to human-induced climate change was exacerbated by the ongoing El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean, Mr Fleming said. \</doc>

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has described its new global deal on reversing land degradation, formally agreed late last Friday night after two weeks of discussions in Ankara, as a "breakthrough". The agreement is likely to have an impact on next month's UN climate change conference in Paris, COP21 The 195 parties to the UNCCD, including Ireland, agreed in Ankara to set a new environmental target: achieving "land degradation neutrality" by 2030. This means maintaining the world's stock of healthy, productive land at a stable level. At present, 12 million hectares of land is degraded annually through infrastructural development and unsustainable food production. So the deal at Ankara commits the UN's members, albeit on a voluntary basis, to restore or rehabilitate at least that area every year, just to keep things from getting worse. This target had already been endorsed in the Sustainability Development Goals agreed by the UN General Assembly last September. The UNCCD decision, however, marks a significant advance in that it sets in motion a framework whereby this target might be achieved. It also marks an expansion in the role of the UNCCD. The agency had previously focused on attempting to counter the rapid degradation of productive drylands ("desertification"), especially in Africa. It will now also actively promote and assist land degradation neutrality in non-arid areas across the world. "That is the fundamental change that has taken place," UNCCD executive secretary Monique Barbut told The Irish Times after the meeting. Not everyone agreed with this interpretation. Francisco Barreto Campello, the leader of the Brazilian delegation, who had opposed any extension of the UNCCD's role, insisted on Friday evening that the convention would remain limited to drylands, in line with its unchanged formal mandate. The scientific definition of land degradation neutrality adopted by the conference, however, omits any such limits, and the consensus was that a significant shift has occurred. Forests and peat bogs Ms Barbut said Ireland's contribution could include, for example, the restoration of peat bogs, reafforestation and reduction in fertiliser use. She stressed the climate benefits, claiming that full implementation of the target could reduce global warming by half a degree, through carbon sequestration in the soil. "We are sending a strong message to Paris," she said. \</doc>

Taoiseach Enda Kenny's speech to the United Nations climate change summit in Paris today will call for a strong agreement that limits global temperature increases. Mr Kenny will be one of more than 150 world leaders who will address the COP21 conference in the French capital today on the opening day of the 12-day summit. His speech this afternoon will confirm that Ireland is fully committed to the European Union target of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. He will also highlight the fact that Ireland will have climate change legislation in place by the New Year. On the sensitive and critical matter of agriculture, which makes up 30 per cent of all Irish emissions, he will reiterate the Government's insistence that any measures do not "compromise our capacity for food production". He will argue that that can be done by achieving "carbon neutrality" in the land sector (using carbon sinks such as forestry). He will say the Government is preparing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that. The Government's controversial stance on agriculture, for which it has made a special case, has drawn criticism from environmental organisations. For its part, the Government has said Irish agriculture is among the most sustainable in the world. Another aspect on which the Government approach has been criticised has been climate finance. Until last year Ireland was one of only four developed countries that had made no contribution to the Green Climate Fund, along with Australia, Belgium and Austria. In the budget a sum of EUR 2 million was allotted for 2016 but no firm commitments were made for subsequent years. There were expectations that Mr Kenny would include a concrete pledge of further specific funding to this fund for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. Such a commitment would have required a memo to Cabinet. However, sources say Labour and Fine Gael Ministers could not agree on the matter, and the issue never made it to Cabinet. Mr Kenny will reference the EUR 2 million contribution in 2016 and say it is part of a process with a view to building up Ireland's support over the coming years. It is not known if he will specify any figures. He is also expected to say the Government is examining how private finance can be used to help contribute to the goals. \</doc>

Swedish scholars David Bryngelsson and Stefan Wirsenius have published a report which suggests EU citizens should be pushed to eat poultry and pork, whose husbandry produces significantly less greenhouse gas emissions. The report s authors suggest people will not have to cut out meat altogether, but will have to be more selective in their diet. They state that producing 1kg of protein from dairy results in emissions four times greater than for an equivalent amount of poultry. The report, How Can The EU Climate Targets Be Met? A Combined Analysis of Technological and Demand-Side Changes In Food and Agriculture , was published in the February issue of Food Policy journal. Cuts, by 50% or more, in ruminant meat (beef and mutton) consumption are, most likely, unavoidable if the EU targets are to be met, the report states. Emissions from manure storage can all but be eliminated if the facilities are covered and waste gases are flared (burned off). But reducing the amount of food thrown away only cuts emissions from food and agriculture by 5%-10%. The Swedish study takes into account commitments made by the EU at the COP21 sustainable innovation forum in Paris in December. The EU is seeking a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions (versus 1990 levels); to generate 20% of all EU energy from renewables; and to achieve 20% more energy efficiency. The researchers at Chalmers University of Technology and Sweden s Technical Research Institute focused their report on GHG emissions from agriculture. They stated that farming contributes to 10% of the total EU s greenhouse gas emissions. This is largely down to two greenhouse gases: Methane from livestock digestion and stored animal manure; and nitrous oxide from organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers. The report says emissions from the production of fertilisers can be halved if factories used the latest technologies. As a first step, they advise farmers to cover over all manure containers. The production of livestock and fodder globally generates more than three billion tonnes each of carbon dioxide equivalent. In 2014, according to Eurostat data, Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom had the highest number of livestock. The largest number of pigs was recorded in Germany and Spain (28.3 and 26.6 million animals respectively); cows in France (19.3 million head) and sheep (23.0 million head) in the UK. The Irish Cattle and Sheep Association has suggested that enhanced supports for forestry and energy crops such as miscanthus would encourage farmers to move some of their focus out of livestock. The ICSA suggests these improved grants could lead to a 5% reduction in the share of land use devoted to livestock in Ireland. \</doc>

N a week when almost 150 heads of state gathered in Paris for the UN climate summit, Taoiseach Enda Kenny once again proved that all politics are local. IAddressing the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ), he said all countries "big and small" had to take action to address climate change, and that Ireland would play its part - as long as it didn't hamper growth in the agriculture sector. "We don't want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce to find that food is being produced in other countries with inferior standards and higher emission levels," he said. But what the Government really doesn't want to see is a situation where the country's 140,000 farming families vote for someone else come next year's General Election. Not until after 2020 when our economy recovers will the State be in a position to meet "aggressive targets" to reduce agri emissions, Mr Kenny added. Next year, it will seek lessonerous targets for the sector, pleading we are a special case. His comments may have played well among some, but they showed that the Taoiseach is no statesman, but a local politician pandering to his constituents. As was noted on twitter, it seems all global eco-politics are local. Reaction was tinged with a sense of disbelief that the Taoiseach was in effect telling the world's poorest that Ireland - a first-world developed nation - was too cashstrapped to help address a problem which would profoundly impact upon those least able to cope. "We're probably going to be dragged (into this) kicking and screaming," Trocaire's executive director Eamonn Meehan said, criticising the lack of leadership. Satirical website Waterford Whispers News didn't hold back in a sketch about the Fine Gael leader needing surgery to remove his head from a certain part of his anatomy. The article helpfully noted that the condition of "Headious Up Arsesus" left the afflicted "unable to perform basic tasks like putting the health of the nation and its environment ahead of a few farmers who might not vote for him if he pushes for a reduction in agri-sector pollution." It's abundantly clear as to why farmers were being addressed by Mr Kenny in his conference speech, and not the global community. With Fine Gael hovering at around 30pc in the opinion polls, and Labour lagging between 7pc and 9pc, the coalition is facing into a difficult General Election and needs every vote it can muster. The powerful farming lobby will play a huge role in the formation of the next government, hence the 'not at any cost' line, a sentiment which has also come from Labour's Environment Minister Alan Kelly. But this stance flies in the face of showing leadership and vision, and once again demonstrates that despite our image, Ireland's green credentials are seriously lacking. Across the EU, agriculture accounts for 12pc of all emissions. In Ireland, it's 33pc. Our household emissions are higher than average. Some 92pc of our energy is produced using fossil fuels, compared with 75pc across the EU, and we produce 20pc more waste per head of population than our neighbours. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill which passed through the Oireachtas this week is welcomed, as it creates a statutory obligation to meet targets, but it doesn't go far enough. In particular, it gives government two years to produce plans on how to tackle the agriculture, transport, energy and buildings sector - work which should have started years ago. Had we very clear and concise plans to get people out of their cars and onto public transport, and if we were heavily investing in energy-efficiency to reduce power consumption, there might be a case to be made for giving agriculture special status. But we haven't, and we now run the risk of missing EU targets which will result in financial penalties. There's no doubting the importance of the agriculture sector to the economy, accounting for more than 12pc of our exports and just under one-in-ten jobs. With 139,600 farms, more than half (56.5pc) are specialist beef producers, and just over 11pc specialist dairy, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The problem is belching and farting cows produce methane which is among the most problematic of all greenhouse gases. Coalition plans to ramp up production will only exacerbate the problem, regardless of how sustainably food is produced. Output is already increasing, and the number and size of farms is also on the rise. According to the Farm Structure Survey from Eurostat, the number of holdings fell in all EU member states between 2003 and 2013 except Ireland, and there are 1,235 more farms today than a decade ago. Each is, on average, four hectares bigger. As custodians of the land over generations, farmers do more than most to protect the environment. But they are the very people who will be among the most affected unless climate change is tackled. It's not a question of 'if', but 'when'. Winter rainfall is expected to increase, resulting in more flooding. There's also a risk of summer drought, and the real prospect of pests and diseases expanding their range, resulting in loss of crops. As website HYPERLINK http://www.uplift.ie www.uplift.ie noted, now is the time to lead, and not to plead. Climate change poses an enormous threat to our health, wealth and well-being. The Government's stance is doing no-one any favours, and may end up harming our agriculture sector in the long-term. Climate change poses an enormous threat to our health, wealth and well-being.

THE EU has joined forces with 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states in an effort to drive home a deal at the UN climate summit. The new coalition of 107 states has agreed on a number of key issues which it hopes will result in a legally-binding deal by almost 200 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). It comes as negotiators this morning produce a new draft text on a proposed agreement which is expected to show progress towards providing financial support for developing nations, a system to verify that emissions are being cut in individual countries and a provision to allow ambitions to be ramped up over time. It is also understood that the European Union is prepared to push for a reference to be included in the text where countries commit to a long-term goal of keeping global temperatures at no more than 1.5C above current levels. This is a key demand from vulnerable nations which believe that the current 2C cap will devastate their countries due to rising sea levels and increases in extreme weather events. Sources said the EU was offering to be "flexible" for certain countries and was "ready to consider" a reference to a 1.5C upper limit. "We are convinced this could address some of the concerns," one source said. "Some countries believe 2C is too much as it will affect their climate too much." The agreement also involves the European Commission providing (EURO)475m in funding to support climate action between now and 2020 in the ACP countries which includes eight from Africa, 16 from the Caribbean and 15 from the Pacific. EU Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete urged other countries to join the bloc to help reach an agreement. "These negotiations are not about them and us," he said. "These negotiations are about all of us, both developed and developing countries, finding common ground and solutions together. "We urge other countries to join us. Together we can do it." The EU and ACP group have agreed that any deal must be "legally binding, inclusive, fair, ambitious, durable and dynamic". German group Greenwatch said policies including rollout of renewables, emission levels and energy efficiency policies would help tackle climate change. Germanwatch is part of the Climate Action Network, and says that Denmark is the most progressive country at tackling climate change, followed by the UK and Sweden. However, it did not award any country 1st, 2nd or 3rd place, saying no nation was doing enough to address global warming. \</doc>

Europe's car makers are saying that they have done more to reduce emissions than any other single sector. They are also calling for another round of "scrappage" schemes to encourage motorists to trade-in for newer, cleaner vehicles. In a statement issued at the COP21 climate change talks in Paris, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), the umbrella group which represents the European car industry, points out that new cars make up only around three per cent of the EU's car park, and that the average vehicle age in the EU is now 10-years-old and rising. The ACEA suggests that a further 30 per cent reduction in fleet emissions could be achieved simply by getting drivers into newer cars. The powerful lobby group said that "last year, average new car CO2 emissions were 33.7 per cent lower than two decades ago; by 2021, CO2 emissions from new cars will be almost 42 per cent lower than in 2005." "Europe's automobile manufacturers have been driving down greenhouse gas emissions by developing ever-more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even when faced with flat or declining sales during recent crisis years, the EU automobile sector has delivered huge environmental improvements, and will continue to do so" said the ACEA. "The European automobile and parts industry is the continent's number one investor in R&D, spending EUR 41.5 billion on innovation each year. As a result, the average new car coming on to the road in 2021 will produce 42 per cent less CO2 per km than a new car bought in 2005. No other industry has done as much as Europe's automotive sector to drive down CO2 emissions in recent years." The ACEA goes on to say that it is, according to its figures, doing far more to achieve emissions reductions than other transport sectors, such as aviation and shipping. The lobby group is calling on EU and world governments to establish a common international framework for the future of vehicle CO2 emissions regulation, saying that a failure to do so will cost both jobs and investment. \</doc>

ONE of the country's leading climate scientists has said a carbon tax on food processors will have to be considered if Ireland wants to expand its agriculture sector. Professor John Sweeney of Maynooth University said motorists and householders already paid carbon taxes on fuels, and that unless the agrifood sector was taken into a similar system it would be difficult to reduce emissions. His comments came as talks on striking a global deal to tackle climate change went right down to the wire, with a final draft agreement expected early this morning. It hoped almost 200 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) will agree to the text, and reduce emissions while limiting average global temperature rises to no more than 2C. Prof Sweeney, who was part of the UN team awarded the Nobel Prize for its research on climate change, said while the proposed deal had many positive aspects, it would require countries to be more ambitious. He also said if the Government wanted to expand the beef and dairy sectors, a carbon tax on food would have to be considered. While the Government hoped to get special treatment from the EU for the agriculture sector at negotiations next year, with our growing economy it would be hard to argue we could not afford to make cuts. "Our GDP is growing, so I don't expect to see any special favours," he said. "It will be incumbent for every country to carry their share of the burden. I can't see how agriculture will escape. I think the food companies have to come into the net. I don't see Ireland getting special treatment for agriculture, in the same way that Germany won't get it for cars and Poland for coal. "Motorists pay a carbon tax for their cars, and householders pay it for fuel bills, but there's no carbon tax for agriculture. I would see the food companies, and not the farmers, being brought into the net there. If you're buying 100 litres of milk, and carbon has a price per tonne, they would pay on that. "You need something to reduce emissions. It may have been feasible to increase dairy if you got rid of the suckler cow herd under Food Harvest 2020, but under Foodwise 2025 that proposal is gone and we will have 300,000 extra dairy cows." All parties must agree the text before it can be ratified, meaning if agreement cannot be struck, the Paris Climate Summit will be deemed a failure. \</doc>

From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, people from 80 countries will come together around the world today for the largest ever global debate on climate change. The "World Wide Views" meeting is a unique experiment in simultaneous civic participation, hearing opinions from more than 10,000 people in more than 80 countries in one day, from 10am to 5pm. Organisers hope that, by bringing ordinary citizens to a table previously dominated by bureaucrats and lobbyists, they can help break the long-running deadlock in UN talks to find a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. WWViews says its day-long event - held from dawn in Fiji to dusk in Arizona - is neither a campaign nor is it about telling people what they should think on climate change. "It is about asking them what they think and about making an effort to involve policy-makers and stakeholders in a dialogue about citizens' views," said Bj\'f6rn Bedsted of the Danish Board of Technology Foundation, global co-ordinator of the event and based in Copenhagen, scene of a UN climate conference debacle in 2009. Participants have been chosen to reflect the demographic diversity in their country or region and have received information packs detailing all sides of the debate on climate change and energy policy. They will watch identical introductory videos, debate the issues, and vote on identical questions. The conclusions will be collated and communicated to the June session of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) now under way in Bonn and to November's UN climate conference ( COP21 ) in Paris. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, welcomed the WWViews debate as a "unique engagement . . . on one of the greatest challenges of this generation". "It is an important contribution to galvanising public understanding of what can often seem a highly complex topic, but one that goes to the heart of everyone's lives," she said. The event enjoys the direct support of French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande. Anticipating challenges from all camps, WWViews organisers say the information given to citizens has been vetted by a scientific advisory board for accuracy and balance. The World Wide Views method was developed in Denmark from 2008 to address fears of a widening democratic gap between citizens and policy makers on technological and environmental issues which are increasingly co-ordinated by international negotiations. "Experts, industry and interest groups and NGOs have found ways to influence and interact with such negotiations," said Mr Bj\'f6rn Bedsted, "but ordinary citizens have practically no role in these processes."

HOW wrong I was when I said here last week that Irish people got what they voted for when it came to action on climate change! The Irish people didn t vote for shame and that s what they ve got at the COP21 conference in Paris. What a national humiliation it was on Tuesday to hear our Taoiseach telling the assembled nations of Earth that the climate challenge requires action from countries big and small , before moving swiftly on to the voodoo which will lead to carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production . Then to hear his comments to Irish journalists off-piste that the 20% reductions in emissions by 2020 from 2005 levels an EU requirement to which the previous government committed were unrealistic and unreachable : We do not want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce with the abolition of quotas, to find that food is produced in countries with inferior standards and higher emission levels. Pardon the pun, but that s bull. Yes, we can reduce emissions per kilo of meat and dairy. But we also have to change our land use, our export patterns, and our eating habits or we will become the laughing stock of Europe to use a well-worn phrase. But we won t be laughing ourselves because we will be paying out billions in environmental fines. Airtricity founder Eddie O Connor hit the nail on the head yesterday when warning the Government against taking a sleeveen approach to the climate negotiations. He said we should not be seeking derogations which is exactly the negotiating position our Taoiseach talked up yesterday when he said that hard bargaining would take place over the coming weeks to make sure our goals were fair and reasonable . The insider word on what the Taoiseach means by fair is an emissions reduction of between 23% and 25% by 2030 as against Britain, France, and Germany, who will offer 40%. I don t know how you can possibly call that fair . It s precisely the me, me, me attitude which COP21 has seemed to overcome thus far in favour of the first stirrings of genuine global co-operation in world history. Generosity on a global scale will be needed if we are to survive with any comfort on this planet. We may be a small brick in the wall against climate change but if we fall we destabilise the structure, opening the door to more special pleading. It is grotesque to listen to Ireland, out with its begging bowl while over a billion people still live in extreme poverty, often greatly exacerbated by the climate effects of the carbon which the rich world emits. Even as the Government trumpets exchequer returns running 3bn ahead of target. Despite recent difficult economic circumstances , whined the Taoiseach, Ireland has committed 34m to help poor countries adapt to climate change in 2014, and is committed to scaling up this support to 175m to 2020. But this is not new money. It is money already committed to Irish Aid. Do the maths. Multiply the 34m to 2020 and you will see how much extra there is. The Taoiseach also announced that we would begin contributing to the global Green Climate Fund in 2016 with a princely donation of 2m for 2016 and no firm commitment to any other year when we need to contribute 45m to 2020 if we are to get to the European average. Some of this 2m is money which was put aside at the height of the recession by the last Government to purchase carbon credits which we did not need because our emissions went down. Our emissions went down for two reasons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency: Because of the recession and because of our increased use of renewable energy. Possibly the most outrageous thing the Taoiseach said in Paris and the competition is fierce was that our emissions had failed to decrease because of the recession. We have lost a decade of investment in our country because of what happened, he said. That cannot be recovered, and until we have an economic engine to allow us change structures and continue to invest in research and innovation for more sustainable ways of doing agriculture, that presents us with a challenge. Holy God, even I thought we d heard the last of It s not my fault, blame them . I certainly never imagined the recession would be blamed for increasing emissions when it was one of two reasons for decreased emissions. This is made clear by the fact that emissions are going up again under the Taoiseach s watch, with next to nothing being done to replace dirty energy with clean energy. The Government has locked us into 15 more years of burning peat in Edenderry, Loughrea, and Shannonbridge. By the time we have finished burning peat, there will be hardly any left, meaning it can t regenerate itself and can t act as a carbon sink . Meanwhile the burning of filthy coal continues unabated at Moneypoint. And it is only the tireless efforts of activists such as the Good Energy Alliance, Love Leitrim, and Friends of the Earth which are holding fracking at arm s length. Alex White, the natural resources minister, and the Environmental Protection Agency were questioned yesterday by the joint Oireachtas committee on transport and communications amid reports the Government s study on fracking has been compromised by links with the gas and oil industries. The desk research allowing fracking to begin is apparently almost complete. All that is missing is local research in Fermanagh, Leitrim, and Clare but thanks to local activism no tenders have yet been issued. Friends of the Earth s Kate Ruddock said yesterday that the study does not even concern itself with the impact of fracked fuel on the climate and our ability to meet our internationally agreed targets. We are on track to miss our 2020 emissions of a 20% reduction from 2005 levels, presenting instead a 5% reduction. The Government has no serious plan to reverse that trend. The people are marching and the nations are communing. Industry is dramatically shifting capital away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy , according to 350.org, which announced yesterday in Paris that more than 500 institutions representing $3.4 trillion in assets, including the cities of Oslo and Melbourne and Europe s largest insurance company, Allianz, have committed to massive divestment of fossil fuel interests. Meanwhile, we are shaping up to be the laggards of Europe, present-ing the elderly, conservative face of a sleeveen to the planet. And I don t believe that even we deserve that. \</doc>

ELAINE EDWARDS TOM SHIEL Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly has said he will bring a memo to Cabinet next Tuesday seeking funds to cover the full costs of flood damage caused during the storms of the past week. With concerns mounting of further serious flooding around the lower Shannon in the coming days, Taoiseach Enda Kenny yesterday apologised for not visiting badly hit areas and said his presence in Dublin, from where the response was being co-ordinated, was more important at this stage. Speaking on Midwest Radio, he committed to visiting affected towns at an unspecified future date. Communities in areas surrounding the lower Shannon river are on alert with water levels expected to keep rising, possibly peaking by Sunday or Monday. The National Co-ordination Group, which met again yesterday, has warned of some potentially serious flooding in some areas, although others have improved. While the ESB decided against increasing the water discharge rate at Parteen Weir, levels were continuing to rise. On standby In a number of areas - notably Athlone, Ballinasloe and Co Clare - Defence Forces personnel remain on standby and continue to assist. Evelyn Cusack of Met \'c9ireann said there was uncertainty around the weekend's weather conditions, although heavy rain in parts of counties Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Wexford is likely. A circular was sent this week by the Department of Environment to every local authority asking them to give an assessment of the costs of staff deployment and overtime, as well as structural remedial work. The deadline for returning the assessments was 6pm yesterday evening. The information compiled on costs will form the basis of a memorandum seeking emergency funds, which are likely to run to several million euro. Speaking during a break in the COP21 climate change negotiations in Paris yesterday, Mr Kelly accepted repairs and flood defence infrastructure would require substantial budgets in future. "Realistically you are looking at a sizeable amount of money. We need to provide protection for those areas that will be worst affected," he said. Department's response Mr Kelly did not accept severe flooding and weather conditions required him to return from Paris. He said he was speaking to officials on an hourly basis and would return to Ireland tomorrow to co-ordinate his department's response. Some difficulties had been caused by poor planning in the past and, he added, while some flood defences worked well, others had struggled. "You can never have a utopian situation [where everything is protected]. Storms cause unintended consequences," he said. "What we must do is prepare ourselves in the best way possible after this event." \</doc>

Global warming could elevate disease, ravage crops and push 100 million more people into poverty without action to prevent it, the World Bank has warned in a disturbing new report. The problem of climate change is already hampering efforts to reduce poverty, the Bank said, and the poorest people are already suffering more than others from lower rainfall and extreme weather tied to warming. The report, "Shock Waves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty," sounded an alarm for the need for tough action at the COP-21 Paris global summit on climate change. On Friday, the United Nations warned that nations' carbon-cutting pledges go nowhere near far enough to prevent warming, and that much greater commitments are needed at the 30 November-11 December summit. The World Bank report said the most impoverished people in the world are already being hurt badly by extreme events tied to the warming trend, including heat waves, drought and flooding, because they are both more dependent on the land and live in regions more at risk that lack good public services. \</doc>

Paul Melia Environment Editor THE Government will announce new funding in the coming weeks to help developing nations fight climate change, Environment Minister Alan Kelly has said. The move comes after Taoiseach Enda Kenny was sharply criticised last week after he said Ireland would contribute just (EURO)2m next year to the so-called 'Green Climate Fund', with no commitment beyond 2016. It would be in addition to the (EURO)175m Ireland has already committed towards climate change adaptation between 2016-2020. The Green Climate Fund aims to raise $100bn a year in finance from governments and the private sector by 2020. "I'm very confident of bringing something in the next few weeks in relation to our ambitions to improve funding for climate finance," Mr Kelly said. "I would say you will see a reasonable and recognisable rise. What I want to see brought forward is something to show that Ireland is going to be ambitious and play its part, but it will be up to (future) governments to decide their allocations." The minister said that today and tomorrow will be "critical" in determining whether the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) will be judged a success. Issues yet to be addressed included whether a deal would be legally-binding, which Mr Kelly said was "completely and utterly necessary". A "level playing field" was necessary, he added, with larger developing countries expected to play their part. But he said demands from NGOs that average global temperature rises be no more than 1.5C - and not 2C - are unlikely to be met. However, 1.5C could be a goal in the final text. Under current commitments, the emission cuts pledged by countries will only limit rises to 2.7C - well above the 2C considered a 'safe' limit. "The 1.5C is extremely ambitious but I think at a political level I'd be saying walk before we can run," Mr Kelly said. "Let's try and achieve 2C, let's be ambitious with the 1.5C, but let's also ensure we have something everyone can sign up to and be realistic. I will be pushing for a reduction of below 2C. Whether that is politically achievable remains to be seen." Ireland, along with Austria and Romania, is directly involved in negotiations around how mitigation measures can be put in place before any deal comes into effect from 2020. \</doc>

The update this week by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on greenhouse gas emissions makes grim reading: Ireland is falling behind the 2020 targets for reductions agreed with the EU by as much as 50 per cent. The EPA is an independent body and its brief includes raising public awareness and advising on policy. It has never been noted for stridency. Indeed, some have accused it of being a watchdog that hardly ever barks. This makes its analysis of the position on climate change all the more disturbing. "Current and planned policies and measures are not sufficient to meet the 2020 targets," the agency states baldly. It goes on to warn that this situation casts doubt "over efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy in the long term". The language is subdued but, on any reading, this report makes a mockery of the Taoiseach's call at the UN's COP21 meeting in Paris last December "to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability" of future generations. The outgoing Government's agenda in this area has been in practice the reverse of this admirable long-term vision. It devoted its energies to pursuing a short-term bonanza for the dairy industry after milk quotas were lifted; this despite the overwhelming evidence that the FoodWise 2025 policy of rapidly expanding dairy (and beef) production will put us further behind our emissions targets with every passing year. Likewise, there was no sign that the Government was willing to invest in transport initiatives to reduce dependence on private cars and fossil fuels. The current model of economic growth is again producing short-term jobs, but it needs to be radically reshaped and redirected if it is to lead towards - and not away from - the low-to-zero carbon future to which we supposedly aspire. The detail of the EPA report makes it clear that Ireland needs to be cutting emissions in the agriculture and transport sectors especially. Reductions in other sectors, like residential and commercial heating and the creation of increased carbon sinks through judicious forestry plantation, are welcome. But they do not come close to compensating for the drastically negative trend on our farms and on our roads. Given the linkage between climate change and recent storms and flooding, and the prospect of more to come, it is extraordinary that none of the four big political parties showed any awareness of the seriousness of this issue during the election campaign. If a vision including future generations is too much to expect from whatever government now emerges, perhaps the prospect of EU fines of EUR 60 million a year (and rising) from 2020 onwards for failing to meet emissions targets might concentrate its mind. This is a sad comment on the state of national politics on the centenary of the high-minded 1916 proclamation. \</doc>

President Michael D Higgins yesterday called on people to reject climate change deniers. In an address in Paris on the destructive environmental threats posed to earth, he said those who are most affected by drought, floods, fire and intense weather must be at the centre of any response. "We need to break away from a destructive relationship with the diversity that is life on our planet towards a new paradigm of existence, one that will be built on the respect we must have for the wonderment and renewal of nature," Mr Higgins said. Mr Higgins was in Paris to attend the Summit of Consciences for the Climate following an invitation by French president Francois Hollande. The day-long conference was designed to raise awareness of the threat from climate change ahead of the COP21 conference on climate change in Paris in December. Other attendees invited included ex-UN secretary-general KofiAnnan, former president Mary Robinson, religious leaders and ex-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In a direct appeal, Mr Higgins said there needed to be inclusive, humane and non-judgmental engagement with the voices of those most affected by climate change. "We must begin with an acceptance of the evidence of science. It is now clear that failure to respond to the scientific reality of climate change may ultimately lead to the destruction of life on our planet," he said. "The first ethical test is in accepting that there can be no compromise with truth." Despite warning about the threat posed to the planet, Mr Higgins also said there is cause for optimism. "I perceive among the populations of the world, and especially among the young, a search for beauty and a yet retained sense of awe at the harmony of nature," he said. "Among the elders of the planet there is also a respect for the potential of the inherited wisdom of the world to inform institutions and policies in new circumstances." Mr Higgins also asked if succeeding in tackling climate change would not be the greatest of all human achievements. "When history records the actions we take or fail to take at this our moment of truth, we will not have the excuse that we did not understand, that we did not know. We have been gifted, in a global communications order, with the knowledge and the opportunity to act," he said. Mr Higgins also suggested the world's leaders should look to the example set after the Second World War while he also attacked the rampant consumerism in many countries. "Extreme individualism manifesting itself as insatiable consumption and accompanied by unconscionable levels of inequality, characterises much of what is regarded as the developed part of our planet," he said. \</doc>

The UN conference on climate change that has just opened in Paris holds out the promise of a major step forward in tackling the huge problem of climate change. In the past, the problem was that only a limited number of countries, covering a minority of the world's population, was prepared to commit to action. This time, a majority of countries, covering the bulk of the world's population (and of its greenhouse gas emissions), acknowledge the importance of tackling the problem. The individual national commitments will not, on their own, halt global warming, but they represent a major step towards developing a successful worldwide response. The key to tackling global warming, which is caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily from energy, is to find energy sources that are "clean". While there are already opportunities to generate a significant part of our energy needs from clean sources, these are, as yet, very expensive. The implementation of a wide programme of renewable energy in Germany has added 6.5 cents per unit to the cost of electricity for households. While Germany is able to afford this cost, and the resulting negative impact on households' living standards and national competitiveness, it is not a solution that will be easily replicated elsewhere. This means that, even for rich countries, a switch to clean energy today could prove very expensive. For developing countries, at today's prices, such a switch could only occur at the expense of a serious reduction in already low living standards and future development. Cheap option However, the cost of clean energy has already fallen a long way from its exceptional level in the early 1990s, when the urgency of tackling climate change first appeared on the world's agenda. The key to finding a solution to the problem of climate change is to make clean energy the cheap option. If that goal can be achieved, emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels will fall dramatically. A two-pronged strategy is required: first, invest public funds in research and development to bring down the cost of clean energy; second, raise the cost of pollution, reflecting the damage done to the environment, to encourage the necessary private sector investment. While technological development through research and innovation can potentially provide a solution, there is no guarantee that a particular investment programme will succeed. The EU, over a number of decades, has spent about EUR 10 billion of public money in the hunt for clean energy from nuclear fusion. However, to date this has proved to be something of a wild goose chase. This highlights the problems we face. It is likely that a very large budget will be needed to invest in the necessary research and development, representing a significant burden for taxpayers across the developed world. However, governments are not good at picking winning technologies. Probably the best approach is to move on many fronts simultaneously, experimenting with different technologies. In the case of Ireland, some of our public research budget is going on wave energy, in spite of the fact that it does not look likely to be economic in Ireland. However, because one cannot be certain about its economics, it is valid to allocate some of the limited research budget to this field. John Hicks was one of the leading economists of the 20th century, winning the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972. As early as 1932, he explained how raising the price of a good, such as energy, will induce successful research that will eventually reduce the need for that expensive factor. In the 1970s oil prices rocketed, causing major economic disruption to OECD economies. The result was a huge amount of research across the world by companies, large and small, into ways to save energy. A decade later this research paid off for many companies and consumers, resulting in a major increase in energy efficiency. The fuel efficiency of cars was dramatically increased in the 1980s, as was the efficiency of electricity generation. Innovation This shows that when prices rise, companies smell future profit from successful innovation. The bigger the market for that innovation the bigger the potential pay-off and the bigger the potential research effort by companies. Because the price of oil rose for the whole world, the potential pay-off from successful research was huge in the late 1970s. This example also shows that, instead of relying purely on taxpayer-funded research, the successful development of clean energy is likely to rely heavily on investment by the private sector. A decade ago the EU embarked on an ambitious programme to tackle climate change. Among other policies, it was intended that the cost of emitting greenhouse gases would rise substantially. Instead, the policy failed to raise the price of pollution as expected, disappointing investors in clean technologies. Clean energy Paris may well see a welcome worldwide substantial increase in government-funded investment in research into clean energy technologies. However, to be fully successful, the EU, and hopefully some other major trading blocs, will need to take effective measures to raise the cost of emitting greenhouse gases. Higher prices will discourage us from using polluting energy and, in addition, as Hicks suggested, it will signal to private sector investors that there is a lot of money to be made from saving the planet. The medium-term cost of this strategy will obviously be higher costs for households. In the long term, however, if cheap, clean technologies are developed, future generations, whether in Ireland or the developing world, will benefit from cheaper clean energy. It could also save the planet from global warming. \</doc>

UN CLIMATE talks have entered a critical stage as negotiators race against time to produce an ambitious deal by tomorrow's deadline. Delegates from almost 200 countries worked into the early hours of this morning as the French presidency of the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) released a draft text of a deal, which runs to just 29 pages. Crucially, it includes a demand from vulnerable nations to limit average temperature increases to no more than 1.5C. But NGOs have criticised the omission of the aviation and shipping sectors from any deal, and said that many key issues remained unresolved. Among the issues yet to be decided is an agreement on limiting average global temperature rises to prevent dangerous climate change - options include a maximum of 2C, 'well below' 2C or below 1.5C. There are also ongoing discussions about funding for vulnerable countries to help them adapt, and the different levels of responsibility which will apply to developed and developing countries, known as differentiation. A major issue which had to be finalised was verification, where country pledges to reduce emissions could be confirmed, he said. "The temperature of the text is being taken at the moment but it looks very positive," he said. "I think the major stumbling block is transparency, and how it is measured. I believe that the sharing of information is the one key issue that needs to be resolved. You ultimately are down to three or four core issues." But Dr Lorna Gold, from aid agency Trocaire, said she was disappointed with the progress to date. "The mood music is better, but we're very concerned that many of the critical issues remain undecided," she said. "The language on key issues such as food security and human rights has been worsened in this updated text. Positive references have been removed, while worrying and inappropriate language remains." COP president Laurent Fabius said the number of points to be clarified by ministers had been reduced by 75pc, and that he was "absolutely convinced" there would be an agreement. On the long-term goal of decarbonising the economy, the draft text presents two very different options - one suggests reducing emissions between 40pc-70pc by 2050, or by 70pc-95pc in the same period. It also calls for a reduction to zero emissions "by the end" or "by the middle" of the century. The second calls for longterm low global emissions over the course of the century, which is a source of concern for observers as it fails to tie down an ambitious target. The text also calls for a review of the deal, but a timeline has not been decided. \</doc>

Efforts to reach a historic global agreement on climate change entered a critical stage last night as it became clear a new text has not overcome major faultlines over global warming. With a little over 24 hours to go before the deadline set by the French presidency for COP21 to conclude, deep divisions over three major issues remained far from being reconciled. The new cleaner text was published yesterday afternoon and had been reduced from 43 pages to 29 pages. For the first time the text gave two (and occasionally three) explicit options on key issues. On the core matter of the limit of global temperature increase, three options were offered: below 2 degrees Celsius; well below 2 degree Celsius with a textual reference to moving towards 1.5 degrees Celsius; or, thirdly, to below 1.5 degree Celsius. Crunch issues The crunch issues were identified by the COP president, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, as: financing (the amount paid by rich countries to poorer countries to respond to climate change); ambition (the speed and intensity of the shift to zero emissions in the long term) and differentiation. Until now under differentiation rules only rich countries have been obliged to reduce emissions, but the US and others want quickly-developing countries to begin to reduce emissions, a position that has been strongly opposed by those countries, which includes India and China. Mr Fabius said a further new draft would be published this afternoon. "It will be as close as possible to what the agreement would be on Friday. It's not the final text but an additional step forward." However, reaction to the text from negotiators was mixed last night. While praising the French approach to the process, the European Union expressed broad disappointment at the ambition levels. It was particularly critical of the exclusion of aviation and marine emissions. Other delegates spoke of the lack of balance in the text with the G77 group led by South Africa criticising the provisions over adaptation and loss and damage. Crucially, there was strong support for the view that the French draft text provided the basis for an agreement. The talks received another impetus when US secretary of state John Kerry announced it would be doubling its funding to climate-vulnerable countries to $5 billion a year. "We are prepared to do our part, and we will not leave the most vulnerable nations among us to, quite literally, weather the storm alone." Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly expressed cautious optimism at Le Bourget last night. "Unlike Copenhagen there is not a wide range of issues that need to be resolved . . . It is likely to go through the night. By Thursday we will know the shape of the agreement," said Mr Kelly. \</doc>

President Fran\'e7ois Hollande s Socialist government adopted state of emergency legislation following the November 13 Islamist militant attacks that left 130 people dead, and it plans to extend the measures for a further three months after they expire next month. Opponents say the increased police powers and restrictions on public gatherings damage democracy and are ineffective in tackling terrorist threats. The debate has become intense as the government has pursued plans to deprive convicted terrorists of French nationality. Paris attracted the biggest march as 5,500 protesters, according to a police estimate, went from the Republic square through central Paris. The organisers said 20,000 joined the Paris protest. Smaller marches took place in Toulouse and Marseille as part of protests planned in 70 towns. I think it s more than dangerous, the extension of the state of emergency, said Alexandra Scappaticci, one of the protesters in Paris. It has already been used during the COP 21 (climate talks) to lock down demonstrators who had nothing to do with terrorism, so I think that if it is extended, I don t know what more they could use it for, but in any case, it will not prevent terrorism. The Socialist government has the backing of most French people for the emergency measures and the wider use of nationality-stripping, opinion polls show. But it has angered some left-wing political allies, and justice minister Christiane Taubira, who had deep reservations about the reforms, resigned last week. \</doc>

Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which is to be held in Paris next month, a seminar on the topic, held in Bray, Co Wicklow, at the weekend, revealed the extent of our vulnerability, as an island off an island. As the seminar s host, MEP Sean Kelly noted, rising sea levels, increased precipitation and flood risks would prove hugely costly, both socially and economically. A keynote address at the Paris conference will be given by Britain s Prince Charles, who believes that climate change could be one of the causes of the civil war in Syria, of terrorism, and of Europe s refugee crisis. One of the reasons for the civil war in Syria is a drought that has lasted for almost six years and which has meant the exodus of huge numbers of people from their parched land. Often derided as a tree-hugging fanatic, the prince s fears are well-grounded and we ignore them at our peril. \</doc>

Sir, - I have observed and participated closely in the Irish energy and climate change debate over recent years and am heartened to see the rise in associated discussion in The Irish Times , particularly as a result of the COP21 climate change summit in Paris. As a scientist, citizen and father, I see the protection of our planet for future generations as our shared number one priority. However, our national energy policy is a shambles and shows no signs of improving through the soon to be published White Paper on energy. Major vested interests continue to have the most influential voices. The Department of Energy and successive governments remain convinced that using wind energy almost exclusively as our renewable energy source is the best path forward. However, the Environmental Protection Agency clearly reported in 2013 that even if we achieve our nominal target of 40 per cent electricity through renewable sources by 2020, that we will achieve less than half of our corresponding greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. As New Scientist What the powerful wind energy lobby endeavours to keep quiet is that the variability and intermittency of wind energy, in addition to lack of viable energy storage solutions, result in the need for our fossil fuel-based energy plants to run in cycling mode in the background for when there is either too much or too little wind. This inefficiency results in only a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, when using wind energy as the primary renewable energy source. The obvious starting point for us nationally and globally is energy usage reduction and not expansion of energy generation. This approach saves money, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and actually creates jobs, such as retrofitting buildings to reduce energy needs. Every citizen in this country needs to get the unspun facts and contribute to the energy and climate change discussion. It's critical to our future. - Yours, etc, DARYL KENNEDY, PhD Co Westmeath. Sir, - Your editorial of December 5th on the climate change conference in Paris rightly highlights the fact that the rhetoric of the conference "must give way to action" to curb global warming. An Taisce finds fault with the fact that Ireland is seeking an exemption for agriculture. It advocates that Ireland shut down its beef production in large areas of the country and convert the land to forestry. Your editorial says that instead of asking for major cuts in agriculture, the alternative could be to "make meaningful commitments . . . on eliminating peat and coal-burning power plants and on fossil fuel extraction, including fracking". As any action is going to have a big impact on the livelihoods of many Irish people, this debate is going to get much more attention in the years ahead. Decisions on what actions are necessary are not going to be easy. - Yours, etc, A LEAVY, Sutton, Dublin 13. \</doc>

Irish motorists could help cut transport carbon emissions in Ireland by 70 per cent over 10 years by choosing one of more than 300 models of car, according to a leading climate scientist. Prof Kevin Anderson, of the University of Manchester, also said retrofitting the State's housing stock over 15 years would eliminate fuel poverty, which affects between 200,000 and 300,000 homes. And introducing stringent efficiency standards on electrical equipment would also contribute to a significant reduction in energy demand. The professor of energy and climate change was speaking at the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin on the achievements and failures following the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) climate change summit in Paris in December. Prof Anderson had earlier given a private briefing on climate change to President Michael D Higgins, along with Prof Barry McMullin of DCU, who is chairman of An Taisce's climate committee. The two men briefed the President at \'c1ras an Uachtar\'e1in after Mr Higgins had expressed interest in an update on climate issues. 'Complete and abject failure' Speaking at the institute, Prof Anderson said everything needed to be known about climate change and how to mitigate its effects was known 25 years ago but, in the interim, carbon emissions had risen by more than 60 per cent and that was "a quarter century of complete and abject failure". He said there was no chance of keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and only "an outside chance" of meeting the 2 degree target. It would require a 10 per cent reduction in emissions year on year from this year. He also said Ireland should have a moratorium on hydrocarbon developments, including fracking. "If we're serious about climate change - no shale gas, no offshore oil or gas for Ireland." Road transport Speaking about transport emissions, he said in the EU and US private road transport was responsible for 12-15 per cent of emissions. However, there were now more than 300 models of petrol and diesel cars with less than 100g of CO2/km, and "they have no price premium. They look like normal cars," he said. "They fit every normal category except for the sports SUV vehicles." He estimated the average car in Ireland used 170g of C02/km and the average car being sold produced 130-140g of C02/km, because of the EU requirement for cars to average 130g, which was still "way above the average of cars available". This figure did not include hybrid or electric cars. He said a move towards models with less than 100g of CO2/km would result in a 70 per cent reduction in transport-sector emissions. "That's all you require - but we're not even bothered to do that." Prof Anderson also said retrofitting homes would greatly cut energy demands. Retrofitting every home in Ireland would cost an average of EUR 40,000, amounting to EUR 48 billion over 15 years, or EUR 3 billion a year, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of GDP. \</doc>

World leaders, including UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon and Pope Francis, have made emotive pleas to the almost 200 countries involved in the global climate summit to reach a historic solution in the final week of negotiations. Government ministers begin high-level talks in Paris today on the 48-page draft accord completed on Saturday evening at the COP21 summit. Among those in Paris to participate in what are seen as difficult negotiations are US secretary of state John Kerry and Ireland's Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly. Minister for Communications and Energy Alex White will also attend the venue at Le Bourget today for 'Energy Day'. Delivering his homily in the Vatican yesterday, the pope said: "What kind of world do we want to pass on to those who come after us, to the children who are growing up?" He said every effort should be made in Paris to mitigate the impact of climate change, as well as tackling "poverty and [letting] human dignity flourish." Urgent plea The UN secretary general Mr Ban said yesterday that he was confident an ambitious agreement could be reached. "I am urging member states to look beyond their national boundaries. Climate change does not respect national boundaries. It impacts all throughout the world and, therefore, we have to have a global vision, global solidarity. "The sea level is rising. Global temperatures are warming. This year, 2015, is the warmest year in human history. Therefore, there is no time to lose. We need to take action now." The week-long technical talks culminated with the publication of the draft on Saturday night. There was general agreement of much greater progress than at a similar stage of the Copenhagen talks six years ago. However, many central issues have not been resolved. There are still a few hundred brackets (representing contested text) in the document. "The crunch issues are still to be decided. Ministers will be arriving on Monday and those crunch issues will come down to the wire," said Dr Diarmuid Torney, an expert on climate change policy from DCU who is attending the summit. He said these included the debate over what should be the maximum average increase in global temperatures: 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius. "There is differentiation, which is how developed and richer countries should act compared to less developed countries. There is the question of transparency. That's how countries report on their issues and whether or not other countries can trust the statistics." Dr Torney said future ambition and finance were other huge areas of contention. In particular there remains a massive shortfall in the annual EUR 100 billion sought from richer countries towards funding mitigation in poorer counties. Before his arrival Mr Kelly addressed criticisms of Ireland's approach to climate change. He said the agriculture sector had reduced emissions considerably and that the EUR 2 million committed to the Green Climate Fund was "only a start". \</doc>

Four of Ireland s leading experts will share their views on what climate change target compliance could mean for Ireland s agri-food sector. The event, sponsored by the Department of Agriculture s climate change and bio-energy division, will be held at the Horse and Jockey Hotel. It will focus on the far-reaching implications for the agri-food sector. It will also highlight what is being done to build climate resilient food production systems and reduce emissions. The forum will be the first opportunity since the Paris Climate Conference ( COP 21 ) for ASA members and others involved in the industry to learn more about its outcomes and what they will mean for Irish agriculture. John Muldowney, climate change and bio-energy division, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; Ois\'edn Coghlan, director, Friends of The Earth; Paul Nolan, Irish Centre for High-End Computing; and Pat Murphy, head of environmental knowledge transfer in Teagasc, will be the panelists. ASA vice-president Mary Delaney said the purpose of the forum will be to build awareness of climate change among those who are working in Irish agriculture while, at the same time, creating a platform for meaningful debate. This is an opportunity for people from right across the world of agriculture to come together to discuss current research and to investigate what climate change target compliance can mean for the agri-food sector in Ireland as it strives to increase production in line with Food Wise 2025 objectives, she said. \</doc>

One storm doesn't mean our climate has irrecoverably changed, but the events of the past week certainly paint an apocalyptic picture of a future ravaged by extreme weather events. Storm Desmond has caused utter devastation across large parts of the country, with householders, businesses and ultimately the Government facing a massive clean-up bill. And the science tells us we should get used to more of the same - extreme winter-weather events, coupled with summer droughts - which will become more frequent as climate change takes hold. It highlights the great dilemma facing every nation across the globe - Governments get elected by promising to grow the economy, but that growth comes at an environmental cost. The Coalition is committed to reducing emissions over time and the weather events of the past week are yet another example of why we need to. However, half the population remain unconvinced that climate change is a serious issue requiring urgent attention. Could Storm Desmond be the catalyst to change the minds of that 50pc and make them begin to sit up and take notice? We are not alone in displaying an unwillingness to address climate change, believing it's a problem for future generations. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows a slight drop in the number of people across the EU who believe it is the single most serious problem facing humanity. Just one in four believes they have personal responsibility for tackling it. That's borne out in the comments made by almost 150 heads of state gathered in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). But behind the rhetoric lay cold, hard electoral politics, exemplified by Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who told the UN climate summit that while all countries had to play their part, Ireland would not jeopardise its economic recovery and tackle agriculture emissions in the near future. He was clearly courting the votes of 140,000 farming families in the run-up to next year's General Election, but he wasn't alone in speaking out of both sides of his mouth. The world's biggest emitter, China - which this week raised warnings about air pollution to their highest level - is seen as likely to support a weak deal, despite making all the right noises during the plenary. India has genuine concerns about its economic growth being curtailed, and while the US is committed to an ambitious deal, it's worth noting that Barack Obama is on his way out of office. Back in 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, when he was less than a year in the White House, Obama's administration was widely seen as scuppering an ambitious agreement due in part to domestic opposition. There's still the very real prospect of Congress refusing to ratify any deal. But the inaction to date flies in the face of science. Climate change is already happening, despite what sceptics would have us believe. Even oil-rich country Saudi Arabia accepts this. Average temperatures in Ireland and across the globe are up almost 1\'b0 C this century. Last winter was the stormiest on record. Some of the highest global temperatures on record have been seen in the last decade, with 2015 looking like being the hottest ever. We are experiencing more frequent flooding, and it's going to get worse. Research from the University of Oxford also suggests that greenhouse gas emissions released to date have increased the likelihood of winter storms by as much as 25pc. It's no longer a question of 'if' but 'when' the worst effects become a feature of our weather. And therein lies the problem. How do you mitigate against further change, while allowing economies to grow? The costs of tackling warming are put at less than 1pc of global GDP, an enormous amount but not that much in the grander scheme of things. The costs of inaction will be far higher, as nations spend billions installing flood defences and replacing damaged infrastructure, dealing with food poverty and coping with climate refugees forced to flee their homes. Fewer cars on the road mean less fossil fuels are burnt, improving air quality and public health. Less traffic means less wear and tear and lower road-maintenance costs, and money for other public services. We need to focus on what we're good at, and look at where we could improve. We're good at producing food sustainably, but we don't debate the fact that 30,000 farms have an output of less than (EURO)4,000 a year - could these farmers, many part-time, be encouraged to move away from beef and dairy to forestry or biomass, for example? Our focus on renewables is helping reduce emissions, but many communities are opposed. What policies can be enacted to encourage take up? A stake in projects? Limiting a wind farm's lifespan to 20 years? Or should we continue to send money to oil and gas-rich nations, many with dubious records on human rights? We have made positive strides towards energy efficiency, and our domestic retro-fitting programme has cut heating bills and created jobs. But we could be doing more, particularly on public buildings, which would give the Government more money for public services. We must also ask if we really need to change the car, or upgrade the television, when the old one works perfectly well? We throw away as much as 30pc of the food we buy - not only a waste of money but a waste of the water, fertilisers and feed required to produce that food. Growing the economy and reducing emissions appear to be mutually exclusive goals, in the short to medium-term at least. But the trick is to achieve growth with the least environmental HYPERLINK http://www.impact.No www.impact.No one is suggesting that growth be curbed or farmers forced off the land. What is being suggested is a bit of wit and ambition to help reduce risk, otherwise Ireland faces being left behind as the world moves to a low-carbon future. An interesting study was published during COP21 , which asked the UK public how much they were willing to pay to fight climate change. The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Policy, revealed not very much, about \£327 a year, which researchers said amounted to no more than the cost of a year's stamps. Among the reasons? "A belief that climate change is caused by nature allows some people to absolve themselves of responsibility toward those who will be negatively impacted by climate change," they wrote. It is nature that is the cause of problems for so many families this weekend. That in itself should give pause for thought and reflection on what is happening to our planet and our seeming unwillingness to do anything about it. How do you mitigate against further change, while still allowing economies to grow? \</doc>

Electricity interconnectors linking Ireland to France and Britain, as well as two North-South interconnectors, are included in a list of "key" energy development initiatives planned by the European Commission. The commission announced the 195 infrastructure projects as part of its efforts to build an "Energy Union" through the greater integration of Europe's disjointed energy systems. The Energy Union seeks to reduce energy costs, ensure security of supply and help develop a low carbon economy, said Ruth Deasy at the commission office in Dublin. It also wants to diversify energy sources by linking in renewables and would help bring an end to the "energy isolation" of some member states, including Ireland. 'Priority' "It is a priority for Europe," Ms Deasy said. "So much has happened over the last six months. Fossil fuels are in regions with great instability and this makes it more urgent we have security of supply but also at an affordable cost. The Energy Union is one of 10 key political priorities for the Juncker Commission." The Energy Union also deals with reduction of carbon emissions. The updated plans were released in anticipation of the international COP21 climate change conference set to take place in Paris from November 30-December 11. "We are coming up to the Paris conference with targets we have to square up to. We need to move towards a low carbon economy," she said. The list of projects is an updated version of the "Projects of Common Interest" first adopted in October 2013. It includes 108 electricity, 77 gas, seven oil and three smart grid projects. The key focus for Ireland is greater integration through more electricity and gas interconnectors. A number of potential Irish projects have been dropped, but key interconnectors remain, for example the "Celtic Interconnector" linking Great Island in Wexford with La Martyre in France. Others include a Great Island to Pembroke, Wales interconnector known as "Greenline", and another linking Co Derry with Islay, Argyll. This would provide an entry point for electricity coming from offshore wind farms proposed for the north Irish Sea. Costs Two North-South links are still on the list including an interconnector between Turleenan, Co Tyrone, and either Woodland, Co Meath, or Srananagh, Co Sligo. Funding should "in principle" come from the market, the EU said. But given the large costs, bodies such as the European Fund for Strategic Investment would help with investment. The document from the commission was an "important landmark" on assessing how member states were performing in terms of 2020 energy and climate targets, Ibec said. Given the "unusual structure" of Irish emissions, however, climate targets would be the most challenging issue related to the Energy Union, the body said. Greenpeace was highly critical of the Energy Union's "lack of ambition" on development of renewable energy. The focus should be on decarbonisation, energy independence and self-sufficiency, it said. Ireland already has an east-west subsea electricity interconnector linking Rush, Co Dublin and north Wales. There is one North South link that connects Co Louth and Armagh. \</doc>

In an address in Paris on the environmental threats posed to earth, Mr Higgins said those who are most affected by drought, floods, fire, and intense weather must be at the centre of any response. We need to break away from a destructive relationship with the diversity that is life on our planet towards a new paradigm of existence, one that will be built on the respect we must have for the wonderment and renewal of nature, the President said. President Higgins was in Paris to attend the Summit of Consciences for the Climate. The day-long conference was designed to raise awareness of the threat from climate change ahead of the COP21 conference on climate change in Paris in December. Other attendees invited included ex-UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, former president Mary Robinson, religious leaders and ex-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In a direct appeal, President Higgins said there had to be inclusive, humane and non-judgmental engagement with the voices of those most affected by climate change. We must begin with an acceptance of the evidence of science. It is now clear that failure to respond to the scientific reality of climate change may ultimately lead to the destruction of life on our planet, said President Higgins. We must therefore unequivocally reject the position of those who would obscure the scientific reality of climate change in their protection of any narrow and short-term self-interest. The first ethical test is in accepting that there can be no compromise with truth. Despite warning about the threat posed to the planet, Mr Higgins also said there is cause for optimism. I perceive among the populations of the world, and especially among the young, a search for beauty and a yet retained sense of awe at the harmony of nature. Among the elders of the planet, there is also a respect for the potential of the inherited wisdom of the world to inform institutions and policies in new circumstances. President Higgins also asked if succeeding in tackling climate change would not be the greatest of all human achievements. When history records the actions we take or fail to take at this our moment of truth, we will not have the excuse that we did not understand, that we did not know, he said. We have been gifted, in a global communications order, with the knowledge and the opportunity to act. President Higgins also suggested world s leaders should look to the example set after the Second World War, while he also attacked the rampant consumerism in many countries. Extreme individualism manifesting itself as insatiable consumption and accompanied by unconscionable levels of inequality, characterises much of what is regarded as the developed part of our planet, said President Higgins. Meanwhile, Earth dialled the heat up in June, smashing warm temperature records for both the month and the first half of the year. There is no way that 2015 isn t going to be the warmest on record, said Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \</doc>

What if we're wrong about climate change? What has art got to say about it, and how can it help? With COP21 , the next conference on the subject, due in Paris this December, those converted to the cause are wondering how to get their arguments across. Perhaps Nora Hickey M'Sichili was thinking of some recent advice when she curated Et Si On S'\'c9tait Tromp\'e9?/What If We Got It Wrong? , currently at the Centre Culturel Irlandais (CCI) in Paris. Simon Kuper had suggested in the Financial Times that lessons could be learned from "the improbably successful gay marriage campaign": keep the message positive, immediate and, crucially, not too liberal. The exhibition, which will tour in Ireland in 2016, takes its title from a Lemn Sissay poem: "what if our wanting more was making less? / And what if all of this wasn't progress?" This sets the tone for a show that deliberately avoids polemic, in which the work of 19 artists flirts with questions of nature versus culture, climate change, the meaning of progress and our undoing of the natural world. These include gently delicate Blaise Drummond paintings, of snowscapes and sensitive plants, people colourful yet small in a whitened world, and brave structures almost lost in Arctic vastness. Drummond had gone to the Arctic in 2014 on a commission to create a travel book for Louise Vuitton. Ruth Le Gear also went to the Arctic, and her 2012 video is a poetic reflection on a landscape in infinitesimal flux, yet the sense of timelessness is undermined by the accompanying cracking sounds of melting icebergs all around. Arctic artists Sissay's What If? Solar Reserve , offers a warmer alternative. Here, Gerrard focuses on the circling structure of a huge Nevada solar power plant. The final installation, editions of which are in now in the permanent collections of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, hints at religious ceremonies, tracing a line from sun worship to our current adoration of technology. This image simultaneously calls to mind both spaceship and planet. It's a marvellous piece, reflecting both humanity's ability to do huge things and our minuscule presence in the magnitude of the solar system. Sheep farming in Leitrim may seem like a small thing, but Hungarian artist Brigitta Varadi, now based in Leitrim, perhaps gets closest to the heart of the dilemma embodied in the challenge of What If We Got It Wrong? with her enticing ox mountain sheepskin sofa, from the 2015 Markings series. Changes in farm pricing and policy mean that it is frequently cheaper for farmers to bury the wool of their sheep, which once clothed swathes of northern Europeans against the cold, than it is to refine it for sale. How far can we come from material and making without losing any possibility of finding the way back? Tubes Scale is again at play in S\'e9amus Dunbar's What Lies Beneath , 2015, a collection of plastic tubes, each construction two metres wide by two metres tall. On the top of the central structure sits a tiny model of the Eiffel Tower. This is Dunbar's reimagining of a shale gas extraction (fracking) operation, as seen at 1:1,000, above ground. Installed in the elegant courtyard of the CCI, it gives pause for thought, not least about the lack of opportunities for genuine discussion about future energy options: each side seems to claim absolute territory, and any call for consideration of a middle ground can be taken as tantamount to capitulation to the ideas of the enemy. The arguments at play in What If We Got It Wrong? are gentle ones. Christine Mackey explores the world of seed banks, in places as diverse as Norway, Russia and Iraq. These are the places in which seeds are stored against potential extinction, which is something small to be positive about in an any end-of-days scenario. Mackey undercuts such an idea by noting that the fortress-like Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway is part-funded by GM giants Monsanto and Syngenta. Overall, the works in the exhibition carry a sense of hope, even if only the hope of the endurance of beauty in a destroyed world. However, Frank McDonald's accompanying commissioned essay is bleaker stuff, as he takes the opportunity to note how government policy is still driven by clientelism. Short term trumps long term, it seems, even when the consequences may last for millennia. Beguilingly beautiful The exhibition is aesthetically satisfying - the works by Gerrard, Le Gear and Alice Clark, for example, are beguilingly beautiful - and even while it prefers suggestions of ideas, rather than aggressive statement making, what emerges most strongly is the idea that there are alternatives to current political thinking. This is summed up in the conclusion of Darragh McKeon's specially commissioned short story: "The fanaticism of our globalised economic system insists that growth, expansion, accumulation is equal to progress. It proclaims, with the unwavering certainty of the fundamentalist, that no alternative is possible. And this is simply not true. Tens of thousands of years of tribes and communities, living in every corner of the planet, stand in refutation of this claim." Whether those alternatives can ever gain any currency in our dominant global- capitalist-driven societies is another question entirely. A pleasant 20-minute stroll across the Seine from the CCI, at the Pompidou Centre, Sugar Metropolis , by Northern Irish artists Brendan Jamison and Mark Revels, is haunted by the ghost of another idea so wrong that it's hard to believe any rational mind could ever have been convinced by it: slavery. Their sweetly glistening, interactive imaginary city, made entirely from sugar, sprawls across a basement space. Get down on its level to be drawn into its world. Commissions have taken the pair around the globe, from Berlin to Beijing, Los Angeles to London, though perhaps the most surprising one has been the permanent installation of one of their sugar sculptures at 10 Downing Street. The publication of the University of London's research on reparations to British slave owners following abolition makes for shocking reading (see the database online at ucl.ac.uk/lbs). Many of the beneficiaries were the owners of sugar plantations, and yes, they included relatives of current British prime minister David Cameron. Reparations amounted to 40 per cent of the treasury's annual budget at the time. The slaves themselves got nothing. It's an unsavoury reflection. Et Si On S'\'c9tait Tromp\'e9?/What If We Got It Wrong? is at the Centre Culturel Irlandais (CCI), Paris, until November 11th. It will tour to venues in Ireland in 2016.

They wouldn t be there for long, though, as the tourist spot is being battered by winds of up to 170km an hour. We have already experienced three major storms here in the past month. Storm Abagail at the beginning of last month was quickly followed by Storm Barney and now Storm Clodagh is sweeping us off our feet. From storms to floods, extreme weather events that we might have expected every 50 years or so are now coming our way with increasing frequency. It is the same the world over. From Dublin to Darwin, the effects of climate change are being felt in a very real way and will only get worse if we do nothing to halt or reverse it. There are low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean that face being wiped out by flooding if global temperatures continue to rise. As an island nation, Ireland is also vulnerable. Almost 10 years ago, a report by the Environmental Research Centre warned climate change would lead to a rise in sea levels and consequent coastal flooding as well as an increase in river flooding and more extreme cyclonic and precipitation events. All of the above have already happened, yet in the past decade we have done little or nothing to address the cause. That is why COP21 , the UN summit on global climate change being held in Paris, is relevant to us all and not just the political elite gathered there. The last such summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 and failed to deliver any meaningful or lasting changes. No firm targets, timetables or enforcement mechanisms for cutting carbon emissions were put in place. Copenhagen failed because no real pressure was put on the world s leaders to come to an agreement, particularly when it meant facing down the fossil fuel industry. Paris might be different if only because, for the first time, tackling climate change has become a mass issue, with ordinary people taking to the streets to compel their governments to act. Tens of thousands yesterday joined one of the biggest global days of climate change activism to put pressure on world leaders to unite in fighting global warming at the Paris summit. Ireland was among 70 countries worldwide where marches took place to call for action on climate change, with rallies taking place in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and Galway. What is happening in the streets may prove more important than what happens in the conference halls. The Paris summit will need to deliver far more than the Copenhagen summit did. It is little exaggeration to say that a robust treaty is all that stands between us and mass extinction. The real danger associated with global warming is how rapidly it is happening, faster than any climate change event in millions of years. Rapid climate change in the past resulted in 90% of all species being wiped out. There is no Planet B. The Earth is our only home and we ignore the dangers of climate change at our peril. \</doc>

Renewed doubt has been cast over Ireland's ability to meet EU greenhouse gas targets for 2020 with emissions across the transport and agriculture sectors set to increase over coming years. The latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report says not even full implementation of existing energy efficiency and renewable fuel policies will help the country meet its binding targets for four years' time. Despite overachieving in annual obligations since 2013, Ireland is set to breach its targets in 2016 or 2017, with agriculture and transport comprising 47 per cent and 29 per cent of non-ETS emissions respectively. Agriculture emissions are expected to increase by 6-7 per cent for the period 2014-2020, with an increase of 10-16 per cent expected in the transport sector. The latest EPA figures concern one of two broad categories for EU greenhouse gas targets, the other being the large energy and power industry which is also coming in behind target. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly last year admitted that Ireland would not satisfy the 2020 targets. Speaking at the COP21 meetings in Paris in December Taoiseach Enda Kenny described the targets as "unrealistic" for Ireland considering the "lost decade" of recession the country had gone through. The national herd is expected to increase substantially by 2020, which many groups say will impact negatively on Ireland's climate obligations. Concomitant effect Allied to this, the EPA's report for 2014 showed that the country's economic recovery is having a concomitant effect on increasing emissions figures from the industrial, commercial and buildings sectors. "Ireland must follow a pathway to decarbonising energy, transport and heating. We must break our dependence on fossil energy infrastructures," EPA director general Laura Burke said. Responding to the figures, the Green Party blamed Government policies and said a "radical shift" is needed to attain the next milestone 40 per cent reduction which is pencilled for 2030. "The 2020 targets are now beyond reach. We need a radical shift in policy if the situation is to be in any way salvaged, and get back on track for 2030. The transition to a decarbonised economy is an economic opportunity, not an economic cost - and we have everything to gain by embracing it," the spokesman added. The Department of the Environment said its National Mitigation Plan aims to "close the gap as much as possible" by 2020, and is working with other departments through the plan's steering group to find the best way forward. A spokesman declined to comment on whether Department of the Environment officials have applied pressure on colleagues in other departments such as Agriculture and Transport to tackle increased emissions in those sectors. \</doc>

The world is on the brink of a major breakthrough on climate change, with an historic agreement expected in Paris today that will limit global temperature increases to "well below 2 degree Celsius" above pre-industrial levels. The deal has come after two weeks of intensive negotiations, including three all-night sessions this week, at the COP21 Summit, in Le Bourget. Crucially, the text for limiting global warming includes a reference to moving towards a more ambitious 1.5 degree target. Parties, including environmental campaigners, have welcomed the addition of the longer-term goals, including a move to "emissions neutrality"; better transparency; guaranteed climate financing of $100 billion a year to 2020 for poorer countries; and five-year reviews to ensure each country keeps up their ambition levels. The potential of the accord was described by the conference president, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, as "a big step forward for humanity as a whole". Mr Fabius was due to present the final draft today with the 50 final bracketed areas of text, denoting disagreement, removed. Well-placed sources told The Irish Times they expected the agreement to be sealed later today after difficult negotiations yesterday. "I will present a text that is as balanced and as ambitious as possible," Mr Fabius said last night. The agreement will have no immediate implications for Ireland, which negotiated as part of the EU bloc. Agrifood sector However, the higher emissions targets could mean a new regime of carbon taxes or levies on agriculture and the agrifood sector, which accounts for a third of Ireland's greenhouse gases. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was optimistic. "This negotiation is the most complicated, most difficult but most important for humanity", he said. On the implications for Ireland, climate expert Prof John Sweeney, of NUI Maynooth, said all Irish transport, including trains, would need to be electrified by 2050 and Irish agriculture would have to pay a carbon tax. "With economic growth, Ireland will be one of the richest countries again in two-three years' time," he said. "I just do not expect to see any special favours for Irish agriculture." Polluter pays With an increase of 300,000 planned in the national herd, and no appreciable reduction in emissions, Prof Sweeney said a price would have to be put on agricultural emissions under a "polluter pays" principle. "We will have to adjust our agriculture taxation system to reflect that." He said the most likely outcome was a carbon tax on agrifood companies. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly welcomed the reference to 1.5 degrees and said Ireland, like Europe, had sought an ambitious agreement that included transparency and long-term goals. He defended Irish agriculture policy, which he said was among the most sustainable in the world. "We have analysis that shows that though the dairy herd is going to increase in coming years, we can do so with the amount of emission we have at the moment," he said. \</doc>

Representatives from 175 of the 196 countries that concluded the Paris agreement to fight climate change last December gathered at UN headquarters in New York yesterday for a signing ceremony. "This is a moment of history," said UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.\~ "Never before have so many countries signed an agreement on the same day." Other records, for high temperatures, were also being broken, Mr Ban warned.\~ "We are in a race against time . . . the era of consumption without consequences is over." The leaders of China, the US, India and Russia, all big polluters, did not attend the ceremony.\~President Barack Obama was in London, but his secretary of state, John Kerry, promised the US would "join the agreement" this year.\~ The Paris accord could not be called a treaty because that would have required ratification by the Republican-controlled US Senate.\~ There are fears that if Donald Trump is elected in November, he will rescind US support for the agreement. As host to the Paris COP21 climate conference, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande made the first speech.\~ The conclusion of the agreement was "an emotional moment, rare in the lives of politicians and leaders", he said.\~ Mr Hollande called on leaders to establish a carbon price and raise $100 billion (EUR 89 billion) to help developing countries make the transition to clean energy, goals not achieved in Paris. Mr Hollande said France would ratify the agreement before summer, and called on the EU to do so this year. The agreement will not take effect until it is ratified by 55 countries representing 55 per cent of the world's greenhouse emissions.\~ China said it would ratify before the G20 summit in China in September.\~Twenty-eight EU member states must agree how much carbon each will cut, then ratify individually. The signing took place on Earth Day.\~ "I was a young organiser and speaker at the first Earth Day in 1970, and I was a young senator and advocate at the first Earth Summit in Rio in 1992," Mr Kerry said.\~ "This is a moment to recommit ourselves to winning this war." Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a "UN messenger for peace", gave the closing speech.\~ Over two years, he said, he'd seen pollution in Beijing, flooding in India and "glaciers disappearing well ahead of predictions.\~ All that I have seen has absolutely terrified me."\~ Climate change "has become a runaway freight train," Mr DiCaprio added. "Our planet cannot be changed unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong." Children from the 196 countries party to the agreement stood in the aisles of the general assembly hall while a horn and trumpets played the Shaker hymn Simple Gifts .

Global carbon dioxide emissions have stalled for the second year in a row despite economic growth, according to new research. COP21 climate change summit in Paris yesterday. It showed global carbon emissions may fall slightly in 2015. This comes after the yearly increases in emissions slowed to almost a standstill in 2014. The research was carried out by the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project, using data from research institutes worldwide. Lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Quere said the figures for the last two years contrasted with the growth trajectory since 2000 when emission rose by 2-3 per cent each year. "What we are now seeing is that emissions appear to have stalled and they could even decline in 2015," she said. However, she added, "It is unlikely that emissions have peaked for good. This is because energy needs for growing economies still rely primarily on coal, and emissions decreases in some industrial countries are still modest at best . . . There is still a long way to near zero emissions." High-level negotiations The report was published on the first day of the crucial high-level negotiations by government ministers at Le Bourget aimed at reaching a global accord that will offer a robust response to climate change. Some commentators said the research showed how economic activity could increase without emissions growing. However, the decrease was attributed mainly to China using less coal in recent years. Responding to the findings, Martin Kaiser of Greenpeace said, "We can't celebrate yet. Two years of apparently stable emissions do not make a trend. With the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere already, there is no room for complacency." Lower target There was some optimism at the talks Monday that the world's largest polluters were rallying around a stronger target for limiting global warming. US envoy Todd Stern said "we are working with other countries on some formulation that would include 1.5 Celsius", a target below the current temperature goal of limiting the rise to 2 degrees above preindustrial levels. However, Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly said securing binding agreement at the lower level would be difficult to achieve politically. Speaking during a break in negotiations in Le Bourget in Paris, Mr Kelly said the outcome of the talks would probably result in a commitment to limit temperature increases to 2 degrees, or well below 2 degrees, with a likelihood of a non-binding reference to 1.5 degrees in the document. He added he planned to bring proposals for significantly increased Irish contributions to the Green Climate Fund to Cabinet. The Government has been criticised for not committing more than EUR 2 million to this fund. \</doc>

THERE is a growing interest worldwide in forestry as an investment due to a combination of its low volatility, relatively risk free status and level of returns achievable. Investors have been making inroads into the sector long before the recent turbulent ride on the stock market as many consider forestry as an investment that moves away from traditional asset classes. Forestry has many natural properties such as age, class, species, market and end use which allows flexibility in management to achieve best financial returns. Traditionally it is seen as providing a solid yield, due to its growth rates, with relatively low ongoing capital investment. Forestry is one of the oldest forms of investment with the diversity of timber products produced now part and parcel of everyday life including timber to build homes, fuel and food packaging. The recent COP21 climate change conference in Paris is likely to lead to increased integration of forestry into combating climate change. The agriculture sector accounted for 32.6pc of Ireland's total national emissions in 2013. Forestry removes CO2 from the atmosphere and also provides raw material for construction and fuel for renewable energy generation. The key to mitigating Ireland's agricultural emissions lie both in increased on farm efficiency and forestry expansion to sequester emissions from the air. Forestry is considered a real tangible asset, rather than stocks that have many investors quaking in recent days. It also provides a real return to investors from sales of timber, and annual forest premiums in the case of Irish forestry. The annual forest premiums available to all landowners are detailed in table 1. Separately, farmers can continue to receive their Basic Payment Scheme on land they plant to forestry. This provides an additional incentive to farmers to engage in forestry, particularly on marginal land. It is important to note that forestry resources are finite. The production of timber takes time which ensures the ability to increase forestry supply can only happen over long timeframes. The current scarcity of timber in Ireland is resulting in the importation of around 500,000 tonnes of roundwood annually into Ireland. The strategic goal of Ireland's forest policy 'Forests, products and people' is "To develop an internationally competitive and sustainable forest sector that provides a full range of economic, environmental and social benefits to society and which accords with the Forest Europe definition of sustainable forest management". In order to achieve this, increasing the forest area by 15,000 hectares per annum from 2016 to 2046 in order to support a long term sustainable roundwood supply of 7 to 8 million cubic meters of timber per annum is a recommended policy. However, we are currently falling behind with 6,252ha planted in 2014. This policy is supported in Ireland by afforestation grants, which cover the full cost of establishing and maintaining a plantation for the first four years, and annual forest premiums payable to forest owners. Support schemes in the form of forest roads and woodland improvement grants are available to facilitate proper forest management. However, the caveat is that forestry is a long term investment meaning the imperative to match a forestry investment with the objectives of each investor.

My television is full of images of men, women and children in orange lifejackets, scrambling out of boats onto beaches on various Greek islands, now interchangeable in their emotional connotations. Joy, relief, happiness is written on their smiling faces. The camera focuses on a beautiful, brown-eyed Syrian child. She is about six years old. "Thank you, Europe, thank you Mrs Merkel," her father shouts excitedly at the camera. He squeezes his child so hard in his excitement that I think that she might cry, but she smiles instead. There are tears of joy in his eyes, his daughter is now smiling straight into the camera, and my heart melts. Then my eyes are drawn to a group of three young men standing just behind them, taking their lifejackets off, smiling broadly, not Syrian, maybe Afghans, but I can't be sure. And then I find myself involuntarily scanning the group to see who else is there on that beach. How many other young men are travelling on their own? Where are they from? Are they just economic migrants and, if so, why is that so important to me? What would I do in their situation? Where will they settle? Will we be safe? Will they? The last image in the news report is a shot of discarded, tangled lifejackets, the detritus of this mass movement of people, the lifejackets lapped by the sea. What have I learned in 2015? I have learned we are a small world, a lot smaller than we ever thought and the old certainties that governed our old, much larger, world have changed forever. This almost biblical exodus saw to that. We now see that global problems require global solutions immediately, rather than in a decade or two's time. There is no long grass when it comes to these sorts of issues. This is the start of their journey on that beach and the start of ours. My emotions are fighting to keep up, empathy, sympathy, shared joy, of course, but also fear (especially following the terrorist attacks in Paris), anxiety, a rising sense of helplessness of being overwhelmed by the million that have come. My emotions need to direct my thinking, to point me one way rather than another, but they're conflicted and confused at the moment. They are confusing to me and my thoughts. The UN climate change conference in Paris this month, COP21 , showed that sometimes global consensus about global problems can emerge and we will discover soon enough if practical solutions derive from this shared political will. And I was fortunate in being given the opportunity to present my research on individual psychological responses to climate change at the UN scientific conference in Paris in July. There was clearly a scientific consensus then and it was more than heartening to see a political consensus emerge five months later. But this emerging consensus on climate change, it must be remembered, took many decades. When it comes to these other global challenges, we don't have many decades. My hope for 2016 is that I, and everyone else, manage to overcome our conflicted minds to arrive at shared, consensual solutions a little bit quicker than in the past, because, quite simply, there is no HYPERLINK http://www.alternative.No www.alternative.No alternative at all.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan has told Bolivian president Evo Morales that there should be an international investigation into the killing of Tipperary man Michael Dwyer, who was shot dead by police in a Bolivian hotel in April 2009. At a meeting in Dublin on Saturday evening, Mr Flanagan told Mr Morales the Government supported calls by Dwyer's family for an independent international inquiry into the circumstances of his killing. Mr Dwyer (24) and two other men were shot dead during a police operation at a hotel in the city of Santa Cruz; the remaining two members of their group were arrested. "I raised the issue of Michael Dwyer, which is an issue of concern to the Irish Government," Mr Flanagan said after the meeting. "I reiterated my support for the family's call for an independent investigation into the death of Michael Dwyer and that there should be an international dimension." Window of opportunity After a separate meeting with Bolivia's ministers for foreign affairs and defence, who accompanied Mr Morales on his two-day visit to Ireland, Mr Dwyer's mother, Caroline, said she was encouraged by the willingness of the Bolivians to engage on the issue and said there was a "window of opportunity" to make progress. "They told me Mr Morales had asked them to convey his personal condolences, which was a good start . . . They said they had a will to have the facts of the case out there, and they would fully co-operate and facilitate an international investigation," she said. Mrs Dwyer said this was in contrast with the Bolivian government's initial unwillingness to discuss the case with the Irish authorities in 2009, and marked a significant improvement in tone since she met Bolivian government representatives in La Paz in September 2014. Timeline Mrs Dwyer said she expressed her concern about the absence of any timeline and the fading memories of witnesses, pointing out that some key witnesses had not been interviewed as part of the original investigation. "They said that if the family were to come to Bolivia they were willing to facilitate our visit to establish any facts," she added. The Bolivian government claims Dwyer was part of an opposition terrorist group. The family rejects that and has gathered its own evidence that it says points instead to their son's summary execution. A recent documentary, with which the family co-operated, pointed to witnesses who contradicted the official version of a shoot-out; video footage that showed police planted evidence; and a public prosecutor in exile who built his government's legal case to support the raid but who says now it was all lies. The Dwyer case was also raised by President Michael D Higgins, who met Mr Morales at \'c1ras an Uachtar\'e1in on Saturday evening. "President Higgins thanked the president for the talks arranged with the Dwyer family during his visit. He also urged progress in addressing the understandable loss and grief of the Dwyer family," the \'c1ras said in a statement. At the one-hour meeting, which the \'c1ras described as warm, the presidents discussed climate change, including the upcoming COP21 conference in Paris; sustainable development; cultural diversity; and the role of indigenous people and their languages. \</doc>

So says Bertrand van Ee, CEO of Climate-KIC, the EU s main climate innovation initiative, after the COP21 agreement in Paris on a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change, by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. He singled out a hydro-powered irrigation pump that can double crop yields in developing countries, without using any fuel or electricity, as one of the range of low carbon innovations to emerge from Climate-KIC. By doubling yields, it can pay back for itself within 18 months. The pump has few moving parts, thus it requires only minimal maintenance. Compared to existing diesel or perol powered pumps, Barsha pumps can save up to 70% costs over their life time. Another Climate-KIC assisted low carbon breakthrough is the carbon negative power technology, Cogent Heat Energy Storage Systems (CHESS). Developed in 2013 in the UK, CHESS integrates three existing technologies already routinely used, and combines them to generate electricity from fossil fuels whilst, at the same time, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. CHESS uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that takes carbon dioxide out of the air. At the end of the process, there is less carbon dioxide in the air than there was at the beginning. The more gas used, the cleaner the air. This essentially means that rather than being a part of the climate change problem, burning natural gas becomes a part of the solution. It works by putting natural gas into a fuel cell, which generates electricity and heat. The generated heat is then used to break down limestone into lime and carbon dioxide. All of the carbon dioxide generated from the fuel cell and the broken down limestone is pure and can be sequestered cheaply and easily, and the lime that is left at the end of the process absorbs the carbon in the atmosphere. This can potentially start to turn the clock back on the effects of climate change. Climate-KIC is one of three Knowledge and Innovation Communities created in 2010 by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology as part of its goal to create sustainable growth. According to experts at Climate-KIC, most European business leaders have prepared strategies to respond to climate change, but with a lack of focus on innovation. As a result, those strategies are likely to be ineffective for a 2\'b0C trajectory an oversight which could yet present even greater opportunity for climate change innovators. \</doc>

" COP21 provides a unique opportunity for the political leaders of this generation to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability of generations of the future. "Many of us in this room came together in New York in September to agree the Sustainable Development Goals, the most ambitious programme of action ever agreed by the nations of the world. "Today, we meet in Paris, a city whose people have demonstrated remarkable bravery, courage and resilience in the face of the most horrendous crimes. "I hope that we are serious about putting in place a legally binding agreement on climate change that will underpin our actions on the goals already agreed and enhance our ability to reach them. This requires action by everybody, big and small. "Ireland is determined to play its part. We have committed, with our EU partners, to a collective target to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030. Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation, which sets out our intention to substantially cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production. We are developing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that vision. "One really significant area for Ireland is our valuable and already efficient agriculture sector. Through a series of programmes, like carbon foot-printing 43,500 beef farms and 18,000 dairy farms, we are driving economic and environmental efficiency in agriculture and achieving results that we believe are both transferable and scalable. "Our research will contribute to global progress and help all countries realise the potential of their land sectors in addressing climate change. This is not just about opportunities, but about the co-operation that will allow us to address our common challenges. Real transparency and accountability will benefit us all, but we need to trust each other and the systems that we operate in. "Building on our strong track record of supporting developing countries, including in areas like climate justice, human rights, gender and education, Ireland recognises that vulnerable communities need very considerable assistance in adapting to climate change. "Despite recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland provided public climate finance of EUR 34 million in 2014, including support for the Least Developed Countries Fund. These funds support adaptation in agriculture, food and energy systems, and help to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. "Ireland is committed to scaling up climate finance. One: in addition to continuing our current level of support, which from 2016 to 2020 will ensure EUR 175 million in public funding, mainly for adaptation, Ireland will commence contributions to the Green Climate Fund in 2016 with a view to building up support over the coming years. "Two: we will increase our contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund. "Three: we are also examining ways to mobilise private finance from Ireland, to further contribute to the 2020 goal. "The negotiations this week will be very difficult, but if we are serious then we should leave Paris with an ambitious and binding agreement that will ultimately limit global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels . . . "I encourage our negotiators to bring this process to a successful conclusion next week. Let's send the signal the world is waiting for and let us not deprive our successors and their children of a real future before they are born." \</doc>

ADVOCATES and campaigners for climate justice struggle to make the threat of global warming relevant to the general public. People are busy and understandably preoccupied by the day-to-day struggles of raising families and responding to the demands of work. Some people even find it hard to keep up with the routine domestic political agenda and rely on the media to keep abreast of current affairs. So, expecting people to reflect on the seemingly remote implications of climate change is challenging. Occasionally, a report from NASA or the UN and other agencies heralding the melting of the ice at the north or south poles, causing rising sea levels, forces the reader to stop and ponder. But short-term concerns aroused are quickly eclipsed by the next, more immediate news item. It is fortunate, therefore, given the fickle nature of politics and media, that public opinion is not the principle driver of initiatives on the State's policy on climate change. This is a topic which requires global leadership and sophisticated policy-making by way of international agreements, targets and binding commitments. India, the US and China have recently stepped up cooperation on climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. The next UN conference on climate change in Paris, later this month, will be a test for the EU in respect of moving to a lower carbon trajectory and restating the EU's traditional leadership in this area. There are real fears that the EU will miss the 2020 emissions targets. The Volkswagen emissions scandal will have cast a shadow, not only on the credibility of the motor industry and compliance with regulations, but on the reputation of the EU. The United States and the Obama administration is now focusing on climate change policy domestically, and also by diplomatic engagement, which will go some way to make up for the failures of earlier administrations to address, or even acknowledge, the reality of climate change. Much of the research in this area is assisted and informed by work in space by organisations such as Nasa. It is expensive work but vital in monitoring by satellite the many changes occurring on the planet. Few people are aware that the international space station is circumnavigating the earth every 92 minutes, doing research, taking photographs and observing the planet in all its diversity. Out of sight and out of mind, all this important work by Nasa goes on literally as if in a parallel universe. Every now and then, when there is a launch or a landing of a space mission, we earthlings take notice and briefly marvel at the wonders of space and earth science. We notice, of course, the big events; landings on planets, meteors, eclipses of the moon or sun. But in the main, most of us are blissfully unaware of all this space exploration and research going on, with a host of devices monitoring planetary changes, carbon emissions levels, melting land and sea ice, and global warming. Satellite images of icebergs breaking off are tracked and fed into the research supplementing the work of scientists here on earth. Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield made all this real for millions of us by intensively photographing the earth from his tour on the International Space Station. During 2,579 orbits of the planet, he took about 45,000 photos. He even had a Twitter feed from space, relating his experiences and went so far as to record David Bowie's iconic song 'Space Oddity' from inside the station. The astonishing sight and sounds of him floating around with his guitar is an indelible image for me of space travel. His book of photographs 'You are here' is a revelation of astonishing views and commentary from space of the earth divided into continents. The images over Africa are stunning in their colour, diversity and clarity, ranging from human settlements in Mali to deserts and deltas in North Africa and the coral reefs of Australia and the Red Sea. These photographs have now inspired a new collection of paintings by Irish artist Catherine Daly, titled 'The Curious Eye', currently showing in the Source Arts Centre in Thurles. Looking at Hadfield's images of our earth from space transported into paintings, I recalled all the places, particularly in Africa, that I visited as minister for overseas aid. I saw for myself the human calamity of famine in countries where food insecurity and drought, harsh terrain, environmental degradation and deforestation contributed to humanitarian disasters, mass displacement and chronic underdevelopment. Climate change is now firmly on the human rights development agenda. Reflecting on planet earth is a rewarding activity. These days one thinks of the war and instability in Syria and the unprecedented march of humanity fleeing across the blue waters of the seas to Europe. One thinks of the tragedy of tsunamis which devastated several countries in the recent past, of melting ice caps and of earthquakes and hurricanes which claim so many lives. Looking at our world from space reminds us that we are mere custodians of the planet for the brief period of our mortal lives. We hold it in trust for future innocent generations. The significant money spent on space discovery and science, which informs policy here on earth, is money well spent. The US federal government spends $1bn each year on Antarctic and Arctic research. Its impact is not immediate. It is the slow burn of knowledge feeding into our collective intelligence about sustainable life on earth. A recent report from Nasa said that the pace of melting of the ice in some parts of Antarctica was a cause for serious concern, suggesting a point of "irreversible retreat" had been reached, which could mean a rise in sea levels of three metres. Similar research is going on in Greenland's ice sheet, the full melting of which could increase sea levels by six metres. Such significant rise in sea levels would have dire consequences for low-lying populations as diverse as Bangladesh and New York. We ignore this intelligence at our peril. Failure to stop dangerous climate change will undermine all the development gains that have been made in poor countries which suffer the most impact. Predicting how rapidly sea levels will rise in the 21st century is not just the stuff of policy wonks. It is a matter of life and death. The Volkswagen emissions scandal will have cast a shadow, not only on the credibility of the motor industry and compliance with regulations, but on the reputation of the EU \</doc>

Ireland must be progressive and understand the "great opportunities" offered by wind energy investment, outgoing Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alex White has said. In a series of unscripted remarks to the industry yesterday, Mr White said while there was agreement on the need to support the "fabric of life" in rural Ireland, there was also a need to form consensus on meeting the challenges of global warming. In turn, he told industry representatives they must "listen and understand", to be realistic without necessarily compromising on ambition. The 2016 annual Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) conference in Dublin heard of the increasing reliance on the sector to help Ireland reach its carbon reduction targets in line with the EU's COP21 commitments. Ireland must reach a 40 per cent renewable electricity target by 2020. Last year almost 24 per cent of Irish electricity needs were met by the wind energy industry. Climate policy The world stands at a "critical juncture" of energy and climate policy, Mr White said, adding that the recently-published White Paper on Energy had set out policy objectives to substantially decarbonise Ireland. Dependency on imported energy fell to 85 per cent in 2014 but cost EUR 5.7 billion or 3.2 per cent of GDP. Today wind energy provides more than 3,400 jobs following investment of about EUR 3.8 billion. The industry is determined to capitalise on the momentum. In a political swansong on energy policy - he lost his seat in the recent election - Mr White expressed his personal views that difficulties must be overcome in the interest of the greater good. "I would say to communities across the country: be progressive and understand the great opportunities that are associated with the development of renewable energy," he said. "Climate change is a challenge for all of us. It's not something that just affects urban areas or just affects rural areas." He also defended the planning system which is heavily relied upon to mediate between the competing interests of wind energy development and Irish communities. Guidelines He said various decisions "demonstrate to me that the planning system is robust and the planning system does work. And I wonder really about the necessity to amend guidelines or amend the planning code". However, Peter Baillie, managing director of Energia Renewables, told the conference the system needed to be addressed. "I believe the planning appeals threshold is too low. Anyone can appeal for EUR 20 without a valid grounds test. That's not the case in Northern Ireland," he said. "An Bord Plean\'e1la is swamped. It takes too long and it does appear at times, looking at it from the outside, that results can be a bit of a lottery with a lack of clarity sometimes on how decisions are arrived at. "You also have judicial reviews now prevalent, and all that is leading to longer timelines for projects." Meanwhile, in a policy document launched at the event, the IWEA said a potential Brexit could compound Ireland's energy challenges. In said there was an onus to "create certainty" on Irish energy policy and, within the regulatory environment, to facilitate investment. Wind investments NTR secures finance Earlier this month NTR announced the closure of a \£316.8 million debt facility with Ulster Bank to finance construction of the 15MW Ora More wind farm in Co Fermanagh due to be operational later this year. \</doc>

As the COP21 The main excuse given is that if we don t produce meat and dairy products, other countries, with higher greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in their meat and dairy production, will instead. There are a number of flaws with this argument. The 2010 EU commission publication, called GGELS, from which our top rank for GHG emissions and dairy stems, also exposes that we re fifth best for beef. This means that the four above us could produce more GHG efficient meat were it not for us. For sheepmeat, incredibly, we re only 10th best in the EU. This means that nine other countries could be producing more GHG efficient sheepmeat, were it not for us. So arguing that if we don t do it someone less GHG efficient will, is simply factually wrong when it comes to beef and sheepmeat. Somehow, we ve allowed a good dairy GHG score at EU level to morph into the illusion of best in the world across all sectors. There are other issues too. The others might do it instead argument imagines trade deals with places like Brazil, where, very expressly, Brazil is left out of all current trade deals being negotiated. TTIP, TPP and CETA (Pacific, US-EU and EU Canada deals respectively) exclude all the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia India and China. This current raft of trade agreements, and indeed the Russia trade war, could be seen as a way to inhibit growth in the BRIC countries. We are also presuming growth in meat and dairy consumption will continue forever, despite their high GHG emissions compared to other foods. This is like presuming coal will still be burned, despite the existence, and needs for, renewables. Yes there are growth predictions for both coal and meat/dairy, but if these growth trajectories do happen, we are facing runaway climate change. All of us. In this context, is it more ethical, and sensible, to say let s try something different, and let s try to convince others to eat that food ? Or will we continue presuming people will ignore the evidence as the planet fries? So just like leaving fossil fuels in the ground seems impossible but yet also the only sensible thing to do, based on the science, changing land use away from land grabbing and methane producing conventional livestock production, and over towards other types of production makes eminent sense. These other systems would integrate livestock more into mixed farms with proper rotations and clover for N fertility. They would also be much more about producing vegetables from mixed cropping systems. And the range of soil regenerative practices currently possible and carried out on model organic farms would have to be mainstreamed. Agroforestry holds the most potential for farmers, especially sheep farmers, to keep farming and store more carbon. As we saw in this supplement last week, while the livestock stocking rate stays more or less the same, there can be 400 to 1,000 trees per hectare with agroforestry. The tree itself is a store of carbon, while soil carbon levels soil structure are improved with standard agroforestry techniques. With organic fertility and pest management techniques, along with agroforestry, soil microbiology would be strengthened, restoring and regenerating the soil. Research has shown that soil carbon can increase by 2.2% per year in organic farms, but remain at best stable on conventional farms. Also organic matter levels are 7% higher in certified organic soils. We are the Carbon Leakage. But we don t have to be. \</doc>

LARA MARLOWE Taoiseach Enda Kenny has blamed a "lost decade" of recession and "unrealistic" targets set by the EU for Ireland's difficulties in grappling with greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector. Attending the COP21 global summit on climate change in Paris, the Taoiseach singled out Irish agriculture as an exception, and said the State would need "time and space" to deal with meeting stringent EU targets of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. Mr Kenny was one of more than 150 world leaders at the summit yesterday, and in his formal address he said Ireland was "determined to play its part" in reaching an historic agreement before the conference closes on Friday week. The most anticipated speech of the day was that delivered by US president Barack Obama, who described the conference as a potential "turning point" to curb global warming. Saying the next generation was watching, he declared: "I came here personally to say the United States not only recognises the problem but is committed to do something about it." The UN summit involving 195 parties will seek pledges that, it is hoped, will collectively result in global temperature not rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Warning However, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who launched an ambitious alliance that will work towards an increase in solar power, warned that the developed world would have to recognise that, for countries such as India, climate change was not of its making. Another key player, Chinese president Xi Jinping, confirmed his country's commitment that its emissions would peak in 2030 and then start to fall. In a well-received speech, the host leader, French president Francois Hollande, referred back to the recent terrorist atrocity in Paris that had resulted in the loss of more than 130 lives. "I can't separate the fight with terrorism from the fight against global warming," he told delegates. In his address to the conference, Mr Kenny said Ireland supported the aim of creating a legally binding agreement on climate change. "Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation, which sets out our intention to substantially cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production," he said. Speaking to reporters earlier, the Taoiseach blamed Ireland's difficulties in meeting targets in agriculture on a "lost decade" which he said was created by recession caused by the previous government. That had resulted in few resources being available to invest in climate change research and infrastructure. 'Unreachable' He also said the targets set by the EU Commission for 2020, which called for a 20 per cent reduction of emissions compared with 2005 levels, were "unrealistic" and "unreachable". Mr Kenny denied the State was seeking "wiggle room" on the vital sector of agriculture. Rather, he said that when the EU Commission set the 2020 target it had overestimated what agriculture could achieve in terms of curbing emissions. "We do not want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce with the abolition of quotas, to find that food produced in countries with inferior standards and higher emission levels." Mr Kenny said he had spoken to several other European leaders at the summit about the agriculture challenge, including the prime minster of Denmark, Lars L\'f8kke Rasmussen. UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, former president Mary Robinson refused to be drawn yesterday on Ireland's policy stance, saying she did not like to talk specifically on a political matter. "I always want every country including Ireland to be more ambitious," she said. "There is room for improvement and I do hope this conference will help." \</doc>

France paid a national homage to the 130 people killed in the jihadist attacks on November 13th in a solemn, almost military ceremony in the courtyard of honour at Les Invalides in Paris yesterday. The 2,000-strong audience included the families of victims, people wounded in the attacks and those who survived them. It is extremely rare for Les Invalides, which belongs to the French armed forces, to be used to honour civilians. President Fran\'c3\£7ois Hollande gave the only speech, and referred at least three times to "the fallen", as if the victims were soldiers on a field of battle. The Republican Guard band played La Marseillaise at the beginning and end of the hour-long service. Mr Hollande had asked the French to hang the blue, white and red tricolour from their balconies to mark the tribute. French flagmakers have reported a rise in sales since the attacks. 'Mad cause' In his speech, Mr Hollande played the role of war president and commander-in-chief to whom the French have rallied. His approval rating has shot up to 41 per cent since the attacks. "France has been struck in a cowardly way, through an act of war that was organised far away and coldly executed," he began. "A horde of assassins killed 130 of our own . . . in the name of a mad cause and a god they betrayed." Mr Hollande promised that "France will use every means to destroy the army of fanatics who committed these crimes. I promise you too that France will remain herself, as the disappeared had loved her, as they would have wanted her to remain." Yesterday France informed the Council of Europe that its state of emergency would contravene provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. Twenty-four militant environmentalists have been placed under house arrest in the run-up to the COP21 climate conference, accused of belonging to "radical protest movements". Muslim groups have complained of arbitrary treatment. At Les Invalides, several of the country's best known pop and classical musicians performed music by Jacques Brel, Barbara (Monique Serf) and Bach while photographs of the victims were shown on a large screen. The names and ages of all 130 who died were read out. "These men and women embodied the joy of living," Mr Hollande said. They came from 50 French towns, cities and villages and from 17 countries. "These men and women were the youth of France, the youth of a free people, which cherishes culture," he added. Refuse to attend The average age of those killed was 35 and they've been referred to as "the Bataclan generation", after the concert hall where the greatest number perished. Today's youth will remember the attacks "as a terrible initiation to the hardness of the world", Mr Hollande said. Two families stated publicly that they would not attend the ceremony because they felt that government incompetence was partly to blame for the deaths. "How can a country that has been on maximum alert since [the Charlie Hebdo massacre of] January 7 have failed to have noticed preparations for the November 13 tragedy?" wrote Delphyne de Peretti, the sister of Aur\'c3\£9lie de Peretti, who was killed at the Bataclan. Also yesterday, Msgr Philippe Barbarin, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon, relieved Fr Herv\'c3\£9 Benoit of his duties. The priest had published an opinion piece objecting to Eagles of Death Metal, the US band performing at the Bataclan and their song Kiss the Devil . The priest described pre-attack images of concert-goers as "in an ecstatic trance. They are the living dead. Their murderers, these hash-smoking zombies, are their Siamese twins. The same unrootedness, amnesia, childishness, absence of culture." \</doc>

The prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, began his launch of the "Solar Alliance" at the COP21 climate change conference with a paean to the sun. "The sun god is the soul of all beings," Mr Modi told a crowded press room, in the presence of the French president and ministers for foreign affairs and the environment, and the secretary general of the United Nations. "Many in India begin their day with a prayer to the sun," Mr Modi said. "The world must turn to the sun to power the future." The Solar Alliance seeks to unite 110 countries, situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which enjoy more than 300 days of sunshine a year, for the purpose of obtaining solar technology cheaply from the US, Germany and Japan, the leaders in photovoltaic panels. India's institute for solar energy will contribute $30 million (EUR 28.4 million) to establishing a secretariat for the alliance. It will be in Gurgaon, a city near Delhi that focuses on information technology. "Carbon space is what it's all about," said Raj Chengappa, a former member of the government's climate change council and editorial director of the India Today group. "You've done all the damage, and now you tell us we can't use fossil fuels," he said. "So give us the finance and technology." Paradox Antagonism is giving way to understanding. President Fran\'e7ois Hollande repeatedly used the term climate justice yesterday. "We can no longer accept the paradox that countries with the most sun have the least energy. Climate justice also means reducing costs to right this," he told the launch of the Solar Alliance. India, the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the second most populous country, was long viewed as an obstruction to an agreement. Indian leaders note that, on a per capita basis, their emissions are far below the world average. Although India has promised to produce 40 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, it is nonetheless determined to double coal production over the next five years. Mr Modi said that one quarter of India's 1.2 billion citizens have no electricity at all, while another quarter have electricity only one hour a day. Access to electricity Close to 1.3 billion people throughout the world have no access to electricity. "If you put clean energy within the reach of all, it will create unlimited economic opportunities," Mr Modi said. "This day is the sunrise of new hope for villages and homes still in darkness." The French organisers of the conference are pleased that Mr Modi has assumed a constructive role with the Solar Alliance. Laurent Fabius, foreign minister and president of the conference, visited Mr Modi in Delhi last Friday. China has long voiced the demands of developing and emerging countries, but is seen to have defected, said Mr Chengappa. "India is now the champion of all the countries who say, 'You've got to pay'." At present, a megawatt of solar power in India costs three times more than a megawatt of coal-generated electricity. "We are looking for breakthrough technology, in particular better batteries to store solar energy and smart grid management," Mr Chengappa said. At present, renewable energy is used to top up polluting thermal energy during peak hours. India wants the technology to establish a "green corridor" which would ensure that grids switch immediately to renewable energy each time it becomes available. \</doc>

Security will be stepped up for the global climate summit in Paris, with civil and military forces deployed to guard the venue where 140 world leaders and up to 40,000 delegates are due to meet next week. French authorities have insisted the summit, known as COP21 , will go ahead despite the terrorist attacks that killed 130 and left hundreds injured in Paris earlier this month. Prime minister Manuel Valls said the event, due to begin next Monday, would be held because "it's an essential meeting for humanity" and would be an opportunity for world leaders to show their solidarity with France. In order to protect the water system from attack during the conference, sensors have been installed in the network to monitor pressure, chlorine levels, temperature and conductivity - parameters that could signal whether there is any contamination of the water supply. "A terrorist could very well take advantage of this gathering to strike," Jean-Louis Fiamenghi, head of security for French water and waste company Veolia, told Reuters. He added that there had been no threat of nuclear, biological or chemical threat at any Veolia sites across France, however. Greenhouse gas Conference participants will be in a closed, protected area at the venue at Le Bourget, north of Paris, as they work towards a deal to limit rising greenhouse gas emissions. Security within that inner zone will be the responsibility chiefly of the United Nations, but French authorities will guard the buildings and control access to the complex. Some public demonstrations planned to coincide with the talks have been cancelled under a state-of-emergency decree that remains in force until February. The French government said 140 heads of state and government were due to attend the opening day of the summit on Monday. They include US president Barack Obama, who said he would go ahead with the visit despite the attacks and urged other leaders to do the same as a way of showing defiance in the face of terrorism. "I think it's absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business," Mr Obama said. Among the events cancelled by the government are large demonstrations that were due to take place in Paris and other French cities on Sunday, the eve of the summit. A number of events scheduled for December 12th, the day after the conference closes, have also been called off. Authorities initially looked at relocating the Sunday march, which was to take place between Rue de la R\'e9publique and Place de la Nation, but that was ruled out. The foreign ministry said only indoor events could go ahead under the tight security restrictions. "The security of everything within the rooms of the conference we will guarantee 100 per cent, because it will be under our control, but we can't completely ensure the safety of the external part," French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said. Climate justice Climate 21, a coalition of NGOs and trade unions, said it regretted the decision but was "more determined than ever" to make its voice heard on climate justice. It would find "creative" ways to have its say, the group added. Access to Le Bourget will be strictly controlled. People entering the conference area will pass through security scanners, and vehicles will be screened for bombs. Some 30,000 police will be on duty around Le Bourget and at French border checkpoints. \</doc>

French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande yesterday appointed former prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault to succeed Laurent Fabius as foreign minister and brought the Greens back into government. In what is assumed to be the last cabinet reshuffle of his five-year term, Hollande enlarged the government from 32 to 38 members, with half now men and half women. However, women still tend to occupy more subaltern positions, with eight of 11 new junior ministers women. The reshuffle indicates no clear policy changes, other than the attempt to bring the estranged Greens back into the fold in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election. Hollande's stalwarts - environment minister S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, finance minister Michel Sapin - remain unchanged. The popular young economy minister Emmanuel Macron was neither promoted nor demoted. Ayrault's appointment as the highest-ranking minister after prime minister Manuel Valls is the most salient feature of the reshuffle. For the third time in a row, a former prime minister has been given the foreign ministry, after Alain Jupp\'e9 and Laurent Fabius. This is also the first time that a sitting prime minister, Valls, will be followed in rank in the cabinet by his predecessor, Ayrault.Valls replaced Ayrault when he was sacked after the socialists lost the March 2014 municipal elections. Ideological grounds Ayrault believed that Valls had plotted against him, along with Arnaud Montebourg and Beno\'eet Hamon. They later broke with Valls on ideological grounds and left his government. Ayrault knows Hollande well. He was leader of the Socialist group in the national assembly for 15 years, including the 11 years (1997-2008) when Hollande was secretary general of the Socialist Party. In a documentary made by Ayrault's daughter last year, Hollande said with a sigh: "I miss Jean-Marc." As foreign minister, Fabius, who has become president of the constitutional council, focused mostly on the war in Syria, the Iranian nuclear agreement and the COP21 climate conference. Ayrault is expected to re-focus on Europe. A former German teacher, he converses with Chancellor Angela Merkel without an interpreter and is highly regarded in Berlin. The migrant crisis and the possibility of a UK exit from the EU are important issues he will have to address. A former mayor of Nantes, Ayrault has been the most fervent advocate of building a new airport at Notre-Dame-des- Landes. He and Valls agree on that issue, but the airport is opposed by the Green, who had made its cancellation a condition for returning to government. They now appear to have dropped that demand. The Greens refused to participate in the Valls government that was formed in April 2014 but apparently could not resist the temptation to regain a foothold in power. As Florian Philippot, vice-president of the extreme right-wing National Front, put it, the Greens "had been scratching at the door for months". Hollande needs their support if he is to have any chance of re-election. Ousting Emmanuelle Cosse, national secretary of Europe \'c9cologie Les Verts (EELV), becomes minister for housing. Jean-Vincent Plac\'e9, who left EELV last year, is junior minister in charge of state reforms and simplification. Another EELV militant, Barbara Pompili, is junior minister for the environment in charge of biodiversity. The most remarked upon slight was the ousting of culture minister Fleur Pellerin, and her replacement by Hollande's cultural adviser, Audrey Azoulay. Azoulay is close to Hollande's partner, Julie Gayet. A former adviser to the king of Morocco, she reportedly makes Hollande laugh and organises Sunday night film screenings in the \'c9lys\'e9e Palace. \</doc>

Shannon-on-Carrick, the joke was funny the first time around, but the humour has been replaced with more sombre reflection. This was not supposed to happen, at least not so soon after 2009. Then residents and businesses consoled themselves, believing such a flood would probably never reoccur in living memory. Then Met \'c9ireann calculated the rainfall which fell in the month of November 2009 was a once in a 500-year event. "We were assured the last time it was a once-off," says Frances Cryan, owner of Cryan's Hotel. Using sandbags Six years ago, Cryan's was closed by the floods, but it has managed to keep the water at bay this time using sandbags and a pump. An elevated walkway over the floodwater has kept visitors dry. With Christmas coming the timing could not have been worse, but shop owners are fighting back. A commuter bus ferries shoppers in from local GAA stadium P\'e1irc Se\'e1n Mac Diarmada. A video declares Carrick is open for business. The flooding is not quite as bad as 2009, but it is bad in comparison with any other year. The main N4 into the town is flooded. So, too, is the car park at the back of the Bush Hotel and the Park Lane. Carrick Indoor Karting, popular with stag and hen parties, has been shut since November 29th, depriving it of a last-minute flurry of parties before the end of the year. "I put everything into this, not the banks," owner Nicky Davey says forlornly. This time, the Carrick Cineplex, the only cinema in a 30km radius, has stayed dry, but it is still closed for business, because customers cannot make their way to it. Swans have been gliding past the cinema car park in recent days. Until the swans leave and the cars come back again, the cinema cannot reopen, says owner, Liam Flood. Flooding levels "The 2009 flood and, to a certain extent, what is happening now bucked all the trends," he adds. The people of Carrick-on- Shannon, Athlone, Limerick and all the other places affected by flooding might have to deal with a new reality which will mean frequent floods and heavier rain. The floods this year bring home the reality of global warming more than all the talking done at the COP21 summit in Paris, says Carrick area councillor Enda Stenson. "I believe there is a solution, but it is going to take mega-money and maybe we don't have the expertise to do it. We might need to call in the Dutch," he says. A start would be to manage the tributaries of the Shannon and clean up parts congested with vegetation which stymie the water flow. "The Shannon has got to be managed properly," he says. He recommends the setting up of one agency to manage the river from the source to the sea. It is a view universally held among those who live close to its banks. \</doc>

Churches in Ireland are invited to pray for the success of COP21 , the UN climate change conference which opens in Paris on Monday in another attempt to secure an effective and legally binding agreement on ways to deal with climate change. There are, of course, deniers who despite clear evidence refuse to accept that there is a problem. But the greater obstacle lies in countries where people are unwilling to accept changes in lifestyle that could help. Tomorrow, Advent Sunday, the Gospel reading has warnings about the inevitability of conflict and disaster when humankind is estranged from its Creator and his creation. We can explore, investigate and learn about the universe, but we can never control it, nor can we limit the consequences of wilful abuse or misguided actions. The reading from St Luke is very strong: "There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken." Some will dismiss such language and others will explain it away, but we should listen to the scientists, the prophets of our time in these matters. They point to the ominous changes that global warming has already set in motion affecting the weather, the seas and the very fabric of life. They tell us time is running out. These concerns present a serious challenge to the Christian, a point underlined by the recent intervention of Pope Francis, who in an attempt to influence the Paris conference called for action on climate change in a recent encyclical. But what can we do as individuals? Or must we leave things in the hands of the politicians? Eco-Congregation Ireland (ECI), an ecumenical organisation representing the main churches, has produced a resource called , which is designed to encourage Christians throughout Ireland to become more eco-aware and eco-active at church and at home. The resource is free to download from the ECI website and offers advice on how to reduce one's carbon footprint as an individual and as a congregation. Launching the resource at a climate justice event earlier this year Nobel Peace Prize winner and emeritus professor John Sweeney of NUI Maynooth said: "The resource provides a valuable perspective on the nature and impacts of climate change in an Irish context. On a practical level it highlights the connection between local action and global consequences. It also demonstrates that the problem of climate change can only be tackled if ethical principles are coupled with scientific knowledge to inform and motivate policy-makers. The disconnect between the science and the politics of national interest has bedevilled attempts to tackle our greenhouse gas emissions and the authors of the report are to be congratulated on highlighting these vital linkages." Martin Smith, Anglican priest and author, in a comment on tomorrow's Gospel reading, says: "The choices we make and the actions we take are made in the presence of, and on the side of, the Human One [Jesus Christ] who expresses God's hope for the world. Now the future of the earth depends on it." If we love our children and grandchildren, really love them, we will pay attention. \</doc>

Environment minister Mark H Durkan says cutting the north's climate change gases is "not mutually exclusive" with ambitious expansion plans for the region's agrifood sector. The minister was speaking to The Irish News ahead of travelling to the COP21 climate talks in Paris, where more than 150 world leaders are seeking to agree international targets for reducing climate change-causing gases. Mr Durkan will join his counterparts from the devolved regions in a delegation headed by British Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd. Northern Ireland is the only part of Ireland and Britain with no legislation for tackling the causes of global warming - a situation Mr Durkan describes as "an embarrassment". The minister has conceded that a bill to curb emissions will not come before the assembly in the current mandate but he believes some future legislation is necessary. "The scientific evidence for climate change is irrefutable, as is man's role in creating it," he said. "Therefore it's imperative that man does all we can to slow down climate change and reduce the impact we have on our environment. While its a global issue there are local actions we can take." Proposals for a Stormont climate change bill have faced strong opposition from the farming lobby. Agriculture is the north's largest source of climate change-causing emissions, accounting for 29 per cent of the region's greenhouse gases, far outstripping the amount caused by transport and energy production. Most of the agricultural air pollution comes from livestock, which emit methane through belching and in manure. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the significance of the Republic's agriculture industry meant it would need "time and space" to deal with stringent EU targets of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. In 2013, a report commissioned by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said cutting greenhouse gases would have "significant negative impacts" on the agrifood sector's growth plans. The 'Going for Growth' strategy is one of the Stormont executive's main job creation plans and aims to increase exports through the expansion and intensification of farm production, a move expected to lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. But Mr Durkan rejected the notion that expanding the agrifood sector was incompatible with reducing emissions. "We have a similar dependence on the agriculture industry as they do in the Republic and it's important we take cognisance of that," he said. "However, I don't think that climate change legislation specific to Northern Ireland has to impact adversely upon productivity." He said there were other ways to address emissions without reducing livestock numbers and that he was determined to strike a balance which did not compromise environmental standards but acknowledged the economic contribution of agriculture. A statement from the Agrifood Strategy Board (AFSB), which is responsible for implementing 'Growing for Growth', said it agreed minister's assertion that agricultural expansion and a reduction in climate change gases were not mutually exclusive. "We believe that clear, demonstrable sustainability credentials will be key to marketing our food and drink across the world and are working to develop a robust scientific evidence base for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions," the statement said. However, it added that AFSB was not in favour of specific targets as these would "simply result in off-shoring agricultural production to less environmentally efficient food production systems". The statement said the board was committed to reducing the "carbon intensity" of produce. Mr Durkan said other ways of reducing greenhouses gases elsewhere were through increased use of electric vehicles and more renewable energy, though he expressed his disappointment at the recent decision to scrap the renewables subsidy. \</doc>

For 30 years, Forestry Services Ltd has been the go-to company for all forestry services in Ireland - from planting to management - and at the recent National Agribusiness Awards, it collected the Forestry Company of the Year award. "We were thrilled to receive this award. It's a recognition of the vast array of services we offer, and helps grow our status within the industry in Ireland," said Paddy Bruton, the managing director of the Kilkenny-based firm. Established in 1985, the company provides services in forest establishment and management, road construction, forest thinning including harvesting and timber sales, national and international forestry investment, woodland valuation, taxation advice and a wide range of associated services. "The government has an afforestation target of 14,000 hectares per annum in Ireland, but the annual rate is currently just over 6,500 per annum. The list of incentives for landowners who consider planting forestry are numerous, and we anticipate that more will opt for forest plantation in the coming years," said Bruton. Indeed, the COP21 "It will be necessary to have more land planted to offset the CO2 increase, which is inevitable with an expansion in dairy and beef herds. This has many additional national benefits, including rural employment and increased timber supply into the future particularly to the emerging biomass market," said Bruton. He pointed out that forestry plantations were fixed assets and, by their nature, increased in value each year with growth - giving a solid yield. There are no establishment costs, as these are paid for by the government by means of afforestation grants and landowners can earn between (EURO)440 and (EURO)615 per hectare per year in income tax-free forestry premiums which can also be combined with the basic payment scheme in the case of farmers. Additionally, their value does not fluctuate in comparison to property price change, and with the cost of timber increasing, both nationally and internationally, the wisdom of the investment is indisputable - especially on marginal land. "Another incentive is that, at the last budget, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan abolished the high earners income tax restriction which previously limited the exemption to (EURO)80,000 per annum. From January 1, this change comes into law," said Bruton. Forestry Services Ltd provides free consultations for those landowners thinking of forestry planting. A core part of the business includes forestry management and plantations set prior to the Celtic Tiger era are now in need of major thinning. Bruton said: "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, between 12,000 and 20,000 hectares were planted each year. Now thinning of those forests is required. The yield from the material removed is significant and sold to the sawmilling and biomass industry, amongst others, leading to profits for the landowner. We take care of everything from the thinning process to the actual marketing stage. We ensure the entire process is seamless for the forest owner." With the increased range of incentives available to landowners in terms of planting forestry, the sector is set to see a significant upturn in 2016 and beyond. From small acorns, large successful and, in the case of Forestry Services Ltd, award-winning companies grow. A full list of the comprehensive services provided by Forestry Services Ltd is available on the company's new and easy-to-use website, forestryservices.ie \</doc>

TAOISEACH Enda Kenny said financial challenges will prevent Ireland from making deep cuts in emissions from our agriculture sector to help prevent dangerous climate change. He warned that not until after 2020, and when the economy recovers, would the State be in a position to meet "aggressive targets". And he added that "hard bargaining" would take place over the coming weeks to achieve goals which were "fair and reasonable". Speaking to the Irish Independent at the UN climate summit in Paris, Mr Kenny said that existing European Commission targets to reduce emissions from agriculture by 2020 were "unrealistic". He said the commission "overestimated" the contribution that the agri-food sector could make, and that as Ireland produced food more sustainably than other countries, it should be treated as a special case. "We have lost a decade of investment in our country because of what happened. That cannot be recovered, and until we have an economic engine to allow us change structures, and continue to invest in research and innovation for more sustainable ways of doing agriculture, that presents us with a challenge," the Taoiseach said. "We don't want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce to find that food is being produced in other countries with inferior standards and higher emissions levels." Agriculture is the biggest contributor to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, currently accounting for more than 30pc of the total. Ireland also has the highest proportion of emissions of any EU member state from this sector. Emissions are expected to increase by 2pc by 2020 as Government plans to ramp up food production are realised. However, the EU requires a 20pc cut by 2020 over 2005 levels - on the current pathway, they will have reduced by just 5pc, well below the target. "The European Commission in setting out targets for 2020 overestimated what agriculture could actually deliver," Mr Kenny added. "What we want is an understanding that we are serious about achieving fair and sustainable targets, but we need space to deliver on them. "What we have to have here is plenty of ambition, but one tempered with reality." The Eiffel Tower goes green for the UN conference. Above left, Taoiseach Enda Kenny makes a speech. Inset top right, Prince Charles greets French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal. Inset above right, Barack Obama, John Kerry and Francois Hollande have dinner at L'Ambroisie restaurant in Paris The Taoiseach was among 147 heads of state who addressed the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) climate summit. He said that tackling climate change required action by "everybody, big and small", and that Ireland was "determined to play its part". Almost 200 countries have gathered in Paris for two weeks of intense negotiations aimed at striking a deal. Most have committed to re-ducing emissions, but scientists warn the pledges are not enough to keep warming below 2C - the tipping point beyond which catastrophic change is expected. Average global temperatures have already increased by 1C this century. French president Francois Hollande told the summit that an agreement was needed to secure global peace, and that it was possible to prevent disaster if countries acted together. "Climate change will bring conflict just like clouds bring storms," he said. US president Barack Obama described the talks as an "act of defiance" against terrorism, and said a grim future could be avoided if leaders took action. "I came here personally to say the United States not only recognises the problem but is committed to doing something about it," he said. \</doc>

SEVEN years ago, First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama requested that the water in the White House fountain be dyed green - similar to a Chicago tradition, wherein the city greens its river for the St Patrick's Day festivities. This gesture complemented and continued an annual tradition that affirms one of the greatest bilateral relationships in the world. Ireland is the only country in the world guaranteed an annual invitation to the White House. The meeting between the President of the United States and An Taoiseach gives us an opportunity to talk about some of the very important bilateral issues that we face, and also to address global issues in response to which our two countries are taking leadership. President Barack Obama has repeatedly identified entrepreneurship as one of the brightest hopes for expanding economic opportunity and creating jobs. Since the president first launched the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington DC five years ago, hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs have been empowered to launch thousands of new businesses and creative initiatives. The US-Ireland economic relationship is now valued at over $510bn ((EURO)454bn), and this fantastic achievement is made possible thanks to our respective entrepreneurial spirit - a spirit that I have seen first-hand in my visits to American and Irish companies across Ireland. The US and Ireland also apply our creativity, talent, and energy to tackling some of the world's most pressing issues such as global hunger, migration and refugees, and climate change. Speaking to the world following the historic COP21 agreement on climate change in Paris last year, President Obama said: "Together, we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one." The president connected our country's future with a future he could now envision as a grandparent. Having been blessed with a grandchild myself, I feel a profound kinship in this shared sense of responsibility - a solidarity that resonates in Ireland. Former President of Ireland and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change Mary Robinson has spoken of how her devotion to her grandchildren has stoked her passion on climate change. As a global ambassador, she exemplifies how an Irish voice can electrify, and amplify, a message on an issue with worldwide impact. The bond and the friendship felt between the United States and Ireland is something most everyone accepts as a given, but we can't take it for granted. We need to ensure that the next generation understands why the White House fountain will flow with green waters this St Patrick's Day and why we cherish this special relationship. That's why in 2015 we launched the Creative Minds Series, which invites prominent US innovators to creatively engage with Irish audiences. The goal of Creative Minds is to spark new collaborations and innovative connections between the US and Ireland. Since January 2015, we have pursued this goal by inviting an exciting list of creative Americans to lead discussions, master classes, and performances in Ireland. Creative Minds envoys have included singersongwriter Ben Folds, Emmy Award-winning 'Sopranos' creator David Chase, legendary songwriter John Prine, Academy Awardwinning animation expert Pete Docter, hospitality guru Danny Meyer, and Grammy award-winning banjo players Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn. We recognise the talent of these creative minds and also that the economies of the 21st Century depend increasingly not only on creativity, but also creative connections. As President Obama has said: "America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention." I believe the same may be said of Ireland and, to the list of qualities that both our countries enjoy this St Patrick's Day, let us include the value that we place on friendship.

The bicycle courier has become an indispensable part of the working day for many businesses, ferrying important documents or packages through traffic-choked city streets - without producing carbon emissions. What would happen, Leeds man Nick Blake wondered a few years ago, if you took Europe's high-speed train network and book-ended it with cycle couriers? With that, ImagineCargo was born. Then in February 2014, Blake, a veteran of the logistics industry, discovered the real selling point: using bicycles instead of trucks at each end cuts carbon emissions by 99 per cent. "That was the a-ha moment," he says, calculating that the transport of a 5kg package across Europe using traditional carriers generates up to 12kg of CO2 emissions. "With 4.5 million packages sent in Europe each day, our model offers a megatonne-sized CO2-saving potential that puts it into a category with major changes to building regulations or power generation." From its base in Z\'fcrich, ImagineCargo has negotiated deals with the rail companies in Switzerland, Austria and Germany and acts as link to courier companies in all major cities served by the high-speed rail network. The company's packaging displays specific CO2-saving information, making each package a small advertisement for its reduced environmental impact, one seen by everyone who handles the package along the way. Embrace sustainability Sustainability never played a major role in the traditional logistics industry, says Blake, but he is confident companies are ready to embrace the concept - once the price is competitive and the service reliable. ImagineCargo intends to be both, and is confident it is well-placed to benefit from heavy investment by European governments in their high-speed networks. From 2017 on, for instance, the 600km Berlin-Munich train journey time will drop from almost six hours to less than four on one of Germany's most crucial arteries. Even now, for journeys of up to 1,000km, Mr Blake says it isn't much quicker to messenger packages via out-of-city airports than city centre train stations - but far dirtier. Overlooked Part of the challenge so far has been convincing German, Austrian and Swiss rail providers of the value of their existing rail transport services for packages, in many cases overlooked since truck deregulation made the rail courier services unprofitable in the 1970s. "It's a 'back to the future' situation: the Austrian system is more than 150 years old and began with steam train and horse and cart," he says. "With our new technology to manage orders and tracking information, we can offer a better experience." ImagineCargo joins the logistical dots but is not a service to ship anything. Instead it pitches itself as the green alternative for companies who need something somewhere fast - legal documents, medical supplies, architect models for competition - and where price is a secondary concern. Prices vary but Blake says it will always be cheaper than the current alternative for companies up against a deadline: a taxi. "And a messenger will place the delivery into the hands of the person, even if it means chasing them around the city," he says. After taking its first steps this year, into Austria and Switzerland, ImagineCargo will be making a major push into the German market in 2016 and hopes for some additional momentum from COP21 climate talks in Paris. Competitors At the very least, he is hopeful any new environmental measures will level the playing field with competitor parcel services using trucks and air travel. Aviation kerosine is tax-free, duty-free and VAT-free, he says, while trucks pay taxes and for tolls but not for noise pollution, congestion and deaths through particle pollution. "It's a contentious issue and we would say our competition isn't paying their full external costs," he said. At the very least, he is hopeful any new climate measures agreed in Paris will oblige his competitors to make a greater cost contribution - and give a shot in the arm to his innovative bike-train-bike courier model. \</doc>

Strictly embargoed until 00:01hrs; Monday 21st March 2016 Broadcast interviews only New report warns global car manufacturers at risk for breaking emissions targets CDP 2016 annual Automotive Report reveals: :: Six months after VW scandal other automakers exposed to up to 4.8bn in emissions penalties; GM and Ford are companies with greatest exposure :: Nissan, Renault, BMW and Toyota rank highest on environment-related metrics :: Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai and FCA rank worst :: Kia was the only major global manufacturer who did not respond to CDPs request for data :: Tightening environmental regulations boosting advanced vehicles market, especially in China A new report, analysing 15 of the world's largest automakers, with combined market capitalization of US 846bn, has found that tightening regulations on emissions are having a significant business impact in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal six months ago. The report uses data from CDP, voted no 1 climate change research provider in 2015 by institutional investors, and shows Volkswagen is not the only car maker facing significant potential penalties as regulation on fleet emissions tightens around the world. Seven other car makers face up to 4.8bn in potential penalties from the EU and US combined for non-compliance on their fleet emissions. The two US car giants General Motors and Ford are the companies at most notable risk - their penalties could potentially equate to a combined US 1.8 billion (114% of EBIT) and US 1.2 billion (27% of EBIT) respectively. The annual CDP Automotive Report ranks each carmakers in four ways: 1. Fleet emissions - emissions from manufacturers' fleets of cars on the road account for 75% of total emissions from the automotive industry 2. Manufacturing emissions - about 20% of the industry's emissions come from the manufacturing stage 3. Advanced vehicles - how well manufacturers are doing at developing and selling alternative fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles, fuel cell and hybrid 4. Carbon regulation supportiveness - the length to which each manufacturer is supporting (or opposing) climate legislation Last year's CDP Automotive Report highlighted Volkswagen as one of the manufacturers most at risk of emissions penalties five months before the scandal broke. This year GM and Ford are most at risk of facing fines, whilst Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen are leading on advanced vehicles. Kia is the only manufacturer to not disclose its carbon emissions. As a result of the ensuing debate around testing for emissions, the report anticipates that emissions regulations are likely to further tighten around the world. The report also identifies several automakers who have taken a lead on `advanced vehicles', putting them at a competitive advantage, especially in light of the accord reached at flagship climate conference, COP21 and increasing pressure to deal with urban air pollution, such as measures to disfavour diesel vehicles. Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen are the only car makers to receive an `A' grade from CDP in this area. VW launched five new models of advanced vehicles last year, contributing to a three-fold increase in advanced vehicles sales volume globally. There is explosive opportunity in China from advanced vehicles where a booming market combines with some of the most stringent passenger vehicle fleet emissions targets.

Britain's Prince Charles has said that climate change may have been one of the causes of the current bloody civil war in Syria. In the interview with Sky News, to be broadcast tonight but filmed before last week's deadly Islamist terrorist attack in Paris that left 130 people dead, Charles talks about his belief that there are links between climate change and terrorism. He also urged governments to adopt green measures despite austerity, saying there was "a real possibility of nature's bank going bust". Charles told the broadcaster: "We're seeing a classic case of not dealing with the problem, because, I mean, it sounds awful to say, but some of us were saying 20-something years ago that if we didn't tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move. "And, in fact, there's very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land." Asked if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, he added: "It's only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening. "I mean the difficulty is sometimes to get this point across - that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we're doing to our natural environment." The interview came ahead of Charles travelling to Paris next week to deliver a keynote speech at the November 30 opening ceremony for Cop21 , the United Nations conference on climate change which will attempt to reach a new international agreement to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees. Charles has been a strong advocate of taking action to protect the environment for many years. In 2007 he set up the Prince's Rainforest Group to find a solution to save the world's threatened forests. He addressed a UN international climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and the following year he gave a keynote speech to the Oslo Climate and Forest Conference. Last month he gave a speech at Lancaster House in London he told Environment Secretary Amber Rudd, her French counterpart Segolene Royal, and other guests that tackling deforestation will be central to combating global warming. Speaking to Sky as part of a day of special programmes, Charles was asked whether we can afford to deal with climate change in a time of austerity. He said: "The trouble is if we don't, this is the awful thing, if we don't it's going to get so much worse, then life will become very, very complicated indeed, and what we're experiencing now will be as nothing to the problems. "I mean the difficulties in 2008 with the financial crash - that was a banking crisis. But we're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust. If you see it like that, we've been putting so much pressure on the natural systems and all those aspects of nature that we take for granted." He added: "Obviously I try to be as optimistic as possible, but sometimes you think that - do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken? The difficulty with all that, is that by the time you try to take the action, it's already too late." Climate Crisis: Prince Charles Speaks Out, is on Sky News at 8pm. \</doc>

A GROUP of Irish climate change activists were temporarily refused entry to France under emergency powers enacted after the Paris attacks. A bus carrying 32 people, ranging in age from 20 to 72 years, was stopped at the Port of Cherbourg at 5.30pm local time because they were carrying a banner. As a result, French police said they were being refused entry because protests have been banned and they were told they must return to Ireland on a ferry. However, shortly after 8pm they were released. The group included Grace O'Sullivan, who was on board Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in July 1985 when it was bombed by the French secret service amid protests about nuclear testing under way in French Polynesia. It later emerged that two mines had been planted by two members of the French intelligence services. A crew member died in the attack. Ms O'Sullivan was a Green Party candidate in last year's European elections. The Irish group was allowed to leave the port following interventions from the Irish ambassador to France, and a request for help from the French Embassy in Dublin. The spokeswoman for Stop Climate Chaos, Ciara Kirrane, said the party were told they were being refused entry to the country because demonstrations were not allowed. "We said we were there for sanctioned events, and they (police) said there was no negotiation and we were being put back on the next ferry," she said. "They told us they were flexible and let us through. We've been let go and we're on the road." The Irish party was made up of members of groups including Friends of the Earth, An Taisce, Christian Aid, Eco-Unesco and People's Climate. Meanwhile, UN climate talks remained unresolved, with the French presidency of the socalled 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) not expected to release a draft agreement late last night. It is understood that some changes have been agreed, with negotiators expected to begin further talks after midnight. Emissions The summit was expected to conclude this evening, but is expected to go into tomorrow, and possibly Sunday. Key issues remain unaddressed, including financing for developing nations to help them adapt to climate change, a system to verify that countries are reducing emissions and a system to ratchet up ambition over time. There is no mention of emissions from aviation or shipping, but it is understood that forestry is being included as being a method to reduce emissions by capturing carbon. This would prove beneficial to Ireland, which intends ramping up investment in the forestry sector to help reduce agriculture's carbon footprint. PARIS DIARY Paul Melia \£6 THIS column has already referenced Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid for his comments about politicians needing to stop flirting with each other and "seal the deal" in Paris. He had a powerful message yesterday too. "This deal needs three things. It needs loss and damage, because without that we'll leave the more vulnerable behind. Finance, because without it, we will leave the poorest behind. Ambition, because without it, we leave everyone behind. In order for this deal to be revolutionary, it must be evolutionary." Enough said. \£6 THE UN has launched a new comic aimed at helping children understand the effects of climate change. And it appears to have some cred, with the Indian hero 'Chakra The Invincible' being co-created by Stan Lee, the man behind Marvel heroes Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, etc. One adventure sees Chakra and his best friend 'Mighty Girl' using typhoon rains from the Phillipines to put out a forest fire in Indonesia, but they soon realise that climate change is too complex to address action by action, even with superpowers. Instead, each community must work together and play its part. A lesson for small and big people alike. \</doc>

Based on divergent perspectives, the Paris climate deal can be viewed in a number of ways. According to Asad Rehman, of Friends of the Earth UK, for example, it is shaping up as "a great escape for polluters and a poison chalice for the poor". At the other end of the spectrum, though, Edward Cameron, the Irish-born director of Business for Social Responsibility, sees it as "a signal to the wider world that the era of building prosperity on high carbon is coming to an end". The latest streamlined negotiating text, released on Thursday night, has something for everyone - almost. It's a measure of the huge amount of work done by ministers and delegates from 195 countries that the number of square brackets - indicating contentious issues - has been slashed from 1,609 when COP21 started on November 30th to only 48 in the latest draft. That, itself, is a major achievement. Devil in detail As always, however, the devil is in the detail. Although the long-term goal is to "hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees", the draft agreement is quite vague on how this is to be achieved. At the outset, a number of options were put forward, such as reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by between 40 per cent and 95 per cent by 2050 and "decarbonisation" of the world's economy over the course of this century (as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recommended) through setting a "carbon budget". Under this, emissions would be limited in order to achieve temperature goals. All the 27-page text says is that countries would "aim to reach the peaking of greenhouse-gas emissions as soon as possible, recognising that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter towards reaching greenhouse-gas-emissions neutrality in the second half of the century, on the basis of equity and guided by science in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication". What "emissions neutrality" would look like has not been defined, but it is certain to permit the continued burning of fossil fuels if the emissions can be offset by planting more forests as "carbon sinks" either at home or abroad, or by using unproven technologies such as carbon capture and storage, or even more fanciful geo-engineering notions about sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. Setting a realistic price for carbon - by far the most effective economic tool to curb emissions - is not in the draft agreement, even though this would do more than anything to accelerate a global switch to clean technologies. Also, setting a timeline "in the second half of the century" to achieve "emissions neutrality" could mean any time between 2050 and 2099, although nobody really expects that it would be the latter. As expected, the "elephants in the room" at the conference - aviation and shipping - have got off scot-free yet again, even though they already account for nearly 6 per cent of global CO2 emissions. A paragraph calling for these to be limited or reduced, by working through the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, respectively, has disappeared from the draft agreement. Updating the pledges On the plus side, conference delegates have agreed on a process for reviewing and updating the pledges already made by 185 countries to reduce their emissions, even before the Paris agreement takes effect in 2020. There are also references to developed countries providing a minimum of $100 billion (EUR 91 billion) a year in aid to poorer nations from 2020 onwards, to enable them to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. This was a key demand of the least-developed countries and small island nations on the frontline of global warming, and was first promised by richer countries in 2009 at the abortive Copenhagen summit. Another make-or-break element of the Paris deal was a "loss and damage" mechanism for countries hit by the worst impact of global warming, first mooted at COP19 in Warsaw two years ago. Its inclusion is a concession to their insistence, but this came at the price of excluding any route to compensation claims under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \</doc>

In an increasingly globalised economy, multinational corporations are some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful entities. Just over 1,300 companies control 80 per cent of global operating revenues, with 40 per cent of this controlled by only 147 organisations. The annual revenue of a company such as Royal Dutch Shell or Walmart is more than double the GDP of many countries, including Ireland. Such wealth gives business enormous potential to contribute to sustainable economic and social development. In recent years "sustainability" has become a business buzzword. However, despite more than 20 years of business engagement with social and environmental issues, global indicators suggest we are farther away from achieving just, stable and resilient societies that function within increasingly vulnerable ecological limits. The aim of the COP21 negotiations that began this week is to produce an international framework to limit human-driven global warming to below two degrees. Nation states will be ascribed legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These targets cannot be achieved without significant engagement and investment from the private sector, particularly from multinational corporations who are both sponsors and "civil society" representatives in Paris. The financial crisis showed key elements of our economic system, of which businesses are the engine, are deeply flawed. The short-term focus of financial markets and the primacy of shareholder value mean business decisions are made within a narrow frame: maximise profit, quickly. Long-term goals The concept of sustainable development is based on long- term ecological and societal goals. To make business compatible with sustainability a paradigm shift is required, away from financial short- termism and towards holistic, long-term thinking. Currently, business discourse on sustainability is dominated by the "business case". Investment in sustainability-related issues is said to benefit the organisation, for example, energy efficiency leads to cost savings. This win- win premise is an excellent idea when it holds. However, it does not always do so. For example, if British American Tobacco was to switch to manufacturing only e-cigarettes, society would benefit, the company likely not. The fundamental issue with the business case is that it is limited by the need to fit within the existing paradigm of financial short-termism. Much business talk of sustainability simply puts a "green" gloss on business as usual. For a paradigm shift to occur, business must look beyond the business case. This is not just a pipe dream but an alternative being implemented by some of the largest global companies. Sustainability vision In 2011, Unilever ceased to publish quarterly financial statements, a controversial decision initiated by chief executive Paul Polman as part of his "longer-term" sustainability vision. The day Polman announced the new policy, the company's share price dropped 8 per cent. In the short term there was no business case for scrapping quarterly reporting, but Unilever's stock rebounded within six months and has since doubled. This challenge to short-term shareholder pressures illustrates that it is possible to go beyond the business case and maintain financial stability. Unilever is among several large companies making innovative operational changes for sustainability. Organisations such as Marks & Spencer, Puma and O2-Telef\'f3nica have implemented initiatives which go beyond efficiency gains (the benefits of which are often negated by increased productivity) to "eco-effectiveness", reducing total ecological impact. Marks & Spencer, for example, is exploring the possibility of "dematerialisation", reducing supply chain waste by allowing customers to rent clothing. Puma has created a biodegradable running shoe that customers can return to its store to be composted at the end of its useful life. Here in Ireland, the Musgrave Group operates in accordance with core values that include "long-term, stable relationships" and "not being greedy". Sustainability is a challenge to accepted norms. It requires business leaders to think beyond conventional notions of the purpose of a business, to recognise that our current economic system is unsustainable in a societal and an ecological sense, and to take an honest look at the role of business in perpetuating that system. We must stop thinking of sustainability as an element of company strategy, an optional extra to be added on if a business case can be made. To make a real contribution to a just, equitable, and ecologically sustainable future, business must begin to look beyond the business case.

French aircraft conducted a "massive" bombardment of Islamic State's stronghold in Raqqa, northern Syria, last night, 48 hours after eight jihadists dispatched by the group killed 129 people and wounded 352 others in Paris. The defence ministry said 20 bombs targeted a command post and a training camp. President Fran\'e7ois Hollande had earlier vowed that "France will be merciless against the barbarians" of IS. At the same time, French and Belgian authorities launched an international manhunt for a 26-year-old Frenchman who is believed to have been the "eighth terrorist" in the attacks. The wanted man is Salah Abdeslam. He and his brother Brahim are believed to have opened fire on the Petit Cambodge, La Carillon and \'c0 La Bonne Bi\'e8re cafes and restaurants in Paris's 10th and 11th districts on Friday night, killing more than 40 people. Brahim blew himself up with an explosives belt at the Comptoir Voltaire bar. Salah is believed to have jumped back into their Belgian-registered black Seat car and driven away. Car found The car was found in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil yesterday morning. It contained three Kalashnikovs. Incredibly, Abdeslam had been stopped for a routine identity check at Cambrai, on the Belgian border, on Saturday and allowed to continue. Another brother, Mohamed, was taken into custody, but the terror suspect cannot be found. Abdeslam may have fled to Belgium, where several of those involved in the attacks lived in the Molenbeek section of Brussels, known for its strong jihadist presence. The identity of three of the killers, all French citizens, was established by forensic specialists who were able to take prints from fragments of fingers. Six of the seven died when they detonated explosives vests. One was shot dead by French commandos. Police earlier identified Ismael Omar Mostefai (29), as one of three assailants who killed 89 people at a rock concert by the California group Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan music hall. Though Mostefai's name appeared on a terrorist watchlist, he was never imprisoned. Paris prosecutor Fran\'e7ois Molins explained how three synchronised groups carried out seven attacks in the space of 33 minutes - the deadliest terrorist assault in Europe since 192 people were killed in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Three people were arrested in Molenbeek, the neighbourhood of Brussels that is 80 per cent north African Arab, on Saturday morning on suspicion of collusion in the attacks. French prime minister Manuel Valls said 103 of the dead have been identified, while up to 30 more bodies remained to be identified. Young people were heavily represented among the victims, who came from at least 15 countries including Algeria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Chile, France, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia and the US. An Irish man is in a serious but stable condition in hospital in Paris after undergoing surgery for gunshot wounds he suffered during the concert at the Bataclan. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was contacted by a large number of concerned Irish people over the weekend, and asked that Irish citizens in France let their families know they are safe. France will come to a standstill at noon today for a minute's silence in memory of those killed. At 4pm, Mr Hollande will deliver a speech to the National Assembly and Senate, in congress in Versailles, "to unite the nation". Claude Bartolone, the speaker of the Assembly, said Mr Hollande will "explain the various decisions that must be taken to ensure the security of the French people". Pay homage Thousands of people gathered at the Place de la R\'e9publique and the sites of the Paris attacks to pay homage to the victims with flowers and votive candles. The crowds scattered at least twice last night when loud noises were heard. The exploding bulb of a street lamp emptied the Place de la R\'e9publique in minutes, but it filled again later. French authorities said the three suicide bombers who died outside the Stade de France, killing one passerby, had intended to enter the stadium, which would have claimed many more victims. The French government also said the COP21 UN Climate Conference to take place at Le Bourget on November 30th, will go ahead. More than 100 heads of state are to attend the opening day, which will be transformed into a show of solidarity. \</doc>

FAMILIES in areas at risk of flooding have been told there is little option now but to "wait and see" as floodwaters are set to peak in the next 48 hours. Water levels continued to rise along the River Shannon yesterday, while the River Lee in Cork was also on the verge of bursting its banks again. A 'status orange' weather warning is in place for today, with Met \'c9ireann predicting heavy rain will sweep in from the Atlantic at Kerry and work its way across the country. For the first time, authorities have sought help from the European Emergency Centre in Brussels, which has begun using observation satellites to assess the extent of floods. The Office of Public Works (OPW) received unprecedented images of Limerick city, Athlone and Carrick-on-Shannon taken using the multi-billion-euro Copernicus system. The system has pulled together information from multiple sources to give the most comprehensive overview available to officials here. It is commonly used for natural disasters or humanitarian crises. Jim Casey, the OPW's head of Hydrology and Coastal Section, said: "We have requested them to monitor the floods as they are evolving now and over the coming days." Athlone is still at severe risk of flooding with the chairman of the National Co-Ordination Group John Barry saying concern is growing that the defences used in recent days to keep areas dry may not cope with the rising water levels. Asked whether any families had been advised to move out of their homes ahead of the expected surge of floodwaters tomorrow and Monday, he said: "It might well come to that." In Limerick, the senior council engineer, Vincent Murray, admitted it was now a case of wait and see. "We will have to wait and see what happens over the next 48 hours but at the moment it's good that the ESB has held the discharge rate [at Parteen Weir in Co Clare] at 375 cubic metres per second - we can cope with that," he said. Critical The critical factor in Limerick, as in Cork, will be the rainfall tomorrow and on Monday when high tides are scheduled. "We are not overly concerned by the tides; we have had much higher tides and have coped well before, but it's the rainfall and the water coming from upstream that we have to monitor," Mr Murray added. If water levels on Lough Derg, upstream on the Shannon, continue to rise, traders and householders in vulnerable parts of Limerick and Clare could face a flood threat as severe as 2009 when, between Cork and the mid-west, over (EURO)200m worth of damage was caused. In Cork, officials are hopeful that, despite the risk, Cork city, Bandon and Skibbereen will escape a repeat of the disastrous floods of 2009, 2012 and 2014. Since Storm Desmond hit last weekend, just under 500 Defence Force officers have been deployed to help communities. Personnel were last night active in six locations: Castleconnell, Clonlara, Portumna, Ballinasloe, Athlone and Claregalway. Defence Minister Simon Coveney vowed that Army units equipped with high-axle trucks would remain deployed in support of emergency services. "All State agencies will do everything they can to protect people and property over the coming days," he said. Environment Minister Alan Kelly arrived back in Dublin last night, having spent the week discussing climate change at the COP21 conference in Paris. He will meet the emergency co-ordination group today. Temperatures are also set to drop today, prompting garda\'ed to warn motorists to take extra caution on the roads. Meteorologist Evelyn Cusack said there was "a degree of uncertainty" attached to the weather system coming in but it was likely to "track across Ireland". "There could be an hour or two of snow," Ms Cusack said. The week ahead is likely to bring "waves of rain" that will be "quite heavy at times". Mr Barry said that public safety is now the major priority. He said people should stay away from rough seas and use detours rather than risk using flooded roads. \</doc>

Paul Melia in Paris A LARGE portion of Dublin's electricity demand in the future will be taken up by data centres, Energy Minister Alex White has said. Speaking at the UN climate summit, Mr White said a number of companies are in discussions about opening centres in Ireland due to our temperate climate and availability of renewable energy. And he said that a White Paper on Energy, due to be published next week, will be the first time that a roadmap will be in place to phase out usage of fossil fuels over time. Speaking to the Irish Independent, he also said it will discuss the issue of community ownership of renewable energy projects including wind farms, because a "new approach" is needed. Mr White was at the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) where the focus was on energy. His comments come as new research published in 'Nature Climate Change' suggests that global carbon emissions from industry and from burning fossil fuels to produce energy are levelling off, and may fall this year. The drop is attributed to a reduction in coal consumption in China due to lower economic growth and a move towards renewables, coupled with growing concerns about air pollution. But Martin Kaiser, head of international climate politics at Greenpeace, said the reduction came as "no surprise" due to the continued roll-out of renewable energy, and cautioned that two years of stable emissions did not make a trend. Tech companies are increasingly demanding that enormous quantities of energy needed to run data centres, which store documents, video and other communications, are sourced from wind and other renewables. Microsoft, Amazon and Google already have facilities here, while Apple is planning another at Athenry, Co Galway. Mr White said Google had informed him in Paris that it remained "very interested" in Ireland. "I think it's important Ireland conveys the message we're progressive on the energy side," the minister said. "They (Google) are saying they continue to be very interested in Ireland, and committed to renewable energy. "There are data centre plans from a number of companies, and a considerable portion of Dublin's energy demand will come from data centres." He said the Government's white paper will set out the roadmap to decarbonising the economy, and will reference community participation in renewable energy projects. He said the paper will also reference the roll-out of electric vehicles, and will cover the period to 2030. "This is the first time we're grappling with an ultimate phase out of fossil fuels," he said. "It's not just electricity, but heat and transport." He added that wind farms will require financial support for "some period" of time, but will eventually have to operate without a subsidy. Separately, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged almost 200 nations to strike a legally-binding deal to combat climate change, saying there was "rising support for a strong, universal agreement". "We are on the verge of one of the most important peace agreements of our times, making peace with our planet," he said. \£6 Never fear, chocolate is here Fairtrade (of course) bars are being handed to delegates with the name 'Change Chocolate' promising to give "all the energy you need to fight for our future during the climate negotiations". But lest anyone think it's just a sweet gesture, each bar has a serious message: "During all your negotiations, please think about us children and what is best for our future. We children are first, the economy is second." \£6 NGOs frustrated NGOs are increasingly frustrated about not being able to take part in negotiations. Step forward Malaysia, hailed in the pamphlet 'Eco' for defending the rights of civil society against corporate interests and for calling for more transparency in the talks. Hmmm. Amnesty International and others have highlighted that freedom of expression is increasingly under attack in the country, with opposition and human rights figures arrested, and often executed in secret. \£6 Negotiating global deal Agreeing a global treaty is a difficult business, but the brinkmanship is beginning to frustrate Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid. "The negotiators have driven their ministers to the dance, but they have to stop flirting with each other and seal the deal," he noted. \</doc>

WITH the COP 21 The idea for the proclamation came out of a conference on energy co-ops organised by Cloughjordan-based NGO, Cultivate. Signed by over 100 community groups, co-operatives, energy agencies and NGOs, the proclamation calls for a number of policy changes to allow communities to participate in Ireland's energy generation and to allow the community energy industry to develop. These include setting a target for community energy in Ireland and removing a number of technical and financial barriers such as access to the grid, payments for solar energy for micro-generation and for renewable heat, and support and advice structures to enable community groups to develop renewable energy projects. The initiative is supported by Duncan Stewart, Environmentalist, Broadcaster and chairman of the judging panel of the local newspapers' Get Involved initiative. Speaking to this newspaper, Duncan said; 'One of the areas that Get Involved focuses on is local energy. There is massive potential for communities across Ireland to produce a portion of their own energy needs and reduce their carbon footprint. 'To reach our national climate and renewable energy targets communities need to be empowered to install energy efficiency measures and insulation retrofits to buildings, and harness local renewable sources. The transition to a clean energy future will not happen without the power of the people.' In contrast to many of our European neighbours, community-owned renewable energy in Ireland is practically non-existent. A fundamental shift in policy is required that views citizens and communities as indispensable agents in securing our energy future, not obstacles to be negotiated. The Community Energy Proclamation recognises communities as active participants in the clean energy transition, and as one of the best way to unlock the renewable energy potential in Ireland. Davie Philip, the Cloughjordan based mentor of the Get Involved contest said: 'Every time we pay our energy bills, millions of euros pour out of our communities that could have stayed there creating jobs and energy security. A community will be more resilient and be better able to reduce its carbon footprint it can contribute to the generation of the energy it needs.' \</doc>

What is happening in Paris? A total of 147 governments will attend the 21st so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) in an attempt to hammer out a deal to address climate change. This is needed because the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), having reviewed scientific literature from across the globe, has concluded that climate change is real, is caused by human activity, and must be addressed to prevent catastrophic changes to our climate system. How many people will attend? Organisers believe around 30,000 will attend the summit, which will be opened this morning by French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and French Foreign Affairs Minister and President of COP 21 , Laurent Fabius. Will civil society be represented? Yes. Side events are organised, but there will be no large-scale climate marches following the Paris terrorist attacks. Have we not been here before? Yes. The first COP took place more than 20 years ago, and in 1997 a deal was struck - called the Kyoto Protocol. But, crucially, the USA pulled out. It is hoped to strike a new deal in Paris. What's the scientific evidence? This year is the hottest on record, and last year was the stormiest winter on record in Ireland. Average global temperatures have risen 1C in the last century, and scientists believe if they go above 2C it will cause "dangerous" climate change. Have countries set out their emission reductions in advance? Most have. But experts warn the current limits will keep warming to 2.7C - not enough to prevent catastrophic change. Can these targets change? Yes. There is nothing to stop countries from pledging more ambitious targets. What is Ireland's position? We are bound by the European Commission, which has ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 20pc by 2020, and 30pc by 2030. Next year, international EU negotiations will begin where Ireland hopes to secure lower targets for agriculture. What are the stumbling blocks? There are many. A crucial question surrounds finance, and who will pay the bill, and in particular assist developing countries to adapt. Is there hope? Yes. The prospects of a deal have never been better. The US and China, among the biggest emitters, have agreed to reduce emissions and there is a mood among civil society, governments and business for change. It will all fall to the level of ambition expressed by countries. It is hoped to secure a deal by Friday week, when the conference formally closes, but organisers have indicated it may run into Saturday if required. Paul Melia \</doc>

If you were the head of French state television and your leading weatherman started preaching climate scepticism in the run-up to the UN climate conference in Paris, you would probably sack him too. Philippe Verdier, "Monsieur M\'e9t\'e9o" (Mr Weather) at France 2, published a book titled Climat Investigation last month, in which he pooh-poohed global warming and questioned the probity of the 830 scientists who comprise the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change. The panel says if nothing is done to reduce carbon emissions, the world's temperature could rise by up to 4.8 degrees by the end of this century. It is 95 per cent certain that most of the global warming since 1950 has been caused by man-made greenhouse emissions. Verdier used his position as Monsieur M\'e9t\'e9o to promote his book. "Every night I address five million French people to talk to you about the wind, the clouds and the sun," he said in a promotional video. "Yet there is something important, very important, that I haven't been able to tell you We are hostage to a planetary scandal over climate change. A war machine intended to keep us in fear." At the root of this conspiracy, Verdier claimed, "are scientists who are manipulated, politicised, conflicts of interest, corruption, sex scandals, politicians who think only of their image and their thirst for power, blind media who get carried away and censor under the pressure of shareholders and advertisers, contradictory financial interests, mercantile NGOs and religions in search of new beliefs". In his book, Verdier vaunted the "merits" of climate change - the attraction to tourists, lower heating costs in winter, better wine and champagne. No one denounced him as a nut case. He told Les Inrockuptibles magazine he decided to write his book when foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will preside over the COP21 climate change conference in December, urged weathermen to report on "climate chaos". Fabius appeared on a magazine cover as a weatherman with the title "500 days to save the planet". "If a minister decides he is Mr Weatherman, then Mr Weatherman can also express himself on the subject in a lucid manner," Verdier said. Asked about Verdier, Fabius said, "If one is a serious scientist, there is no debate Of course, in history there have been famous precedents of minorities who were right. But one mustn't invert reason and say that just because they are a tiny minority, they are scientifically right." On November 1st, Verdier posted a video in which he read his dismissal notice in silence. Delphine Ernotte, chief executive of France T\'e9l\'e9visions, told Paris Match that her employees "must distinguish between personal opinions and what may be attributed to the company. He confused these, and that's a problem for me." Daniel Schneidermann, an editorial writer for Lib\'e9ration newspaper, warned of the "Streisand effect" whereby attempted censorship merely amplifies the internet audience. "Firing [Verdier] will make the presenter an instant martyr of climate skepticism," he predicted. In other "climate chaos", socialist politicians have clashed, yet again, over air pollution in Paris. In the face of predicted peak levels of pollution yesterday and today, Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris, and Jean-Paul Huchon, the socialist president of the \'cele-de-France (Paris) region, demanded that environment minister S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal activate a plan to limit traffic to cars with odd or even plate numbers on alternate days. Royal, in Beijing with President Fran\'e7ois Hollande, said the plan would not be activated before tomorrow, and only if peak levels were reached. (They were not.) As accusations of incompetence and bureaucracy flew, it became clear no one is certain who holds ultimate responsibility for activating the anti-pollution plan. In an earlier clash over anti-pollution measures last spring, Hidalgo said "the health of Parisians is non-negotiable", while Royal said it was not reasonable to impose the hardship of odd/even car days on residents of the suburbs. \</doc>

FRANCE is secretly planning to bring back passport checks on all its borders. According to a leaked letter, the French government will temporarily re-introduce controls for a month from next week. Officials say the move is necessary to keep order as it hosts the UN Conference on Climate Change from November 30 to December 11. In a letter to EU officials in Brussels, French diplomats reportedly wrote that 'the controls at the borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain' will be temporarily reintroduced from November 13. \</doc>

Sweden alerted the French government to the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl two days after it occurred. The priority of French authorities was to prevent panic, perhaps because France produces 75 per cent of its electricity in nuclear power plants, the highest share in the world. On April 28th, 1986, the evening news presenter on public television reported in all seriousness that a high-pressure zone from the Azores would block radiation at the French border. "From a public health point of view, there is no risk," the deputy head of the health ministry's radiation protection service said. "Cloud stopped at the border," was Lib\'e9ration newspaper's mocking, front- page summation of the government's position. Decades of investigations, accusations and lawsuits over alleged misinformation followed. The true effects of Chernobyl in France were never fully elucidated. The French comforted themselves with the knowledge that their plants, unlike Chernobyl, are encased in concrete. Likewise, when the nuclear accident occurred at Fukushima in 2011, the French said their country was not threatened by powerful earthquakes or tsunamis. "This reasoning is wrong," Pierre-Franck Chevet, the president of the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), said in an unusually forthright interview with Le Monde today. "We could have earthquakes or floods greater than expected in France, acts of malevolence against a plant," Chevet said. "To think it only happens to others means you're not accepting the consequences . . . Japan was caught by surprise . . . We could be too." Dismantling costs The electricity company EDF needs EUR 55 billion to renovate 58 nuclear reactors on 19 sites, to extend their lifespan from 40 to 50 years. But it has neither the means to prolong their service nor the EUR 74 billion the EU Commission says it will cost to dismantle them in coming decades. One lesson of Chernobyl was that a nuclear accident does not spare one's neighbours. Switzerland recently filed a lawsuit over the Bugey plant in eastern France, for "deliberately endangering the lives of others". On Sunday, hundreds of people, most of them German, demonstrated against Fessenheim, France's oldest, 39-year-old nuclear reactor, in Alsace. The German government has long demanded it be shut down. To satisfy intermittent allies in the Green Party, President Fran\'e7ois Hollande promised in 2012 that he would close Fessenheim in 2016. At his annual environmental conference yesterday, Hollande promised to sign the closure order this year. But Fessenheim will remain in service at least until 2018. It cannot be shut down until the new European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Flamanville, on the English Channel, comes online. Flamanville is six years behind schedule and EUR 7.2 billion over budget. A nine-year delay and EUR 5.2 billion cost overrun on the EPR that France is building for Finland has poisoned relations, with the Finnish power company suing the French contractor Areva. The future of a French- built EPR at Hinkley Point, England, is also in question. Pro-nuclear lobby The need to reduce carbon emissions has strengthened the pro-nuclear lobby, who claim nuclear energy is "clean". On the strength of the December 2015 agreement at the COP21 climate conference, environment minister S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal frequently refers to France's "environmental excellence". Yet only 14 per cent of French electricity comes from renewable sun, wind, marine and biomass energy, below the European average and well below France's goal of 23 per cent by 2020. The 2015 law on energy transition promised to reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from 75 per cent to 50 per cent by 2025. But until renewable energy provides 40 per cent of electricity, Royal said yesterday, France will not start scaling down its use of nuclear power. "I'm not going to cut off French people's electricity to satisfy anti-nuclear ideologues," Royal said, calling anti- nuclear groups "obsessed". Royal was supposed to announce a multiyear energy programme detailing plans for transition from nuclear to renewable energy, including the schedule for decommissioning ageing nuclear plants, by late 2015. A second, February deadline also passed. Hollande yesterday promised the plan by July. Some expect it won't materialise before the May 2017 presidential election. "The government seems to constantly postpone decisions it could take today," L'Opinion newspaper said. "This procrastination is the rule for everything concerning the nuclear programme." \</doc>

MII director Cormac Healy said it would be foolhardy to demand that Ireland should reduce its beef output. He said Ireland operates one of the most eco-friendly beef industries in the world. It would be foolhardy in the extreme to curb the production of beef in a country where we produce in an extensive grass-based system that is far more efficient and sustainable than elsewhere in the world, said Mr Healy. He said Irish beef has the fifth lowest carbon footprint in Europe and is far more sustainable than beef production in South America.\~ He said Ireland s meat sector is also committed to the Bord Bia-led Origin Green initiative, an independently verified, national scale sustainability programme which involves a sustainability audit of all farms and the use of the Carbon Navigator tool enabling farmers to focus on improving both their economic and environmental efficiency. Mr Healy cited a World Bank statement which noted: If every cow was as good as the top 10% produced in Ireland we would have one-third less methane emissions on the planet. He also praised Taoiseach Enda Kenny for the views he expressed at the COP 21 meetings in Paris last week.\~ He said Mr Kenny set out the progressive steps being taken by Ireland to meet the challenge of climate change and to further improve the efficiency and sustainability of agriculture and food production in Ireland. He singled out the exceptional performance of Irish agriculture in particular. However, the Taoiseach was criticised by environmental group Friends of The Earth for taking a soft position on climate change Friends of the Earth director, Ois\'edn Coghlan, said: The reason we are not on track to meet our 2020 targets is because this Government has made no concerted effort to do so. It will go through its entire five year term without producing an Action Plan to reduce emissions. Compare that to the Action Plan for Jobs and you see what policy looks like when the Government is serious about setting and meeting targets. In fact, Friends of the Earth has reluctantly concluded that the Government is deliberately not trying to meet the 2020 targets, because they want to say to the European Commission look, we told you that they were too hard, make our 2030 targets easier. MII s Cormac Healy said Ireland remains very sustainable compared to food production in many other parts of the world.\~ The meat sector alone supports over 100,000 jobs across farming and processing in rural Ireland and accounts for some 3.5 billion in export earnings annually, he added. \</doc>

Football fans have until now focused on the risk of jihadist attacks during the Euro 2016 championship, to be held in 10 French cities from June 10th until July 10th. They must now also consider the danger of strikes, transport chaos and even civil unrest. France has seen almost daily demonstrations by the left of the left, who demand withdrawal of a new labour law, for 2\'bd months. But participation was waning and the communist CGT, France's largest trade union, has turned to more drastic measures, including blockading petroleum refineries and storage facilities and open-ended transport strikes. Yesterday, railway workers announced daily strikes from May 31st. Civil aviation employees will strike on June 3rd, 4th and 5th. This is in addition to already scheduled train strikes today and tomorrow, marches against the labour law and blockades in French ports tomorrow, an open-ended strike in the Paris metro from June 2nd and further marches on June 14th. For the first time in the current crisis, the government yesterday used force to "liberate" the Esso petroleum refinery and storage depot at Fos- sur-Mer in the southeastern Bouches-du-Rh\'f4ne department, which the CGT had occupied overnight. 'Burning pallets' When police from the mobile guard stormed the site at 4.30am, they encountered "significant resistance" including burning wood pallets and tyres, and projectiles. It took an 90 minutes to dislodge the trade unionists with water cannon and tear gas. Only one of France's eight refineries was functioning normally last night. The CGT's siege of petroleum facilities has led to panic buying in much of the country. Prime Minister Manuel Valls vowed all fuel facilities will be "liberated". Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said 2,400 of France's 12,000 petrol stations are dry or running out of fuel. Queues The government has ample petrol reserves, and Mr Valls has promised there will be no shortage. Images of queues and closed petrol stations seem to contradict him. The other enduring image of the crisis is that of a burning police car on the sidelines of a police protest against "cop hatred" on the Place de la R\'e9publique on May 17th.\~ In video footage, policeman Kevin Philippy parried blows from hooded men as he emerged from his burning car. He, the policewoman who was with him, and several others were given medals by interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\~ The government says more than 300 police have been injured by protesters this year. Authorities cosset the police, who have full powers under the state of emergency, while protesters accuse security forces of brutality.\~ A controversial CGT poster shows the badge of the CRS riot police and a baton in a pool of blood with the words: "Stop police violence!\~The police must protect citizens, not beat them!" At a dinner with the Presidential Press Association in 2013, President Francois Hollande said he was worried about the volatility of "the street".\~For four years, he has done his utmost to mollify "the street", by zig-zagging between liberal reforms and concessions to the left of the left, who supported him in 2012. But placards at demonstrations frequently mock Mr Hollande's assertion in his most recent television interview that "Ca va mieux" - things are improving - in France. "Let us be ungovernable!" is another slogan. Mr Hollande yesterday accused a "minority" of orchestrating a "strategy of blocage". Only 3 per cent of French workers belong to the CGT, but the union holds nuisance power far beyond its numbers.\~ Embody opposition CGT leader Philippe Martinez, has come to embody opposition to the government. Six other trade unions and student groups are following his lead in the strikes and demonstrations. 's front-page editorial yesterday accused the CGT of "social terrorism", while graffiti daubed in red outside the socialist office in the Paris suburb of Palaiseau called the party "social traitors".\~ In the early hours of Monday morning, socialist headquarters in Grenoble were sprayed with automatic weapon fire. In Lille, men wearing balaclavas attacked the facade of the socialist federation with baseball bats. Access points to the stadium have been reduced from 26 to four, resulting in bottlenecks and the entire stadium has been surrounded by a 2.4 metre high fence. Ticket-holders managed to smuggle in smoke and stink bombs, and security forces had to use tear gas, amid wailing children, when the match ended. Mr Bernard Cazeneuve noted that the COP21 climate conference and Cannes film festival took place without incident.\~He promised lessons had been learned from the "unfortunate dysfunctions" at Saturday's match. \</doc>

WITH the COP 21 The vision of the proclamation is for a transition to a clean, secure energy system for the citizens of Ireland, where communities - whether organised as co-operatives, voluntary associations or individual citizens - can get involved in energy planning, conservation, energy generation and energy distribution. . The idea for the proclamation came out of a conference on energy co-ops organised by Cloughjordan based NGO, Cultivate. Signed by over 100 community groups, co-operatives, energy agencies and NGO's the proclamation calls for a number of policy changes to allow communities to participate in Ireland's energy generation and to allow the community energy industry to develop. These include setting a target for community energy in Ireland and removing a number of technical and financial barriers such as access to the grid, payments for solar energy for micro-generation and for renewable heat, and support and advice structures to enable community groups to develop renewable energy projects. This initiative is supported by Duncan Stewart, Environmentalist, Broadcaster and chairman of the judging panel of the local newspaper's Get Involved initiative. Speaking to this newspaper earlier this week Duncan said; "One of the areas that Get Involved focuses on is local energy. There is massive potential for communities across Ireland to produce a portion of their own energy needs and reduce their carbon footprint. To reach our national climate and renewable energy targets communities need to be empowered to install energy efficiency measures and insulation retrofits to buildings, and harness local renewable sources. The transition to a clean energy future will not happen without the power of the people." In contrast to many of our European neighbours, community owned renewable energy in Ireland is practically non-existent. A fundamental shift in policy is required that views citizens and communities as indispensable agents in securing our energy future, not obstacles to be negotiated. The Community Energy Proclamation recognises communities as active participants in the clean energy transition, and as one of the best way to unlock the renewable energy potential in Ireland. Davie Philip, the Cloughjordan based mentor of the Get Involved contest said, "Every time we pay our energy bills, millions of euros pour out of our communities that could have stayed there creating jobs and energy security. A community will be more resilient and be better able to reduce its carbon footprint if it can contribute to the generation of the energy it needs." \</doc>

CV: Jean-Pierre Th\'e9bault Role: French Ambassador Age: Lives: Ailesbury Road Family: wife Aurore and children Jean-Baptiste and Ariane Hobbies: cooking Just finished reading: Franco-Irish Military Connections 1590-1945 by Nathalie-Genet Rouffiac and David Murphy Favourite Film: Cyrano de Bergerac Jean-Pierre Th\'e9bault was with his wife and two children at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on the evening of November 13 enjoying a performance of L'Oubli\'e9, a contemporary French circus performance that fuses theatre and dance. "It was extraordinary. It was a wonderful performance and a wonderful evening," he says. "And then the text arrived." The message was from his step-brother, who was looking out of the window of his apartment close to the Bataclan, and was just four words long: "It's war in Paris." By accident, the French ambassador to Ireland had become one of the first people to learn of the horrors that were beginning to unfold across the French capital. "I didn't understand it," Th\'e9bault says. "I called him straight away, and he said there were bodies all over the avenue, and shooting everywhere. He lives on the third floor of an apartment block, and could see everything that was unfolding on the ground. So we understood quite quickly that something really terrible was happening." Through the course of a long and sleepless night, the full extent of the Paris attacks emerged. By the next morning, with the death toll having risen to well over 100, Th\'e9bault and his compatriots were under no illusions about the threat they were facing. "This was a coordinated, indiscriminate mass attack by people who did not care whether they themselves survived. It was a completely new form of terrorism," he said. "In some ways, the word terrorism doesn't fully reflect what we are now facing. It is an ideology first, and a terror ideology second. It thrives on and enjoys the feelings of fear it creates. It has taken us into a long-term fight that will not be solved by dialogue or discussions and where no accommodation is possible, because this is a totalitarian regime that will never accept how we live." We are meeting a few weeks after the Paris attacks. Th\'e9bault is just back from a five-day visit to the city, his first since the outrage. An air of sadness remains, he says, but so too does a determination to carry on life as normal. There is also, he says, huge gratitude for the outpouring of support the city and country has received. "I've had so many people come up to me since the attacks and say 'we went to France this year on our holidays, and we will go again next year'. It is their act of solidarity with our people, and it is something that we are deeply grateful for," he says. "We have had letters of support from all over the country, we have had drawings from children that they have made in school - all of that will go into the embassy's archive. I will never stop saying how thankful we are to the Irish people for everything they have done for us during this challenging year. For us, it has been incredibly moving." As ambassadorial residences go, 53 Ailesbury Road is nothing short of spectacular. When it was placed on the market by the French government in 2008 it had a price tag of (EURO)60 million, - with 40 rooms and over 11,000 square feet of living space, it reportedly attracted interest from the likes of Denis O'Brien and Derek Quinlan. But by the time the year was out, the property market had collapsed and the bids received on the house had been withdrawn. So it was that when Jean-Pierre Th\'e9bault arrived in Ireland with his wife and two children in 2014, he found himself living in what had been described at the time of its aborted sale as "by far the largest and grandest detached house in the city". He had never been here before, but had met many Irish people over the years in his home city of Lourdes. "The first time I saw an Irish flag, it was flying over one of the hotels in Lourdes. It caught my eye as a child because it was a tricolour, just like ours - it made me want to find out more about it," he says. The year-round population of Lourdes is a modest 18,000, but every year it attracts eight million visitors. "It's a really unique place to grow up, because it's very local and very international at the same time," Th\'e9bault says. "I have no doubt that my diplomatic career was inspired by the fact that, even as a very young boy, I was meeting people who had come to Lourdes from all over the world." He studied history at university before furthering his studies at the Paris Political Sciences Institute and the National School of Administration, then joined the ministry of foreign affairs in 1988. By 1992 he was a special adviser on European affairs in the office of the prime minister. The following year brought both his 30th birthday and his most challenging assignment to date, as head of a European monitoring and negotiating mission in the former Yugoslavia. He led a team of some 60 military personnel attempting to monitor the situation in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and, where possible, negotiate ceasefires, prisoner exchanges and the return of the bodies of casualties to their families. "It was very challenging. We were unarmed, with only flak jackets and helmets for protection, and we were very easy targets. But it was the type of mission where as a diplomat you felt that you were having a real, tangible effect on the situation on the ground," he says. "One of the proudest days of my life was when I was able to reach agreement to get the first food convoy into eastern Mostar [the city was under siege]. We knew that if we didn't get that convoy through, it could be a week before we could try again, and the civilian population was suffering terribly, as they always do in these situations." He spent two years in the former Yugoslavia; it made him "a very convinced European", he says. "It's easy to criticise Europe, but what is the alternative? The former Yugoslavia could have been a brilliant example of Europe working together to ease a transition to democracy. But instead we didn't pay enough attention, and a truly terrible war broke out," he says. "We must not forget the lessons of that war. We must always remember that peace is not a given - it is something that we must actively defend. "Nothing that we have built as Europeans could have been possible without us all contributing to it, and nothing will be kept if we do not realise that it is up to us to express a strong political commitment to it. "We need a Europe that is completely embraced not only by its governments, but by its people." More than (EURO)8 billion worth of goods and services were traded between Ireland and France last year; the country is our sixth-largest trading partner. Over 200 Irish firms, among them Glen Dimplex, Accenture, CRH and Smurfit-Kappa, operate in France - between them, that group of 200 employs over 16,000 staff. Here, around 130 French companies employ 13,000 people. It is by any measure a prosperous relationship, but Th\'e9bault believes there is plenty of scope to grow it. The COP21 agreement on climate change, which was negotiated in Paris before Christmas, will not only benefit the environment, he believes, but the business landscape too. " COP21 "France and Ireland are already cooperating strongly in areas like sustainable energy, sustainable transport and energy efficiency, and this gives us the opportunity to do even more." A special France/Ireland forum on sustainable energy will take place next spring, according to Th\'e9bault, and will gather together national and local government representatives as well as businesses and researchers. In another initiative designed to boost relations, a number of young Irish and French students interested in careers in the hospitality and tourism sectors will travel to study and train in each other's countries. Those links, Th\'e9bault says, make him feel "very close to at home" in Ireland. He and his wife Aurore have taken their two young children on a family holiday to Mayo ("I promised Aurore good weather and lobsters; we got the lobsters at least"), and he himself has visited areas including west Cork, Galway and Carlingford. The couple are keen gastronomes, and travel regularly to discover Irish ingredients and cooking - oysters from Dungarvan and butter from west Cork are particular favourites, and here again, he believes there is scope to boost trade between both countries. "There is great potential for Irish artisan food producers to grow their business in France," he says. "I would love to see more Irish products with 'protected designation of origin' status - in France we have about 400 of them, but there are only five here. My grandfather was a farmer, so I've always had an interest in what is produced on the land, and what that says about a country and its people. It's a very strong physical expression of a culture." That interest in Irish food extended to Christmas dinner at 53 Ailesbury Road, with the family enjoying oysters from Dungarvan, Carlingford and Galway followed by lobster thermidor, a leg of Mayo lamb with c\'eapes and girolles, and cardons \'e0 la mo\'eblle, a traditional Lyonnaise dish of chard in a marrowbone sauce. As for the wines, they too had an Irish connection, coming from two of the most famous wine geese ch\'e2teaux - Lynch-Bages and Kirwan. \</doc>

AMANDA FERGUSON About 5,000 people took part in a march through Dublin yesterday aimed at putting pressure on the Government and world leaders ahead of the COP21 UN climate change summit in Paris. Hundreds of people joined other marches in Belfast, Cork and Galway as part of a global day of action. The Dublin march was organised by Stop Climate Chaos, a coalition of 28 organisations including Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Tr\'f3caire. The crowds braved some harsh and stormy conditions to make their presence felt as they made their way from Custom House Quay to D\'e1il \'c9ireann. The march was led off by a dozen or so members of the Dublin Cycling Campaign and just before it got under way a coal-burning steam train thundered over the protesters on the Loop Line Bridge to hoots of derision from the crowd. "I'm here for my little boy," said broadcaster Jonathan McCrea nodding in the direction of his four-year-old son. "I turn 40 next year and when he turns 40 the world will be a much different place. There is very little I can do. I feel useless but at least by marching we can show our Government this is an issue we care about." Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said climate change was an issue the Government "doesn't care about" . He accused the Coalition of "shaming our country" and paying lip-service to the will of the people who want real action to be taken to curb emissions. Scathing "I think there will be a deal in Paris," Mr Ryan said. "Everyone is moving in the right direction in lowering their emissions except us. Ours are actually increasing. We are becoming a pariah in Europe." Friends of the Earth director Ois\'edn Coghlan was similarly scathing of the official response to the climate change crisis, but was not as upbeat as Mr Ryan about the prospects of a deal being struck in Paris. Mr Coghlan said people had come on to the streets of cities all over the world because they "no longer trust our leaders to grasp the urgency of climate change or the opportunities of action". Cork In Cork, a teenager who won the BT Young Scientist of the Year competition for her research on solving the global food crisis was among close to 400 people who attended the climate change rally in the city centre. Time magazine as one the most influential teenagers in the world, said it was important to build momentum prior to the meeting in Paris . "My particular area of interest is food security. To make sure the world is food-secure, we need 50 per cent more food by 2015 and that is a crazy amount. "We need everybody to get together in order to achieve these goals." People at the rally on Grand Parade held placards with slogans such as "System Change, Not Climate Change", "Keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground" and "There is No Planet B". Belfast In Belfast, the threat of Storm Clodagh was not enough to keep around 300 protesters from gathering at Writer's Square. Amandine Chesnel (8) from Belfast was among the young activists. She was carrying an "Act Now: There Is No Plan B" banner made with the help of friends and explained her motivation for joining the day of action. "I don't think that the world should be overheating," she said. Demonstration organiser Niall Bakewell from Friends of the Earth said: "It is a very important gathering of world leaders and we need around the world to give a message that they now are running out of time to get the right deal." International effort Green Party leader in Northern Ireland Steven Agnew MLA said Stormont had a responsibility to take part in the international effort to tackle climate change. David Thomas from Christian Aid wanted to send a message to world leaders at the UN climate talks that they "need to take action on climate change urgently". Galway In Galway, several hundred people, including performers and drummers, braved heavy downpours of rain and a south- westerly gale to take part in yesterday's Carnival for the Climate. Chanting reworked lyrics to the tune of Italian partisan anthem Bella Ciao , the participants set off from Eyre Square to the Spanish Arch. The event was organised by Transition Galway and was supported by representatives of a number of groups, including NUI Galway's Irish Centre for Human Rights and Amnesty International. \</doc>

Every year science throws up remarkable discoveries, great advances, important decisions and new ideas, and 2015 was no different. For what it is worth here are five really good things that happened during the year just past, and they are presented in no particular order. Innovation 2020 The Government published "Innovation 2020 Excellence Talent Impact" its strategy for research and development, science and technology. Launched last month, it lays down a plan for how the State will fund and support research in all disciplines but particularly science and technology in the coming years. The Government was wise to allow a good amount of discussion as the document evolved so, for a change, we really do seem to have some form of consensus, at least based on the early response of the research community. The strategy remains strongly pro-industry and private sector, continuing the Government's current approach to discovery and innovation. This demands that academia and the private sector join forces in collaborative ventures that have the potential to deliver jobs and new companies. Wisely, however, the strategy also makes room for frontiers research, with funding arriving for blue skies science via a new programme to be run by the Irish Research Council. It will be interesting to see how the strategy plays out in the coming months. Nobel Prize for Irish scientist For only the second time an Irish person has claimed a Nobel Prize in one of the sciences. William Campbell shared the prize for medicine or physiology with two others, with his work related to the development of a new drug for the treatment of parasitic diseases, particularly River Blindness. It doesn't matter that he was born in Derry and spent virtually all of his adult life in the US. He grew up in Ramelton, Co Donegal and did his undergraduate degree at Trinity College Dublin so he is Irish through-and-through by any measure. If the Innovation 2020 strategy really works we should be seeing lots more Nobel laureates with Irish sounding names in the coming years. Crispr/Cas9 Some have described Crispr/Cas9 as launching a new era in molecular biology. It is a gene editing method that allows scientists to make very precise, targeted changes to the DNA of living cells. It achieves pinpoint accuracy so it takes the uncertainty out of where an edit to DNA has been made. It emerged several years ago but took off in a big way during 2015 and has received lots of media attention, so it is a bit of a cheat to include it in 2015. This technology is going to change our lives in ways that we have not yet begun to imagine. It can be used to alter genes in plants and animals but can also be used to edit human DNA, immediately raising ethical concerns. It could be used, for example, as a way to change faulty genes into working genes in various diseases. But it potentially could be used to make you taller, give you blue eyes or deliver a hair colour on demand - provided the genes responsible for this can be identified. Once again scientific advancement has raced ahead of our ability to develop a balanced ethical approach to its future use. Joining Cern and Eso This arises because of the Innovation 2020 document but is important enough to deserve separate treatment. The document stresses the importance of Ireland's involvement in international collaborations, and this now officially includes these two important research bodies. It has been a long battle to get the Government to accept the value and clear economic return on spending money to join them. The strategy states that it is time for us to begin negotiating an entry deal that will open up the right of Irish scientists to participate. Cern is Europe's nuclear research centre, the home of the 27km long Large Hadron Collider, the particle smasher that helped discover the Higgs Boson. Eso, the European Southern Observatory, is one of the premier locations to do advanced astronomy, using the largest telescopes the world. It is built into the mountains of Chile, hence its description as the southern observatory. COP21 The clear success of the climate change negotiations in Paris last month suggests that the world's governments have finally woken up to the collective threat posed by global warming. Targets were set and agreed. Did it do enough? It delivered more than many believed it could, almost complete international acceptance that climate change is a danger to us all. It may be too little too late but at least it has the potential to stabilise warming and prevent things from getting worse. Let's hope for all our sakes that it is enough to make things change for the better. \</doc>

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been cast as the villain of the COP21 UN climate conference. "Saudi Arabia is braking on every important subject," says Denis Voisin of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation. "They're playing for time, contesting long-term objectives about reducing emissions and decarbonisation." Liz Gallagher of the environmental think tank E3G calls Saudi Arabia "the first and primary disrupter in the talks". Riyadh has so far blocked attempts to enshrine the goal of a 1.5-degree ceiling on the rise in temperature. It would preserve island nations such as the Philippines, where most of the Saudis' servants come from. Saudi Arabia opposes statements about climate-friendly investment and refuses to help developing countries fighting climate change. They've even asked for assistance which, as Gallagher says, "is a bit rich, coming from the world's 13th wealthiest country". Pakistan as puppet The country exerts influence over the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). When the "Like-Minded Developing Countries Group" decided this week to endorse the 1.5-degree goal, the GCC objected, at the Saudis' behest. Saudi Arabia uses other Sunni Muslim countries such as Pakistan "to say things the Saudis don't want to say themselves", says a highly placed source. The Saudis are masters at obstruction. They've banned the words "renewable energy" from the draft accord. They object to "decarbonisation" and prefer "climate neutral" to "carbon neutral." Ultimately, the linguistic arguments mask deeper issues over the objective of the accord and who assumes responsibility for fighting global warming. On the opening day of the conference, Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi called for "emissions-reduction policies that do not discriminate against any of the energy sources". Climate Action International, a network of more than 950 NGOs, gave al-Naimi its "Fossil" award for saying there should be no distinction "between clean and dirty fuels, a statement that fundamentally undermines what everyone is trying to achieve at the climate summit". Negotiating tactics In an interview with Elizabeth Kolbert of the New Yorker The Saudis are defending their livelihood or as the French say, their bifteck (steak). With temperatures often above 50 degrees, they too are threatened by global warming. "Parts of the kingdom won't be inhabitable, no matter how much technology you bring," says Gallagher. "Their outdoor air-conditioning brings temperatures down from 55 degrees to 35 degrees. They do have a vested interest in a good outcome. They want to have a diversification strategy. But they want to do it on their own terms and they don't want international pressure." With the world's largest oil reserves and lowest production costs, Saudi policy has been to drive down the price of petroleum. "They basically want to bankrupt everybody and put them out of business so that theirs is the only oil that will be sold," says Gallagher. "When they talk about the end of fossil fuels, I think they mean everybody else's but not theirs." Anti-Americanism Alba, a group of left-leaning South American countries led by Venezuela, is also causing problems. They are motivated by anti-Americanism. "They believe that climate change is an imperialist imposition, which is true," says a veteran negotiator. "And therefore they don't want to participate in any solution that is also imperialist, where the US dictates how much money will flow, etc." The South Americans "can make a lot of noise and they can be very dramatic and it will get a hell of a lot more dramatic before we close on the weekend", says the same negotiator. "You'll have people screaming and crying and standing up on their chairs and making flamboyant multihour statements." But ultimately, neither Saudi Arabia nor Alba have the economic weight to block an agreement. "The Saudis know the Chinese and the US need an agreement," says Gallagher. "So they're not going to bring down the show. What they will do is systematically undermine the quality of the deal coming out of here." Ten nations yet to pledge on emissions Of the 195 countries represented at the UN climate change discussions, 185 have submitted pledges. The 10 which have yet to do so, in order of contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, are: VenezuelaEmits 0.83 % of global greenhouse gases Uzbekistan 0.5 % Libya 0.27% North Korea0.18% Syria 0.15% Nicaragua 0.09 % Nepal 0.08% Panama0.05% East Timor 0.002% Saint Kitts and Nevis less than 0.0001% \</doc>

There are no jobs on a dead planet. David Begg, former general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions summarised things neatly when recently asked to consider the nebulous crossover of business and environmentalism. "The future of work is dependent on environmental stability." The issue can be a slippery thing to grasp because of traditional, if waning, corporate attitudes that a "green agenda" is bad for the bottom line. Today, more Irish companies (and Irish-based companies) are embracing the concepts of carbon reduction and energy efficiency, if not for their own peace of mind, then for that of their investors and customer base. As the COP21 The December event will, for the first time in more than two decades of entrenched UN negotiations, aim to achieve binding agreements on action. Many of the 50,000 participants will be from the corporate world and today there is an entirely different perspective on business and the environment than at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the precursor to the first UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Accordingly, latest figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show the carbon content of electricity last year fell to half its 1990 level. "Outside of governments a lot of businesses are looking at Paris in the sense that the world is changing," says the authority's chief executive, Dr Brian Motherway, who believes the days of companies not really engaging are over. "They know change is coming. We need policy to evolve in terms of [energy] price and incentives and disincentives so we can start to change. The call is: let's get on with it." Ireland is advantageously placed as a country that exploits renewable energy and doesn't produce fossil fuels. "We are at a point where what we don't have is going out of fashion and what we do have is coming into fashion," says Motherway. "Paris is going to be, in my view, a much stronger sense that things are going one way and we are getting out of fossil fuels." New technologies are making energy efficiency easier and more attractive. Data handling and communications have been revolutionised and it all feeds into business. Solutions to problems are easier and cheaper. "Five years ago if you were talking about clean energy you were probably a bit ahead of the curve. Now for any company who is looking at it strategically there is a sense of inevitability this is no longer an add-on glossy bit. It's become part of the business strategy cycle. It's about risk. It's very much part of the boardroom conversation." The private sector's response to environmental realities can be roughly divided in two parts: the corporate world pulling itself into a new frame of mind and the emergence of nascent industries capitalising on it. Of the latter, new ventures are appearing all the time. Among the recently acclaimed are Climote, which uses remote technology to control home heating. SELC, based in Co Mayo, produces efficient LED street lighting and recently struck a deal in Florida to use its technology to transfer energy consumption data from individual homes through its network of streetlights to the utilities which, in turn, pay for the service. Similarly, UrbanVolt, which began trading last April, signed a three-year deal with Bord G\'e1is Energy to become the LED lighting retrofit provider for 30,000 Irish SMEs. In September it announced intentions to invest EUR 30 million rolling out its energy-efficient system. Diageo has pounced too. In November it officially opened its new, energy-efficient brewery backed by a EUR 169 million capital investment, becoming one of the world's most technologically advanced and environmentally sustainable operations. Often green initiatives are employed somewhere along the commercial chain completely unseen by the consumer. Motherway talks about supermarkets beginning to ask producers what they are doing to be environmentally conscious so they can pass the knowledge onto customers. "There is a shift in consumer demand. I have talked to people in the agri-sector who say Tesco won't buy their produce anymore unless they have an energy plan or a sustainability plan," he said. "They call it different things but basically the supermarkets will want to say the stuff on our shelves is not bad for the environment." Environmentalism and consumer behaviour has come a long way since "Save the Wales" tuna boycotts, aerosol disdain and soft-drink cans reinvented with secure ring pulls. Inevitably, as the consumer war is increasingly won (to varying degrees) the remaining frontier is largely corporate. But there is a crossover when companies require the support of the public. This is particularly true of energy. The academic John FitzGerald, when discussing market prices, pointed to the example of post-Berlin Wall life in the Soviet satellites. "Households were not ready for this," he wrote of Poland, where old fashioned flat complexes had central heating systems which residents could not individually control. As energy prices drew level with western markets, it became unsustainable until the inevitable installation of individual hot-water meters and improved insulation. Environmental reform and efficiency is often a synergy of commercial and consumer needs. In Ireland, this scenario has played out particularly visibly in wind energy. When SSE Airtricity successfully undertook its wind-farm project in Moycullen, outside Galway, it did so by engaging with locals. "This is not about arriving when the turbines are going up," managing director Stephen Wheeler recently said of a scheme which compared more favourably with controversial equivalents in other parts of the country. "It really means going and talking to locals, being clear about our plans. Ultimately this is about keeping the lights on: this is about having an infrastructure in place that supports and enables the transition from having a heavy-carbon to a low-carbon system." Consumers Consumer pressure to effect change is also on the rise. This week the worldwide Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) launched its Ireland report, which goes a long way to illustrating improving corporate culture based on investors. Set up 15 years ago, the CDP "serves" 822 investment organisations responsible for $95 trillion (EUR 90 trillion) in assets, all of whom are concerned about environmental credentials. In 2015, 28 Irish companies reported their carbon emission status, up from 23 the year before. There are also more than 170 multinationals who report their emissions from Ireland. "Companies have made considerable progress in recent years, whether by adopting an internal carbon price, investing in low-carbon energy or by setting long-term emissions reduction targets in line with climate science," Paul Dickinson, executive chairman wrote in the 2015 report. "Investors . . . use CDP data to help guide investment decisions. Many investors are critically assessing the climate risk in their portfolios, leading to select divestment from more carbon-intensive energy stocks or, in some cases, from the entire fossil fuel complex." The bigger Irish-registered companies in the CDP report include Accenture, AIB, C&C and Shire. But, warns CDP Ireland Network chairman Brian O'Kennedy, "much work still needs to be done, with only a third of the top 30 Irish publicly quoted companies reporting, a figure well below the global average." Similar words of caution appear elsewhere. Ahead of the COP21 , there are those who believe Irish business and industry could be doing more - particularly with crucial systemic supports. Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth makes the point that standards are one thing but enforcement is another. "[We] welcome all initiatives that genuinely reduce emissions and push actions on climate change, but as the Volkswagen scandal shows, it's vital that it provides a proper regulatory framework," he says. "You can't leave it to companies themselves, even those that seem so prestigious." Perhaps not surprisingly, Eamon Ryan, Green Party leader and former minister for energy and natural resources believes a similar lynchpin should be provided at policy level. "I think Irish business is waiting for the political signal that we are serious about this. As soon as they get that we will take off," he says, referring to the raising of standards in business and construction in particular. On the latter issue, the Isec-listed Kingspan appears to be making significant progress and the principal regulation it adheres to is its own. The building materials company was recently placed on the CDP "A List", among just 113 companies. In the case of Kingspan, this means impressive targets such as achieving a 100 per cent procurement rate for renewable electricity (target net zero energy) by 2020, and they are well on course. Again, this is no moral or conscientious epiphany: it is good business, and that is the most compelling message that can ultimately alter the course of global commerce. Mark Harris, divisional sustainability director, explains the three strands to its strategy are securing energy efficiency, generating their own energy via wind, solar thermal and biomass technologies, and purchasing renewable energy. "[The CDP report] was a big driver from our point of view but what the CDP also does is it demonstrates to the wider stakeholder community, particularly our customers, what we are doing," he says. "It's a very powerful message to the marketplace. It's all about payback at the end of the day. Obviously we are a commercial business and we invest in energy efficiency because it pays back." Ultimately, strategising for carbon reduction is nothing new to the business world and many are looking to Paris simply to cast it in stone. In September last year, for instance, the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group produced its report, Unlocking Opportunity: The business case for taking climate action in Ireland. It pushes a similar, and appealing, philosophy: carbon reduction is not just about meeting "the scale of the threat posed by climate change", but also to grasp the resulting business opportunities. As a solution it says several components are important to carbon reduction, including a better exchange of user and financial data on the electricity grid; wind power; zero energy buildings; the low-carbon production of food, and easier access to investment capital for such initiatives. "Decarbonisation," the report states, will create "tens of thousands of jobs, driving competitiveness and exports, efficiency and productivity gains, innovation, supply chain, development, energy security, health benefits, fuel-poverty alleviation, boosting tax revenues and regional development". The dominant analytical approach that "decarbonisation must cost" requires rethinking and as an incentive list, it's difficult to argue with. If the environment's troubles are capitalism's opportunities, there appears to be few reasons left to fight the inevitable. Particularly when it's all good for business. \</doc>

Revenge is a dish best eaten cold . A decade ago, S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal watched helplessly as Val\'c3\£9rie Trierweiler, a journalist at Paris Match magazine who is 11 years her junior, stole the heart of Fran\'c3\£7ois Hollande, moved in with the socialist party leader and eventually became first lady. Some argue the ensuing drama should be confined to the private lives of the protagonists. But Hollande and Royal are political animals, and their story of love, rivalry, rupture and reconciliation is at the core of contemporary French politics. After seven years in purgatory, Royal, who had been spurned and humiliated, has made a stunning comeback. She has resumed her role as chief supporter and adviser to Hollande, with whom she lived for 27 years. In April 2014, Hollande appointed the mother of his four children as the third-ranking member of prime minister Manuel Valls's government. Royal is no ordinary cabinet minister. Detractors say she's a temperamental and bossy diva whose restoration symbolises a decadent monarchy. Nonsense, Royal told L'Obs magazine. "We're in France, country of the rights of man and woman, in 2015, not at Versailles under Louis XIV." Royal's admirers say the 17 million votes she won as the only Frenchwoman to have made it to the run-off in a French presidential election confer a special status that justifies her position. Royal may be playing for higher stakes. After losing municipal, European and departmental elections since last year, the socialist party's prospects are poor in next December's regional elections. Hollande wants to be re-elected in 2017 and could sack Valls in the hope of making a fresh start. If that happens, Royal is the leading candidate to replace Valls at the prime minister's office. Royal has already become a central figure in Hollande's presidency. In January, he sent her to Jerusalem to represent France at the funerals of four Jews who were murdered during a jihadist attack on a kosher supermarket. Her presence annoyed foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who believed that as second in the government, he should have gone. In February, Royal accompanied Hollande to the Philippines to raise awareness of global warming. Their complicity was obvious at a joint press conference. When the Germanwings flight crashed in March, Royal rushed to the scene of the catastrophe with interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve. In April, she and Hollande together launched the Hermione , a replica of the frigate the Marquis de La Fayette sailed to join the American revolution. In May, she again accompanied Hollande on an official journey, this time to the Caribbean. According to L'Obs , Royal has a direct telephone line to Hollande's office. The couple often have Sunday lunch at the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e with their four grown children. Royal sits to the right of Hollande at cabinet meetings. French media have taken to calling her "la vice-pr\'c3\£9sidente" or "Hillary", an allusion to the US presidential candidate, whose relationship with Bill also constitutes an indestructible political alliance that was shaken by infidelity. Trierweiler has observed Royal's return with sardonic detachment. "They're inseparable," the former first lady told Le Parisien newspaper when the paperback version of , her venomous account of life with Hollande, was published in May. "It goes beyond their children. They share an immoderate taste for politics. Power is their reason to live, their shared obsession . . . There wasn't room for another woman in this story. Now they can be together, help each other and exploit the media and the power they both crave." At present, it's as if France has two first ladies. Royal (61) is in the limelight as a semi-official consort and "queen mother". Julie Gayet (43) is the discreet presidential mistress who lives at the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e with Hollande. For Royal owes both her fall from grace and her resurrection to Hollande's fickle heart. As long as Trierweiler inhabited the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e, Royal was persona non grata. Trierweiler had been so jealous that during Hollande's election campaign she demanded images and quotations from Royal be erased from campaign videos. Royal was literally airbrushed out of history. After his election, Hollande reportedly offered his former partner the presidency of the Institut du Monde arabe, a prestigious ambassadorship or a post as an EU commissioner. She declined all, because she wanted to return to government. Closer magazine revealed in January 2014 that Hollande has been riding pillion on a motor scooter to assignations with Gayet. Two weeks later, Hollande announced in a terse statement: "I have put an end to the life I shared with Valerie Trierweiler." Trierweiler was evicted from the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e. The last barrier to Royal's political rehabilitation had been removed. As ecology minister, Royal is embroiled in a power struggle with foreign minister Laurent Fabius for control of the COP 21 UN conference on climate change , which Paris will host next December. Hollande, who always attempts to reach a "synthesis" of opposing points of view, decided Fabius, the president of the conference, would lead diplomatic negotiations, while Royal would mobilise French public opinion and France's European partners. Rivalry between Royal and Fabius goes back to 2006, when she announced her candidacy for the socialist party's presidential nomination. "But who will look after the children?" Fabius quipped to journalists. He and Dominique Strauss-Kahn - who joked that Royal should have stayed home rather than read kitchen recipes during a debate on international politics - found it galling to be upstaged by Royal. She defeated both men in the November 2006 primary, winning 60.65 per cent of the vote. Royal and Fabius attended the COP 20 climate change conference, in Lima, last December. She had left arrangements until the last minute, by which time all flights were fully booked. Hollande lent her the presidential jet. In Lima, she and Fabius did not hold a joint press conference. She departed early in the presidential jet, leaving Fabius and his delegation to fend for themselves on lowcost airlines. More recently, Royal criticised the negotiations for which Fabius is responsible. "The UN negotiations are totally inadequate compared to the urgency of the climate situation," Royal told Le Monde . "We must change methods." Royal has often been at odds with Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris. The ecology minister may have taken exception to past rumours about the nature of Hollande's friendship with Hidalgo. In any case, the women clashed repeatedly in recent months over Royal's crusade against what she calls "punitive ecology". Royal reversed Hidalgo's ban on wood-burning fireplaces in Paris and opposed severe restrictions on the use of cars during intense bouts of air pollution. Royal built her political career on intuition, and issues that please the masses. Last year she abolished the unpopular "\'c3\£9cotaxe" on heavy lorry traffic. It cost the French state at least EUR 800 million to dismantle electronic gates on French highways and compensate the private company that was supposed to collect the tax. When Royal first became a deputy in the National Assembly, in 1988, she made a point of asking where the creche was - there was none. Her fellow deputies mocked her for specialising in "women's issues", but the public remembered Royal's campaigns for lighter school satchels and paternity leave, against hazing, noise in school canteens, paedophilia, unsightly hoardings and violence on television. Last February, Royal suggested the proceedings of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's trial for "aggravated pimping" (he was cleared in June) be closed to the press and public, to prevent children hearing the lurid details of Strauss-Kahn's orgies. When Royal's concern was mentioned in court, Strauss-Kahn laughed. Royal has spent much of her life fighting macho men, starting with her late father, Jacques Royal. Lieutenant Colonel Royal treated his wife H\'c3\£9l\'c3\£8ne and eight children as if they were his troops. The family lived in Senegal, where S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne was born, and Martinique. Jacques retired early and became a travelling salesman, moving his family to a small village in Lorraine called Chamagne. The Royal children were forced to attend Mass and catechism. "Very early I understood the unbearable contradiction between going to Mass and coming home and saying things that were anti-Semitic or contemptuous of women," Royal said in archive footage included in the psychiatrist G\'c3\£9rard Miller's documentary S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal; the woman who wasn't a man . Royal's mother eventually left her husband, fleeing on a bicycle to Nancy, sleeping for several nights on a bench and working briefly as a cleaning lady to support herself. Legend has it Royal, then a fledgling law student, sued her father to force him to pay maintenance money to his wife and children. "My whole childhood and adolescence, I heard my father saying, 'Girls, you're going to get married, not go to university,' " Royal said in the same footage. "I didn't want to resemble the women in my family, women who were submissive in every way. I swore to myself: Never like my mother." Neither Royal nor Hollande ever married. For all her feminism, Royal enjoys a strongly maternalistic image. In her earlier incarnation as environment minister, she attended the 1992 earth summit in Rio while heavily pregnant and became the first French woman cabinet minister to give birth while in office. Royal's decision to invite television cameras to the hospital room where she stayed with her newborn daughter and fourth child, Flora, drew criticism. Royal said she wanted to show that women could be mothers and exercise important responsibilities. In political office, she saw to it that contraceptives, including the "morning-after" pill were made available free of cost in French lyc\'c3\£9es (secondary schools for students from about 15-18 years old). Both were from deeply conservative, Catholic, provincial families. He was humorous; she was serious. They were recruited to work at the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e when Fran\'c3\£7ois Mitterrand became president in 1981. Hollande and Royal were both elected to the National Assembly in 1988, when she was 35 years old. Their constituencies were 300km apart. In a now iconic photograph, the smiling couple stand in front of the assembly's columns, clutching their deputies' briefcases. Royal has long dark hair and wears a flowered suit. For years she dressed like a convent girl, in oversized spectacles and long Laura Ashley dresses. "She was fascinated by Hollande," says the political commentator Alain Duhamel. "Sometimes I invited both of them to lunch. If she arrived first, she was talkative, interesting. When Fran\'c3\£7ois arrived, it was as if she disappeared. She watched him. What mattered to her was what Fran\'c3\£7ois said." The balance shifted when Royal was elected president of Poitou-Charentes in 2004, becoming the only woman to head one of France's 22 regions. Poitou-Charentes had been held by the right for 18 years, and was the home region of then prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. Royal's victory made her famous. She shocked the socialist party "elephants" or old-timers by leading a poll of potential presidential candidates. For the first time, she and Hollande were rivals. As secretary general of the socialist party, Hollande endorsed the European constitutional treaty in the 2005 referendum. His ambition to become the socialist candidate in the 2007 presidential election was shattered when nearly 55 per cent of the French voted No. As his partner of 27 years grew ever more popular, with his own career in a shambles, Hollande set out to seduce Trierweiler. The journalist and party leader were saying goodbye in the street after a rally in Limoges, in April 2005. Hollande "gave me a kiss worthy of a scene in a movie", Trierweiler wrote later. "A kiss like none I had ever known." Royal learned of the liaison and asked Paris Match to take Trierweiler off the socialist party beat. A few months later, Royal gave an interview to Match . "May the best candidate win," she said. Hurt pride may have been the engine of Royal's presidential campaign, but she told no one she and Hollande had split up. "We thought S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne was living with her companion," said Aur\'c3\£9lie Filippetti, an adviser in the 2007 campaign and one of several young women politicians who were promoted by Royal. "We saw nothing, knew nothing. She was so strong that she got through the presidential campaign without ever showing what she was going through." At the February 2007 rally where Royal presented her programme, the elephants sat in the front row snickering. They preferred that Nicolas Sarkozy won the election. "Since the men in my own camp denigrated me, the French thought, 'If they say such horrors, she mustn't be any good,' " Royal later told French television. "There was no solidarity among socialists around my candidacy. Nobody said, 'She's intelligent. She's competent. We're 100 per cent behind her' . . . I was alone. With the solidarity of my camp, I think I could have been elected." The mystical, Messianic side of Royal's character came to the fore at her final election rally on May 1st, 2007. Christ-like in a white suit, she exhorted the 60,000-strong crowd to "Love one another". Five days later, she lost to Sarkozy, 47 to 53 per cent. A few weeks later, she announced she had "asked Fran\'c3\£7ois to live his life on his own". Royal wanted to replace Hollande as secretary general of the party, but the elephants ganged up on her and she lost the leadership to Martine Aubry in 2008. When Royal came in fourth in the 2011 presidential primary, she wept in front of television cameras. Then, in an extraordinary act of forgiveness and political foresight, she rallied to Hollande, saying it was "noble to help the one who is in a position to win". Hollande and Trierweiler were already ensconced in the \'c3 lys\'c3\£9e when Royal decided to stand for the National Assembly in 2012. Once she regained a deputy's seat, she hoped to become president of the assembly. But Royal suffered her fourth devastating defeat since 2007, after Trierweiler posted a tweet encouraging socialists to vote for the dissident candidate who opposed her. Today, Royal is again combative, energetic and deeply engaged in French politics. Regardless of how the UN climate change conference pans out, or whether she becomes prime minister, she has earned a place in history as the great survivor of the Hollande love wars. \</doc>

THERE are five good reasons for Ireland to be cheerful about COP21 , whatever the outcome of the Paris climate change summit. The result of the summit is currently unknown, but the direction of travel is clear. Countries across the globe have put together plans to tackle their emissions, many of which include renewableenergy generation targets. Strong policy signals about the transition to a lowcarbon economy are already reverberating across the globe. The prospect of success at the Paris summit has been boosted because the two biggest emitting countries in the world, the US and China, have started taking decisive action on climate change. Ireland is playing its part, but the chances of success are beginning to feel real as the big players come on board. China has said its emissions will peak by 2030 as it looks to combat the smog blighting some of its cities and show leadership on climate change. The US has released a Clean Power Plan to radically overhaul and decarbonise its power sector. It is estimated that the rule will cut powersector emissions 32pc below the 2005 levels by 2030. The G7 nations agreed to phase out fossil fuels altogether by the end of the century and for emissions to be cut by between 40pc and 70pc by 2050, compared with 2010 levels. So that's the good news and the indications are that Ireland and other nations will benefit from a legally binding agreement before delegates leave Paris. Here are five reasons why we can all be positive about the prospects for a sustainable future: 1. CARBON PRICING Regional carbon-trading schemes are being created as governments look to put a price on emissions. China is set to create what is expected to be the biggest scheme in the world in 2017. The EU's emissions-trading system is on the mend after politicians stepped in to tackle an oversupply of allowances. In North America, schemes in California and on the east coast are gaining traction, and it is thought that the Clean Power Plan could pave the way for other states to initiate carbon trading. 2. COMPANIES Not only are governments beginning to take decisive action against climate change, but businesses are now also leading the way. Many have now recognised that climate change is a material issue for them. Companies such as Apple and IKEA are sourcing their own power from renewables. Apple's investment in a new Data Centre in Athenry and the Docklands21 initiative to build a Sustainable Energy Community (SEC) in the IFSC and Silicon Docks are hugely positive steps. The global environmental disclosure organisation, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), recently said the number of companies with emissions targets has doubled since 2010. In Ireland, 28 of Ireland's leading corporates report under the CDP Climate Change programme, including Kingspan, which recently achieved an A grade. 3. INVESTORS Investors are increasingly realising that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are material. Some 1,380 firms representing a combined $59 trillion of assets have signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, which sees them commit to incorporate ESG factors into their investment decisions. Sonen Capital, a USbased impact investment management firm, is the latest ESG focused fund to domicile here. In Ireland, some $36bn is already deployed into Irishled sustainability projects and enterprises, funds managed or domiciled. 4. STRANDED ASSETS Some investors are increasingly taking seriously the risk that fossil fuel investments could be devalued or rendered 'stranded' as policies are brought in to discourage the burning of fossil fuels. 5. GREEN BONDS The green bond market has emerged as an increasingly popular tool in recent years for investors to channel resources into investments with an environmental theme. Since 2007, the market has grown rapidly and is thought to have seen $40bn of issues so far this year. Green bonds have the potential to help fund the transition to a low-carbon economy and countries such as India and China are actively encouraging the issuance of green bonds. A Europe-wide 'Green bond' seminar will be hosted by the ISI Centre in Dublin in January. IRELAND'S OPPORTUNITY Ireland is emerging as a hub for environmental finance by attracting a greater share of green assets, either under management or domiciled. BlackRock Renewable Power, Greencoat Capital, Brookfield Renewable and Kleinwort Benson Investors are amongst an emerging investment cluster. The country's businesses are looking overseas where their expertise is helping to finance, develop and construct sustainability related projects across the globe. The sector, a cluster of over 600 firms, is creating innovative, world-beating solutions with firms like Glen Dimplex, Cylon, OpenHydro, FenestraPro, SELC, OxyMem and Climote to the fore. Such firms are creating jobs and winning global investment. Opportunities for Ireland - founded on our financial expertise, innovative and entrepreneurial abilities - are emerging, holding the potential of sustainable growth and economic prosperity as the world transitions to a low carbon model.

BETWEEN now and the end of February every politician in the land will be looking for your vote so be prepared for some extra visitors on the doorstep. Environmental issues may not be very high up on the agenda of many of those seeking a seat in D\'e1il \'c9ireann, but if we do not ask the questions, they'll have no idea of our concerns. This week we look at some of the questions that should be put to anyone looking for your vote. CLIMATE CHANGE Question: What is your policy on climate change? Food 2025 is part of government policy to increase the current herd of 7.1 million cattle by 300,000 by 2025. Almost 1/3 of our current greenhouse gas emissions now come from agriculture. Methane, produced by cattle, is 20 times more heat retentive in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Increasing the national herd is a contradiction of Ireland's commitment to climate change at COP 21 The response will probably be that Ireland is producing food more sustainably and more efficiently than other countries and that if Ireland reduces or does not increase its output, other countries will produce the food in a less sustainable way. Your response: (1) This is the 'race to the bottom' argument. Germany will say it produces cars more efficiently. Poland will claim it produces coal more efficiently. Each country has its own pet project. (2) All this extra milk and meat will not feed the poor. (3) A large portion of the extra milk that will be produced is to be exported as powdered milk to China. This will discourage Chinese mothers who are now breast feeding their children and will result in them changing to powdered milk. (4) The production of meat requires far more energy in the form of land, animal fodder and fertilisers than the production of vegetables. From a health point of view, we should not be encouraging the consumption of more meat. In a world of 8 or 9 billion people, more food will have to come from cereals, rootcrops and vegetables. TRANSPORT If we increase emissions from cattle, we have to reduce emissions from either energy or transport. So, here are some interesting questions that arise from that: Have you any plans to increase public transport in this area? Can we have a smarter travel project in our town? We need more cycling routes for residents and visitors. What can you offer? ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY Questions: Why is there not more support for community based alternative energy co-operatives instead of supporting huge corporations supplying power to Ireland Do you think the grants for retro-fitting houses are sufficient in light of our commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions? What support are you giving for the installation of photo-voltaic panels (similar to solar panels but excess energy can be sold back to the national grid)? \</doc>

The Government's approach to the climate talks in Paris could be summed up by the country expression: "You can't run with the hare and chase with the hounds." On the one hand Ireland has played its full part as part of the EU negotiating block, seeking ambitious long-term goals, transparency, and momentum towards the target of a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on global temperature increases. On the other hand, both Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly have made the same argument about protecting Irish agriculture. It's a growing sector in Ireland, helped by the removal of quotas. It comprises 12 per cent of GDP, and there are plans to increase the national herd by 300,000. The Government says this can be achieved without increasing emissions. But emissions in this sector are already high (a third of all Irish emissions). Even without Europe moving to more ambitious emissions target in Paris, Ireland will face an uphill struggle to meet 2030 targets. It has essentially argued a special case for Ireland on the basis that Irish agriculture is among the most sustainable in the world. If it doesn't succeed in that argument the State will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of euro in annual carbon charges. The focus will now turn to Brussels in spring when EUstates will debate how to divide the burden of meeting the EU's 2030 targets. Mr Kelly yesterday stressed the inclusion of reference to "food security" in the text of the proposed agreement, which he said acknowledged the reality that food will have to be produced for a rising global population."Ireland is a very environmentally friendly producer of food, will continue to do so. We will continuously reduce our emissions from the agricultural sector." Richest countries But climate expert Prof John Sweeney said with economic growth Ireland would be one of the richest countries again in two to three years' time. "I just do not expect to see any special favours for Irish agriculture," he said. He said it was incumbent on every country to share the burden, and Ireland had to put a price on agricultural emissions under the "polluter pays" principle. "Agriculture and food companies should be brought into the net. I don't see Ireland getting special treatment for agriculture in the longer term. We will have to adjust our agriculture and our agriculture taxation system to reflect that." Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir from the department of energy policy in UCC said there had been less discussion on heat and transport, even though they comprised 80 per cent of energy use. "We have higher emission per capita because of dispersed population. We have a poor standard in building stock, though there have been improvements in new buildings. We still have a large legacy stock. "The challenge is to persuade one million households of the benefits of retrofitting their homes." Another reality that will emerge from Paris is that all transport will have to be electrified by midcentury. "In the public transport area, electric vehicles do not exist in the Irish bus fleet," said Prof Sweeney. "They were using hybrid buses in Paris for COP 21 . The network in Paris is electrifying in the next three years. "We cannot make excuses, because we won't be poor." \</doc>

The photograph on the front page of yesterday's Irish Times brought me back to a beach near Izmir in Turkey last month. The beach I went to was littered with shoes, backpacks and packaging for outboard motors and life-jackets. Picking through the debris of Syria's awful war, I could only imagine the anxiety of parents as they loaded their children into boats. I was told that smugglers would take no more than six children on each boat and that children under five went for free. Yesterday's picture also put in mind the restless anger that we all felt at the photo of Alan Kurdi last September. Somehow the mood has changed. Politicians and the media are now focused on how to deal with two "problems" - the refugee problem and the Islamic State problem. But if both were comprehensively dealt with tomorrow this would take you back to summer 2014, before Islamic State, also known as Isis, had captured great swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, and before the tide of refugees arrived in Europe. Back then, the conflict in Syria had already been accepted as the worst humanitarian crisis since the end of the cold war and the worst refugee crisis since the second World War. It must be obvious that the two issues (Islamic State and refugees) are downstream consequences of the original source of these problems: the government of Bashar al-Assad. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, even if the deluge of refugees was to subside and even if Islamic State was to be defeated, what would emerge would be the integrity of that originating quarrel. In spite of this, and informed by the obsession with refugees and Islamic State, insufficient attention has been directed towards resolution of the conflict. Some voices are even calling for Assad to be part of the solution. Disastrous models of succession In support of this viewpoint, frequently cited are the examples of the turmoil in Libya and Iraq following the fall of Col Muammar Gadafy and Saddam Hussein respectively. Clearly these disastrous models of succession are not to be recommended. But to even contemplate a future Syria with the house of Assad still in charge is Pollyannaism in the extreme. It is clearly in Assad's interests that the West focuses on Islamic State, so much so that the recent Russian military intervention that purports to target Islamic State has targeted all anti-Assad targets bar Islamic State. Solutions across the European Union must be found for the absence of EU solidarity on refugee intake. But perspective is important. If I told you that the population of the EU had increased in 2015 by 0.2 per cent you would probably think that that was a bit low and a strong indicator of the difficult demographic problems that lie ahead for our ageing population. More than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015. That is 0.2 per cent of the population of the EU. Notwithstanding this, the EU finds itself unable to cope. Fundamental freedoms, Schengen and all the principles of solidarity that form the basis for the EU are under pressure because of what Peter Sutherland referred to before Christmas as "ruinously selfish behaviour". German chancellor Angela Merkel's policies can succeed only if her generosity is matched by other member states. One hundred and fifty thousand migrants came to Ireland in 2007 alone (net migration was more than 100,000). We coped well with that number and significant numbers in the years previously. While times have changed, the economic recovery looks real and sustainable. It is incredible to hear Irish politicians say we should bear in mind there are still people on housing lists, as though we should wait until all social problems have been addressed before demonstrating solidarity with those fleeing crippling violence. If that argument was applied in Turkey and Lebanon, where would Syrians go? There are four million Syrian refugees in countries in the region. Is it good enough to say to Turkey: "Tough luck, they landed in your country?" Burden-sharing is the core of multilateralism. Election manifestos As we approach election season in Ireland, manifestos should have clear policies on the issue of Ireland's place in this debate. There will be a sense of trying to avoid politicising the issue. Such an approach would be mistaken. This is the compelling issue of our time. It is important that serious political comment is made on issues such as integration and migration generally. And there are many positive proposals that should be looked at. First, after our special pleading at COP21 , we should re-establish our multilateral credentials and drive hard for an international summit on migration and displaced populations, fed by citizens' forums at which issues around integration and diversity could be addressed. Second, while Ireland's peace process in not necessarily transferable, many lessons can be learned from our experience of the institutions and political economy of peace and reconciliation. Along with our status as a non-belligerent EU member state we have credibility and we should use it. Most of all we should continue to look at the Syrian conflict through a humanitarian lens and not through the lens of border security. Barry Andrews is chief executive of Goal \</doc>

Suicide bombers and gunmen linked to the Islamic State group were behind how the terrorist acts unfolded , Francois Molins said in a televised press conference. One of the suicide bombers in the attacks has been identified as Ismael Omar Mostefai, who lived in a Paris suburb and probably spent a few months in Syria during 2013 and 2014, Le Monde reported, citing Chartres Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges, a member of parliament, and another unidentified source. In Belgium at least three people have been arrested in connection with the deadly attacks, local prosecutors said. [media=bbw]2548542[/media] Faced with the atrocity that was committed, we are more determined than ever in our struggle against terrorism, Molins said. Quite probably there were three terrorist groups, who were co-ordinated, who originated these barbaric acts. In Belgium, the raids followed French requests related to a Belgian-plated rental car found near the Bataclan concert hall, Belgium s Federal Prosecutor s office told reporters. Police and intelligence agencies across Europe and beyond are racing to determine who was responsible for Friday s assaults, which French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande called an act of war . [media=bbw]2548605[/media] The slaughter compounds one of the deepest crises facing European leaders since the Second World War as they struggle to accommodate a stream of refugees from war-torn Syria while also facing jihadist retribution for air strikes on Islamic State. According to Molins, one of the three teams operating on Friday consisted of a trio of suicide bombers at the Stade de France, who wore identical explosive vests. A second drove to multiple locations in east-central Paris, firing hundreds of rounds from Kalashnikov rifles. And a third went to the Bataclan, where 89 people were slain before police stormed the theater, killing one gunman. The other two killed themselves with explosive vests, Molins said. Molins said information was still preliminary, and that police are working on the basis of witness statements and surveillance-camera footage. It s unclear whether additional suspects are still being pursued. In a statement posted on Twitter claiming responsibility, Islamic State said the violence was in retaliation for French air strikes on what it calls its caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. The attacks are the first drop in the rain, and should serve as a warning , it said. For the extremist group, the killings signal a structural shift in its modus operandi, representing a prelude to additional attacks in the West , political consultancy Eurasia Group said. [media=bbw]2548779[/media] Islamic State s leadership is committing to a strategy of pursuing retaliatory attacks against any country conducting airstrikes on its bases in Iraq and Syria , the note said. Ninety-nine people remain in critical condition, among a total of 352 injured, according to Molins. The death toll, which he warned could still rise due to the number of seriously wounded victims, is the largest for a terror attack in Europe since the 2004 train bombings in Madrid. Among the rapid developments in the aftermath of the assault: Marine Le Pen, leader of the hard-right National Front political party, said the attacks were evidence of the need for France to take back definitive control of its borders and strip French terrorists of their nationality; Laurent Fabius, France s foreign minister, said the United Nations COP21 climate talks scheduled for late November and early December in Paris would go ahead as planned, with reinforced security. Over 120 world leaders are expected to attend the conference; The Paris stock exchange operator said it would open trading as normal today . Schools will also be open nationwide; France s main Muslim groups issued a joint statement condemning the attacks and calling on Muslims to donate blood; Spurred by the Paris attacks, 17 nations in Vienna overcame policy differences over Syria and adopted a timeline to elect a new government by 2017. The killings are certain to intensify debate about accepting migrants fleeing Syria and Iraq for the European Union, where hundreds of thousands have sought shelter this year. Politicians in some countries argue the open-door policy advocated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel will let more jihadists into the 28-nation bloc. The attacks are also likely to reopen the issue of how to better integrate France s Muslim population, the largest in Europe. The co-ordinated assaults began around 9.20 pm on Friday local time with three suicide bombings near the Stade de France. Almost simultaneously, gunmen with automatic rifles jumped from cars outside various bars and restaurants in the vibrant 10th and 11th arrondissements of the capital, shooting at Parisians who moments earlier had been enjoying a normal start to the weekend. Theresa Cede, a 39-year-old who works in the telecommunications sector, was at the Bataclan when the gunmen burst in. I hid underneath the body of a man who was shot in the head Cede said. Another woman lying next to her was severely wounded, though Cede escaped unharmed. I don t know how many guardian angels I had looking out for me, she said. \</doc>

It was the sort of trip Taoiseach Enda Kenny loves, filled with wizardry and widgetry from Irish companies that have pioneered sewage-eating bacteria and James Bond-like digital vehicle-tracking systems. If there was a shadow over his official visit to France, it was the migration crisis, which he discussed with President Francois Hollande on Thursday and G\'e9rard Collomb, the prominent senator and socialist mayor of Lyons, yesterday. How many migrants will Ireland take, the Taoiseach was questioned at every turn. At a breakfast - organised by Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Embassy - on the top floor of the Sofitel, with a panoramic view over the Rh\'f4ne river and Lyons, Mr Kenny witnessed the signing of Franco-Irish contracts totalling EUR 5 million. "My presence here is to give witness to opportunities in the Lyons region," he said. Fifteen Irish firms will visit Lyons on a trade mission in November. Tricel, from Killarney, Co Kerry, makes sewage-treatment plants for buildings not connected to public systems. Bacteria that live in three- chambered tanks eat the waste and die, managing director Mike Stack explained. Tricel produces the tanks at a factory in Poitiers. "More than five million homes in France are not connected - that's 50 per cent of the European market," Mr Stack said. Wood-pellet boilers Wood Energy Solutions, which makes boilers fuelled by wood pellets, signed deals with French, Swiss and Spanish firms. Enterprise Ireland had invited the small company from Cahir, Co Tipperary, to a trade show in Saint-\'c9tienne in 2013. "We dipped our toe in the French market at that exhibition and met our French and Swiss partners," said technical director Declan Crosse. Derek Bryan, vice-president for sales at Fleetmatics, met the Taoiseach when he inaugurated the company's Tallaght headquarters in 2012. Mr Bryan said Fleetmatics was "the fastest growing software company in vehicle tracking globally". Its technology keeps watch on the maintenance, location, speed and fuel levels of fleets of vehicles. Fleetmatics bought the French firm Ornicar in Grenoble last February. It is a growth sector. At 15 per cent, French market penetration is much lower than Britain's 30-40 per cent, because French drivers object to the idea of "Big Brother" watching them. Mr Collomb welcomed Mr Kenny in the city's 17th-century town hall. Its magnificence bears witness to the fortune Lyons built on silk and textiles. Today, Mr Collomb said, it is a leader in life sciences, green and digital technology. Though nominally a socialist, Mr Collomb is allied with jis party's economically liberal, reformist wing, and like Mr Kenny he is gung-ho on business. The Taoiseach briefed him on his discussion of the migration crisis and the Cop 21 climate conference with Mr Hollande. They talked about the Irish recovery, their mutual desire to fight youth unemployment, French debt and the need for labour-market reform in France. Mr Collomb said he found the Taoiseach "very warm and straightforward and very engaged". Mr Kenny invited Mr Collomb to tag along with Mr Hollande when he visits Dublin next summer. And would he ever bring a business delegation with him? \</doc>

President Francois Hollande is retaliating with diplomatic and military means against Islamic State for the November 13th attacks that killed 130 people in Paris. Mr Hollande received an offer of assistance from British prime minister David Cameron yesterday, just as the aircraft carrier catapulted Rafale fighter-bombers against Islamic State targets in Syria for the first time. Mr Cameron paid an early-morning homage to the dead, with Mr Hollande and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo. Each laid a long-stemmed rose outside the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 were killed. Yesterday, an explosives belt believed to have been abandoned by Salah Abdeslam, one of the attackers, was found in a public litter box in Montrouge, south of Paris. Abdeslam's mobile telephone was detected near Montrouge before he fled to Belgium. "The United Kingdom will do all in our power to support our friend and ally France to defeat this evil death cult," Mr Cameron said at the \'c9lys\'e9e. Air base Mr Cameron offered France the use of the British sovereign air base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The two countries last shared the air base for a joint attack on Nasser's Egypt in 1956. Britain has also offered to refuel French aircraft on long-range sorties. Referring to the stepped-up air raids on Islamic State, also known as Isis, Mr Hollande said: "We will choose the targets that yield the best possible damage against the terrorist army." The arrival of the Charles de Gaulle in the eastern Mediterranean triples France's strike force from 12 aircraft, based in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, to 36. Mr Cameron hopes the atrocities in Paris will help him win parliamentary approval for British intervention in Syria. (Britain already participates in attacks against Islamic State in Iraq.) "Later this week I will set out in parliament our comprehensive strategy for tackling [Islamic State]," he said. France believes two steps it has already completed will provide arguments to Mr Cameron and other leaders who want to strike at Islamic State. The UN Security Council passed resolution 2249 on November 20th, exactly one week after the Paris attacks. And EU defence ministers voted unanimously on November 17th to assist France under article 42.7 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Negotiations Gen Beno\'eet Puga, Mr Hollande's chief of staff, has started bilateral negotiations to determine how France's European partners can best help. Resolution 2249 calls on UN member states to "take all necessary measures" against Islamic State. France would have preferred to invoke Chapter VII of the UN charter, which authorises military force, but feared getting bogged down in lengthy negotiations. By November 29th, Mr Hollande will have met with the leaders of the other four permanent members of the Security Council. At the same time, he will engage in last-minute negotiations before the UN COP21 climate conference. Mr Hollande will fly to Washington DC today to meet President Barack Obama. He will dine with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Paris tomorrow. On Thursday, he will have breakfast with Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, attend the France-Oceania summit and travel to Moscow to see President Vladimir Putin. Mr Hollande built his career in the French socialist party as l'homme de la synth\'e8se , who always managed to conciliate opposing views. He now hopes to bring the US and Russia together, though Washington insists that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad must step down, while Moscow wants him to remain in power for as long as possible. Versailles speech Mr Hollande's speech in Versailles last week was widely interpreted to mean that France had altered its position on Mr Assad. "In Syria, we resolutely, tirelessly seek a political solution in which Bashar al-Assad cannot constitute the outcome, but our enemy in Syria is [Islamic State]," Mr Hollande said. A source close to Mr Hollande now says "there is no reason to abandon one objective for the other. It was Islamic State that attacked France. That doesn't mean we will make less effort to make Bashar leave." At Versailles, Mr Hollande said he was working to establish "a grand and unique coalition" to fight Islamic State. His entourage now prefer to speak of "co-ordination" through a "cluster of bilateral proposals" with France at the centre of that "cluster." "It is what you would expect of a country that was hit so hard," an official said. "It was unspeakable what happened to us . . . We're a country that is trying to react with its allies." Mr Putin met with Iran's president, Hassan Rohani, and supreme guide, Ali Khamenei, in Tehran yesterday. France believes Mr Putin is now less attached to Mr Assad, and hopes to drive a wedge between the dictator's most stalwart allies. On Sunday, Mr Hollande will meet with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, lunch with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and dine with Chinese president Xi Jinping. \</doc>

"Environmental degradation . . . has a huge impact on human security and thus on the potential for outbreaks of violent conflict." You might expect this kind of statement to come from an environmentalist, especially when it is quoted at a conference of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN body that attempts to reverse land degradation. But the author, Harmut Behrend, is a military specialist working for the German armed forces. His article in Global Affairs soberly documents links between environmental breakdown and security threats worldwide. The UNCCD's current Conference of the Parties (COP12), in Ankara, is a curtain-raiser for the UNFCCC COP21 on climate change which begins in Paris next month. Its deliberations mostly move at a pace slower than that of drying paint. But there is a palpable sense of urgency about the dangerous relationship between land degradation, forced migration and war. The proximity of the host country, Turkey, to the conflicts in Syria and across the Middle East was underlined by the horrific bombings that killed at least 100 people in the capital, just before the conference opened last week. And a Turkish official reminded The Irish Times his country had already absorbed more than two million refugees in recent years. Turkey is also, of course, a key transit route for refugees and migrants. Productive land Many delegates at the COP, especially among the 300 accredited NGOs, argue there are deep environmental underpinnings to the Mediterranean migration crisis, and to the multiple armed conflicts associated with it, stretching from Nigeria to Afghanistan. They say these events can only be adequately understood in the context of the loss of productive land, a loss invisible for far too long from the perspective of the well-fed nations of Europe. "If you find that you can no longer feed your family from your own land, you do one of two things: you move somewhere else, or you fight," says Louise Baker, policy co-ordinator at UNCCD. And if you move somewhere nearby, it's not unlikely you will have to fight anyway. Whatever neighbouring productive land you may still be able to find is likely to be already occupied by people unwilling to share it. So some people decide to take the appalling risks of making the journey towards Europe. Migration is not a new phenomenon and in many cultures local seasonal movements of people, between high and low pasture or between town and country, have long been a normal part of life. People have always moved for better economic opportunities elsewhere. The current waves of migration, however, are very different, say Barbara Bendandi, from Italy, and Mariam Traore Chazalno\'ebl, from Mali, representatives of the International Organisation of Migration at the conference. Most people migrating to Europe today are not leaving home for "a better life". They are leaving because their home places no longer support any life at all. They may not, initially at least, be refugees from war. But their life-or-death choice is just as stark. The Lake Chad basin offers one illustration of how land degradation is associated with migration and conflict. In the early 1960s, Lake Chad covered 25,000sq km, and straddled the borders of Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Today, a vicious cycle of overgrazing, deforestation, unsustainable irrigation and climate change have reduced it to 1,400sq km. There have been several high-profile conflicts in the region in the last decade, most recently the insurgency by the Islamist Boko Haram group in northern Nigeria, the poorest area in the country, and closest to the shrinking lake. It is less well-known more than 100 major village-on-village clashes have occurred in northern Nigeria since 2003, unconnected to Islamist fundamentalism. Many are attributed to acute shortages due to land degradation. These in turn lead to large movements of displaced populations, with many eventually heading for Europe. Migration patterns Another example of the degradation-migration-conflict pattern, frequently given at conference sessions, is the role of drought in the build-up to civil war in Syria. From 2006 to 2010, the country suffered its worst dry period ever, pushing a million people, many of them young men, to cities already almost overstretched by refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan. "You can't necessarily establish a direct causal links between land degradation, migration and conflicts," says Bendandi, "but it provides an aggravating, amplifying context to other factors". "Land degradation in hotspots of global instability is like putting a flame where the bomb has a fuse . . . but the bomb is not local, it is global," Italian diplomat and environmental writer Grammenos Mastrojeni told The Irish Times . Since the world is losing 12 million hectares of productive land each year, these are problems that are not going to go away, unless we start to rehabilitate land. The major proposal before the conference is that the UNCCD should commit its 168 signatory states to rapidly achieve "land-degradation neutrality". That is, the restoration of productive land each year should be the equivalent of the land lost. EU taxpayers might like to note the cost of rehabilitating land is generally a great deal less than the cost of supporting millions of displaced people in refugee and migrant camps. \</doc>

Mark H Durkan says he didn't really value the environment before he was handed the portfolio in July 2013. His attitude has since changed but the 38-year-old Foyle MLA remains to be convinced that his ministerial colleagues share his positive assessment of the natural world. To illustrate this he points to an executive proposal to name the new department that will have responsibility for farming and environmental matters. "They wanted to call it simply the Department of Agriculture and I took exception to this as it clearly relegated the importance of the environment and suggested environmental policy and protection was going to be subsumed into the new department rather than merged with it," he says. "Sadly it reflected where the environment sits on other ministers and other parties' list of priorities." Despite the general lack of concern at executive level, he believes the north's environment has "dramatically improved" in recent decades. "It's no coincidence that we've been a member of the EU during this time," he says. "They keep us on our toes." He therefore believes a Brexit would be a setback for Northern Ireland. "I think leaving the EU would be catastrophic for the north as a whole and it certainly wouldn't do our environment any good," the minister says, adding that "fear of infraction has concentrated minds around the executive table". As he prepares to clear his desk before the Department of Environment is confined to history and its responsibilities absorbed into the new Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), Mr Durkan reflects on his three years as a minister. The positives he takes from his time in charge are a tightening of road safety measures, the creation of a strategic planning policy and safeguarding the region's built heritage. On the downside, he's failed to convince his executive colleagues of the need for a climate change bill. Like his predecessor and party colleague Alex Attwood, who early in the mandate was thwarted in his efforts to create national parks, Mr Durkan points to objections from the powerful farming lobby. "I circulated discussion paper on climate change and while responses were overwhelmingly in favour of the legislation you have what you might describe as the usual suspects, who believe there's no need for such legislation," he says. The minister believes in working with farmers and the agrifood sector and points to last year's Cop21 Mr Durkan is so convinced by the need to curb climate change gases that in the event of the new Daera minister not showing any enthusiasm for legislation, he will introduce a private members bill. "If I'm lucky enough to be returned to Stormont, I'll be looking to bring forward a private members bill but I believe that it's such a huge issue it should be led by the department and by the minister," he says, pointing to two recent assembly votes that have endorsed his aim. The "usual suspects" are again cited for their resistance to the creation of an independent environmental watchdog, a body the minister believes is all the more important now that his department is being dissolved. "I think it should be independent and not be restricted by conflicting policy objectives in government departments or even within one government department," he says. "There's continued concern that within the new department alongside agriculture that environmental protection might be relegated in terms of its importance." Mr Durkan admits that being the sole SDLP minister in the executive can be "lonely" and frustrating. "I've seen how it works from the inside but I've also seen why it doesn't work," he says. "What you tend to see around the executive table is the tip of the iceberg - a lot of the dealing and deals between the two big parties happens behind closed doors and they usually come to executive meetings with agreed positions on things." As an illustration of how things sometimes work, the minister points to proposals he first tabled in November 2014 to extend emergency financial assistance for flood victims to businesses, churches and community organisations. "The other parties sat on it for 15 months then lo-and behold in January this year they stole it as when it was Dard and DFP announced they were bringing forward this scheme," he says. How did he react? "I just laugh - it was kind of pathetic." So after his experience in the executive does he advocate the SDLP returning to government after May's election? "Whether we go into the executive depends what's on the table and us having a imprimatur on the new programme for government," he says. "While it's depressing at times at the executive table at least we're seeing more of what's going on - as you wonder how much they'd try to get away with if they weren't being watched so closely." \</doc>

Even as Paris steps up its military intervention in Syria, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has launched a diplomatic offensive aimed at uniting international efforts in the war against Islamic State (IS). Since the IS attacks that killed 129 people in Paris, Hollande has been dreaming of uniting two international coalitions that are working at cross purposes in Syria. The Moscow-Tehran-Damascus axis seeks to keep Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in power. Moscow and Tehran are the only foreign parties to the conflict who have shown a willingness to commit ground troops. The other coalition, led by the US and including France, says Assad's departure should be a prerequisite for military cooperation with Moscow and Tehran. Washington fears the Russians and Iranians might otherwise misuse intelligence on US-backed opposition groups. There are also fissures within the US-led coalition. Turkey gives priority to preventing the emergence of a Kurdish state, while Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arabs - the main financiers of the rebellion - rabidly oppose Assad but are ambiguous on IS. Conflicting interests Hollande has stepped into this tangle of conflicting interests. He began efforts to build a "grand coalition" at a meeting with US secretary of state John Kerry yesterday. Kerry expressed their shared determination to "fight and defeat together the psychopathic monsters" of IS. But Kerry told journalists travelling with him there could be no military co-operation until there was a ceasefire and political transition. It would be impossible to defeat IS unless Assad left. "He's complicit in the rise of Daesh [the Arabic acronym for IS], and therefore, as long as Assad is there, you cannot fully get rid of this [IS] phenomenon." Hollande also talked to Iranian president Hassan Rohani by telephone to "show the importance" of negotiations among great powers regarding the war on IS. France nearly bridged the gap with Russia on Monday, when Hollande said IS, not Assad, was France's enemy in Syria. Russian intelligence has just confirmed that the crash of a Russian aircraft which killed 224 people on October 31st was the work of IS. Until now, 80 per cent of Russian air strikes were directed at opposition other than IS, but Vladimir Putin has said he will intensify attacks on IS because of the Sinai assault. "The murder of our own in the Sinai is the bloodiest of crimes," he said. "We must act without delay and learn the names of those responsible. We will seek them out wherever they hide. We will find them and punish them." Putin welcomed Hollande's initiative with a sarcastic remark. "We heard our French friends saying all the time that President Assad's departure was a precondition for political changes . . . But did that protect Paris against a terrorist attack? No." Putin also claimed paternity for the idea of a grand coalition. "I talked about it at the UN session marking its 70th anniversary . . . The tragic events that followed [in Paris] showed we were right," he said. Russian forces in Syria are based on the coast. The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has been redirected from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean, where the French will co-ordinate with the Russian navy. Hollande will travel to Washington on November 24th, and Moscow on November 26th, to discuss the "grand coalition" with Obama and Putin respectively. But French diplomacy "has little margin for manoeuvre", warned Bernard Badie, an expert on international relations at the Sciences Po educational institute. "Things get played out between the Russians and Americans, and we try to get involved." Hollande enjoyed more immediate success after invoking article 42.7 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, on the "aid and assistance" owed to member states who are "the victim of armed aggression". Vote of support French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called a unanimous vote of support by EU defence ministers yesterday "a political act of great importance" which would "enable us, in the coming hours, to hold the necessary bilateral meetings". Le Drian's entourage said other EU states might contribute weapons or aircraft to France's war effort. France also received financial relief from Brussels. "The pact of security is more important than the [EU's] stability pact," Hollande said in his speech at a special congress of both houses of parliament on Monday, referring to France's commitment to bring deficit spending under 3 per cent by 2017. Paris has received repeated postponements from the European Commission. The budget limits "will have to be exceeded", French prime minister Manuel Valls said yesterday. As a result of the IS attacks, Hollande has promised to recruit 8,500 personnel for the ministries of the interior and justice. Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic affairs, said the commission "understands the priority for security". The COP21 But he added: "Everything outside the COP, a whole series of concerts and festive events, will probably be cancelled." However, uncertainty surrounds the grand march between Place de la R\'e9publique and Place de la Nation, scheduled for November 29th, the eve of the conference. France will remain under a state of emergency until mid-February, and public gatherings are banned. \</doc>

THE signing of the Paris Agreement by Ireland and 170 other governments brings into sharp focus the fact that there is no time like the present to get serious about addressing climate change. History tells us a lot can happen in a short time, but the next decade is critical for effective actions on global warming. Our understanding of the Earth's climate, and the role we have in changing it, is a major scientific achievement. It was not a breakthrough made by one scientist, but a culmination of efforts that are central to our fundamental human curiosity about our world and how it works. In Ireland, monuments like Newgrange reflect this curiosity. It was built to chart the changing cycles of light and dark, and the seasons. This understanding allowed forecasting of the coming summer and planning for a new year. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 is really an award to the hundreds of scientists who put the scientific jigsaw puzzle of our climate system together. We can now look back to when Newgrange was built, and beyond that, and chart how and why the Earth's climate changed over centuries and millennia. Importantly, we can also project what may happen to our climate system in this century and beyond. The key information is that we are irreversibly changing our climate system. That was the message from science to last December's COP21 meeting in Paris. The detail carefully presented by the IPCC to governments is compelling and stark; warming is unequivocal, the human influence is clear, and the need to take action is urgent if large-scale global impacts are to be avoided. The response by world leaders was also compelling. They agreed to collectively work to hold average global temperature increases to well below 2\'b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C. They also agreed to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience to the impacts of climate change that are now inevitable. Importantly, they agreed to make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience development. Among the details is agreement to peak global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and reach a balance between emissions and removals, by sinks such as forests, in the second half of the century. The Paris Agreement effectively takes on board the necessity to decarbonise global energy systems and enhance land management to increase uptake of carbon dioxide. Scientifically, reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions is an imperative if we are to stabilise the global climate system. Ireland's National Policy Statement on climate change and the White Paper on Energy outline a similar pathway. Currently, just over 90pc of our energy is provided by fossil fuels. This has significant economic and environmental costs - and not just for climate. Human health and the ecosystem are adversely impacted by pollutants produced by burning fossil fuels. A 90pc dependency on fossil energy means that Ireland is highly locked into carbon-intensive systems in electricity generation, transport and heating. This reflects a very high level of lock-in to carbonintensive infrastructure and systems, and brings associated societal and cultural lock-in. This situation has to be reversed. Investment and innovation are needed to achieve this and enable decarbonisation. Individuals, communities and organisations need to be enabled to take ownership of this challenge. Increasing energy efficiency in our workplaces and homes is also essential. Analysis of the 2014 data on Building Energy Rating (BER) certified homes show that 50pc of houses tested were rated D or lower. This represents both a considerable ongoing cost for these households and an opportunity to improve energy performance. Signing the Paris Agreement will not protect us from all climate change impacts. Some of the changes will inevitably increase during the coming decades. Others such as sea-level rise may continue well into the next century. The impacts of weather extremes witnessed over recent years highlight major vulnerabilities across the country. A first step in adapting to climate change and increasing our resilience is to address and reduce current vulnerability to weatherrelated extremes. Such adaptive actions will require on-going investment and regulation. THE recent enactment of climate legislation paves the way for production of national plans to address climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing a framework for adaptation actions. The challenges facing Ireland are both immediate and longer term: Ireland faces challenges in meeting its 2020 EU emissions targets and in charting a transformation pathway to 2050. All sectors have to play their part in achieving Ireland's decarbonisation goal and increasing resilience to the impacts of climate change. It is in all our interests that the Paris Agreement is signed, ratified and implemented. Otherwise addressing the consequences of climate change would be increasingly costly, difficult and unmanageable. Adaptation would eventually become futile for high-risk areas. Investment, innovation, information and education are needed. Examples of such innovation are evident around Ireland, but scaling these up with a new sense of urgency is essential. The message from science is clear, the response from governments is agreed. Taking the next steps is the shared challenge for today. Frank McGovern is the head of climate research at the Environmental Protection Agency Warming is unequivocal, the human influence clear \</doc>

WITH the door slammed firmly on 2015, we might acknowledge the outstanding contributions of our betters in the rarefied worlds of politics, media, business and sport. My awards are random and indiscriminate and seek to cut through the contrived self-regarding clap-trap while recognising worthy work. Politician of the year: Willie Penrose deserves the nod for his dogged perseverance in reforming personal insolvency law by reducing the bankruptcy discharge period to just one year. He persevered despite Cabinet disinterest in butting heads with bankers and civil servants. Willie won through eventually. Junior Minister Simon Harris deserves mention for his persistence in his ascent of the greasy pole. Tall tale of the year award: Enda Kenny, take a bow. His creative flourishes might even be marked in the fiction awards regarding his fabulous recollections relating to the prospect of our soldiers being deployed around bank ATMs at some unspecified moment in the financial meltdown. His words took on a life of their own at the European People's Party congress in Madrid. The heroics apparently rescued our imperilled nation. Alas, former Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan dismissed the fairy-tale as being wide of the mark. Denials of year: Gerry Adams walks away with all accolades. His lack of knowledge about Mairia Cahill's abuse, kangaroo courts, former IRA membership, Thomas 'Slab' Murphy's financial empire, Jean McConville's murder and assorted republican baggage has not dented his fulsome support in Sinn F\'e9in. It works well internally, but the recent significant poll slippage since the Euro elections suggests that the wider public may be more circumspect. Issue of the year: For my money, it has to be housing. The shortage has had a terrible impact on family incomes, as it feeds through into higher rents. It is also responsible for the historic highs in homelessness. Families and the unfortunates who could find themselves sleeping rough are driven to depend on costly emergency accommodation. The Government's lack of resolve in addressing the rent supplement has fuelled the accommodation crisis. And despite multiple ministerial pronouncements, additional units have yet to be built . The stunt of the year award: This was a tough call. Vincent Browne and his adventures at the former O'Donnell home at Gorse Hill, Killiney, Co Dublin, deserve a special commendation in recognition of self-promotion. However, the overall winner is the partnership of Mick Wallace and Clare Daly. Their travelling circus acts at Shannon Airport, Ennis District Court and Limerick Prison secure the prize. Fat cats of year: International - Sepp Blatter/Michel Platini are the winners here, as they succeeded in garnering millions of dollars from Fifa over a decade, resulting in what will effectively be a lifetime ban. Fifa's generosity to compliant associations included John Delaney's FAI securing (EURO)5m compensation for the 'Hand of Henry' furore. Delaney also had a spectacular year with Euro 2016 qualification. Irish cat of the year - IFA's former boss Pat Smith was paid a (EURO)500k salary in 2013. He also received a (EURO)1.2m pension top-up to offset the hole in his defined benefit pension scheme when it was closed in 2011. How are you still in the job award: Attorney General M\'e1ire Whelan survives another year. Her evidence to the Niall Fennelly Commission was bizarre. She drew heavy political fire for her failure to contact either Commissioner Martin Callinan or former Justice Minister Alan Shatter about the potential legal landmine stemming from the widespread recording of certain telephone calls in garda stations. Ms Whelan also drastically changed her evidence relating to the legality of secret recordings and she also apologised to the commission for her "trenchant language". U-turn of year: Greece's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, proffered stubborn resistance to Angela Merkel's diktats on the third bailout deal, pushing rejection to a referendum vote. When creditors still didn't budge, they ate humble pie. Amazingly, they got reelected. Businessperson of the year: Aviation made headlines. IAG's Willie Walsh deftly acquired Aer Lingus. Having convinced Aer Lingus's board of directors, management, workers and unions that greater opportunity existed through a takeover, politicians acquiesced. But the award goes to Michael O'Leary's new cuddly, friendly face. Ryanair proved ever more popular and profitable, carrying 105 million customers, with a fleet of more than 300 planes. Sports stars of the year: Willie Mullins's spectacular achievement on Cheltenham day one in winning first four races through Douvan, Un De Sceaux and Faugheen was awesome. Eight individual Cheltenham winners with 31 Grade one wins amount to an historic achievement. Ruby Walsh deserves equal accolades. My teams, Leinster rugby and Man City, won zero trophies. My manager of the year is Dublin's Jim Gavin. Horrors of year: Islamic State (Isil) terrorism represents the greatest peacetime threat to our way of life. Graham Dwyer's conviction for Elaine O'Hara's murder was a great day for justice. Bore of the year: Serious contenders at home and abroad. COP21 in Paris permitted a proper bore-fest of selfimportant worthies to fulminate endless hot air. Outright victor, however, is the Oireachtas Banking Inquiry. This yawnfest allowed a parade of characters to absolve themselves from culpability for the crash. Person of the year: Father Peter McVerry. His unstinting selflessness, sincerity, compassion and commitment to identify with those at their lowest point in life remains truly inspirational. He tirelessly continues to champion the most marginalised and friendless. \</doc>

As we digest the warnings and promises from the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, there is one industry that is poised for major change in Ireland and abroad: construction. "Every newly built house in Ireland now has to have an A3 BER" - or building energy rating - "under the 2011 building regulations," says Pat Barry of the Irish Green Building Council (igbc.ie). And, although this heralds a new era in green building, the work involved in improving the energy ratings of the 1.7 million existing homes is the other side of the coin. Some progress has been made through two grant schemes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (seai.ie), Better Energy Communities and Better Energy Warmer Homes, which help to cover the cost of retrofitting insulation, upgrading boilers, installing smart meters and switching to renewable energy, among other fuel-saving measures. There has also been some success because of energy providers' EU obligations to save energy by working with communities to reduce fuel poverty and improve efficiency. But there is still a strong sense that Ireland lags behind many other countries in becoming a nation of energy-efficient homes. Last year the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published Better Buildings , Ireland's first National Renovation Strategy, for instance, which aims to reduce emissions from the country's buildings. But it lacks goals, and Ireland is off course to meet the overall EU target of saving 20 per cent of projected energy use by 2020 and 27 per cent by 2030. Buildings account for about 12 per cent of the Irish greenhouse-gas emissions, and improving buildings' energy efficiency is one of the cheapest ways to cut that figure. But to do this, organisations such as the Irish Green Building Council believe, the Government and local authorities must understand the benefits of sustainable housing. "The Department of Health needs to see that decent housing is part of a public-health strategy, that fuel poverty and people attending A&E departments with respiratory problems are linked to poor-quality housing," Pat Barry says. And building contractors will need to get to grips with sustainable building methods. "There aren't enough renovation skills in Ireland. Poor-quality insulation is worse than none at all. For example, it's critically important that good ventilation is understood by everyone in the building trade," says Barry. A hundred builders took part in the council's three-day Qualibuild scheme this year; from next year the EU-funded scheme is open to all builders. And the council has just published an e-book for homeowners, explaining what is required for a house to be properly insulated. For example, the concept of deep retrofitting - where floors, attics and walls are insulated, boilers upgraded and air-tight doors and windows created - isn't widely understood in Ireland. "What happens with a shallow retrofit - attic insulation and a new boiler, for example - is that people absorb the extra comfort into their homes with no energy savings," Barry says. Another key issue in green building is that of cost. D\'fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently decided that all new buildings in its area should meet passive-house standards. This usually means thick insulation, triple-glazed windows, solar-powered hot water, and a heat pump or other form of renewable energy, and it would enable both commercial and residential buildings to dispense with conventional heating systems. But the Construction Industry Federation has warned that the standard will increase prices, and Nama has urged the council to reconsider the requirement. Supporters of the passive-house standard argue that building costs are not necessarily higher and that money is also saved over a lifetime of tiny heating bills. Barry says that the passive-house standards are higher than current building regulations but that costs depend on several factors. "Green building shouldn't cost more if the architect, construction contractor and construction workers are all trained well. It's down to good design, quality building and quality supervision of work." Greener future Paris zero-carbon pledge France's minister for ecology, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, led the first day dedicated to buildings at the COP21 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. The message was that "green buildings are possible, healthy and profitable" - and the outcome of the day was that 25 Green Building Councils committed to register, renovate or certify more than 1.25 billion square metres of green building space and train more than 125,000 green-building professionals by 2020. All 74 national green building councils at the event supported the World Green Building Council's commitment to achieve net-zero-carbon new building and energy-efficient refurbishment of existing buildings by 2050. A net-zero-carbon building - or net-zero-energy building, known as an NZEB in the trade - is one whose annual energy consumption roughly equals the amount of renewable energy created on the site. Buildings account for about a third of global emissions, and green buildings are one of the most cost-effective solutions to climate change, partly because it's cheaper to save energy through more efficient design than it is to produce it differently. The development of materials for green buildings brings jobs to economies, and green buildings have better indoor air quality, leading to more pleasant and healthier living and working environments. Several large construction-material firms, including Ecocem, Kingspan and Saint-Gobain, pledged to reduce emissions, increase low-carbon investments and use more clean energy to tackle climate change. Such is the growth in the green building sector that green building will account for more than a third of the entire US construction sector by 2018. \</doc>

The COP21 The Government justifies this on the basis that beef in Ireland is produced in a more sustainable and less intensive fashion than in many other countries. But environmental groups such as An Taisce say the long-term sustainability of the planet should take priority over what is, by international standards, a luxury dietary option. To try to settle the matter, Unthinkable sought the view of American philosopher and environmental expert Paul B Thompson, author of the recently published From Field to Fork: Food Ethics for Everyone . Thompson argues that "ethics should be viewed as a discipline for asking better questions", and therefore shies away from simplistic solutions. "When we move into the intersection between climate ethics and food ethics, we find ourselves needing to juggle some complex trade-offs," he says. "We might meet targets such as those agreed to in Paris by reducing livestock production, but from the standpoint of obligations to our grandchildren we would be doing much less than we should be to really address climate change." A broader point he makes is that changing consumer behaviour is less important than changing production methods. Or, as he puts it (providing today's idea): "We should not think that we can shop our way into a solution to climate change." To what extent should greenhouse-gas emissions enter our thinking when we choose what to eat? "I would say that they are in the mix, but should not be dominant considerations. Emissions are handled better as public-policy issues than as dietary choice issues." Some environmentalists advocate the introduction of a 'steak tax ' to factor in the cost of carbon emissions from beef farming. What do you think? "Given what I've just said, I would endorse a steak tax only within the context of much larger and more richly considered climate policies. It could be part of the picture, but people would be misinformed if they thought it was making a major contribution to climate policy by instituting a steak tax in the absence of other, additional measures." Is it okay to damage the environment in order to achieve food security? "Well this is really a crucial ethical question that I take to be much more substantive than the climate questions. My short answer is that food security takes top priority, but even within the food security discussion there are complexities that are seldom appreciated. My book discusses how a naive urban-centred approach to food security actually harms food security for many of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world, who as farmers would actually like to get a higher price for what they are producing. "So in fact I don't endorse the 'feed the world' rhetoric that comes out of many agribusiness firms. If push comes to shove, people need to be fed, but the whole point of food ethics should be towards more subtle, long-range thinking that avoids the situation where push comes to shove. "I do endorse more environmentally oriented approaches to agriculture, and I think of environmental sustainability as an area where dramatic and effective changes are within reach. So to repeat, as a strictly moral point, people come first, but as a practical matter, environmental improvements may hold the greatest promise for an effective food ethics." What's the most ethical way of eating? "I'm tempted to be facetious, undertaking a comparison of knife and fork to chopsticks, for example. My book makes the point that we are really talking about buying and selling rather than eating when we get into food ethics, which suggests to me that we should be having a hard look at the way our current configuration of property rights, market structures and public policies affect a wide range of social and environmental values. "I'm not going to quibble with someone who tries to make the best of a bad lot by trying to make food purchases that do the least harm, given the current structure of our food system, but I would take issue with those who define food ethics strictly in terms of 'the most ethical way of eating'. "We could develop more ethically satisfactory food systems, and we have an ethical obligation to try and achieve this goal. Purchase decisions make a contribution to that end not so much by bringing about a particular good consequence as by sending a signal that these things matter. "So in a nutshell, any time you buy a product at a premium price and the premium is linked to environmental, animal welfare, social justice or better health values, you are making a contribution to a more ethical food system by telling the food industry and our public policymakers that you care. What you buy is less important than the fact that you are sending that message."

Welcome to the new Irish Times Environment Page, where we will be expanding and deepening our coverage of, and reflections from, the environment over the coming weeks, months and years. Our relationship with the natural world has rightly become one of the defining issues of this century. However, the constant association of "the environment" with "catastrophe" is profoundly unhelpful, disabling, and simply wrong. Engaging with nature should be a source of pleasure, not a trigger for crippling anxiety. We cannot and must not evade the daunting challenges of climate change, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. The road to December's Paris COP21 conference, and beyond, will be among the stories you read here. But our sense of helplessness in the face of such devastating changes too often slides into despair; then it can collapse into weary, fatalistic indifference. To counter this, we need to focus more on expanding the ways citizens, educators, scientists and communities are already finding to engage positively with nature, and reviving old ones. Here at home, and across the world, there has been a surge in innovative conservation and restoration projects, in urban agriculture, in sustainable farming programmes and in artisan food production, to give just a few examples. New research has confirmed the widespread conviction that the physical and mental wellbeing of children and adults depends to a remarkable degree on their ability to access, and engage with, natural landscapes. Hospitals are recognising that even very small increases in contact with nature significantly benefit patients. When children are given an opportunity to encounter wildlife and wild places, even in urban settings, their sense of wonder and delight is almost always spontaneous and immediate. We need to find ways to nurture and sustain this pleasurable engagement with nature through all phases of education, and in adult workplaces and leisure activities. If more people enjoyed a closer relationship with the natural world, and had a more direct grasp of nature's extraordinary variety and resilience, our society would be in a better place to tackle the consequences of centuries of environmental abuse by our species. The focus of the "green" constituency to date has too often been too negative and too narrow. No-one has done more to evoke the wonders of nature for Irish Times readers, over several generations now, than Michael Viney, in his Another Life column and in his delightful, informative and insightful books. It is a privilege to join him as a regular contributor, along with Sylvia Thomson and other colleagues, to this very welcome development of expanded weekly environmental coverage in The Irish Times . Viney's column will continue to be the flagship of this coverage. Wide-ranging themes General themes will be wide-ranging, and may include: opportunities for individual engagement with the natural environment, from mushroom foraging to whale-watching; environmental policy at home and abroad; lifestyle in relation to environment; energy issues; community-based environmental projects; agriculture, landscapes and biodiversity; conservation and restoration; the natural environment in urban contexts; innovative approaches to tackling our various environmental challenges; eco-holidays at home and abroad; artisan food production and traditional crafts that heighten environmental awareness. The design of the homes and towns we live in, and of built infrastructure generally, can have significant environmental costs and benefits, and we will explore these from time to time. In my own articles, I will highlight new environmental projects, especially those involving ordinary citizens, and also educational programmes that engage children in an active relationship with the natural world. Interest in these issues extends throughout our communities, urban and rural, right across the country. From time to time, I will report from abroad, linking the stories to themes and contexts familiar at home. I will also focus on environmental policy and science issues. While never minimising the grave environmental challenges we face, I hope to highlight areas where advances are being made, and the pleasure that many people derive from working together to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity. We are particularly keen to find ways of drawing readers' attention to opportunities to delight in nature close to home throughout the year. For example, many of us are unaware how easy it is to find orchids in most parts of Ireland, even on an urban street, if you know where and when to look for them. Or that it is possible to witness the wonder of the massive seasonal migrations of birds, close up and personal, even within our biggest cities. We hope a closer relationship with our readers will develop; there is certainly a great web of knowledge and experience beyond our inevitably limited circles as writers that we would like to share with the reading public. We hope you will enjoy, and perhaps contribute to, this ongoing expansion of the paper's long history of environmental coverage. Ideas for articles and images, as well as responses to what we publish - as frank as you like - are always welcome. Comment on this article at irishtimes.com.

WIND ENERGY ENTREPRENEUR ISSUES WARNING ON EMISSIONS TARGETS - Eddie O\' Connor, the wind energy entrepreneur, has warned the Government against taking a  sleeveen approach on emissions targets, after the Taoiseach Enda Kenny complained at the COP 21 global summit on climate change in Paris about  unrealistic targets for Irish agriculture. The Irish Times reports that Mr O\' Connor, who founded and sold Airtricity and now runs renewables developer Mainstream Renewable Power (MRP), said the Irish Government should not seek  derogations .  There is no excuse. You can\' t opt out of global warming. There may be an issue with agriculture, but it is going to have to get dealt with, said Mr O\' Connor.  PROFITS UP AT UK'S PINEWOOD STUDIOS AFTER STAR WARS FILMING IN IRELAND - Profits rose by half a million pounds at Pinewood Studios, the biggest film studio in the UK, as it was boosted by blockbusters such as the new 'Star Wars', which was partly filmed in Ireland - according to the Irish independent. The paper writes that the company, which is the largest studio in Europe, launched an Irish operation in May which offers services such as pre-production budgeting and location scouting. Pre-tax profits rose from \£33.8m to \£34.3m in the six months to the end of December, while operating profits more than doubled to \£37m from \£32.5m in the same period a year earlier. Revenue slipped slightly to \£338.2m, down from \£338.5m in 2014. Included in that figure is revenue relating to 'Star Wars' Episode 7, part of which was shot on Skellig Michael island off the coast of Co Kerry.  POPE ORDERS AUDIT OF CHURCH\' S FINANCES - Pope Francis, galvanised by a scandal over Vatican finances, has ordered the most powerful bodies in the city-state to launch an unprecedented audit of its wealth and crackdown on runaway spending. The Irish Examiner reports that at the suggestion of his economic chief, Cardinal George Pell, Pope Francis has set up a  Working-Party for the Economic Future which brings together the Secretariat of State, or prime minister\' s office, the Vatican Bank and other agencies, said Danny Casey, director of Cardinal Pell\' s office at the Secretariat for the Economy. The pope\' s initiatives come as five people stand trial in the Vatican over the leak of confidential documents in two books published last month that described corruption, mismanagement and wasteful spending by church officials. The paper writes that those on trial deny wrongdoing.  GREECE THREATENED WITH SCHENGEN SUSPENSION OVER MIGRANT RESPONSE - The EU is warning Greece it faces suspension from the Schengen passport-free travel zone unless it overhauls its response to the migration crisis by mid-December, as frustration mounts over Athens\' reluctance to accept outside support, according to the Financial Times. The paper writes that several European ministers and senior EU officials see the threat of pushing out Greece over  serious deficiencies in border control as the only means left to persuade Alexis Tsipras, Greece\' s prime minister, to deliver on his promises and take up EU offers of help. If the EU follows through on its threat, it would mark the first time a country has been suspended since passport-free travel was established in the Schengen Agreement of 1985. The challenge to Athens comes amid a bigger rethink on tightening joint border control to ensure the survival of the Schengen zone. \</doc>

The farmer and the cowman, the musical tells us, should be friends. Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, a remarkable young African woman who campaigns for land rights for her pastoralist Mbororo people, would agree. She believes grazing and cultivating communities can benefit each other, in a traditional seasonal synergy. "It starts with cowshit," she explains disarmingly. The dung dropped by the Mbororo's cattle, roaming vast areas across Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic, is an essential source of fertility for crops after they have moved on. But problems arise when the Mbororo retrace their steps, and find land they have grazed for centuries fenced off for exclusive cultivation, often without even a corridor for their cattle to pass through, and with no prior negotiation. Ibrahim argues that customary communal use of land should be recognised as a legal right worldwide. Ibrahim represents the Congo Basin region on the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee. She has won remarkable concessions from the government of her native Chad, such as flexible school schedules and curriculums for pastoralist children, whose patterns of life do not conform to a five-day working week. She spoke to The Irish Times after participating this week in a round-table on land rights at the biannual conference (COP12) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Ankara. Many NGO delegates expressed concern that the convention's proposal to rehabilitate degraded land globally could have negative, if unintended, consequences. UNCCD is usually seen as the poor relation of the UN environmental bodies which emerged from the historic 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development, but that may be changing. Hitherto mainly restricted to arid land issues, especially in Africa, the UNCCD has long been dwarfed by the more global reach of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) and the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which starts its critical COP21 negotiations in Paris next month. Ambitious target Those who hope for some real movement on climate change at those talks can find grounds for optimism in the outcomes so far in Ankara. After byzantine discussions over 10 days, the conference finally accepted, in principle, the ambitious new target of "land degradation neutrality". That is, the restoration of degraded land to productivity, in each country each year, should be the equivalent of the land lost. Since 12 million hectares of productive land are degraded annually across the globe, this is a very challenging aspiration. The agreement is a significant expansion of UNCCD's role, because wetlands and forests as well as arid lands are degraded by unsustainable use. The convention decision, if implemented fully, could affect Ireland and Bangladesh as much as Mali and the Sudan. "Land degradation neutrality" is an awkward mouthful at first, for sure. And it risks joining "sustainable land management" and a dozen other familiar "green" labels that governments and corporations love to display, but all too rarely put effectively into practice. If it were achieved, however, it would not only help supply rapidly increasing demand for food production, it would also mitigate carbon emissions. This is because restored land generally stores carbon, while degraded land often emits CO2. So it could have an impact on how emission reductions are negotiated in Paris and beyond. However, as some land rights activists see it, there is a serious snag in the proposal. They argue that it needs to be hedged by much clearer definitions of "degradation", and accompanied by legal recognition for the world's many millions of untenured small farmers, pastoralists and indigenous peoples. Otherwise, it could accelerate the current trend towards "land-grabbing" by states, corporations and private individuals. Michael Taylor, director of the International Land Coalition, told the conference a new study demonstrated that as much as 65 per cent of the earth's land surface is claimed by indigenous peoples and local communities, through customary usage and management. But only 18 per cent of this land is acknowledged as communally owned by governments. Squatters on ancestral lands "This is a concern," he said, "because it is land on which up to 1.5 billion people live and use, but over which they have no legal control. In other words, they are legally squatters on land that in most cases has been theirs for generations. " As competition for this land increases, and this competition becomes increasingly unequal, so does their risk of dispossession." The question of definitions is almost as tricky as the issue of legal rights. Where one person sees good pasture, another may see degraded land. "Hindou's people know the land they graze as very productive on a seasonal basis," said Taylor after listening to our interview, "but a government or a corporation might say it can only become fully productive if it is irrigated." Forcing unsuitable land into industrialised agricultural production, however, often exhausts the soil. It can destroy its productivity long term through salinisation. So we are left with the paradox that, unless there are clear guidelines, efforts to restore land wrongly considered degraded could lead to the degradation of productive land. Land degradation neutrality may indeed be the next big thing in tackling the global environmental crisis. But it clearly needs to be fire-walled against the worst tendencies of the species which just invented it. Paddy Woodworth moderated a discussion on land rights at the UNCCD conference \</doc>

What distinguishes the Paris climate summit from other such gatherings over the past 20 years is that it's the first time virtually all of the world's nations have committed to being part of the solution, with 180 pledging to take action aimed at tackling global warming. These 180 countries account for about 90 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change applied to just 37 developed countries, which accounted for substantially less than half of the world's emissions at that time. The problem is that the current pledges - known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs in United Nations' jargon - are not legally binding, nor can they be, because of the difficulties of ratifying anything that could be called a "treaty", especially in the United States. The US delegation has circulated a "non-paper" to a number of other countries suggesting that further pledges under the Paris accord should also be determined independently by each country, rather than being mandatory or subject to sanction if they fail to deliver. Green Climate Fund President Barack Obama's climate envoy, Todd Stern, has also made it clear that the traditional distinction between developed and developing countries should no longer apply, and that wealthier developing countries should contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund. "What is expected from countries should be differentiated to capture their varying circumstances and capabilities today and in the future, not based on outdated categories created in 1992" under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Stern said. This is anathema to China, India and other much poorer developing countries. They insist that the historical responsibility of countries that achieved economic growth and prosperity over the past 200 years by burning fossil fuels must continue to be recognised. In its "non-paper", the US also wants the long-term goal of the Paris agreement to be defined as "collectively aiming to achieve climate neutrality over the course of this century", which would allow countries to continue burning fossil fuels by buying carbon credits elsewhere. As world leaders gathered in Paris for the high-level opening session yesterday, negotiators were grappling with a 54-page draft text peppered with square brackets indicating that agreement had yet to be reached on key points, such as the level of ambition needed. But China's chief negotiator, Su Wei, said the "mere presence" in Paris of 150 heads of state or government - an unprecedented number for any event in the UN's history - "will give important political momentum in moulding the negotiation process" over the next 10 days. Ken Kimmell, president of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said the emissions cuts countries had proposed, "while an important step forward, will not collectively achieve the goal of holding global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius". Pledge revision "So, to be a success, the agreement must require countries to revisit their pledges in the years to come, raising the level of ambition to take into account advances in technology and economies of scale that make cutting emissions easier or less expensive," he said. According to Kimmell, an environmental lawyer, a "good outcome" in Paris would be a commitment to revise pledges at least every five years after the accord takes effect in 2020. "Given the so-called ambition gap, we can't afford to wait until 2030 to revisit this." He said another important element to watch for in the negotiations is a long-term goal to spur future actions in raising the level of ambition. It needed to send an "unmistakable signal that the age of fossil fuels is coming to a close", pointing the world towards renewable energy. Naming and shaming Although the accord will not be legally binding, Kimmell said it needed to have a mechanism for "naming and shaming" countries that don't fulfil their pledges. Therefore, it must include "a reliable and common protocol for each country to monitor, report and verify progress". Also critical for Paris is how the negotiations "handle the issue of fairness for poorer countries that have contributed little to climate change, are particularly vulnerable to its effects and have the fewest resources to cut their own emissions and prepare for what is coming". At the abortive Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries promised to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 95 billion) a year in public and private financing by 2020 to assist developing countries. So far, however, only $6 billion (EUR 5.7 billion) has been pledged to the Green Climate Fund. Conditional pledges That's why a number of developing countries, notably including India, have made "conditional pledges"- commitments to cut emissions that are conditional on the availability of funds and technology from richer countries to help them grow in a low-carbon, sustainable way. Ravi Prasad, head of India's delegation in Paris, said he hoped to "get a just, equitable, durable an ambitious climate deal" by the time COP21 closes on December 11th. But he stressed that it must be grounded on the principles of the UN framework convention adopted in 1992. Gurdial S Nijar, spokesman for the Like-Minded Developing Countries group - which includes China and India - said it was clear and "very disturbing" that attempts were being made by others to "dismantle a fundamental precept" of the climate change convention. This precept relates to the "common but differentiated responsibilities" of parties to the convention, meaning those that got rich during the fossil fuel era "owe a debt" to developing countries which had yet to eradicate poverty and provide food security for all of their people. Sticking points What can go wrong nDemands by developing countries that their richer counterparts' historical responsibility for causing climate change must continue to be recognised. nFailure by governments to honour promises made at the Copenhagen summit in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 95 billion) a year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. nDisagreements over how to ensure countries implement pledges made to cut emissions. \</doc>

Jimmy Rabbitte's proclamation in that the "Irish are the blacks of Europe" had a ring of truth in the late 1980s when the Roddy Doyle novel was published. Can the same be said today in a changed socioeconomic landscape? Irish folk in England are now better known as developers than bricklayers, while in Europe we're top of the class, having helped to gang up on those supposedly irresponsible, sun-kissed Mediterraneans. If you feel a little less black today, or a little more white, then, you may have good reason. As Linda Mart\'edn Alcoff, the New York-based philosopher and author of The Future of Whiteness , points out, "white" and "black" are fluid concepts and not necessarily tied to skin colour. "Whiteness emerged in the colonial period," she notes. "Before that there were Normans and Saxons and Irish, and various assorted people, but there weren't whites as such." Colonialism in the traditional sense might have ended, but a white, European "vanguard" mindset continues to infiltrate economic, scientific and even environmental thinking, says Alcoff, who was speaking to Unthinkable on a visit to Dublin. In order to tackle big problems such as borderless conflict and climate change, she argues, " We need to come to understand what role whiteness plays in our own identities". In what way does whiteness influence our thinking? "Everywhere European colonialism happened - and it happened in Ireland too - there were certain ideas, concepts and categories that got sent out to the world. There was a ranking of peoples, and part of the idea of colonialism was that European peoples were the vanguard of the human race: scientifically, technologically, aesthetically, morally, philosophically, politically. "The assumption was: 'We have the best thinkers.We have the best religion in Christianity'. That idea of [the supremacy of] white societies is still embedded. "The other way in which it still manifests itself is being uncovered by a lot of empirical studies by social psychologists who are looking at how white people think and talk and interact with others in unconscious ways. Implicit bias can make people pay more attention to others, or judge them to be more credible. "The way in which we interact with others, even if we are anti-racist, can be affected by these histories, so we need to be more conscious of that." How is whiteness approached in the US?"In the US there is a kind of hysteria about it now because of the demographic changes; whites are going to become a minority by 2042. You have white nationalists running around - like Donald Trump - talking about white, European identity in very old-fashioned ways. "So the right wing loves to talk about whiteness, liberals are afraid to talk about it, and radicals have adopted this view for the abolition of whiteness - they want to eliminate it - and I argue against that because I don't think it's a realistic approach. "We need to come to understand what role it plays in our own identities. It's not everything, but it's not nothing either. We need to spend some time understanding the history of places like the US where a lot of state policy favoured whites. "In 1793 one of the first laws that was passed after the US was formed said you could immigrate to the US if you were free and white. So they institutionalised a certain privilege for white immigrants from the very beginning. "Whiteness is a historical formation. You can talk about the Irish experience in very particular terms because they were coming in to the labour market at the lowest of the low. They weren't included in the club of whiteness in the beginning, but have had a particular experience in colonial migration and the labour market because they were at least seen as European, and so were able to make the shift that I think is harder for African-Americans today or people from Latin America or Asia." Do colonised people think differently? "Every part of the world that was colonised has had to think at some point about their identity, and has not been able to buy into the universals of European thought so easily because they were excluded from those universals. "So in Latin America, philosophy is not seen as just bodiless minds engaged in debates, but something that comes out of a particular place in time, because Latin American philosophers had to defend their ability to do philosophy, and the right to ask fundamental questions." What is the future of whiteness? "I am a philosopher, not a social scientist, so I certainly don't feel capable of making predictions. But I do think that if we get a better grasp of what whiteness is as a historical formation, we can have a more realistic approach to our possible futures. "The climate change crisis is connected here because there is an incredible hubris about the technological possibilities of overcoming nature's restrictions on us that is very much connected to that European 'vanguard of the human race' model, rather than seeing that we need to work with others, and learn from others, to survive on the planet together. "So in some ways I think the question of whiteness is really critical to the future." But one of the chief proponents of that technological approach is the US's first black president, Barack Obama. Are you saying his thinking here could be 'white'? "Sure, I think there is a certain perspective that all of us who were trained in European school systems and curricula adopt, and live in the West. In that sense, whiteness is not exclusive to white skin."

SENAY BOZTAS, COLIN FREEMAN AND DONMINIC EVANS MACEDONIA has become the latest European country to build a fence to restrict migrants over its frontier, as border police clashed with groups of asylum seekers yesterday. In a move that follows the controversial policy pioneered by Hungary, Macedonian soldiers began driving 10ft-high metal poles into the cold, muddy ground along its southern border with Greece. The migrants use Macedonia, a non-EU member, as a transit point for their journeys onward to northern Europe. As construction work on the fence began, police fired tear gas and stun grenades at crowds who have found themselves stranded at the Greek border since Macedonia changed its policy on which migrants it allows through two weeks ago. Like other Balkan nations on the migrant route, Macedonia has now begun turning away "economic migrants" and allows through only those who come from war zones, such as Syria. Greek police say about 800 migrants are stranded on the Greek side in worsening weather after Macedonia blocked access to citizens of countries that are not being fast-tracked for asylum in the European Union. The movement of citizens from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan continues uninterrupted. The move has triggered days of protests from Iranians, Pakistanis, Moroccans and others, most of whom are now stuck in tent camps on the border. Some Iranians have sewn their lips shut. One man yesterday threw himself on railway lines before the police, screaming and flailing. The violence started after one migrant, believed to be a Moroccan, was electrocuted and badly burned when he climbed on top of a train wagon. An angry crowd surged towards lines of Macedonian police and began throwing stones, a photographer at the scene said. The Macedonian government insists it has no intention of sealing its border completely. A government spokesman said the aim of the fence was "to direct the inflow of people towards the controlled points for their registration and humane treatment". "We would like to underline that the border will remain open," said Aleksandar Gjorgjiev, a government spokesman. "We will allow passage for the people who come from war-affected regions as we have done thus far." The number of migrants making the journey to Europe rose dramatically this year compared with 2014, although the influx shows signs of decreasing as winter approaches. Germany expects roughly one million refugees and migrants to arrive this year alone. Meanwhile, all non-EU newcomers to the Netherlands will now be forced to sign a declaration saying they will uphold Dutch values, or pay a fine of up to (EURO)1,250 and have their residency revoked. These values include upholding people's freedoms, being a good neighbour and participating in society - for example, speaking Dutch. The measures are part of a harder line on immigration in the Netherlands, which Lodewijk Asscher, social affairs minister, described as the "warm heart and cool head" approach. He wrote in a letter to Dutch MPs on Friday that the government is "committed to reducing the number of refugees" and acknowledged concerns about threats to jobs and houses, and about "which culture they bring along with them". The measures come days after Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, warned that the "massive influx" of refugees threatens the fall of Europe. The Netherlands has suggested reducing the size of the Schengen open-border agreement in early November, and on January 1 2016, the country takes on the presidency of the EU. Mr Asscher said refugees with permission to stay would be housed in "clean but austere" housing, and had a "personal responsibility to integrate, to learn the language and find work". To "promote self-motivation" the government is offering refugees payment for doing jobs in and around refugee centres, such as cleaning and gardening, for up to 25 hours a week and for 56c to (EURO)1.10 per hour - amounting to a maximum of justv (EURO)14 a week. These sums - far lower than the minimum wage - are permitted because the refugees already receive state allowances if they do not have any means. Food allowances are up to (EURO)44.60 per adult per day and (EURO)34.86 per child, with just under (EURO)13 per week for clothing and other items for people living in asylum centres. There are loans available to furnish council houses. The Dutch government is to give extra grants to local areas to support refugees with permits to stay, of up to (EURO)2,370 per person. Numbers of asylum seekers hit record levels in October, with 11,700 arrivals, according to Dutch national statistics office, the CBS. The government expects 60,000 refugees in 2015, about a sixth through EU quota agreements. Nearly 1,000 people have been barred from entering France since border controls were put in place just after the Paris terror attacks, the French interior minister said. Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking in the eastern city of Strasbourg, said that nearly 15,000 police, gendarmes and customs officials are manning France's borders, notably the borders with Belgium, where the three teams of attackers started their deadly journey, and Germany. One-hundred-and-thirty people died in the November 13 attacks. The borders were re-enforced in the run-up to the COP21 climate talks that start tomorrow and in the wake of the attacks. Mr Cazeneuve noted the "very high threat level" that has yet to abate. Besides those barred from entering France, 300 people have been placed under house arrest as part of a state of emergency. Two dozen of the 300 are considered potential threats to public order during the two-week climate summit. \£9 Telegraph The Macedonian government insists it has no intention of sealing its border completely \</doc>

President Michael D Higgins took a holistic approach to climate change in his first major address on the subject, arguing that the great challenges of our time could not be dealt with in piecemeal fashion. Mr Higgins also said the issue should not be addressed under the sway of economic neoliberalism, which he said weakened the state and fostered inequality and injustice. "New thinking," a "new normative framework" and "reconstructed" economic models were desperately needed, Mr Higgins said. "It will require moral courage." The President yesterday addressed the "Summit of Consciences for the Climate" in Paris, at the invitation of French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande. The fact that both he and the former president Mary Robinson, now United Nations special envoy for climate change, were prominent speakers created an impression of Irish presidents, past and present, as a moral compass for Ireland and beyond. Ethical questions Mr Higgins saluted the complex political and technical decisions to be thrashed out in the international COP 21 climate conference in Paris in December. But he concentrated on the ethical and intellectual questions raised by climate change. Global warming provided "opportunities to construct a new order for humanity and for our planet," he argued. Climate change was "grounded in forms of development and industrialisation that were based on the exploitation of fossil fuels, with an assumption of infinite growth," he said. "Individualism manifesting itself as insatiable consumption and accompanied by unconscionable levels of inequality characterises much of what is regarded as the developed part of our planet," he said. "For some it is an economic model that cannot be contested, like received truth in the days of Galileo." In a subsequent interview, Mr Higgins explained how the post-second World War model based on solidarity and human rights was in the 1980s transformed by the influence of the Chicago school of economics, which advocated rolling back the state. At the same time, investment that could be identified and traced gave way to uncontrolled, "massive, free-flowing capital" that created "great fissures of inequality" and was "capable of dislodging the international fiscal system". The global challenges of climate change and inequality could not be met if governments were not in control of their economies. Mr Higgins linked the climate conference to UN conferences that are defining the follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals - international targets for addressing issues such as poverty, hunger, and disease. Mr Higgins added: "People are sleepwalking into the acceptance of the inevitability of a single model in economic theory. People think I am attacking neoliberalism . . . Yes, I think the neoliberal model has failed, because of its push to extremism." But isn't neoliberalism the Irish model? "I wish we had time to look at how it came to be," the President said. "Of course, as President I don't ever comment on government policy of the day, but I offer this analysis. The interesting part is I have gathered a lot of allies in the last couple of years." In their speeches, Mr Higgins, Mr Hollande and Mrs Robinson linked climate change to broader development issues. Sustainable model A planned $100 billion annual "green climate fund" constituted "collective global recognition that while today's rich countries built their prosperity from fossil fuels and unsustainable land use, leaders from the developing world are trying to find a way to a more sustainable model of developing without emissions," Mrs Robinson said. In the minds of the speakers, climate change seemed to have replaced nuclear war as the threat looming over the world's future. Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan quoted the late Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, who said, regarding nuclear war, that "the living would envy the dead". On a lighter note, Mr Higgins commented on a recent Irish Times report citing French documents that indicate remains buried in Drumcliffe churchyard were unlikely to be those of WB Yeats. Did it matter? "Not at all," Mr Higgins said. \</doc>

Writing for eolas, Eurelectric's Secretary General, Hans ten Berge outlines how the European power sector is leading the transition to a low carbon future.\~ Decarbonisation is essential to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the global economy and Europe's electricity sector is fully committed to leading this transition. As a global leader in decarbonisation, the European power sector is committed to decarbonising power supply by 2050, and we are already taking important action. In 2014, 56 per cent of electricity in the EU came from low carbon sources. In the same year, the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the power mix became the largest source of low carbon electricity in the EU, comprising 28 per cent of total power generation. Market design The real challenge is to create a holistic market design that delivers the technologies needed for a balanced low carbon energy mix, while being able to adapt to the evolving economics of power systems. The new market design, including a reformed and strengthened EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), must provide a solid basis for sustainable investment in low carbon technologies, ensuring in particular a robust business model for such investments. Only the combination of an effectively reformed EU ETS and an improved EU electricity market design can lead to proper price signals from the relevant markets to drive investments in mature low carbon technologies, allowing decarbonisation to take place in a cost-effective manner. Meanwhile, in the midst of this energy transition, Europe needs to ensure secure, sustainable, affordable and competitive energy for all its citizens and businesses. The Energy Union project, based on its five mutually supportive dimensions (energy security; solidarity and trust; the internal energy market; energy efficiency as a contribution to the moderation of energy demand; decarbonisation of the economy; and research, innovation and competitiveness) is intended to address these challenges. The European power sector sees immense potential in the Energy Union project and we fully support efforts to develop an ambitious, European approach to energy policy. This is an opportunity for member states to enhance security of supply, cost competitiveness and emission reductions in ways which individual countries cannot achieve on their own. EU institutions and member states should therefore work together to ensure that collective and national measures lead to the development of a decarbonised and fully competitive single market in energy. The agreement reached last December at the COP21 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris should result in an ambitious and rules based climate change regime, which paves the way for a stable and predictable framework for policy and action. This agreement provides a clear and unequivocal signal to government and investors to invest in low-carbon technology in line with long-term decarbonisation objectives. In this context, the power sector believes that the emissions trading system should be the main driver for RES investments in the electricity sector. Strengthening the emissions trading system is a no-regret option. With a reinforced carbon price signal and an accelerated cap reduction, additional measures to promote renewables can be minimised within the ETS sectors. The EU ETS, which is an established, technology-neutral, European wide instrument, can also bring an increasingly EU wide approach to low carbon technologies development and investment. If member states choose to continue to provide support for mature RES after 2020, it should be done in the most cost-efficient and market-based way. Policy design The Commission's proposal to revise the EU ETS Directive puts the EU on course to take important steps on the path towards cost-effectively decarbonising the European economy. However, the success of the reformed EU ETS will depend on ensuring full consistency and coherence between the various elements and targets of the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, as well as developing an adequate governance framework which enables the achievement of these objectives. European policies and implementing instruments must therefore be designed in a way that does not undermine the overall economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness of the EU ETS. Coherent and integrated policy instruments based on a well-functioning EU ETS will be crucial to achieve the EU's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on a level playing field and in the most cost-effective way. To date, the European electricity industry has delivered the bulk of greenhouse gas emission reductions on the pathway towards a low carbon European economy and these reductions have come primarily from the supply side. Looking forward, we see the electrification of the demand side sectors of the economy, which do not fall under the EU ETS, as being crucial on the path to decarbonisation. The upcoming revision of the effort sharing decision and the EU's strategy for decarbonising the transport, heating and cooling sectors, provide an excellent opportunity to enhance the role of decarbonised electricity in achieving the EU's decarbonisation agenda. The key role of electricity in the decarbonisation of the European economy, the recognition of the synergies in the energy system, many of which will be unlocked through a smarter electricity system, and the central role to be played by customers, are all advancements that we support and encourage. The European power sector sees that further electrification of the non-ETS sectors (such as transport, heating and cooling) provides a technically and economically effective way to further enhance the contribution of renewables to the decarbonisation objectives. As electricity becomes increasingly low carbon, replacing fossil based systems with electric technologies will provide a promising pathway to decarbonising these sectors. A successful strategy for transport, heating and cooling must recognise that as the electricity sector's greenhouse gas emissions are strongly decreasing, electricity should play a key role in decarbonising these sectors, and will bring other important benefits, such as improvements in air quality. It is also important to provide consumers with choice, affordability, security and quality of services through markets, and to recognise the fact that a 'one size fits all' approach cannot work. The solutions must therefore give the necessary freedom to member states to assess their national and local challenges and opportunities. In order to ensure that these objectives are achieved, we believe that consistency and coherence will be essential. We therefore believe that the Energy Union project must include a governance system that provides a coherent approach to the achievement of the 2030 Climate and Energy framework targets, as well as the EU's broader energy union policy objectives, including a 2050 perspective. \</doc>

THIS year has already brought many challenges and opportunities for Irish agriculture. An industry with an annual output of (EURO)24bn employing over 150,000 people in Ireland, agriculture has played a pivotal role in leading the country's economic recovery and delivering a much-needed dose of national confidence. After more than 30 years, the lifting of dairy quotas this year opened the door to increased export revenue and the potential for considerable job creation. Opportunities also continue to open up for Irish beef exports, with markets such as China and the United States lifting their bans on exports of Irish beef this year. The opportunities for the sector will continue to emerge as Ireland's association with quality, traceability and sustainability strengthens. 2015 has also been an important year in the global debate on the pace and effects of climate change. With the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris approaching in December, many critical issues will be debated in the months to come. COP21 will be an important conference, with a focus on achieving a new international agreement on the climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C. At a national level, agriculture is a significant contributor to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. It accounts for approximately 32pc of our total emissions, a figure that underscores the role Irish agriculture plays in our economy. The Irish government has set out ambitious targets for further growth and development, so as to take full advantage of the opportunities for our industry. The challenge is to drive Irish export growth and feed a growing global population while respecting our environmental limits, not to mention legal obligations to reduce greenhouse gasses. Irish agriculture has come under the spotlight of late as stakeholders examine ways to square this circle. There is the belief in some quarters that the objectives of initiatives like Food Harvest 2020 (which includes a target to increase beef production by 20pc) are incompatible with Ireland's legal greenhouse gas reduction obligations. There is criticism of what some view as government rhetoric around emissions reductions and a lack of concrete proposals to achieve these. There is also a fear that attempts to protect "privileged sectors", such as agriculture, will result in unfair concessions for food producers and a disproportionate effect on other sectors of the economy. The blunt solution suggested by detractors is that Ireland should, as a responsible global citizen, reduce food production in order to meet the mandated emissions targets. The truth is that Ireland's high rainfall combined with our grass-based feeding system makes for a sustainable beef production environment compared with other regions of the world. Within the European Union the average CO2 output per kilogram of beef is 22.1kg, whereas in Ireland it is 14pc lower at 19kg. Put simply, swapping an Irish cow for one somewhere else in Europe will actually increase the overall global carbon footprint, even if it helps Ireland hit emissions targets. responsible production to It is worth considering the broader sector context. While Irish agriculture contributes 32pc of total Irish emissions, agriculture targets worldwide contributes only 12pc, with energy production contributing 75pc. This gives an idea of the scale of the challenge facing us all. Ireland also has a natural advantage in terms of carbon sequestration - the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and its longterm storage. The carbon released in the production of beef for example, is offset by that carbon being stored by the grassland, soils and forestry on Irish farms. Our climate is naturally ideal for grass production, and carbon sequestration should be taken into account when looking at national emissions - currently it is not. Reducing emissions is important, and at Dawn we have made huge efforts to address the environmental sustainability of our business. We introduced a group sustainability plan in 2009 which made core commitments to reduce our environmental footprint including: a 50pc reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020; a 40pc reduction in water and energy use by 2020; and a 50pc increase in recycling of waste by the end of this year. To date, we have achieved annual water savings of 56m litres and reduced thermal energy consumption by 50pc across all sites. Among the most ambitious projects to date has been our development of a seven-acre wetland and eco-park in Carrolls Cross, Co Waterford, a low-carbon effluent treatment method, improving biodiversity and also sequestering carbon. Carrolls Cross was also the site of our first fossil fuel-free plant in 2014 reducing our dependency on non-renewable energy and the associated carbon emissions. Dawn Meats and many of our industry peers have supported and driven initiatives such as Bord Bia's Origin Green programme which is helping Irish food producers demonstrate to international customers the verifiable achievements being made to ensure supply chain sustainability. The industry has recognised and advocated the importance of a proactive, innovative approach from an early stage. Origin Green is a global first, with Ireland taking a leadership role in making a commercial virtue of climate-smart agriculture. Irish food producers After more than 30 years, the lifting of dairy quotas this year opened the door to increased export revenue. Below: CEO of Dawn Meats Niall Browne continue to take huge steps in this area, and given the collective goal of reducing global emissions it would be an exercise in futility to reduce Irish beef production to meet emissions targets, and shift production to less-sustainable production systems overseas. There is a tendency to view sustainability purely in terms of carbon emissions. Whilst measurements like these are important, sustainable production should be viewed in a more holistic way, recognising the benefits that it can bring to the Irish economy, at a national level, and in towns and villages all around the country. Finally we need to consider the global food security threat that we face, with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forecasting a 50pc increase in food demand by 2030. Few would dispute the urgency of the emissions reduction challenge facing Ireland and countries all over the world. It is important, however, that sustainability should take into account the significant contribution to addressing this challenge that Ireland's rich and varied agri-business sector is making in an environmentally responsible way. We also need to remind ourselves that any drop in food production in this country will quickly be filled by other, lesssustainable locations. Niall Browne is Chief Executive of Dawn Meats \</doc>

Sabina Brennan When she started university as a mature student of 43, Brennan became the first member of her family to go to third level and graduated with her younger son. A former drama teacher and Fair City actor, she also worked in insurance. Now 53, she is co-director of the dementia research programme in Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and research assistant professor of Trinity's School of Psychology. Referring to the "insidious ageism" in Ireland, one of her big concerns is around the human rights of vulnerable older people with dementia, in nursing homes and hospitals. With personal knowledge through her own late mother's experience of dementia, she cites abuses such as "sedating older patients for no other reason than that they are walking up and down corridors". Her other major concerns include "excellent" public health strategies sitting on Government shelves. She reels them off. A lot of work was invested over six years in the Government's positive ageing strategy before it was shelved in 2013. The national dementia strategy "got off the starting blocks" and action was taken on a few of the proposals. Then there is the neuro-rehabilitation strategy which was shelved in 2011 and funding is squeezed because it is not directly and specifically allocated. Someone with a brain injury needs immediate rehabilitation to repair and save valuable cognitive function but can spend months "in an acute hospital before they go to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D\'fan Laoghaire", by which time much cognitive function is permanently lost. "In the NHS (in the UK) you are provided with a case manager and rehabilitation immediately." Dr Brennan said she has picked the issues and strategies that were "practical, viable and could make a difference. They are ready to go but just need a voice to scream at the Government" about their implementation. \'e1n Melly For him, the "major loss of business experience in the Seanad" was a motivating factor in his decision to run. Chairman of the board of Trinity College business school, he points to the retirement of Senator Feargal Quinn, founder of Superquinn and the end of the term of office of Taoiseach's nominee and businesswoman Mary Ann O'Brien, founder of Lily O'Brien's Chocolates. He also highlights the power of the Seanad to introduce legislation, citing the 17 Bills introduced in 21 years in the Upper House by Senator Quinn, who nominated the Trinity candidate for the election. "The Seanad has the power to shine a light on issues," he says. As for reform, "I like the idea of having a Seanad of people with real expertise and experience in specific areas, whether that's business or education or the medical area". A former investment banker, he set up a telecoms company in Ireland that was subsequently bought by Verizon and he now runs Powerscourt Investments, which invests in start-up companies in Ireland, often in high tech areas. Proud of his work on Trinity's EUR 70 million new business school, which will open in 2018, he believes there is a need for the State to focus on "home-grown entrepreneurs and enterprise" and give them the same prominence as the multinational firms. Ois\'edn Coghlan He had been "badgering politicians for years from the sidelines, but I felt it was time for me to put my money where my mouth is" and push climate action. Director of Friends of the Earth, it is a natural "area of special interest" for him. And the Oireachtas last year passed Ireland's first piece of legislation on climate change. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act had been eight years in the making. One of the highlights is that the Seanad will have equal billing with the D\'e1il. The four ministers responsible in this area - environment, agriculture, energy and transport - will be obliged to report progress on reaching targets to the Seanad as well as the D\'e1il. He said that while a number of politicians were very interested in climate action, there was a need for a voice in the Seanad on this issue as he pointed to Ireland's poor record in meeting climate targets, ahead of the formal signing in New York on Friday by 142 countries of the Cop21 global climate summit agreement. He wonders if acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny will be there. Ireland will sign the agreement, whether on Friday or an another date, but the New York meeting aims to highlight its importance, he says. Maeve Cox The barrister believes there is a need for "genuine independent voices campaigning for those whose rights are not being implemented". She is a candidate for the second time, having run in 2011 while still a student and campaigning mainly through social media. "There is a lot of talk about reform but everyone seems to forget the principal role of the Seanad is to monitor and scrutinise legislation and initiate Bills." The Seanad is not meant to be a "mirror" of the D\'e1il, she stresses. She cites the example of senator Dan Neville of Fine Gael, who in the early 1980s, initiated the legislation to decriminalise suicide. "That was a huge step forward." Not aligned to any political party, she is frustrated by the actions of political parties to back affiliated candidates for the Upper House. And she says that while it is well and good for people to have policies in finance, the Seanad cannot be effective in this area because it does not have the power to change money Bills. nOutgoing Senators Ivana Bacik, Se\'e1n Barrett and David Norris are also running, as are carer, journalist, academic and retired army captain Tom Clonan; lecturer Kevin Cunningham; communications officer Edward Davitt; IT consultant Eoin Meehan; Senator Averil Power; director of youth services William Priestley; president of TCD students' union Lynn Ruane; professor of health systems Anthony Staines; musician, formerly RT\'c9 producer, Ethna Tinney \</doc>

Yet here he was after 7,200 long seconds, back in the real world handed a chance to finally get on with his life. So began Mick Wallace s first moments of freedom after his imprisonment on Wednesday for failing to pay a fine. The fine arose from a guilty verdict against him and his confederate Clare Daly for breaching security at Shannon Airport in July 2014. Later on that evening, Daly was subjected to an equally gruelling spell in stir, but she did her time with stoic defiance, and also emerged two hours after the key had been turned on her freedom. The release of the Shannon Two was just one of a number of instances during the week that gave us a glimpse of modern Ireland as we head towards the centenary of the Rising to commemorate who we are. Or something like that. There was much derision and anger heaped on the Shannon Two over the use of Garda resources to have them brought to Limerick to do their time. Perhaps resources could have been put to better use, but on the same day a Garda Inspectorate report was published which suggested that garda resources are mismanaged to a chronic extent, what s the big deal about four officers driving around the country for a day when hundreds are apparently sitting behind desks twiddling their thumbs? Others grumbled that Wallace and Daly were lawmakers who were breaking the law. Maybe so, but at least they did so on a matter of principle. Look at the huge cohort of councillors and a clutch of TDs who improperly filled out their declarations of interest, as exposed on the RT\'c9 Investigates programme. They didn t have much regard for the law either. Among those who considered the whole incident with distaste was Health Minister Leo Varadkar. He was doing press on Wednesday for new legislation which will bring in unit pricing for alcohol and restrictions on advertising. This proposed legislation follows recommendations from an expert group that reported in 2012. Now, with the D\'e1il on the cusp of dissolving, the Government announces the changes. There isn t a hope that the legislation will be passed in time, but at least Leo got some PR and the drinks industry managed to get the whole thing delayed. Anyway, when Leo was asked about the Shannon Two, at the launch, he had this to say: I imagine they [Wallace and Daly] will argue they did this as a form of protest and that is a decision for them. "It does occur to me the instability that might arise from having a government that is dependent on independents for support. "Because you might come to an agreement with some independents in order to form a government but then you might find those independents are in jail because of a protest and the government falls. Did you get that? Leo Varadkar, the apparently straight- talking minister, is saying that you shouldn t vote independent because your TD might end up in prison, triggering the collapse of government. Not just that. He is hinting that a vote for an independent might clog up the already overcrowded prison system. Cabinet meetings may have to be relocated to Mountjoy or moved to Cork Prison, and take place within visiting hours. Perhaps Leo is searching for a slogan that echoes with that which informed the infancy of democracy in this State, when senior figures languished in English jails. Put him in to get him out, it said on the election poster. Maybe Leo is going to drum up something like: Don t put them in or we ll have to get them out. In any event the mask has now slipped on the extent to which Fine Gael will milk the stability or chaos tactic in the general election. The chaos option is being painted as more chaotic by the day. While Varadkar was musing on jailbirds, his boss was in Leinster House having a pot at the man who would be president. In a pose that would elicit blushes from the editorial writer of the Skibbereen Eagle, Enda Kenny said he would unreservedly condemn the latest outpouring from the ridiculous Donald Trump. He was reminded by Richard Boyd Barrett that last year The Donald had been met at Shannon Airport by Michael Noonan with a red carpet, harps and people in traditional Irish dress in what was frankly, even at the time, quite a ludicrous show of deference to this multi-billionaire . Word from Trump Towers in New York is that The Donald s campaign is now on the rocks following this stab in the back from world leader Kenny. (Before he attended the COP21 in Paris last week, where he managed to talk out of both sides of his mouth, Mr Kenny said he was off to confer with other world leaders .) The smart money says The Donald will now go quietly and retreat to his Doonbeg golf course, where he will instead focus on scaling the rickety ladder of Irish politics, crowned with a new rug. While there was enough silliness in Irish politics to go around last week, there was also something from dark side of stupid. The RT\'c9 investigation on Monday exposed, among others, councillor John O Donnell in Donegal as seeking personal benefit from his public office. O Donnell was caught on camera indicating that he expected to be paid through an intermediary for assisting a reporter posing as a company representative. O Donnell is 34, was elected at the last election, and an independent. His credentials cast him as a new breed of politician at the frontline of changing times. Then he gets caught at the sleaziest end of the trade, in a manner that was supposed to be behind us. What was interesting was his response. He issued a release to RT\'c9, saying that he was a businessman and any payment he would have received would have been as a businessman. He added: RT\'c9 now proposes to reveal my business secrets, style and methods in your programme which could enable other entrepreneurs to copy them. Far from being caught with his hand moving inexorably towards the till, Mr O Donnell sees himself as an entrepreneur, straddling business and politics, using unique tactics which he developed himself, and now others will see how well he s getting on and attempt to copy him. Young, budding entrepreneurs are you watching? It was one of those weeks: the serious, the silly and the disgusting cast a pall over politics. \</doc>

One in six Americans and one in three Catholic Americans say they were influenced by the pope's message that climate change is a crucial moral issue. The study, by climate-change researchers at Yale University and George Mason University, in the US, found that the percentage of Catholics who said they were very worried about global warming more than doubled after Pope Francis's visit to the US in September. And the proportion who denied the scientific consensus on climate change declined by 10 percentage points among Catholics and six points among the US population as a whole. The pope's Laudato Si': On Care for Common Home was published in June 2015. Over 120 pages Francis covers everything from loss of biodiversity, and access to drinkable water as a human right, to intergenerational solidarity, ecological education and spirituality. He says he wants to "address every person living on this planet . . . for decisive action here and now". Clear moral teaching The former Green Party MEP Nuala Ahern says it is the first clear moral teaching on the environment from a Christian world leader. "It's a call to dialogue which is hugely significant for scientists, politicians, the business community and ordinary people," she says. "He is saying that it's not just about science, technology and behaviour, but it's also a question of ethics and how we live. He is saying that we are not separate to nature but a part of it." Ahern says that the language of the encyclical is both poetic and practical. "I think it will have a powerful impact beyond Catholics and the western world. Faith leaders have an enormous role to play. Climate change is so overwhelming that we need everybody to tackle it." Together with colleagues at the Green European Foundation, Ahern is studying religion and green values. "Many politicians on the left don't want to know about religion. Even Green politicians are resistant to serious engagement with religion, but we are beyond that phase of the church's overarching power in telling us what to do. This encyclical is a sign that the Catholic Church at a high level is shifting to a new moral ground, and it's not before time. In fact it's well overdue." Today at the Columban Ecological Institute at Dalgan Park, in Co Meath, the ecotheologian Fr Sean McDonagh is hosting a conference on and CopCOPOP21, the UN climate-change conference in Paris. The climatologist John Sweeney, emeritus professor at Maynooth, climate scientist from NUI Maynooth University, will address the conference. "It is difficult to overemphasise the scholarly quality and potential impact of this work. What many anticipated as a theological treatise turned out to be a scientifically robust, readable and inspirational document," Sweeney says. "The pope suggests market economics needs to be tempered by social and environmental responsibility to a much greater extent. Our disconnection with the natural world is leading, Francis says, to an ecological crisis of our own making as our throwaway culture destroys our common home. And, in that, the pope identifies climate change as a human-induced problem rooted in an insatiable quest for unsustainable growth and material consumption." Sweeney says that Pope Francis sees emissions trading as a flawed mechanism that won't tackle the root of the problem. Instead, the pope suggests, an "integral ecology" recognises the components of the environment under threat for their intrinsic worth and not as resources for exploitation. And Francis emphasises that "an ecological debt of developed countries requires them to finance sustainable development in poorer countries, linking natural and human rights to more practical issues of financial compensation as part of a global accord on climate". Revolutionary Speaking about the moral teaching in Laudato Si' , McDonagh says that the pope is "asking for a shift in the moral imagination. He is saying that interfering with biodiversity through deforestation and other interventions in the natural world is a sin. It is revolutionary to call this a sin." McDonagh says that a key point in Laudato Si' is its belief that every species of plant and animal has intrinsic value. "What he means here is that every creature has its own purpose; it's not just there for us. He also speaks about the three vital relationships: our relationship with God, with humanity and with the earth itself." The Rev Andrew Orr, a Church of Ireland priest who is chairman of the Christian environmental lobby group Eco-congregation Ireland, says that the encyclical is significant in that Pope Francis has a statute that no other world religious leader has. "He has a moral authority that no political leader can match, so it's significant that he has made climate change a priority of his papacy." Rev Orr says that the document will primarily reach Catholics but also have a wider influence. "It's very significant that he has reached the conservative Catholic cohort in the United States, [which] was ambivalent about climate change. And the ethical dimension is very important, because the science will only be accepted when it is in tune with people's values." The papal encyclical also values the work of nongovernmental organisations to put pressure on governments to develop more rigorous controls. Rev Orr says that churches and other organisations can bring a message of hope by calling on governments and businesspeople to act on climate change. "The hope comes from working collectively to put pressure on politicians to come up with an agreement at Cop21 that will be acted on." What the pope says From 'Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home' "Ecological culture cannot be reduced to a series of urgent and partial responses to the immediate problems of pollution, environmental decay and the depletion of natural resources. "There needs to be a distinctive way of looking at things, a way of thinking, policies, an educational programme, a lifestyle and a spirituality which together generate resistance to the assault of the technocratic paradigm. Otherwise, even the best ecological initiatives can find themselves caught up in the same globalised logic. "To seek only a technical remedy to each environmental problem which comes up is to separate what is in reality interconnected and to mask the true and deepest problems of the global system. "An authentic humanity, calling for a new synthesis, seems to dwell in the midst of our technological culture, almost unnoticed, like a mist seeping gently beneath a closed door." \</doc>

T was a week that demanded action, yet this was met with much resistance. IClimate change talks began on Monday, as 150 heads of state gathered in Paris to try to agree a global deal that will avoid worldwide average temperature change from exceeding 2C. Some say if the agreement is made it would be praised in the future as humanity's greatest achievement. However, that did not stop our very own Enda Kenny from taking to the stage and making excuses. Commentators criticised his lacklustre speech, which said that while "Ireland is determined to play its part," in cutting CO2 emissions by 2050, he wants "an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production," referring to beef and dairy farming. Later, speaking to reporters at the COP21 global summit, he singled out Irish agriculture, which he said was being asked to meet unreachable targets and blamed the "lost decade" of the recession for impeding our efforts. This kind of localised thinking at a global summit is a bit embarrassing, isn't it? For the Irish are not the only ones who rely on agriculture, nor are we the only ones who experienced the "lost decade" of the (ahem) global recession. And while the beef and dairy agriculture industry may suffer, (even though the diversification to crop production, ironically aided by rising temperatures due to climate change in our latitude, should be embraced), that is nothing to the suffering of countries affected more directly around the world by the effects of climate change and pollution. One need not look very far last week for examples. The New York Times also profiled the disappearing Marshall Islands, 1,000 low-lying islands in the South Pacific that are slowly being drowned by rising sea water. "I feel like we're living underwater," said islander Linber Anej, "I can't leave my parents but I don't want my kids to drown here." Not only is climate change impacting on our natural environment but our political and social environment too. Scientist Bill Nye spoke on CNN last week linking climate change to the recent Paris attacks. He said, "It's very reasonable that the recent trouble in Paris is a result of climate change," explaining that water shortages in Syria are displacing young farmers to the city where high levels of unemployment lead to disaffection and ultimately radicalism. Despite Kenny's hesitation, compromise is exactly what will have to happen if we are to make any dent in the overwhelming reality of global warming. Meanwhile, while climate change may have played a role in the rise of Isil, Western intervention most definitely has and this sticky topic reared its ugly head again last week as the British parliament faced a tense 10-hour debate over whether or not to support a vote for airstrikes in Syria. Thousand of protesters took to the streets to cry "Don't bomb Syria" and politicians on the left decried a lack of proof that airstrikes would lead to any tangible change. Whether or not it will is debatable. The UK is merely joining a Western air fleet to fight Isil but many worry that innocent civilians will be caught up in the bombings. Without any clear military targets or strategy, they fear, it will merely create more devastation and inevitably, play into the cycle of Western killing of innocents leading the victims to seek retribution against the West and becoming radicalised. Then there's the issue of who on the ground the West should support to fight Isil. Syria is divided amongst warring factions, some just as dangerous as Isil should they gain power. While British PM David Cameron claimed there are 70,000 opposition fighters in Syria, critics say the number is far fewer and they are not a united force. Still, action calls. Last week it was reported that yet another mass grave of Iraq's Yazidi community has been discovered in the town of Sinjar, one of more than 30 believed to exist in the region. The UN has accused Isil militants of committing possible genocide. Can we stand by and do nothing when faced with such a destructive, borderless, fascist force? As Cameron said, "If not now, when?" In the end Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn stood by his lifelong policy of pacifism, calling for a diplomatic peace settlement. However, Corbyn did not use his party whip - indeed, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn spoke eloquently in favour of airstrikes in the House of Commons debate. In the end, many Labour MPs voted in favour and the motion was passed, leading to airstrikes on the Isil-controlled Omar oil fields, in eastern Syria, just a few hours later. Meanwhile, a potentially Isil-motivated terror attack in California shocked no one, as it was seen merely as another in a series of deranged civilian-on-civilian attacks. Gun violence in the US is relentless and unchanging and there's an element of sympathy fatigue amongst those watching from the sidelines outside America. Because of the widespread availability of guns, 297 people are shot every day, 89 of whom are killed. Mass shootings merely draw attention to the wider insanity of gun laws in America. The sad thing is that this shooting happened in California, which has made a conscious efforts to limit the availability of guns. It was one of the few states to effectively enact the Brady Bill, which stops the sale of guns to those with a criminal record, those declared dangerous due to a mental illness or domestic violence offenders. With it, California reduced its firearm mortality rate by 47.7pc between 1990 and 2009. In reality, 90pc of Americans surveyed say they support background checks being expanded but progress is slow. Anti-gun violence groups like The Brady Campaign are continually lobbying the state legislatures and enacting change on a small scale. But US politicians need to act and the public needs to embrace it. Otherwise, everyday life in America will continue, as a BBC correspondent said when reporting on the shooting. "Just another day in the United States, another day of gunfire, panic and fear." \</doc>

Enda Kenny has said that says Ireland's agriculture industry will have to be given special treatment in any deal to limit its carbon emissions. The Taoiseach was speaking to an audience of world leaders this evening, as a two-week summit on climate change began in Paris. He told reporters that it is not realistic for Ireland's agriculture sector to meet the EU targets for cutting carbon emissions. Speaking at the summit in Paris, he told other world leaders that the agri-food industry would need special consideration. "Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation which sets out our intention to substantial cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production." <strong>Taoiseach's speech in full</strong> Ireland agrees with the statements made by Presidents Junker and Tusk and the Luxembourg Presidency, on behalf of the EU and its Member States. COP 21 provides a unique opportunity for the political leaders of this generation to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability of generations of the future. Excellencies, colleagues: Many of us in this room came together in New York in September to agree the Sustainable Development Goals - the most ambitious programme of action ever agreed by the nations of the world. Today, we meet in Paris, a city whose people have demonstrated remarkable bravery, courage and resilience in the face of the most horrendous crimes. I hope that we are serious about putting in place a legally binding agreement on climate change that will underpin our actions on the goals already agreed and enhance our ability to reach them. This requires action by everybody - big and small. Ireland is determined to play its part. We have committed, with our EU partners, to a collective target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation, which sets out our intention to substantially cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production. We are developing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that vision. One really significant area for Ireland is our valuable and already efficient agriculture sector. Through a series of programmes, like carbon foot-printing 43,500 beef farms and 18,000 dairy farms, we are driving economic and environmental efficiency in agriculture and achieving results that we believe are both transferable and scalable. Our research will contribute to global progress and help all countries realise the potential of their land sectors in addressing climate change. This is not just about opportunities - but about the cooperation that will allow us to address our common challenges. Real transparency and accountability will benefit us all but we need to trust each other and the systems that we operate in. Building on our strong track record of supporting developing countries including in areas like climate justice, human rights, gender and education, Ireland recognises that vulnerable communities need very considerable assistance in adapting to climate change. Despite recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland provided public climate finance of 34 million in 2014, including support for the Least Developed Countries Fund. These funds support adaptation in agriculture, food and energy systems, and help to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Ireland is committed to scaling up climate finance; 2. We will increase our contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund and 3. We are also examining ways to mobilise private finance from Ireland, to further contribute to the 2020 goal. The negotiations this week will be very difficult but if we are serious then we should leave Paris with an ambitious and binding agreement that will ultimately limit global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In this regard, I wish to salute the leadership the French Republic has brought to hosting the negotiations. I encourage our negotiators to bring this process to a successful conclusion next week. Let's send the signal the world is waiting for and let us not deprive our successors and their children of a real future before they are born. \</doc>

When French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande addressed France's ambassadors to foreign countries, assembled in the red velvet and gilt reception rooms of the \'c9lys\'e9e Palace yesterday, the usual boasting about France's influence in the world rang hollow. His hour-long overview of the sorry state of the world was long on observation and very short on remedies. The country that fostered the Enlightenment has, it seems, little more to offer than its skill at organising international conferences. The UN COP 21 climate change conference in December "will be a major event", Mr Hollande said. "We must succeed because the stakes are global, because France is the host." Paris will host a conference on Christians of the Middle East next week, and Mr Hollande also offered to stage a meeting of parties who are fighting Boko Haram extremists in Nigeria. Confronting terrorism Islamic State is the greatest danger, Mr Hollande continued. Alluding to the beheading of Khaled al-Asaad, the former director of the ruins of Palmyra, and IS's destruction of the temple of Baal Shamin, he said the intention was "to erase all traces of humanity, terrorise through images . . . show that there is no limit to barbarity. We must act." But no, Mr Hollande was not about to send in the legionnaires. In connection with the Unesco convention on cultural diversity, he has asked the president of the Louvre to undertake a study mission on the protection of cultural treasures in armed conflicts. Nor did Mr Hollande offer succour to the victims of Boko Haram, "10,000 since the beginning of the year . . . 14,000 last year, most often women and children". He expressed France's "faultless solidarity" with Nigeria and surrounding countries. In Mali, he said, France, with the help of the African Union, the EU and the UN had "made terrorism step back". Terrorism must be fought with force, Mr Hollande continued, but "military commitment will never be sufficient alone, for terrorism feeds political chaos". It was up to French diplomats "to find exits from the crises we are living through". In the lurch Mr Hollande remains bitter over the way President Barack Obama left him in the lurch two years ago when Washington backed out of military retaliation against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons. IS now holds one-third of Iraq and half of Syria, but Mr Hollande insisted that Iraq, like Syria, must preserve its "state structure". A state was not consolidated in Libya after the fall of Gadafy "and we are paying a high price" for it, he said. The "disorder" of the Middle East has created "the greatest migratory crisis since the second World War", Mr Hollande said. Walls rising He estimated that 350,000 migrants had arrived in the EU in recent months. "One sees walls rising up again within Europe, armour being mobilised, barbed wire being set down, refugee centres attacked. This is the situation today, and it is likely to continue . . ." An opinion piece in Le Monde newspaper, written by Jean-Marie Fardeau, the director of Human Rights Watch France, accused Mr Hollande of "burying the diplomacy of human rights". Mr Fardeau particularly criticised France's cosy relationship with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi of Egypt. Mr Hollande devoted three sentences of his speech to Egypt. Nor did the French president explain why France has abandoned a UN Security Council Resolution that would have recognised the state of Palestine within two years. Mr Hollande told the Presidential Press Association on July 27th it was because the Obama administration had threatened to veto the resolution. Mr Hollande challenged those "who foretold the end of the credibility of France as an exporter of military materiel to look at the figures. French products - not only the Rafale [fighter jet] - have never been so sought after," he boasted. \</doc>

What will happen to the thousands of people who work in Ireland's peat-fired power stations, to the many tens of thousands who mine coal and drill for oil and gas across Europe, and to everybody else involved in distributing fossil fuels and the energy they produce to our communities if we uphold our promises to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in order to keep global warming below two degrees? The optimistic view is that jobs lost in fossil-fuel industries will be gained in the green economy, as we build a bigger renewable-energy infrastructure and retrofit homes and offices to make them more energy efficient. But there are no guarantees that the people who lose their jobs will be the same people who get the new work. As people realise that job losses in fossil-fuel industries will be a consequence of the move to a low-carbon economy, environmental campaigners and trade unionists have been forming an alliance, to highlight the need to combine cleaner energy with an enlightened employment policy. Trade unions stress the need for a "just transition" to a carbon-free world and point out, as their slogan has it, that there are no jobs on a dead planet. The International Trade Union Confederation, which says it represents 168 million workers in 155 countries, attended COP21 , the UN climate-change conference in Paris at the end of last year. Here the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was one of the organisers of Climate Conservations, a series of public debates on climate change in 2015. This month Liam Berney of Ictu was a speaker at a Friends of the Earth gathering in Dublin of groups from 25 countries that discussed, among other things, how to support communities in the move towards low-carbon economies. "Decarbonisation is an economic, moral and political imperative for a stable world and climate," he says. "We don't have a choice, but it's important that the environmental movement doesn't dismiss working people and their jobs." Berney cites the 150,000 people employed in the coal industry in Poland and the 2,000 jobs that would be lost if the two Bord na M\'f3na peat-fired stations closed. Speaking in Dublin earlier this month, the Canadian climate-change activist Naomi Klein said that 100,000 people had already lost their jobs since the price of oil collapsed. "When oil prices are down it's a good time to introduce a carbon tax - to pay for the green transition. When people are losing their jobs in the extractive industries it's also a good time for the environmental movement to build alliances with unions and labour movements," she told a packed audience at the RDS. Berney says there is too little debate about how we will move to a low-carbon economy. "Markets dictate policy to government, and workers have a right to know the Government's plan to move to a different order. Workers and vulnerable people can't be left behind." Diarmuid Torney, who teaches international relations at Dublin City University, says: "Much of the discussion on decarbonisation focuses on the business interests that either push for or, more often, hold back low-carbon transition. "If Ireland and the EU are serious about decarbonising the economy, the Government needs to come up with a proactive set of interventions that will retrain and reskill workers from high-carbon sectors, so that they can move into emerging low-carbon sectors." Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth is more vocal about the Government's delay in closing down peat-fired electricity plants. "The Irish government was first told to stop burning peat for electricity in 1998, to meet their 2010 Kyoto targets. If they had put a plan to develop alternative employment in place and set 2005 as the deadline to close peat stations there would have been plenty of time to ensure a just transition. Instead they opened two new peat stations in 2005, and 10 years later we have a crisis." Activisits say that peat is the dirtiest fossil fuel. In Ireland it gives us 9 per cent of our power, with 27 per cent of climate pollution from electricity generation, yet we spend EUR 120 million subsidising peat-burning power stations, according to Coghlan. "We simply have to stop industrial extraction of peat by 2020, and some of those subsidies should be diverted to ensuring decent employment for the affected workers." Others believe that a low-carbon economy with a high percentage of community energy projects will keep money in local communities and generate employment as a result. Dirk Vansintjan is the founder of Ecopower, a Belgian renewable-energy co-operative that has 50,000 members. He also belongs to the European Federation for Renewable Energy Cooperatives (rescoop.eu), a European organisation of citizen initiatives that invest in supplying their own renewable energy. "By making maximum use of local renewable-energy sources, and leaving the investments to local people, much money stays local that otherwise would be lost," he says. "This translates into a resurgent local economy and increased employment." In its report The Energy Transition to Energy Democracy Rescoop cites G\'fcssing, in Austria, as an example of a town whose economy was transformed when it cut carbon emissions by more than 90 per cent and became a thriving renewable-energy producer. It could be a model for Irish towns to follow. Connecting A smart, flexible way to go green 'Green Plan Ireland' (dconnolly.net/greenplanireland), which first appeared in the 'International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management', in 2014, hinges on combining our transport, heat and electricity sectors into one energy system. "This smart energy system allows the flexibility in heating and transport sectors to accommodate the intermittency of wind turbines," says Connolly, of the department of development and planning at the University of Aalborg, in Denmark. Wind power would be the primary form of energy production. "Due to recent improvements in wind-turbine technology and the excellent wind resource that exists in Ireland, a wind turbine in Ireland can produce electricity at a cheaper price than any other form of electricity-only production," says Connolly, who was invited to speak at two events in Ireland this week, the International Energy Research Centre's conference, in Co Carlow, and the Irish Wind Farmers' Association conference, in Dublin. 'Green Plan Ireland' divides the transition to renewable energy into steps, among them expanding electricity production from onshore and offshore wind and from solar panels; converting the heat supply in Irish cities from gas boilers to district heating; converting individual boilers in rural areas from coal and oil to electric heat pumps; converting cars from petrol and diesel to electricity; and producing synthetic fuels from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. All except the production of synthetic fuels will reduce the cost of energy, according to Connolly. "And instead of importing fuels for our energy" - Ireland imports more than 85 per cent of its fuel - "in a renewable-energy world Ireland will be producing its energy from local infrastructure. This means that the money will be spent locally." This would create an estimated 100,000 additional jobs, beginning in the construction sector and expanding as the plan develops. \</doc>

WHEN the wind blows and the sun shines, there is money being made. But how do renewables stack up against bricks and mortar as an investment option? Sometimes it feels like there is only one option for excess cash in this country - invest in property. Our recent past, however, has made us wary of putting all our eggs in the property basket. Renewable energy is a real alternative in investment terms, and represents a viable way to diversify. It offers a steady return over a medium term, typically 8.5% for a direct investment in solar for example, and of course it has the moral kudos. It's relatively new to us, however, and lack of knowledge makes us cagey. To help close that knowledge gap, here's a cheat sheet on renewables. I'm deliberately ignoring the moral or environmental argument so as to compare them simple as asset classes. Renewable energy has fixed, predictable income streams. Rates are usually underwritten by government feed-in-tariffs, which provide price certainty. The government guarantees a price of energy for the producer. In Italy, for example, where Solar 21 has its solar farms, we are guaranteed a price for each unit of energy we produce for the next 20 years. Government support for renewables will increase. Global agreements like the one achieved at COP21 in Paris in December will mean more, not less, support in the future. Not everyone was thrilled with our own government's white paper on energy, which was finally published in December, but it is indicative of the commitment global governments are making to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. There are minimal operational costs once a renewable energy project is up and running. If you think about it, wind and solar farms have a free supply of raw materials. Like property, you can see your investment. You are buying a piece of a wind or solar farm. You can physically visit it. There is an increasing demand for electricity. You're investing in the generation of electricity. You know it will always be in demand. Accessible. Through companies like Solar 21, Greenroom and Greenman, individuals can invest in solar or biomass farms easily with the help of their financial adviser either through a self-directed investment structure or directly. There are downsides though. For a start, like any technology there is the potential for obsoletion. This is important given the long-term nature of the investment. Having said that, the pace of technology innovation has been slowing in recent years translating into lower costing assets. According to a recent KPMG report, the costs of solar fell by 80% from 2008 to 2013. Renewable energy assets need on-going investment. Regulation is evolving, which may lead to some uncertainty. Now for property. Having lived through the property crash, we may all need some reminding of what property as an asset class actually has going for it. It's familiar. The oldest asset class, everyone is familiar with property, particularly in this country where it is a barstool and dinner-table staple topic of conversation. There are many ways to do it. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts - a tax-efficient way of investing in property), self-administered pensions, direct investment; there are many ways to dip into property investment depending on how hands-on you want to be. It has the prospect of capital appreciation. However, that swiftly spoken line that goes at the end of all financial services radio ads also applies here - the value of your investment may go down as well as up. The myth of always increasing house and commercial property prices has been shown to be just that - a fiction - in recent years. Property is beholden to economic cycles like most asset types. The proeprty market is regulated. Regulation around property is mature and only changes incrementally and generally for the good - for example, laws on building energy efficiency, health and safety, the use of noxious materials (asbestos, pyrite) and so on. It's tangible. Property is a physical asset and there is some psychological comfort in the 'bricks and mortar'. There is a demand for it. There will always be a need for homes, offices and commercial buildings. Of course its not all sweetness and light. For a start, there are a lot of costs involved with being a landlord. There are taxes and fees associated with property: stamp duty, local property tax, rates and so on. The expenses do not stop there. Though we probably all had some landlords in our student days to whom this point did not seem to have occurred, over the life time of the investment it will be necessary to make capital investments to refurbish and modernise it. It can also go wrong. Like every major purchase, it's a case of caveat emptor. There is a risk that your investment could be at risk from poor building standards or materials - just look at the case of Priory Hall or the pyrite estates. A bargain is not always a bargain. Location with property is everything. Two words: ghost estates. If location is everything, timing counts for a lot too. As I pointed out earlier, despite upward-only rent reviews, return on investment is not guaranteed. Vacancy rates for office buildings in Dublin, for example, were 23pc in 2010 according to CBRE. During a down turn the value and rental income of property are both hit. Property can be vulnerable to government intervention. We've already had the mort-gage rules, which appear to have cooled demand for residential property. Berlin has introduced a law prohibiting landlords from charging new tenants more than 10pc above the local average to combat the fastest rising rents in Europe. Rent caps area real possibility here. So is there a winner here? Property and renewables have a lot in common but there are some features of renewables that make them the winners for me. For a start, we're good at it; in Ireland we have the greatest wind energy resources in Europe. Solar? Well, that's another story. But there are plenty of places, southern Italy for example, where there is no shortage of sun. Property rental income is an unknown, affected by economic cycles which increase in value in good times and reduce in times of recession. Renewable energy projects on the other hand offer predictable returns over the lifetime of the investment. But it needn't be a case of one or the other. Ultimately, any good financial adviser should be offering you alternatives so that you can diversify. Property and renewables are uncorrelated asset classes, so having them both in your portfolio will protect you from over-exposure. When one goes up, the other goes down. Look, there are plenty of signs that property yields are on the up - rents are inexorably rising, by 9pc nationwide in 2015, according to a recent Daft survey. New home building is lagging behind what the experts claim is necessary - and a lack of supply means one thing for the investor - return on investment. But for investors looking for a long-term, balanced portfolio, it is worth remembering that renewable energy investment offers a stable, government-underwritten return. Brian Tiernan is an investment analyst with Solar 21, which is the investment adviser and asset manager to Greenroom Investments. \</doc>

Rogerstown Estuary was long a hidden jewel of Co Dublin's coastal scenery and wildlife, overshadowed by the international reputations and exceptional accessibility of North Bull Island and Sandymount Strand. Locals from Swords, Donabate and Rush have always known that the inner estuary, bounded towards the sea by the Dublin-Belfast railway bridge, was a special place. The subtle wetland landscape captures light in ever-shifting ways. Walking there is a more powerful, and much more desirable, antidote to stress than Prozac. Well-informed nature lovers have been enjoying its wealth of wildfowl, wading birds and plants since at least the mid-1970s. It has also long been home to gardening allotments. But it is only in recent years that innovative management by Fingal County Council has opened up the estuary, and the Turvey parklands to its south, to a much wider range of visitors. The council consulted widely with neighbouring communities, and with groups ranging from BirdWatch Ireland to the boy scouts and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Nature on Display: A n I ntegrated M asterplan for A menity, N ature, A ducation Hiking routes and cycling trails now extend through most of the Turvey parklands, and will soon link the site to Newbridge Demesne, nearby. The setting has been greatly enhanced by the planting of 30,000 native trees by Conservation Volunteers Ireland and locals, and by the reintroduction of traditional grazing and cultivation in some areas. Now the council's biodiversity officer, Hans Visser, has begun to incorporate elements of "climate-smart conservation" into the management of the site, anticipating the future effects of increasingly frequent and dynamic high tides. This is a pioneer project for Ireland. His first step, taken two months ago, has been to level nearly a kilometre of a 1.5metre-high embankment above a stretch of the south bank of the river. This will allow exceptionally high tides to flood on to several acres of level grassland. "The removal of the embankment here means that this area will probably flood with brackish - ie, partly salt - water about twice a year, instead of once every 10 years," says Visser. "We are restoring the natural hydrology of the area, beginning to climateproof the estuary," he continues. "There are no houses behind this bank, no critical infrastructure, so we are able to allow floods to occur as they should naturally." This absorption of floodwaters is a valuable ecosystem service provided by wetlands, protecting housing upstream from extreme weather. On the open area where we are standing, the flooding will create a gradual shift in vegetation from wet grassland towards salt marsh. "We don't have sufficiently detailed records to claim that we are restoring the salt marsh that may have existed in this precise place before," he says, although he thinks it is likely. In any case, the drainage of so much salt marsh along Dublin's coastline makes any increase of this habitat a biodiversity gain. But Visser cannot be sure exactly which species may benefit and which may lose. This raises a typical conservation dilemma. It has led to discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has overall responsibility for protecting the estuary's species, as it has been designated a special area of conservation. A little farther upstream, in similar wet grassland, a protected rare grass called meadow barley ( Hordeum secalinum ) is found. It tolerates a slightly salty environment but will not survive in full-blown salt marsh. So Visser is faced with the paradox that restoring the natural hydrology more extensively than he has done already could endanger a protected species. Whether the extension of salt marsh could destroy existing skylark breeding habitat, and potential nesting sites for lapwing, is a further issue that will require careful monitoring. This situation illustrates the degree to which conservationists, operating in a world where natural spaces have shrunk to fragments, live daily with the painful question of triage; they are like battlefield surgeons, prioritising the treatment of the wounded. Visser's general approach is to encourage the return of the broad ecosystem dynamics that originally created the landscape mosaic, while keeping a close eye on the effects on its individual pieces. The main changes in future, he says, "are linked to the restoration of the natural hydrology of the site, further expanding the open water in Turvey. "We are also looking into moving away from grazing targets in individual fields and allowing for herds of cattle and horses moving over a larger linked grassland area, and potentially grazing the woods too. The idea is to allow for the natural processes such as flooding and grazing to take place and monitor how nature reacts to these processes." It's exciting that such large-scale ecosystem restoration is taking place so close to our capital city. And it's important to remember that this might not even be conceivable today without many years' hard work by local citizen scientists in BirdWatch Ireland. They began systematic counting of the wintering wildfowl and wading birds on the estuary in 1989, several years before the national Irish wetland bird survey began. But why is counting birds important? The records produced showed that the estuary attracts wintering bird populations of international significance, on a par with better-known sites like Bull Island. This was enough to convince a government minister, in 1996, to deny permission for extension of the Balleally landfill site, on the north side of the inner estuary. Ironically, the applicant was Fingal County Council, in an era before biodiversity officers. BirdWatch Ireland went on to buy land on the site and to build hides on either side of the estuary. These offer spectacular opportunities to see many birds, including several species of geese, a dozen species of duck, and most of our wading birds, in glorious detail only a few metres away. Or just to sit and enjoy the constant changes in the light and on the water. Access details are at bwifingal.ie/ birding-sites/site-guides/#Rogerstown Perils Second-guessing climate change Even if the Cop21 climate-change talks in Paris produce the best possible outcome, we will still probably face quite dramatic increases in extreme weather, temperature and sea level. So should we struggle to maintain habitats, ecosystems and entire landscapes within their current range of species and ecological processes? Or should we adopt "climate-smart conservation" and attempt to anticipate the effects of rapid change in the near future, and adapt conservation management and goals accordingly? These are fraught questions. There is a strong argument for accepting that some changes are inevitable, and altering the practices at particular sites to accommodate them. Facilitating localised flooding to absorb increasingly high tides, as at Rogerstown, is a fairly straightforward case; the new habitat will be similar to species-rich marshes long lost to drainage in the area. But there is also a danger that a crude version of "climate-smart" thinking could lead to giving up on valid but costly conservation efforts - a convenient excuse to abandon, for example, native oak forest and bogs to invasive alien species such as rhododendron. There is likely to be much debate about how much we should second-guess climate change. \</doc>

Scientists are beginning to understand the circumstances of five mass extinctions that transformed the world over the past 4\'bd billion years. For example, a giant asteroid collided with Earth with the force of 100 million megatonnes of TNT 66 million years ago, plunging the planet into cold and darkness, wiping out three-quarters of all species (including the dinosaurs) and ending the Cretaceous period. That cataclysm was not explained until 1980, by Walter Alvarez, a geologist, and his father, Luis, a physicist. We are now rushing headlong into a sixth mass extinction, but this time the culprit is man, Elizabeth Kolbert writes in her best-selling book, The Sixth Extinction; An Unnatural History , which won a Pulitzer Prize last April. Kolbert travelled the world, from the Americas to the Great Barrier Reef to Europe, to document vanishing frogs, bats, rhinoceroses, coral. In our Anthropocene age, named for the impact of human activity, increasing numbers of species exist only in "frozen zoos", their cells preserved in pools of liquid nitrogen at -195 degrees. Towards oblivion Amphibians, which have been around for 250 million years, are now the most endangered species. "But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels," Kolbert writes. "It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all fresh water mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion." The early 19th-century French naturalist Georges Cuvier discovered that earlier species had become extinct, paving the way for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The sixth extinction is characterised by its rapidity, Kolbert explained in a telephone interview from her home in Massachusetts. "Most of the great mass extinctions of the past unfolded over thousands of years. The rates at present are phenomenally high," Kolbert said. "If we keep this up for another 500 years - long for humans but very short for the planet - the general consensus is that we are in a very serious extinction event." Kolbert's book explains the "dark synergy" between climate change, the acidification of the oceans and "fragmentation" - the fact that "Tundra is crisscrossed by pipelines . . . Ranches and plantations and hydroelectric projects slice through the rainforest". The funguses that are killing off frogs and bats in their millions were propagated by air travel. "So far," Kolbert said, "there is not a clearly documented case of a species driven to extinction by climate change." But global warming is pushing temperatures to extremes not seen for hundreds of millions of years. Life forms may not be able to adapt. "All the scientific literature predicts that climate change will become a major driver of extinction over this century." Humans are already fleeing the results of climate change, especially in Africa. "The refugee crisis in Europe should be a wake-up call," Kolbert said. "It's a vision of what's to come in a world where life is going to get harder and harder." The UN's COP21 "The word on the street is that it's very likely some sort of agreement will come out of Paris," Kolbert said. "It will be hailed - perhaps rightly - as a watershed moment. But the defining question is: when do we see global emissions actually start to drop? Is Paris a success if emissions continue to rise for 10, 20 or 30 years?" A 20-page draft treaty published on October 5th sets no date for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Though the threat of global warming has been understood since the late 1980s, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise, from six billion metric tonnes annually in the early 1990s to nearly 10 billion metric tonnes at present. Arbitrary target The treaty will set the target of limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 or 2 degrees by the end of this century. Scientists say there will be substantial risks to the environment beyond a 1.5 degree rise, but there is a consensus that even 2 degrees is unrealistic. "We are already seeing the impact. We're already seeing Antarctica start to go, and we aren't even at 2 degrees yet," Kolbert said. "Two degrees was always an arbitrary point. We are probably going to go over 2 degrees, but we can't give up because that would mean an even greater level of disaster." Kolbert believes "there is way too much emphasis on the words in the treaty", which is ultimately only a piece of paper. "What matters are the emissions. There is almost nothing that is or is not in the treaty that is going to make or break this. Are countries going to realise that it's in their interest to reduce emissions? If so, there is hope. If not, the treaty is not going to make it happen." That world leaders will gather in Paris to sign a treaty against climate change while they continue to subsidise massively the production and consumption of hydrocarbons seems the height of hypocrisy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates subsidies at $500 billion annually, though other calculations run much higher. Green Climate Fund By contrast, developed countries have mustered only $57 billion for each of the past two years for the "Green Climate Fund," to which they pledged $100 billion annually to help developing countries tackle climate change. The carbon subsidies are "completely wrong", Kolbert said. "On every level, it's crazy and self-defeating, but we keep doing it." She likened the problem to the "prisoner's dilemma", a game theory in which rational individuals refuse to co-operate, although to do so would be in their interest. "Everyone has to make the renunciation [of hydrocarbon subsidies] at the same time. Otherwise people are gaming the system, and no one wants to be the one making the sacrifice." Almost no one in Europe now doubts the reality of climate change. "Europeans are coming to it from the perspective of a continent that saw terrible things in the past century. They've come to believe in the need for global co-operation. "I don't think that consciousness has come to every part of the world yet. In the US, we still have presidential candidates who are doing extremely well in the polls who deny global warming exists. It is quite likely that one of them will be the Republican nominee . . . It's become one of the things you almost have to say to get the Republican nomination." Use of fear Though she believes climate change is "the great cause of our time", Kolbert is sceptical about the reliability of the INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) upon which the Paris treaty will be based. She regards predictions that the world will "come together" in a great shift of moral consciousness as naive. "Fear is a very good motivator," Kolbert said. "And if people are afraid that their kids are not going to have a future, they can be motivated." Action taken in the 1980s to stop the spread of the "ozone hole" which exposed the earth to ultraviolet radiation is a good example. "The world is capable of changing if it wants to." \</doc>

We often talk about our troubled relationship with the natural environment as if it were a modern problem. But there is abundant and increasing evidence that human effects on our landscapes have had problematic consequences for a very long time. Lorc\'e1n O Toole of the Golden Eagle Trust, which is having serious troubles of its own, embraces this long perspective. He thinks widely and deeply about matters ecological, and suggests that solutions from the past may hold lessons for present crises. So, while discussing why the eagles that the trust has reintroduced to Co Donegal failed to fledge a single chick last year, O Toole throws a legend that may date back to the Bronze Age into the mix. Midhir, the hero of the story The Wooing of \'c9ta\'edn , was challenged to plant a great forest in Breifni (Cavan, Leitrim and parts of Sligo). "I think this story suggests that even then people were aware that they had gone too far in deforesting the land, and that they needed to start replanting," says O Toole. He concludes that the management of our landscapes has always had to accommodate changes and conflicting interests, and that our notion of an ideal landscape condition is often distorted by seeing it through a short time frame. "Today we seem to think our uplands are at their best, their wildest, when they are denuded of trees," he says. "But if we take a longer view we realise that they used to be a mosaic of open country and pockets of native woodland." Although some of our vast stretches of upland blanket bog were created by climate change in the past, he holds that many of them were the product of human clearances. "It's possible that we may have been mismanaging our uplands for centuries. We are simply not sure today what healthy uplands should look like." What has this to do with his main concern: securing the success of the reintroduction of golden eagles? In November O Toole bluntly posted on the trust's Facebook page that the breeding productivity of the eagles was "not enough" to ensure their survival in Ireland. The problem, he wrote, was not direct human activity. Neither persecution nor accidental poisoning has been a key issue since the first of 50 young eagles was released in Glenveagh National Park in 2001. "In general the people of Donegal have embraced golden eagles," says O Toole. Changing climate is probably a key issue: exceptionally wet springs are causing higher than expected fledgling mortality. But O Toole believes that the primary problem is the poor ecological condition of the Donegal uplands. This habitat is simply not producing enough prey for eagles to feed their chicks adequately. This analysis is surprising. Surveys before reintroduction concluded that these uplands could definitely support eagles, to the satisfaction of national and international conservation authorities. "In hindsight we may have got it wrong," says O Toole. But if that's the case "the same failure applies to everything in this habitat.The Golden Eagle Trust rather naively felt that the amount of designated upland [conservation] sites and the size of the national park could lead only to the long-term enhancement of these habitats and further expand the live-prey availability in these sites. However, we did not sufficiently factor in deteriorating prey populations and worsening habitat." More victims than villains The Irish Wildlife Trust has blamed "uncontrolled burning, turf extraction and overgrazing" by farmers for this deterioration. But O Toole sees sees hill farmers as much more victims than villains in a complex uplands tragedy. He stresses the lack of connection between the international promotion of Ireland's "green" environment and the degraded ecological condition of many of our most cherished landscapes. He believes that there is an urgent need for extensive research into upland management that takes into account the needs - and effects - of all legitimate interest groups: hill farmers, wind farmers, foresters and recreational users, as well as conservationists. There is, he points out, far more State and university funding for research into the agricultural and biological productivity of our lowlands. The National Parks and Wildlife Service and the uplands council movement do their best, "but far more resources are needed", says O Toole, who mentions the cutting-edge uplands management research and practice in Scotland, Wales and, especially, Norway. There is nothing comparable in Ireland. Pending such research, he says, the amount of prey for golden eagles could be augmented by increased culling of another top predator: the fox. He has observed the Donegal eagles hunting most in areas where farmers keep fox populations low. He argues that, because Irish wolves have been exterminated, fox numbers are much too high for the good of the overall ecosystem. Foxes reduce the populations of vital eagle prey, such as red grouse and hare, to levels that will not sustain eagles. A fox cull will not be popular with everyone, O Toole concedes. But as hardly anyone supports the reintroduction of wolves, he says, we have a responsibility to control foxes just as conservationists, in the absence of big grazers, cut native hazel to foster wild-flower diversity. He also advocates restoring native forest in the uplands, through spontaneous regeneration and through hand-planting. The latter could provide incomes for hard-pressed farmers. Again, this idea may seem surprising, because eagles favour open landscapes. But O Toole says that native woodlands, limited to smallish pockets by harsh conditions, would also foster additional prey for eagles. O Toole says that the Welsh Pontbren farmer's project, which indicates that broad-leaved native-tree woodland absorbs water run-off 60 times more effectively than pasture, reveals another benefit of such reforestation; it could be a very significant tool against flooding. But he is sceptical about current proposals for more upland plantations of alien conifers, accompanied by promises to sequester carbon and help us meet the Paris COP21 targets. O Toole believes that the aggressive cultivation methods involved in such plantations increase net emissions. He is mildly optimistic that growing public concern about climate, carbon and flooding will soon drive research towards much better upland management, benefiting the human and ecological communities that depend on healthy hill and mountain landscapes. "The Taoiseach made very big promises before world leaders in Paris about our landscapes' capacity to sequester carbon," he says. "Now we need to measure precisely how this can best be done." The task of restoring our uplands, with eagles thriving above them, will require different tools from those that Midhir employed in the legendary past, but it is just as challenging, and more urgent than ever. Lorc\'e1n O Toole develops some of these points further in the upcoming issue of Natural Renewal , published by the Golden Eagle Trust Not just eagles Which species indicate the health of our uplands? n"Indicator species" are animals and plants that help ecologists to gauge the state of an ecosystem. If there are pearl mussels in a river, for example, that indicates the water quality is very high. nIf predators at the top of the food chain, such as the golden eagle, are flourishing, then the whole system is probably doing well. nBut Lorc\'e1n O Toole of the Golden Eagle Trust uses a suite of indicators to assess upland conditions: red grouse suggest thriving heathlands, and breeding golden plover indicate healthy upland grasslands, while Irish hares tell us that the mosaic mix is good. Bog cotton grows only in areas that are free of overgrazing. \</doc>

THE Christmas tree is up on Leinster Lawn but the mood in Leinster House is fractious and far from festive. Decks are being cleared as the Government pushes through reams of legislation before the end of term. After the Christmas break there is no knowing what could happen and deputies across the board are on election footing, with several in the last-chance saloon. Some in Fine Gael may be regretting the Taoiseach's decision not to call the election back in October. The seemingly intractable problem of patients on trollies, the constrained banking inquiry, and the calamitous floods of the last two weeks, all have a capacity to poison the public mood. However unreasonable it may be, when people lose their homes, livestock, farms and possessions, they inevitably cast around to blame the "authorities". In fairness to the Government, local authorities and the Civil Defence have mobilised a massive collective effort on this occasion to respond to the crisis, including immediately making money available to help those affected. There was more than a touch of irony that while people here in rain-soaked Ireland battled the elements, world leaders at long last agreed a long-term strategy on climate change in Paris. The Taoiseach's opening speech at the COP21 conference was badly received as being minimalist and defensive; he appeared to be putting the interests of Irish agriculture ahead of our country's climate justice obligations and to be at variance with the general political sentiment and clamour for brave global action. Climate change has always been a difficult policy agenda on which to get traction. With so many competing issues for global leaders to tackle ranging from terrorism, poverty, migration and economic and currency challenges, long-term priorities like global warming and rising sea levels have taken a back seat, despite many grandiose plans. But now for the first time, 195 countries rich and poor have agreed to eliminate dependence on fossil fuels in favour of more environmentally sustainable options. Action is no longer postponable, such is the rise in global temperatures due to uncontrolled carbon emissions and disregard by developed countries of the impact of transport pollution, agricultural methods and excessive energy use on the environment. Reaching agreement was arduous and protracted but the Paris Agreement binds all countries to reduce their emissions and sets highly ambitious targets. This week, Ireland's White Paper for decarbonising our energy system was published. President Francois Hollande and foreign minister Laurent Fabius of France did well to pull it off. Perhaps there has never been a greater need in the world for ethical leadership by heads of state and government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, now ten years in office, has been appropriately acknowledged in some quarters for her courage and leadership on the migrant crisis in Europe and her handling of the Greek debt crisis. Germany has welcomed a million refugees this year. She has done so even as the tide of welcome and public solidarity is ebbing away. She faces dissent too within her CDU party, some members of which are dismayed by what they see an ill-judged and disproportionate response. But she is steadfast in her belief that this is the right thing to do, not just for migrants but also for Germany. This week, she described the challenge as the "historic litmus test for Europe". Merkel is an example of a world leader, willing to risk unpopularity for herself personally and her party because she is convinced of the moral validity of her stance. Similarly, US president Obama has that capacity to hold firm against the tyranny of populist domestic politics, by articulating a need for gun control reform in the United States against the clout of the National Rifle Association. But he has been constantly thwarted by Congress in his attempts to introduce even moderate reforms. Closer to home, our own John Hume, whose life is documented in a recently published book, risked his own reputation and the electoral fortunes of his party by having a secret dialogue with Gerry Adams over many years since 1985. When news of it emerged in 1993, Hume was vilified but he made no apology for the controversial talks, even though IRA violence continued at the time. It took real courage to trust his instincts about the value of that engagement. He was instrumental in persuading president Clinton to grant a visa for Adams as part of confidence building with republicans. Clinton, in turn, took risks in granting the visa, against the advice of the State Department, and in 1994 the first IRA ceasefire was announced, marking the beginning of the end of the conflict in Northern Ireland. Reflecting on John Hume's selfless contribution to the peace we all now enjoy, one cannot help comparing such a life of endeavour and conviction to the likes of Donald Trump, the republican candidate seeking the US presidential nomination. The wrong-headed intolerance and xenophobic rhetoric emanating from him is enough to reduce one to head-hanging despair. Similarly, the narrow nationalist rhetoric generated by UKIP and some of the eastern European member state leaders is depressing. Denmark's recent referendum result marked yet another popular vote against EU values of solidarity. The Brexit debate can also be seen in this context. So ethical leadership in politics is an absolute priority in these times of war, migration, economic instability and terrorism. We in Ireland, though we are small, can and do play a disproportionate part in international discourse on these major issues through the EU and the UN. Only this week, former president Mary Robinson was honoured in Dublin by Kofi Annan for her work on climate justice. Former attorney general and UN special envoy on migration Peter Sutherland has led the humanitarian debate on behalf of migrants and refugees, making the moral case for generosity and humanity in dealing with the migrant crisis in Europe. The passing of the marriage equality referendum this year is a measure of the best instincts of the Irish people and our polity. We should be proud of our many distinguished and internationally renowned politicians, public servants and presidents and not be overly side-tracked by the misdeeds of the odd venal councillor. Probity in elected officials is important and there are rigorous checks on ensuring high standards now. But the sins of a few should not eclipse the achievements of many good men and women who devote their lives to public service in politics. Those who seek to attribute base motives to all politicians should be careful what they wish for. Denigrating all politicians from traditional parties leaves the pitch open to unproven and potentially chaotic extremes which could unravel our hard-won recovery. Angela Merkel is an example of a world leader who will risk unpopularity when she is convinced of moral validity \</doc>

An idea that began in Dublin's Central Hotel in 1999 - to create Ireland's first ecovillage - has borne fruit on a 67-acre farm adjoining the village of Cloughjordan, Co Tipperary. Back then, the aspiration of low-carbon living, where going about one's life means producing as little climate-changing carbon emissions as possible, was cutting edge. Now it's on the lips of everyone from the pope to corporate and state leaders meeting in Paris at the COP21 climate change summit. As a founder member of the ecovillage, I was heavily involved up until 2009 when I left for a six-year stint in Belgium. Back then, only one house had been built. On returning this summer, things had changed dramatically. There are 55 homes, an enterprise centre, a bakery, allotments and a hostel. The community farm is finally up and running; some 16 acres of broadleaved forestry is maturing nicely; a meandering biodiversity trail, colloquially known as the "perimeter walk", is trod daily by ecovillagers and locals alike. There's also a steady trail of students, both from school and university, who come to learn in the community. Policy lessons Internationally, the ecovillage is part of the global ecovillage network and has been identified as one of Europe's most important examples of an initiative that provides policy lessons for a low-energy society. Of 1,500 projects initially chosen by the EU-funded Milesecure researchers, Cloughjordan featured in the final 23. "It's the multifaceted nature of our project that makes us so successful," says Peadar Kirby, academic, author and one of the first ecovillage residents. "The ecovillage is robust in renewable technology, food and community." At the national level the community's ecological footprint is the lowest measured in Ireland at 2 global hectares (gHa), just above one-planet living. (One gHa represents the average productivity of all biologically productive areas on Earth.) The average for 79 other settlements included in the study was 4.3gHa. "This is the single biggest piece of evidence that we are really achieving quite a substantial amount," says Kirby. That the ecovillage has gained international acclaim is all the more remarkable given that it is still a work in progress, with 47 sites still for sale, and, like many other developments, recovering from the recession. "We were launched in the Celtic tiger and were expected to be sold out but now it's quite a different ball game," says Tom Tracey who lives here with his family. "There are only 55 households where there were meant to be over 130." Higher charges One effect is that the district heating system has fewer customers than it was designed for, resulting in higher than expected charges for residents. Also, it was designed to run on two renewable sources - woodchip and solar - but the solar panels have, so far, not worked. The contractor overseeing the work subsequently went bust and we are now seeking ways of raising the finance to get them operational. Nevertheless, the "interconnectedness [of the district heating system] reinforces community which is at the heart of the project", says Kirby. "Far too much of the discourse about climate change is about technology but it's not going to make a difference on its own. It's a resilient community that will make the difference." Drainage system One system that appears to be working well is the sustainable drainage system. In effect it's a controlled floodplain, designed to keep water away from ecovillage houses but on site for as long as possible, thus slowing down its release into the local stream. It's heartening to know we are doing our small bit to reduce flooding, especially as we're in the Shannon catchment. In September 2012, the ecovillage halved its site prices, with sites serviced for electricity, heat, sewage and water now on offer for between EUR 45,000 and EUR 70,000. The project received virtually no national public funding but did receive an EU grant towards the renewable energy heating system. "We are at the cutting edge of the most crucial global challenge - that of achieving a low-carbon society by 2050 - and yet we are existing on a knife-edge and with virtually no funding," says Kirby. So what's it's like life in the ecovillage? Living in a bright, warm house (ours is B1 energy-rated) is pure luxury, especially when you know all your heating and hot water is coming from a renewable resource. It's satisfying too to harvest rainwater off our roof for use in all but two cold water taps. When it comes to mobility I was part of a car club in Brussels, so sharing cars with a couple of my ecovillage neighbours comes easy. The strong sense of community within Cloughjordan as a whole, combined with various community email lists, is a bonus to getting to places. "Help is always there," says resident Junko Shimada, who is originally from Tokyo. "When you need a lift, you send an email and five minutes later it's sorted." Living here, it's possible to radically reduce one's food miles. You can grow your own, buy directly from the experimental vegetable gardens run by ecovillager Bruce Darrell or join the community farm. As members we help ourselves to as many vegetables as we want from the central collection point, where produce is delivered three times a week. Making a living We are also members of the local bread club, paying for our home-delivered bread from the Riot Rye bakery on a monthly basis. Combined with meat from the local butcher, milk delivered by a local supplier, dry goods ordered in bulk with some 50 others and a few supplies from Cloughjordan's shops, non-local shopping trips are few and far between. Making a living in rural Ireland is undoubtedly an issue. While some residents commute to nearby towns and some further, many work from home and from the WeCreate enterprise centre. For Laois man Pat Malone, who farms the community land, the biggest daily challenge in the ecovillage is our diversity. "But it's also our strength. To live in a community you have to follow the agreed processes. I'm useless at it, but I'm learning," he says with a chuckle. As for the kids, they have a choice of two primary schools and numerous activities within walking distance. Sophia Whelan (11) who has been in the ecovillage since she was seven, says: "We are quite free to go where we want as there aren't many cars." So is the ecovillage a success? "We don't have much of a sense of achievement but others who visit are always impressed," says John Jopling (80), the oldest ecovillager. "We are a community who are trying to do our best." Village life By the numbers 90% of ecovillage homes are energy-rated B1 or higher 28% of households have rainwater harvesting systems 2 Wood-chip boilers provide all ecovillage homes with heating and hot water 85 varieties of vegetables including five types of potatoes are grown on the community farm 600 metres, the distance vegetables travel from soil to the collection point 95% of primary-age residents cycle or walk to school 1 public 'ecar' charging point at Django's hostel Load-Date: \~December 10, 2015 \</doc>

Last month, as world leaders met in Paris at COP21 , the United Nations climate-change summit, more than 100 Irish community groups, co-operatives, energy agencies and nongovernment organisations signed the Community Energy Proclamation. "Imagine a community putting its hands up and deciding to build a wind farm," its organisers said. "Imagine all the schools in a town running on clean, free solar electricity." Encouraging communities to move to clean energy through projects like these is the best way to unlock Ireland's renewable-energy potential, according to the groups that put the proclamation together. "The 100 signatories represent thousands of people. A lot of people see the climate challenge as serious and want to respond to it in their communities," says Kate Ruddock of Friends of the Earth ( HYPERLINK http://www.foe.ie www.foe.ie ), one of the organisations that signed up. The proclamation envisions Ireland as a nation of "energy citizens" who will plan, generate and distribute energy for the benefit of their communities. This is also what the Government says it wants, according to Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030 (bit.ly/1nxDJdd), a White Paper that Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alex White published the week after the signing of the energy proclamation. "The need for change to our energy system is absolute. The deregulation of the electricity sector has led to the private ownership of new energy infrastructure. The debate on fossil fuels is now over, and in the transition to clean-energy production we need to engage citizens in the ownership of energy," says Paul Kenny, chief executive of Tipperary Energy Agency (tea.ie). Kenny believes that much of the objection to wind farms was really about the transfer of wealth from the community to developers and landowners "who make substantial amounts of money while the wider community doesn't benefit much at all". Service to society Kenny has been to Denmark to see some of the first community wind farms. "It was interesting to see how community wind energy was born out of a voluntary effort and a move against corporate energy production. The Danish model of co-ownership states that a community must own 20 per cent of wind farms." Everybody in Denmark accepts and is engaged by the need to move from a fossil-fuel society, according to Kenny. "That hasn't happened in Ireland yet," he says."We have to ask ourselves: is energy a service to society or a commodity to make money from?" Kenny believes the ideal is for energy to be created in the local economy and for any surplus to be sold back into the local area as part of a circular economy. But Ireland has huge issues to overcome before it can accommodate many community-run wind farms or solar-powered schools. Most community energy projects cannot currently access the national electricity grid, for example, sell any surplus electricity they generate or share the electricity they generate with their neighbours. More fundamentally, they often cannot even get advice on planning permission, on the installation of equipment or on the financing and managing of energy co-operatives. Kate Ruddock is critical of Ireland's lack of support for community energy projects. "We have relied on energy from big power plants. In contrast to many European countries, community-owned renewable energy in Ireland is practically nonexistent," she says. "About 60 per cent of renewable energy is owned by communities in Germany, and Scotland has recently met its target to supply 500 megawatts - about 500,000 homes - with locally owned wind- and hydro-powered projects. "How is it right that we subsidise peat and gas power plants but there are no payments for solar electricity or for microgeneration of electricity? How is it right that the system supports developers to build wind farms but there is no mechanism for community participation in renewable energy?" She acknowledges that the White Paper is a step forward. One of its sections, entitled "From Passive Consumers to Active Citizens", outlines the need for "energy citizens" and "energy communities" to be "agents of change in how we generate, transmit, store, conserve, and use our energy". It also says that "the energy system will change from one that is almost exclusively Government and utility led, to one where citizens and communities will increasingly be participants in energy efficiency and in renewable energy generation and distribution". New infrastructure The Government says it will fund and support community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction; facilitate both access to the national grid and payments for electricity generated by the projects; and develop a framework that allows communities to share in the benefits of any substantial new energy infrastructure in their areas. "For the first time in Ireland, community energy has become policy, but the implementation of the White Paper on energy is far from clear," Ruddock says. Ireland has only one community-owned wind farm, and it took more than 10 years to get it up and running. Templederry Wind Farm, in Co Tipperary, has two turbines that generate up to 4.6 megawatts of electricity. This is then fed into the national grid. "The way I see it is that each turbine means the money stays in the area and prevents another oil tanker from coming into the country," says John Fogarty of Templederry Wind Development Company. Clare Watson, an energy-policy researcher at University College Cork (bit.ly/1nxDQWd), says that more financial, technical and practical support needs to be made available to initiate, motivate and sustain long-term action for community energy. "People need to feel that we are all in this together, that we're part of a national movement, a national energy transition, and that the Government, politicians, policymakers and businesses are doing their part," she says. "Setting up and supporting community energy groups is only part of the jigsaw." Community energy projects in Ireland nComharchumann Fuinnimh OileainOile\'e1in Arainn , or Aran Islands Renewable Energy (facebook.com/AranIslands energy), is the stand-out community-owned energy project. The winner of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's Sustainable Energy Award in 2014, it aims to have all three Aran Islands energy-independent and carbon-neutral by 2022. Seventy-five per cent of homes on the islands have signed up for insulation upgrades, with 30 per cent already done; 30 residents also reduced transport costs by almost 80 per cent by using eight electric vehicles over three years; and there are plans to supply all three islands with wind-powered electricity. "The community here are very practical people, and they see the benefits of having comfortable homes and cheaper heating bills. We aim to offer people cheaper energy from wind generation, with options to own shares in the turbine and share in the profits," says Dara Molloy of the project. Longer-term plans include photovoltaic and wave energy. "We want to start new businesses that run on green energy, to strengthen and broaden our economy from tourism and fishing." nTemplederry Wind Farm, in Co Tipperary, is Ireland's first community-owned wind farm. Located between Nenagh and Thurles, it has two turbines that generate 4.6 megawatts of electricity at maximum capacity. nClaremorris & Western District Energy Co-Op (claremorrisenergy co-op.com) is a community-led district heating project to be fuelled by woodchip from local softwood trees and biogas from local farms. A joint venture with Mayo County Council, the project aims to bring heat to businesses, homes and the local national school. "We are also submitting an application for two community solar farms and will run workshops on biogas generation with an innovation award we won from Gas Networks Ireland," says JP Prendergast. The co-op also hopes to build a microgrid, so it can supply all its own electricity and heat. Mayo County Council also plans to convert some vehicles to run on biogas. \</doc>

A forum to allow young Irish people have an input into international negotiations on climate change is to be established by An Taisce. The environmental watchdog has said it will set up the National Youth Forum for Engagement with Climate Change if it can raise at least EUR 14,500 through crowd funding. It wants to establish the platform ahead of the latest international climate change summit in December this year so that young Irish people can have a voice at the event. More than 190 countries will take part in COP21 in Paris. To donate, and for further information, see icrowdfund.ie. \</doc>

It has taken time for climate change to creep back on to the political agenda. During the recession, understandably, it plummeted as a priority issue for voters, with a huge fall-off in media coverage. In 2009, there were almost 3,000 articles in Irish media about climate change; in 2012 there were well below 1,000. Last December, the UN climate change conference, COP 21 , produced the Paris agreement, a breakthrough document that commits nearly 200 states to keep global temperature increase "well below" 2 degrees, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial levels. The achievement was beyond the expectations of many detractors. There were also important commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to put $100 billion a year into climate finance. However, there are large variations in terms of detail and commitments, as well as get-out clauses for particular sectors or interest groups. For example, some parties look for exemptions for the likes of agriculture, oil-burning power generators, peat-extraction and wind-power. The spread of wind energy had met resistance in local communities because of the intrusive nature of some wind farms and this local opposition has percolated into manifestos. Dr Cara Augustenborg, a lecturer in climate change and the environment at the UCD School of Biology and Environmental Science, has done a comprehensive analysis of the manifestos to compare their policies. A former member of the Green Party, she declares that interest up-front. She found limitations in all the manifestos, including that of her former party. But as this is its raison d'\'eatre, it is unsurprising that the Green Party emerges as strongest in her analysis. It is rated number one followed (in descending order) by Labour; Social Democrats; Fianna F\'e1il; Fine Gael; Renua; Sinn F\'e9in; and People Before Profit. The latter four have big omissions or are inherently weak or soft on climate change, in her view. Fine Gael It refers to climate change in its manifesto more than any other party and there is a section devoted to it, including some good measures on biomass. Surprisingly, there is no concrete target for electric vehicles, in sharp contrast to the 2011 manifesto which included ambitious targets. There are no firm commitments in terms of reductions and all initiatives mentioned have to be "balanced" against other interests, including rural economy and expansion of agricultural produce. Whitegate refinery is to stay open. Judgment on fracking is withheld. There is no reference to solar energy. Wind energy must be balanced against the concerns of local communities. Greenways and existing public transport plans - new Luas lines, bicycle schemes and so on - are included. There is a commitment to add 6,000 hectares of forestry over 2\'bd years. Labour Party This is one of the better manifestos, according to Dr Augustenborg. It includes a few imaginative ideas, including carbon-neutral cities within 20 years. There are strong ambitions for community ownership of projects, based on the White Paper on energy, steered by Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alex White, but there are no great specifics on how it will be achieved. The party is against fracking, will keep Whitegate open and will replace coal-burning Moneypoint with low-carbon energy by 2025. The party puts a big emphasis on compressed natural gas as an interim alternative to petrol/diesel. Fianna F\'e1il The party has a surprisingly good manifesto, says Dr Augustenborg. Its big initiative is a specific department of climate change, incorporating energy, transport and flood defences. The party is strong on electric vehicles with four specific incentives. There is strong resistance to wind energy. Sinn F\'e9in The party's commitments to climate change are a little sketchy compared to other big parties. It does not have a comprehensive transport policy, nor does it have a full energy policy. Peat is only mentioned in the context of retaining turbary rights. The party opposes fracking. There are references to including energy efficiency in housing. The overall commitment to climate change is disappointing, says Dr Augustenborg. Renua Ireland Climate and natural resources is one of its 19 manifesto policies. It opposes wind energy, favouring solar and tidal energy (even though the latter is at an early stage of development). It supports biomass and lays strong emphasis on air quality. It opposes fracking and supports new road building. Social Democrats One of the party's TDs, Catherine Murphy, has been a vocal proponent of climate change legislation and the manifesto reflects this view. The party is also strong on electric vehicles, public transport, housing and elimination of peat burning. There are no specific targets, however, and no detailed plans on solar energy. People Before Profit It produced a very slim manifesto in general. The party has opposed fracking and it supports insulation programmes and the use of Coillte land for energy projects. There are no other commitments on climate change. Green Party It calls for 2030 binding targets and 80 per cent emission reduction by 2050. Specific actions are laid out for agriculture, forestry, energy and transport. It does not agree with full expansion of the national herd under Food Wise 2025, the only party to explicitly state such a view. Surprisingly, there are scant references to biomass policy.

THE gunmen who mowed people down in cafes in central Paris and at a packed theatre in the French capital on Friday were acting in a city on high alert since terrorists attacked satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in January. That did nothing to stop them. According to eyewitnesses, the men with machine guns walked down streets crowded with Friday revellers with aplomb to carry out the worst terror attack in over a decade in a Western country. Their action shows the challenge of providing foolproof security in a city of 2.2 million people with a bar or a restaurant dotting practically every corner, said Louis Caprioli, the exhead of DST, France's former anti-terrorism unit, and now an adviser to Paris-based security consultants Groupe GEOS. "It's precisely because sensitive sites have been protected by security forces since January that the terrorists attacked all of France," Caprioli said in a telephone interview. "These people knew our habits. They knew these streets would be busy on a Friday night. There is no way to provide total protection." Friday's carnage left at least 128 dead and more than 200 wounded in near-simultaneous assaults on cafes, a soccer match and a concert hall. The attacks were carried out by "a terrorist army", French president Francois Hollande said in an address to the nation. It's the deadliest such act since the 2004 bombings at train stations in Madrid that killed 191. "Though shocking, the attacks are not completely surprising," risk analysts Stratfor said in a note to clients. "Multiple individuals from France and other European countries have travelled to Syria to join extremist groups there. As the Charlie Hebdo attacks have also demonstrated, there is a persistent risk of terrorist attacks within Europe." That said, Hollande's government may draw criticism for what some analysts see as a failure of security. "This kind of attack is an intelligence failure," said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore. France was "aware of the threat but did not anticipate an attack of this scale". After 17 people were murdered at Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket in January, the French government mobilised 7,000 soldiers to protect sites such as government buildings and synagogues. It hired more police and voted in laws giving it greater surveillance powers. Hollande, who yesterday blamed Islamic State for what he said was an "act of war", pledged that security will be further tightened, with more soldiers patrolling the streets of Paris. There are 571 French residents with radical Islamic groups in Syria now and 141 have died there, interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Thursday. Another 370 have been arrested upon their return and 11,000 people are being followed, he said. After the Friday attacks, France is deploying 1,000 additional soldiers to patrol streets in the Paris region, reinforcing the 30,000 police and military who have been protecting sensitive sites in recent months. Another 230 soldiers have been put at the disposal of local authorities. While armed soldiers in the metro have become a standard sight for Parisians, they can't be everywhere. France has 35,000 cafes, according to state statistical institute Insee. Paris alone has about 13,000 restaurants, according to the Paris Commercial Court. Visitors spent 22 million hotel nights in Paris in 2014. The Paris metro has an average of five million rides a day. "It's very difficult to secure a city," said Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at Royal United Services Institute in London. "It's access to weaponry which would make this less heinous." COP 21 "When one targets civilians, it's almost impossible to prevent," Claude Moniquet, co-founder of the Brussels-based European and Strategic Intelligence and Security Centre, said in a post on Facebook. "Don't forget that every day security forces arrest or question suspects, and that at least 10 plots have been broken up since January." In addition, illegal guns circulate freely in the tough neighbourhoods that surround many French cities, even if civilians in France aren't allowed to possess military-style weapons unless they are a certified collector, and permits and background checks are required for hunting rifles and handguns. An AK-47 can be bought for (EURO)1,000 on the black market, according to police unions. Police seized 5,300 guns in 2014, of which 175 were "war weapons", according to the French interior ministry. "Weapons are circulating very easily," former French anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Louis Bruguiere said on BFM TV. Thibault de Montbrial, a French lawyer, said France needs to loosen some of its gun laws. "Civil servants who are authorised to carry weapons should be allowed to do so off-duty," he said. "That wouldn't cost a euro. We could have had people able to fire back in restaurants, concert rooms, in stations and shopping malls." \£9Bloomberg \</doc>

The Ireland South MEP said Europe needs to ensure other big emitters follow the efficiency of EU member states at the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. He was addressing a Climate Change and Sustainable Agriculture debate in the EU Parliament in Brussels. Europe has some of the most efficient processes in the world, both industrial and agricultural. It would be unacceptable for us to go to Paris and accept anything less than a global agreement, said Mr Kelly. Agriculture is key to spreading the recovery throughout Ireland. Our grassland system creates lower emissions making our sector far more sustainable than others globally. "We should promote how sustainable intensification of food production contributes to GHG mitigation, to food security, and to preserving the job creation it brings in countries such as our own. \</doc>

At the Paris climate talks before Christmas, the former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern heralded the end of what he called the fake horse race between the twin goals of tackling climate change on the one hand and eradicating poverty on the other. In his conceptually neat view the COP21 agreement, in which 195 nations, led by the United States and China, agreed to cut emissions in order to limit global warming, will involve no economic cost. In the savannah and highlands of northern Tanzania, reducing poverty while preserving the environment is a high-wire act. Twelve million Tanzanians live in dire poverty despite economic growth of 7 per cent last year. A large population - 47 million people - a high birth rate, and an economy based largely on subsistence farming mean that pastoralists, smallholders, commercial farmers and game reserves are competing for land. This is all happening amid rising temperatures brought about by global trends, uncertain rains and vanishing tree cover. In 2012 Nasa warned that the ice cap that crowns Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro, could disappear by 2020. The volcanic Mount Meru, 80km to the west, has been mostly ice free since the 1960s. Today the people who live and work on its slopes feel the heat very keenly indeed. "It's much warmer around here now than in the 1970s, even in the early 1990s," says Ernest Kaaya. A small farmer in the Luguruki ward of Arumeru district, with two wives and 10 children, the 66-year-old is a genial, paternal figure in the small community. "The snow on the mountain disappeared decades ago," he says. "Until recently a lot of the trees on the mountains were being cleared by the villagers, but the government stopped it." While climate change affects the mountains' ice caps, forestry has been blamed for robbing the slopes of moisture. Kaaya started a small tree nursery in 2011, selling jacaranda saplings for about 8 cent each, after being trained by Cedesota, a community organisation funded by Irish Aid, via Care International. "After the seminar I started growing trees so locals could plant on their farms on the mountain, to help the soil," he says. "Now the conflict with the government is over. It's my ambition to spread the training, because it's good for everybody. It's very easy to erode the soil on the mountain without trees, and the trees provide shade." Kaaya is also part of a co-op that exports avocados, papayas, coffee, beans and timber. In addition to nurseries and cash crops, Cedesota has helped the locals, who come from the Meru and Masai tribes, to mitigate the depredations of drought by keeping poultry and goats. "It opened my mind: chickens are like insurance when there's no rain," says Rosemary Mosembise, a 37-year-old who runs a small restaurant from a tiny shack. "My firstborn is in secondary school because of the money I get from selling chickens." The tuition costs 1.2million Tanzanian shillings a year, about EUR 500 - a sizeable sum. Northern highlands Compared with the tropical south and the arid interior, Tanzania's northern highlands are blessed with rich soils and a superb, relatively cool climate despite being just shy of the equator. In the area around Luguruki village, where I visit small irrigated plots of coffee, avocados, papayas and bananas, I pass oxen pulling ploughs, fields teeming with corn, and plantations of beans and peas. "They are poor people here - they live in the mountains - but they know how to use the land," says Jackson Muro of Cedesota. "They take their cows' manure to fertilise the crops, and the cows eat fodder. There is no grazing here, because there is no space to graze. It's mainly agroforestry." Here, at least, among Meru tribespeople, economic development seems to go hand in hand with looking after the land. Farther north and west, near the vast Serengeti plain, Masai communities practise pastoralism. Although the government officially encourages agriculture as more economically and environmentally sound, no crops or trees are planted on the plains to the west and north of Arusha, the regional centre. Instead Masai pastoralists drive cattle across them in ever-increasing numbers. Although the vast majority of Irish Government aid to Tanzania goes on health services and nutrition, Irish Aid policy is to support the pastoralist way of life. To experience it at first hand I travel to Loliondo, in the heartland of Masai territory, on the border with Kenya. The 360km journey takes about 10 hours - the route includes deeply rutted tracks - but we sweep through the sunlit uplands of Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a Unesco World Heritage site where Masai herdsmen share green pasture with wildebeest, zebras, giraffes and elands. The vast lands north of the conservation area, around Loliondo, are also populated by Masai tribes, although wildlife is not afforded the same protection here. In the boma, or fenced village, of Enguserosambu I meet Masai widows who, in 2014, were part of a group that received 100 cows funded by Irish Aid via Palisep, a local group. Robert Kamakia of Palisep explains how they help the women produce and market their dairy produce. A Masai, Kamakia admits that work among the tribe to combat female genital mutilation, forced marriage and a widespread denial of the existence of sexually transmitted diseases has a long way to go. Customarily forbidden from remarrying or owning land, Masai widows are usually shunned by the community and even by their own families. Nanyikai-Sironet, who is 48, says that her late husband's alcoholism frittered away their resources and that she suffered dire social exclusion for not owning cattle. "When I received the cow from Ireland I was so happy. It was the end of a very dark time. It was the first time I ever owned livestock. Things are changing, but very slowly," she says of the deeply patriarchical Masai society. After another hour's drive we come to the boma of Ngarwa, about 10 huts overlooking a marshy plain. I meet Noosupuia-Kosiom, a 24-year-old who was widowed five years ago, when her husband died in battle. After she sold her remaining livestock to feed her two children she was forced to work part-time as a labourer, collecting firewood and water. "It was very difficult having nothing. Since receiving my cow from Irish Aid" - via Oxfam - "people here treat me completely differently." Sagging, grey, grassless land Although flies swarm around us and the cattle, the land is lush and green up here in the far north, and some areas show bursts of agriculture. Not so between Karatu and Arusha, where the sagging, grey and often grassless land shows, even at the end of the rainy season, the effects of overgrazing. Local officials say that pure pastoralism is unsustainable in the long term, as nomadic herders require much more land than the agroforesters of the Arumeru region. Given the Masai's staggering birth rate - the population has more than doubled in less than 30 years - there is huge pressure on the land in many areas. Oxfam has called for the Masai lifestyle to be embraced as a response to climate change, because of the Masai's experience of living in arid bushland. Yet the rapid growth in the Masai population, and subsequent overgrazing, is one reason why some previously fertile lands have turned to desert. This article was supported by the Simon Cumbers Media Fund Mental health: the culture is to repress and suppress The population pressure in northern Tanzania is especially evident in Arusha, whose population estimates put at anything from 500,000 to two million. A city who bustle is partly due to its status as a safari staging post, Arusha consists mostly of slum dwellings, wooden or earthen shacks with neither running water nor electricity. The area around Esso Road is among the fastest-growing slums in east Africa. Evanna Lyons, a Meath woman, sees the problems first hand in her work as a psychotherapist at Arusha Mental Health Trust, the city's sole mental-health clinic. "The patients we see have no words for depression, anxiety or stress. Emotive words like 'sad', 'hurt' and £ngry' are not used a lot," she says. "The culture is to repress and suppress; a lot of members of the community can by silenced for the greater good. "They find it hard to express feelings and report a lot of psychosomatic symptoms. You might have someone say they have a pain in their head, and then you find out their father died in front of them a few weeks beforehand." Arusha Mental Health Trust was founded in 2000 by another Irishwoman, Dr Sheila Devane. Last year Minister of State Sean Sherlock awarded EUR 10,000 to fund a psychotherapy education programme on sexual abuse. \</doc>

He used the party s weekly parliamentary party meeting to put to bed suggestions that he was the source of the leak . The party last week heard TDs and senators say that the supposed internal analysis leaked to the media which claimed Labour could lose 20 seats had damaged the party. Mr Kelly told his colleagues he was upset at the suggestion it was him. He spoke for about two minutes, there was a small ripple of applause and then people shook his hand, said a party source. Meanwhile, Taoiseach Enda Kenny tried to quell the backlash after his controversial speech in Paris this week where he suggested Ireland should be exempt from EU emission targets. Sources said he told the Fine Gael party meeting there would be no exemptions for Ireland from whatever collective framework comes out of the COP21 climate summit. Mr Kenny had said the targets to cut emissions by up to 20% were unrealistic . \</doc>

Iarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann is ready to play its part in ensuring Ireland has an effective public transport system.\~ Think of the great liveable cities of the world. Vienna, Vancouver, Melbourne, Zurich and others regularly found at the top of global rankings. In survey after survey, mobility in these cities is dominated by effective public transport systems. At the heart of these systems is a high-capacity rail network, and planning and development which supports sustainable travel and living. As our delicate economic revival continues, the most immediate pressures are being felt once again in our urban centres, with congestion returning, traffic volumes reaching boom-era levels and the unsustainability of car-dominated commuting clearer than ever. This is most acute in the Greater Dublin Area, where conservative forecasts show a 35 per cent increase in morning peak travel demand by 2041 or 650,000 additional trips to and from work per day. Clearly this increase in transport demand needs to be supported by sustainable public transport options, with Dublin recently identified as being the 10th most congested large city in the world with an average route taking 35 per cent longer than it would in free-flowing traffic. As home to 39 per cent of the population and 43 per cent of jobs, the economic wellbeing of the greater Dublin area is central to national economic recovery. It accounts for almost half of national GDP and its effective management and continued success is critical for the performance of the entire economy. Furthermore, the new COP 21 UN Climate Change agreement puts an onus on Ireland as a country to work to reduce transport emissions significantly, which currently account for 30 per cent of Ireland's emissions, second only to agriculture. Investing for our future Iarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann is planning to address the forecast demand and expand the scope and capacity of our rail network to ensure we provide the high-capacity public transport solutions needed for a sustainable future. Through a mix of shorter-term and longer-term projects, we can keep pace with the emerging pressures from a growing population, and help support the type of planning essential to achieve sustainability. In 2016, two projects will be delivered which will allow more commuters to travel by rail: \'b7\~\~\~In April, we will increase the frequency of DART services from every 15 minutes to every 10 minutes in each direction all day on weekdays, as well as providing additional weekend frequency. DART passenger numbers grew by 8 per cent in 2015 over the previous twelve months, and the enhanced capacity provided by a more frequent service will allow for further projected growth; \'b7\~\~\~Towards the end of 2016, the Phoenix Park Tunnel line will be open to commuter trains daily, offering direct Kildare to Connolly/Grand Canal Dock services for the first time. This (EURO)13.7 million project, funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport through the National Transport Authority - together with ongoing signalling works - will offer new connections to commuters. There will be a higher frequency of services for customers on the Kildare commuter line, who will have a choice of Heuston and Connolly/Grand Canal Dock services operating. It is forecast that up to one million additional journeys annually will be made by public transport as a result. The key to our future network However, while the options commuters have are set to expand imminently, there remains a missing link constraining the rail transport options available to the Greater Dublin area. The DART Underground line is at the heart of the DART Expansion Programme, a series of projects which would develop and expand the DART network in the Greater Dublin Area, building on one of Ireland's great public transport success stories, the DART. The programme includes: \'b7\~\~\~the DART Underground line, a high-capacity second DART line running underground through the heart of Dublin city; \'b7\~\~\~electrification of the northern commuter line from the existing end of the DART network in Malahide on to Drogheda; \'b7\~\~\~electrification of the line from Heuston to Hazelhatch and completion of the four-tracking of this line between Inchicore and Park West; \'b7\~\~\~electrification of the line from Connolly to Maynooth, together with removal of level crossings and resignalling; \'b7\~\~\~expansion of fleet and depot facilities. It has the potential to treble the capacity of the rail network passing through the heart of Dublin, and connect all rail modes - DART, Commuter, Intercity, Luas and forthcoming Metro - together to from a truly integrated network. The project is currently being reviewed by Iarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann and the National Transport Authority to provide a lower-cost technical solution whilst retaining the essential rail connectivity. Design and planning is being advanced to ensure construction can commence after 2020, as pressure on our urban transport capacity accelerates. Airport Rail Link While not included in the recently announced capital programme, Iarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann has also proposed a DART Airport link that would see a spur off the DART line at Clongriffin to the airport, allowing direct high-capacity DARTs to operate from the airport to Dublin Connolly and Pearse Stations and the entire DART network at least every 15 minutes. It supports the European Union's policy goal of ensuring major airports are linked to the national rail network, and would also align in future into the expanded network delivered by DART Expansion. This would allow airport DARTs to operate directly to the Docklands/IFSC area; Pearse; St Stephen's Green; Christchurch and Heuston Stations in such a network, serving key business, commercial and tourism areas. For this low cost option, the alignment for the airport rail link from the airport to Clongriffin is directly underneath the main flightpath to the airport and is undeveloped, meaning construction could take place without disruption to residential or commercial interests, or to the city's existing infrastructure. It is imperative that this alignment is protected to ensure this strategic option remains available as our city develops. Demand Management Measures Iarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann has also welcomed the strong emphasis on wide ranging demand management measures contained in the draft Dublin City Council/ National Transport Authority Greater Dublin Area strategy. In particular, it is essential that there is ongoing implementation of land-use policies which support the provision of new developments in locations and at densities which enable the efficient provision of public transport services. We stand at a point of opportunity again for shaping the future of our transport services. Rail transport is ready to play its part in ensuring our economy, our planning and our future sustainability gains maximum benefit.

Supply chain optimisation can yield a significant reduction in supply chain costs as well as giving companies a competitive advantage through delivering more efficient, flexible and responsive supply chains. "Companies across all sectors now recognise that implementation of best-practice supply chain management can offer strategic differentiation," said Pat Treacy, deputy chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Ireland (CILT). "Many companies are now seeking to proactively build supply chain capability and as a result, supply chain graduates are much sought after," said Treacy. "At the recent annual End2End Supply Chain Conference 2015 held in Dublin, there was much debate among delegates about the need to generate more supply chain graduates and build greater capability in this key area." Treacy said several new developments were supporting supply chain optimisation. "These include greater focus on marketing and supply chain integration and the implementation of lean manufacturing principles right across the supply chain from external suppliers through to the customer," he said. "These initiatives will drive greater integration across all functions and liberate significant business savings which will enhance margins," said Treacy. "Business has invested heavily in information systems which have had a significant impact on organisational structure and design. This investment has supported improvement in the flow of information and cash which supports more effective decision-making in key areas." Treacy believes, however, that the business culture in many organisations does not support the full exploitation of these systems. "This needs to change and supply chain managers need to show leadership in not just using systems for competitive necessity but leveraging their use to deliver competitive advantage," he said. "Diageo Ireland, for instance, identified the adoption of a supply chain philosophy as key to developing competitive advantage within the brewing industry and invested heavily in capability development," said Treacy. According to Treacy, COP 21 [the 2015 Paris Climate Conference] will have profound implications and challenges for Ireland, particularly in agriculture and transport. "If we are to be successful, we must adopt a systemic approach as sustainability initiatives are complex. Supply chain professionals are trained to take on these challenges and can help organisations develop supply chains that adopt a sustainable biosphere approach," he said. Whilst there are a significant number of higher certificate, degree and masters degree programmes offered in many of Ireland's third-level colleges, Treacy said the Institute had identified a lack of continuous professional development (CPD) programmes in the market. "This needs to be urgently addressed if we are to continue to develop supply chain capabilities and stay on top of developments and trends," he said. The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Ireland is the international professional body for the industry. "Our role is to promote professionalism in logistics, transport and supply chain," said Treacy. "We currently deliver a Diploma in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and are actively engaged in collaborating with a third-level college in developing and delivering a new part-time degree which is aimed at working professionals," he said. "We have also sought feedback from our membership recently as to the type of CPD programmes we should deliver and we are currently developing these programmes which we intend launching in quarter two of this year." "Taking the Gartner Top 25 supply chains as a reference, we have the top-rated companies like Apple and P&G operating from Ireland," said Farrell. "Conspicuous by their absence from this top 25 are any of the pharma companies operating from Ireland and these companies will be catching up on other industries in terms of supply chain maturity during 2016." He said there was a trend towards spending less time focusing on the demand forecast. "This is heresy to many practitioners but agility and responsiveness to actual demand and supply events is the guiding principle underpinning this movement," said Farrell. "This process called Demand Driven MRP (DDMRP) requires the demand forecast to play no role in supply decisions. It can be mind-bending to run a supply chain in this way if your experience to date saw a forecast driving the plan, but we're seeing a lot of interest in this topic from Irish companies that do not have a strong tradition of accurate forecasting." Farrell said recruiters were finding it difficult to source certified planners. "There is a real shortage of certified talent and while many people end up working in supply chain, not enough is being done to educate this talent to certified levels," he said. "Government-supported Skillnets are one way of addressing this gap, so an expansion here would certainly improve Ireland's credibility as a global hub for supply chain excellence," said Farrell. IPICS, the Supply Chain Management Institute, was established in 1981 to facilitate courses, study and exams in APICS certifications. "This year, our focus will be on the creation of a Supply Chain Skillnet, raising awareness of new course areas such as DDMRP, Certification in S&OP, Certificate in Transport & Logistics, and promoting existing certifications such as CPIM and CSCP," said Farrell. With supply chain management (SCM) now widely recognised as a critical success factor for many organisations, there is a growing need for more formalised training, according to Eoin Plant, assistant head at Dublin Institute of Technology's School of Transport Engineering, Environment and Planning, which manages the National Institute for Transport & Logistics (NITL). "In contrast to other professions, a career in supply chain management and logistics tends not to develop in an orthodox way," said Plant. "You could say that traditionally many people fell into an SCM career. However, today you find higher education colleges are now offering SCM programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate level, offering a clear career path." The National Institute for Transport and Logistics (NITL) offers a full-time MSc in Supply Chain Management and a flexible part-time course that allows students to tailor their own MSc to meet their particular career requirements. "The aim of this programme is to develop the leaders of change and business improvement in all sizes and types of companies," said Plant. "It achieves this through broad-based vocational postgraduate education, providing a thorough understanding of the key elements of logistics, technology, operational management and business." \</doc>

Annual average temperatures in Ireland could rise by between 1 and 1.7C between now and the middle of the century as a result of climate change, according to a new report funded by the Environmental Protection Agency. The report also predicts that our warming climate could result in hot days in Ireland being as much as 0.7-2.6C warmer. The largest warming increases will be seen in the east of Ireland. The number of extended dry periods will increase substantially over the full year, and during autumn and winter, the report claims. The research was carried out by Irish Centre for High End Computing and University College Dublin, as well as Met \'c9ireann. It comes as representatives of the Government and non-governmental organisations prepare to travel to Paris for the UN COP21 climate change talks next week. \</doc>

Mary Robinson, the UN special envoy on climate change, has said she is optimistic that an agreement can be reached at the global summit on climate change in Paris. Former president of Ireland Mrs Robinson said she was very struck by the marked focus on the impacts of climate change on people and vulnerable societies in the addresses of leaders on the opening day of COP21 . Speaking to The Irish Times , she said she hoped that this people-centred focus would carry through to the negotiations. "I have been very struck by the emphasis on it being people-centred," she said. "President Hollande used 'climate justice', President Michelle Bachelet of Chile used 'climate justice', [indicating] a concern for the most vulnerable. "The problem is that unless those heads of State say it expressly to the delegations [from their countries], it may not carry down. We may be back to the same not-so-people-centred approach of the past." Mrs Robinson said her optimism was founded on a lot of preparation being done before this summit. She pointed to 180 countries having made commitments, in addition to further promises on climate finance. \</doc>

This year is destined for the history books with 2015 likely to be the warmest on record. It is smashing records in different regions of the globe for the driest year, wettest year, strongest tropical storm and warmest ocean temperatures. The figures, published yesterday by the World Meteorological Organisation, will provide a grim backdrop for the UN COP21 climate conference which gets underway next Monday in Paris. "This is all bad news for the planet," said the organisation's secretary general Michel Jarraud. The figures are based on data collected around the world between January and October. The numbers are so bad already that the organisation is fully confident 2015 will be warmer than any year before it. It will be one of the warmest years on record over land. China is having its warmest year on record as is South America and Asia generally. The global average sea level in the first half of 2015 was the highest since satellite observations began in 1993, the organisation said.The human-induced warming is being accentuated this year by an El Ni\'f1o warming event under way in the Pacific. \</doc>

MUCH has been made of the recently concluded COP21 talks in Paris, with those talks being cited as "the world's last chance" to put a stop to the climate change threatening us all. While it would be extreme folly to deny that the climate is warming up to the detriment of all of us (look at the remarkably warm winter we've experienced thus far, for example), some perspective is also needed on the context of the talks. Consider, for example, that in 2010, China - the world's largest producer of carbon dioxide - produced between nine and 10 billion tonnes of the stuff, which is roughly twice the output of the United States and two-and-a-half times that of the entire EU. What tangible use is it to anyone to criticise the multiplicity of low-emissions countries that exist worldwide when it's the likes of China, India and America that are the real offenders? What use is it to try to tackle global climate change through a country (or a group of countries) whose entire CO2 output, if somehow reduced to zero, would make not one bit of difference to global emissions? To try to pin the same burden on our shoulders as on China's when it comes to reducing global emissions is nonsense. KFW By email \</doc>

As the Middle East editor of Newsweek, JANINE DI GIOVANNI had come to terms with the idea that she might die in a war zone. What she wasn't prepared for, however, was the terror on the streets of her own city that brought two worlds crashing together - and made her fall in love with Paris all over again On Friday 13 November, I woke before and lay in bed thinking about weekend plans: lunches with friends, a bike ride by the Seine or Bois de Boulogne with my son. the early light crept through my curtains, I got up and prepared my chocolat chaud and tartine, before hustling him to school around corner from our flat on Rue Notre Dame des Champs in the of Paris. I love those moments walking my little boy, listening to his chatter; passing the house where Gertrude Stein once lived, the apartment where Hemingway lived with his first wife, and where many of the memories in his memoir A Moveable Feast - his love letter to Paris - were made. Then I went home, dressed quickly and rushed across the river to the Place Vend\'f4me. It was the middle of Paris Photo, the annual tribute to photography that draws some of the most gifted artists in the world to my city. It is also a time that sets offthe holiday season in Paris - lights going up all over the city, foie gras, champagne, parties, celebration, happiness. That morning, I was judging a prestigious prize and I was late. I ran up the two flights of a 17th-century building designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, so lovely that I stopped and took a photograph of the staircase. Paris is like that. Sometimes, just walking to buy bread or get on the metro, I see something so visually stunning that I have to pause and look. Thank goodness for Instagram. I have lived in Paris for 12 years, since I married a Frenchman (we are no longer together) and gave birth to our little boy. I am French by nationality now, meaning I hold a French passport and pay my taxes here. But I never really felt French until that dark Friday. Less than 24 hours later, I felt bonded to the city in a way I had never thought possible. Tragedy can do that. To believe that an attack so vile could take place in the middle of Paris was unthinkable. When it happened, and in its aftermath, Parisians stood together. The attacks all had a horrible sense of 'it could have been me ' - a slap in the face about the fragility of our own mortality. I had been to Le Petit Cambodge - one of the two restaurants attacked - just the week before, drinking beer and eating dinner with a good friend; the Bataclan was a place where I had passed happy hours listening to cool music. In early September, I had spent nine days in the H\'f4pital des Quinze-Vingts, which is on the route the killers took, so I was back and forth among those streets. I have often wondered about whether I would die in a war zone; I never thought about dying in my own city. For me, it was even more disturbing because, as Middle East editor of Newsweek, my work is centred on reporting in Iraq and Syria, and on the study of Islamic State [IS]. I am also a graduate student in international law and relations and am writing my MA thesis on the Syrian peace process. For the past four years, since I began reporting there, I have lived and breathed the Syrian conflict and the issues that go along with it: radicalisation, the rise of armed factions, terrorism. But war has always been somewhere else for me. As someone who has reported on conflicts for nearly 25 years, my only method for staying sane is to compartmentalise my work life and my home life. Home is nesting, cosy, friends, a fireplace, love, my son, food, drink, sleep, comfort. War is Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Sudan, Liberia, Chechnya, Libya, Sierra Leone. It is stories about blood, war, vengeance, hatred, murder, rape, torture, refugees, ethnic cleansing, chemical weapons, starvation as a tool of war - issues that I feel must be brought to light. But the person who wears a flak jacket and crouches when bombs go offis not the same person who makes Sunday lunch and teaches my son to appreciate Chopin. Separating the two is the only thing that has allowed me to escape the hell-onearth traumatic syndromes that some of my colleagues suffer from. But the Paris attacks changed all that. Except for a brief few months after my son was born - and I was recovering from living in Iraq and assuming that every window had the potential to be shattered by a car bomb - I have felt safe here. Paris is a place where I take the metro at midnight; where I walk home alone and never assume the worst. Paris is the Algerian fruit seller outside my door where I can leave my keys for friends to pick up if I am away and trust them entirely. Paris is the Pharmacie Stanislas across the street where I can go any time of day and know I will find the right answers. I have learned, in my dozen years here, to trust Paris. Suddenly, I felt betrayed by my own innocent trust. I have a dear French friend who last year nearly died from malaria that she caught working in South Sudan. Part of the recovery process for her was learning to trust her body again, because she felt it had betrayed her, let her down. But as she grew healthier, she told me she discovered something monumental: 'My body had not betrayed me - it saved me,' she told me. 'It did not let me die. It pulled me out of the coma I was supposed to never wake up from. I survived.' In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, I felt let down, in some sense, by my city. Where were the gaps in the security services that could allow so many people to die? Where was intelligence, when French intelligence is so strong? How had they let this slip through the cracks? But by the next week, as the city slowly came back to life - and even as I write this, weeks later, there are still checkpoints on certain streets where I have to show my ID to pass - I began to see the strength of this society. Many people, my French relatives included, lived through war and occupation, and not only survived, but learned to make the best of it. The reason I fell in love with my ex-husband (one of the many reasons) was that when I met him in Sarajevo during the siege, he taught me about a French idea called 'Syst\'c8me D', a wartime concept which means making the best of a dire situation. In Sarajevo, the French reporters always kept some saucisse and a bottle of wine tucked into their gear to supplement their humanitarian rations. It's a clich\'e9, but they always had style. A week after the attacks, my son and I finally went for that bike ride. I took my rented V\'e9lib and he took his mountain bike and we rode down through Rue de Rennes in the 6th arrondissement to the Seine. We followed the quiet, dreamy water west, seeing all the runners, families, skateboarders and sailors who had come out, almost in defiance: we are not going to let you destroy us, they seemed to say. This morning as I write, the French tricolore is still at half-mast and raw emotion remains, but there is hope for the future. The COP21 climate change conference opened today, with world leaders from 140 countries arriving in Paris, not afraid of terror. I still look at the photos of the dead from that awful night and well up with tears because I know they are someone's daughter, someone's son, someone's loved one - who will never come home again. The horror of terrorism is that it always strikes innocents. But Paris is resilient. Paris will survive and go on. We will not forget, but we will continue. It's part of what makes France great. Le Petit Cambodge, the restaurant where so many died, posted a notice on its website that the restaurant would open out of solidarity: 'Because life must go on, out of respect for the customers who were here that night. Not to reopen would be to give in and concede a victory [for IS].' On Facebook, friends wrote of going to parties where they 'dragged their feet because they did not want to leave their houses'. But when they got there, they sang, drank, danced, smoked and made their own little victory over terrorism. Hearing all the stories made me incredibly proud. I have had my French passport for many years, but for the first time, I felt truly bonded to this place. It is interesting to note that Hemingway's A Moveable Feast topped the bestseller lists here in the wake of the attacks. It is a classic memoir of Paris, but one that perhaps had been forgotten until now. It tells the story of Hemingway's love affair with this city, and I think people are buying it because they, too, are falling in love with Paris, all over again.

US stymied at home A lot of the attention at the talks has been about the "blocking" nations. They are those who want no substantive deal, just a minimalist agreement that won't affect the status quo. Most of these are oil-producing countries, the leader of which is Saudi Arabia. It has blocked most of the meaningful proposals, including a strong scientific review that said that 1.5 degrees and not 2 degrees should be the maximum increase in global temperatures. But there is another blocking constituency, and they are not present at the talks: the Republican Party in the US. While Barack Obama has made climate change a signature of his second presidential term, the Grand Old Party, which controls Congress, has tried to impede him at every turn. In the past week, two pieces of legislation were obstructed by Republicans. It's not helped by the fact that most of the front-runners in the Republican presidential race are climate-change sceptics. None more so than Donald Trump. A typically classy tweet from him in January 2014 read: "This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullst has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps, and our GW scientists are stuck in ice." He tackled Obama again this week, portraying his comparison of climate change and terrorism as "the dumbest thing I've heard in politics". That's a bit rich coming from Trump the Chump. Tweets of the day Lots of celebrities knocking around COP21 in Paris this week, but the king of the A-listers is still Leonardo DiCaprio. Here is a fan tweet from a starry-eyed teenager called Christiana Figueres: With my #climate hero @LeoDiCaprio at # COP21 .

French climate activists have carried out an unusual bank heist, stealing chairs from two bank branches in a protest linked to the upcoming Paris talks on fighting global warming. The group said it will use the chairs to organise a "citizens' summit" on social and environmental issues during the COP 21 climate negotiations, which will bring world leaders and tens of thousands of others to the French capital later this month. Activist Txetx Etcheverry said the group has "reclaimed" 196 chairs in a series of similar bank jobs in recent weeks. During Thursday's stunt, BNP Paribas branch manager Cyril Hamer stood by and watched, saying "let's just go with the flow and let them finish this peacefully". \</doc>

THE expansion of the dairy industry will add to the challenges of meeting the country's climate change targets, the Taoiseach has warned. Enda Kenny flagged that growth in the agricultural sector will have to be monitored in light of the agreements from COP 21 in Paris. "Obviously we want to get full value for our agricultural land and our forestry," Mr Kenny said. Targets "The targets will be set for each country in a short period," he said. "We will be able to meet our targets but it is going to provide a real challenge." IFA national chair Jer Bergin said farmers were facing severe volatility and farm incomes must be the "number one" priority under the Food Wise 2025 targets to drive Irish exports. \</doc>

Mary Robinson's contributions to Ireland will be celebrated at an awards ceremony tonight. The former head of the United Nations Kofi Annan has flown into Dublin to pay tribute to her work as a lawyer, activist, statesperson and her current role as Climate Change Envoy. Previous recipients of the Business and Finance awards are George Mitchell and John Major. Publisher Ian Hyland has said it is a significant occasion: "Both Mary Robinson and Kofi Annan last week closed out COP 21 and the agreement there in Paris at the UN climate change so much and their next engagement is in Dublin, and both will speak, "Kofi Annan will present Mary Robinson with the outstanding contribution to Ireland and Mary Robinson will speak on accepting that. "I think it is incredibly significant and puts the event on an International platform." \</doc>

THE climate change phenomenon means that everyone everywhere is looking for new ways to fine-tune energy use. And spearheading this worldwide revolution is a major EU-funded home-energy project called RealValue - set up by an Irish consortium led by billion-euro business Glen Dimplex. The results of the Irish project, which will come out over the next three years, are set to have a massive international and economic impact. Exactly 1,250 homes in Ireland, Germany and Latvia will have cutting-edge Glen Dimplex electrical storage systems installed in them as part of the project. The aim is then to demonstrate how these small-scale energy-storage systems can provide benefits to the whole electricity supply chain, from generation to distribution and from suppliers down to the consumers. Sean O'Driscoll, chief executive of Glen Dimplex - which is the world's largest manufacturer of domestic heating appliances - says the energy revolution is here and now it's just a matter of joining all the dots across the various industries. "We are selling Quantum (the electric heating and storage system being rolled out in 1,250 homes) and have been selling Quantum for the last three years as a heating device which has a 27pc lower running cost (than its predecessor). "So we're already selling the unit on that basis and that's a standalone basis and we have sold 80,000 of them between the UK and Ireland over the last three years," said Mr O'Driscoll, proving that the results of the RealValue project will be able to stand up on their two feet in economic terms. The RealValue project has a total of 13 partners on board, including energy economists from UCD and businesses from both the public and private sector. The Glen Dimplex CEO explained: "What this project is now about is saying we now want to take the technology to the next level, we know we have a very good heating system which is operating in isolation from the overall energy ecosystem. "We're now saying with connectivity, with digital connectivity, we can bring all of this together and provide it as a service to the electricity industry. "That's 1,250 homes, that's what those business models are and within that there are about eight or 10 different income streams that can be generated out of that which can be passed on, part of it, to the consumer." The results of the project can be divided into two parts, between the customer running their home off the electricity grid and then the industry, which is supplying the energy and ensuring its distribution. "The customer is getting a much more controllable and a much more energy-efficient system and the running cost for a Quantum heater relative to its predecessor is a 27pc reduction, so there's a real, real tangible saving. "It's completely controllable and you can also control it over an app. You're bringing a better solution to the home and you're bringing a cheaper solution to the home. "Then the second side of all of this is, if you aggregate a population of homes, which is the 1,250 that we're talking about in this project, you can provide that as an energy store for the electricity system. "There are times during the day, in the winter particularly, where it's very windy, and there's too much electricity coming onto the system. "You can now find a home for that and when it's surplus to requirement it's cheaper, because after putting up the turbine, the costs are minimal. The wind is for free. "So you're providing a balancing system to the grid operator and that is of real value to the grid operator and that will reflect itself in a better tariff and a better pricing structure for the customer," he explained. "There is very, very significant industry collaboration here in Ireland. So you look across the 13 members that we have, we have EirGrid, which is the grid operator in Ireland, we have ESB Networks, which is the networks operator, we have SSE Electricity, which is an energy provider. "Now that would be unheard of to be able to get the sector together, to get that together in another country would be virtually impossible. We are able to do that here in Ireland. "It's five years of very, very hard work. At a very early stage, we would say EirGrid, ESB Networks and SSE Electricity got this immediately." Another key player to come on board was Intel, bringing the project to a whole other level of applicability. "The other thing we love about this is, we got an absolutely cold-call from Intel research, [in] November 2011. "They knew why they were making the call, they heard it in Brussels that we were working on something very significant in this area," explains Mr O'Driscoll about how the technology giant became involved. "They were building out a gateway technology platform for electric vehicles and concluded that there wouldn't be a population of electric vehicles to deliver what they wanted any time soon, so they were looking to see how could they deploy this technology into something that would be available quickly and then they heard of our heating technology and they approached us to see if we wanted to work with them." By the time Intel came on board, it meant that RealValue now had indigenous Irish industries (Glen Diplex) working alongside the country's largest foreign direct investor (Intel), as well as ESB and EirGrid from the public sector and then the UCD Energy Research Centre. And the parties promise to have the results of RealValue as soon as possible, so that it can be implemented and rolled out into the real world. "We're looking here at a three-year project, we are six months into the project and we won't be waiting until the very end to find out the lessons from this. "As we're going along, we're getting information and using information and we're moving along our business model. "So this is not waiting for the big bang at the end of the three years, this is a progressive learning process and as we're doing it. "We will then be using that to put that platform over all of the houses that currently have the heaters installed," Mr O'Driscoll said. Furthermore, this project is something the whole world is keeping an eye on, and it is not just a project relevant to a small island on the fringe of Europe. The island just happens to be the perfect research ground for it. "This has international opportunities. We will be working on this concept everywhere from Tasmania through to Nova Scotia. Word gets out. This actually has international appeal and opportunity. Ireland is at the forefront of this. "The wonderful thing about Ireland is, we actually have it in the era of energy that we're heading into, and we're only at a very, very early stage of it. "Ireland being an island with very little connectivity, hugely dependent on fossil fuels historically, it throws up all of the problems that this industry will have worldwide and those problems can be studied, they can be researched and the solutions found, which not only have relevance to Ireland but to the UK, to Germany, to France," explained the Glen Dimplex CEO. Key figures from countries like Spain and Portugal are already seeking to speak to the leaders of the RealValue project, because they have the "same problems." So will Ireland be home to the world's next Silicon Valley, having spearheaded this international home-energy project? "I would be very hopeful that the answer to your question, 30 years from now, is that we look back at it and say, 'Ireland was at the forefront of this,'" answers Mr O'Driscoll. Right now, however, Denmark and not Ireland is at the forefront of renewable energy consumption, something that has benefited the country's economy too. "The country that we think has the best energy policy in the whole world at this time is Denmark. Denmark has a national policy of saying that by 2050, it will be completely independent of fossil fuels, irrespective of the price. "They've already started the process of getting there and if you look at the Danish economy over the last 15 years it's grown by about 40pc, and its energy consumption has been reduced by 18pc. "So again to the people who say, £ll this does is over-layer the consumer, the customer, the industry with costs,' they're wrong. Denmark has the policy and framework that we can all look at and say, 'that's the way to do it,'" explained Mr O'Driscoll. Other people who he believes are 'wrong' are those stockbrokers and detractors who say that the green energy industry is a long time off being economically sustainable, aside from government grants. "Well firstly I would say to the stockbrokers, if they were saying that to me, I would say, 'you're wrong, the technology is there.' "All the parts are there from a technology point of view, it is connecting the parts. "So the technology is there, the connectivity will be there very, very quickly," said the CEO. In terms of Ireland, where a whopping 52pc of homes are oil-heated, it seems like it would take a long, long time before the results of the RealValue project could be implemented here. Europe will have to push us on. "Europe has set a 2050 target to electrify heat and transport. If we were sitting here in 2025 or 2030, I think we'd be having a very different conversation. "This is not something that's going to happen overnight, this is the start of a journey and we are at a very early stage in the journey," said Mr O'Driscoll. And perhaps he is right, considering that no less than 195 countries at COP21 (conference of parties) in Paris this month agreed to a landmark deal. These countries, Ireland included, aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will limit the global average temperature to rise "well below" 2C (3.6F) compared to pre-industrial levels - 2C is a level of warming that is deemed to be the point when dangerous climate change could threaten life on Earth.

CLIMATE change and renewable energy are phrases long-associated with tree-hugging non-capitalist types, but in 2015, if you follow the money even in Ireland, you'll find business people are investing billions of euro in the new green sector. They're investing in companies that manufacture things such as solar panels, wind turbines and LED lighting. They're funding firms that build wind farms and companies that are developing software to run more efficient energy grids. In short, climate change is a reality and we appear to be in the middle of an energy revolution - the catalyst perhaps being the Paris climate conference, which ends this Friday. For the first time in history the world is on the cusp of having a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change thanks to the UN summit in Paris, known as the COP21 (Conference of Parties). This potential agreement, which US President Barack Obama is strongly backing, coupled with the fact that the creation of some renewable energy sources is as cheap, if not cheaper, than more traditional supplies such as oil and gas, means the green sector is now attracting major investment. "If you look at the next generation of investors they're very pro-environment. There is a trend to invest in companies that support society," said Chantal Brennan, the chief investment officer (CIO) with Davy Asset Management. "The UN principles for responsible investment are an important part of how we think about things," added Ms Brennan, referring to the investment approach taken at Davy. In terms of environmental investments, "directionally it's the right thing to do", she added. "People want to do the right thing by the next generation. We're all members of the global community." One Dublin fund has (EURO)1.5bn of its clients' money invested in green equities For the time being she feels that government subsidies are still needed in some cases to get companies off the ground in the green sector and in time to take these away, hopefully leaving the firms standing on their own two feet. One 'green fund' in Dublin, run by Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), has (EURO)1.5bn of client money invested in environmental equities. So where exactly should investors place their money and what are the incumbents that currently stand in the way of this energy revolution? Kleinwort Benson's chief investment officer Noel O'Halloran points to a few areas in which people are currently investing. "Wind, solar, hydro are the three renewable energies, within wind you have turbine manufacturers. So from an investment point of view you have Vestas Wind Systems, they're a Danish company, and then you've wind farm operators, you've one called Gamesa, which is a big Spanish company. "The other big area then is solar. There's a value chain there as much as anywhere else and the leaders would be a company called SunPower, which is probably the highest, most efficient manufacturer of solar panels globally. "There are also very low-cost, very efficient Chinese manufacturers. There's a company called Trina Solar and one called Canadian Solar - even though it's actually a Chinese manufacturer," said Mr O'Halloran. "There's an increasing amount of dedicated money. We have in our environmental fund today about (EURO)1.5bn of client money invested in environmental equities from a Dublin point of view," Mr O'Halloran told the Sunday Independent. For years, investors and big businesses have been extremely slow to back this sector but now 'grid-parity' means that the green industry is standing on its own two feet. Grid-parity is a technical term meaning 'on par' - in other words, the generation of some renewable energies is as cheap, if not cheaper than the extraction and roll-out of oil or gas extraction. "For instance today, wind energy in Eastern Brazil and solar energy in Northern Chile is cheaper than traditional energy sources. "In India, where almost 400m people have no access to electricity, heavily polluting diesel generators account for the bulk of electricity. Solar is emerging as a cost-effective and cleaner energy source especially in areas where there is no electrical grid," reads the KBI white paper on energy solutions. Furthermore, the cost of solar panels has reduced by 75pc since 2008. But it's not just in renewable energy where the investible opportunities are emerging. Technologies such as super batteries and LED lighting are creating an economic stir too. But the KBI white paper states that a breakthrough in battery technology is needed before the mass electric vehicle market will be penetrated. "We expect lithium ion battery costs to decline rapidly through the latter half of this decade and this will result in heightened investor interest," reads the paper. Mr O'Halloran added that the general consumer demand to save money on domestic energy bills and cut down on carbon emissions is driving these investible opportunities too. "A spectrum that's increasingly important is on the demand side, the energy efficiency side; how you cut down on the demand. And there is an incredible number of interesting companies coming into it. "One is transport efficiency, this is where you're getting smart cars, electric cars. Obviously the leader there is Tesla, an Elon Musk company. That's very alive and real. "The other one is building efficiency, so if you just look at Ireland every [new] house is now going to be A-rated, so [you have] things like Kingspan. Kingspan is actually a global leader, one of the few Irish companies I'd put into this universe, with the roof panels they're manufacturing that are going into A-rated homes. "Another massive area of growth is LED lighting for homes, so your incandescent lightbulbs - they're going, ultimately," said Mr O'Halloran. Backing this up is the fact that in 2015, Tesla is expected to offer a next version car for sale to the masses with a price tag of $35,000. This is compared with their first one a number of years ago that had a retail price of around $120,000. Globally, three key statistics support all of these green sector developments and claims. Firstly, according to a 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report, global energy demand is expected to grow by 33pc by 2030. Following on from this, 90pc of this growth will come from emerging market countries. That's according to a Bank of America Merrill THE CATWALK CALLS ON WORLD LEADERS TO MAKE PARIS WORK THE chief executives of seven top clothing companies, including H&M, Gap and Adidas, are calling on governments to agree a strong climate change deal, saying they fear global warming will drive up their costs. Almost 200 nations are meeting in Paris until December 11, trying to work out a deal to limit a rise in temperatures blamed on increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. "We come together to acknowledge that climate change is harming the world in which we operate," read the joint declaration, which was also signed by the heads of Levi Strauss, Burton Snowboards, Eileen Fisher and VF Corp, which owns Timberland. "Climate change mitigation and technological innovation are vital to the health and well-being of those who make and use our products, as well as to the future supply of materials needed to make [them]," they added. Finally the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that, of the $37 trillion currently needed for energy supply infrastructure, $16.9 trillion will need to be invested in power generation, transmission and distribution. More than 75pc of this investment will be in renewable generation, higher capacity and more efficient transmission and distribution systems. "Clearly there's a revolution going on here, it's just hitting the mainstream now. "I think it's really been accelerating in the last three to five years, but its genesis is back 15 years ago. "Economically it makes sense. The green movement wasn't seen as capitalist [before]. Whether [investors] believe in green or not doesn't matter, it's not an either or, it's that it makes sense," he added. According to Mr O'Halloran, KBI's email inbox went into overdrive last week after President drive up costs by harming cotton production. Faced with criticism that the fashion industry helps fuel a wasteful, throw-away culture, companies such as H&M and Adidas have been trying to improve their environmental credentials by launching products made from recycled materials. The apparel industry accounts for 10pc of global carbon emissions, with more than 150 billion garments produced every year, according to Zady, a fashion website that seeks to encourage consumers to buy fewer, higher-quality garments produced in a more sustainable way. The seven executives said they hoped the Paris deal would ensure net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century and that it would include assurances that national climate commitments are strengthened every five years, starting in 2020. The declaration included no new commitments from the companies themselves on how they plan to help reach those aims. Emma Thomasson Obama's comments on climate change at the Paris summit - proving that investors are listening to world leaders and industry regulators. "We still need a Paris agreement," President Obama said. "So my main focus is making sure that the United States is a leader in bringing a successful agreement home." The US President added that rising seas and warming climates could be a drain on economic resources. "This is an economic and security imperative that we have to tackle now," he said. However, even if investors listened to him, the US House of Representatives last week acted against his comments. Just hours after President Obama verbally pushed the world for an international agreement to halt climate change, the US House of Representatives voted to block his effort, showing that the Obama didn't have support in his own country. The House passed a pair of resolutions that would prevent the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from implementing measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Green investment experts hope that the Paris conference will prove to be the long-awaited catalyst to spark the energy revolution, but if the House of Representatives' actions are anything to go by, it may be unlikely. "It's not a sexy area yet. It would be an area that people would like to invest in. There are too many hurdles at the moment. If the use of the power of the renewable is cheaper, that's what it boils down to - hardcore economics. Obama can bang his drum until he's blue in the face. There has to be some major catalyst. At the minute it isn't attractive," said the insider. However, Mr O'Halloran would argue against that belief based on what is physically visible on the roads and in the fields of our own country. "There is a revolution going on and I think you'll look back in 10 or 20 years time and say 'my God, things really were changing.' "If you go around Ireland you'll see wind farms, you'll see solar panels, you'll see batterypowered cars and you'll see LED lighting in your homes," he said. The climate change conference is to end this Friday, historic game-changing agreement or not. Right now, the main thesis is that it is difficult to achieve any legally binding document at an international level. Regardless, that (EURO)1.5bn 'green fund' in Dublin says a lot. \</doc>

I don't know who wrote the signs along the road that goes from Bhutan's international airport, at Paro, to Thimphu, the tiny capital, but like almost everything in this remote Himalayan kingdom they are distinctly memorable. "Don't be a gama in the land of lama," the most original one instructs. Translation: Don't drive crazily in the land of Buddha. Other road-safety rhyming couplets include "Drive slow to avoid grave below," "Faster spells disaster" and "On the bend go slow friend." Paro Airport has one big and thoroughly stirring arrival route - through the Himalayas, with bonus views of Everest - one small airstrip in a breathtakingly gorgeous valley, and one small baggage carousel. The population of Bhutan is about 700,000, and the best road is that between the airport and Thimphu, 50km away. It's one of very few that is surfaced and the only one that appears to have clearly designated lanes. Hence the road signs, which are there to warn locals to slow down on a near-irresistible stretch of fast going in a country where elsewhere it takes hours to travel a few score kilometres. High value, low volume I have a driver and a guide because that's the rule for international tourists. This has been the policy since 1974, when Bhutan first opened to foreign tourists with a "high value, low volume" ethos. It was probably the only country actively seeking low numbers of visitors, albeit high-spending ones. Its visas are inexpensive, and Bhutan does not limit the number it issues, but it does impose a daily tariff. This fixes the cost of travel for international tourists and so keeps visitor numbers low. In high season the tariff is $250 (EUR 230) a day and in low season $200 (EUR 185), with supplements for travelling with fewer than two other visitors. The tariff covers your guide, driver, accommodation and meals. In 1974, 287 tourists visited. By 2008 that number had risen to 27,000 international tourists and 12,000 regional ones (which is to say people from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives, who do not have to pay the daily tariff) . On any scale, those figures are minuscule. In 2014 Ireland received 7.3 million tourists, a figure the industry is continuously trying to increase. Attracting more tourists has long been seen as good for an economy, including our own, but Bhutan has always aimed for something radically different. The Bhutan I arrive in in December is not very different from what those first tourists in 1974 would have experienced. True, wifi is almost everywhere, but the distinctive square houses are still built in the traditional way, and there are no advertisements, international franchises or western clothing chains to be seen. Many people still wear national dress, some of it woven by hand, and the landscape remains pristine. There is no McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC or Subway. Bhutan has a royal family, and the monarch, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, is called the dragon king. The kingdom is known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon or, sometimes, after the Tibetan paradise in James Hilton's novel , as the Last Shangri-La. The royal family is revered and respected, if singular. The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who ruled between 1972 and 2006, has four wives, all sisters, whom he married on the same day. I see the four sisters' beautiful hand-woven wedding kiras in the textile museum in Thimphu. The fifth king says that Jetsun Pema, whom he married in 2011, when he was 31 and his bride was 21, will be his only wife. Their striking wedding photograph, showing them in yellow traditional royal dress, seems to be on the wall of every public space, with blown-up versions near many temples and in many town centres. Last November they announced that their first child, a son, will be born in February - and Bhutan rejoiced for a day and a night. Zebra crossings The only daily publication in Bhutan is Kuensel , an English-language paper of between eight and 12 pages. One day in December it carries a press release from the Royal Bhutan Police about the recently introduced zebra crossings in Thimphu - reputed to be the only capital city without traffic lights. The press release explains how pedestrians and motorists should behave at the zebra crossings: pedestrians have been lingering on their phones at some crossings, and motorists have failed to stop at others. "We feel saddened to hear about such inconveniences," it says, "but it is apparently happening because this is a new initiative. As time passes by, we expect people to be more aware about how to cross the Zebra Crossing." I cannot think of another capital city where such instructions would be needed in a national paper. After its four-decade experiment in moderating the number of tourists visiting it, Bhutan is undergoing a change that some fear may result in more tourism and damage the country's so-far-unspoilt culture. In 2006 the fourth king, who had initiated the "high value, low volume" tourism policy, abdicated in favour of his eldest son and declared that he wanted Bhutan to make the transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy with a multiparty democracy. This was a highly unusual step in the absence of public pressure, lobbying or unrest, and one for which he was much admired. Bhutan held its first general election in 2008. Since then the monarchy has had an essentially symbolic role. Also since then there has been much discussion within the government about developing tourism. In 2009 the "high value, low volume" policy was changed to "high value, low impact". The government now has a target for attracting international tourists - it hopes to see 100,000 a year. By 2014 the number had reached 65,480. It's still a low figure, but it had more than doubled in only six years. The question nobody can answer is: how much will Bhutan change as a result of developing its tourism industry? During my stay the word that comes to my mind every day is "pristine". There is no other word to describe a country whose natural landscape has been so carefully conserved and is so consistently beautiful. Bhutan is like most countries in having specific destinations on its so-called tourist trail. Here they include the impossibly photogenic Tiger's Nest or Taktsang Palphug monastery, the country's most sacred site, which is built into the side of a mountain that tourists and monks hike to daily from Paro. But Bhutan is different in that the entire country is a destination in itself. The built and natural environments remain so astonishingly unspoiled by development that pretty much anywhere in the country will reward you equally. Bhutan's heritage is also unspoiled. For example, many people still wear national dress every day. Men wear a gho , which is a kind of woollen belted kimono; women wear a kira , a long wrap-around skirt, with a short jacket; and many children wear miniature versions. Paro and Thimphu have almost as many little fabric shops selling the makings of ghos and kiras as they have shops selling hand weavings and prayer wheels to tourists. Native forest At COP21 All those deep, dense forests again bring fairy tales to mind. Trees wash across the mountains and valleys like the waves of a green ocean. Depending on the elevation, there are forests of fir, pine, spruce, cedar, cypress, magnolia, oak and laurel. The trees shelter countless species of wildlife, among them the rare snow leopard, common leopards, tigers, yaks, blue sheep, wolves, Himalayan black bears, red pandas and 770 types of bird. The forests of Bhutan are one of the last remaining great areas of biodiversity, and surely deserving of World Heritage status. The lack of pollution results in crystalline air that gives you the impression of having preternaturally good eyesight, as you can see across vast distances as if you were a kind of human hawk. Lichen, which usually grows elsewhere as a thin fuzz around branches, is an indication of clean air; here, hanks of it hang from every tree at altitude, like unspun skeins of wool. Then there are the festivals, the temples and the monasteries that permeate every part of Bhutan's Buddhist life and culture. Prayer flags fly over bridges and between trees. Clusters of white prayer flags, in memory of the dead, stand like herded ghosts on mountainsides. Wherever there is water there will be a tiny building housing a water-powered prayer wheel, which tings every 15 seconds or so. Each monastery or temple is revered for a different reason. Every town of size has a dzong , a complex of buildings housing both a monastery and local government buildings: Buddhism is stitched into every part of life. National sport Archery is Bhutan's national sport, and each of its 20 districts has a team. They regularly hold competitions, with finals in Thimphu. The prizes are televisions, mobile phones or fridges. Competitions can go on for days, and every archery ground I see around the country is being used. I spend part of an afternoon watching a competition in Thimphu. The 11 archers in each team use simple bows and arrows, aiming for a target, 140m away, that I can barely see, let alone make out the markings on. Although I am standing alongside the archers I cannot see arrows' trajectory from bow to board, as they travel so fast. After a while I sit halfway down the field and stare straight ahead until, finally, I glimpse the bamboo slivers passing by, high in the air, shooting past like furious little comets. Despite the astonishing distance, a number of archers hit the target. Every time this happens their team-mates at the opposite end of the field do a shuffling victory dance in front of the board - a kind of Himalayan haka. Bhutanese archery is a mesmerising, almost medieval-looking sport to watch against the backdrop of dramatic mountains. But although Bhutan is almost ridiculously picturesque it is not a museum, a film set nor a country whose culture or people are fossilised. My guide, Tashi Tschering, for instance, wears national dress, believes in evil spirits, danced and celebrated in the streets of Paro all night when the impending royal birth was announced, and throughout our time together sucks for hours on rock-hard, machete-cut chunks of smoked yak cheese to try to stop his nicotine pangs now that he has given up cigarettes. He also wears Ray-Bans, carries an iPhone and studied commerce at Chandigarh University, in India. Undercutting prices Bhutan has more than 1,700 tour operators - anyone can set themselves up as a tour company. For international tourists the daily tariff is the same no matter which company you choose. On the other side of this transaction, however, it is different. A story in Kuensel Until 18 months ago Phobjikha Valley had just one hotel. There are now five, with a sixth large hotel - being built by the tour company I booked with, my guide tells me - under construction. Commercialism is now firmly entwined with tourism in Bhutan. Dawa Penjor favours retaining the daily tariff to help protect Bhutan's unique culture from mass tourism. "The media is the most important thing in Bhutan right now," he says. The kingdom has fewer than 200 journalists, most of them at one of its five radio stations. There are 11 newspapers, but all except Kuensel are weekly and contain little hard news. As Penjor points out, it's a potentially exciting and challenging new era for the media in Bhutan. In the past the decisions of the absolute monarchy went unquestioned. Now that the country is a democracy it has an opportunity to step back from its traditional respect for authority and to question ordinary fellow citizens - which is to say elected members of government - about important decisions such as the planned development of tourism. Are any of the government, for instance, associated with hotels, guest houses or any of the 1,700 tour companies? This would be an obvious conflict of interest, and an association that would clearly profit by the presence of more tourists. If there are links, that important story remains to be written in Bhutan, where investigative journalism does not yet exist. What is evident is how successful Bhutan has been in its brave experiment to control its tourist numbers: the country remains unspoiled. Its unique culture is intact and authentic: a rare combination in a world of globalisation. Long may it remain so. \</doc>

ANNIVERSARY The year gone was, to some extent, all about the year to come. Preparations for the centenary of the 1916 Rising got under way during the year, with all manner of planned ceremonies, commemorative books and various movie and TV portrayals all set up. [media=bbw]2518476[/media] On September 18, a state funeral took place in Cork for Thomas Kent, the only man to be executed outside of Dublin following the Rising. Kent had been buried in the grounds of Collins barracks, and it was deemed time that he be given a proper burial in his hometown of Castlelyons. On the political front, the split has already occurred, with Fianna F\'e1il and Sinn F\'e9in announcing during the year that they would hold their own commemorations. A taste of things to come was presented on August 1 with an event to mark the 100th anniversary of the funeral of O Donovan Rossa, the event at which P\'e1draig Pearse s oration singled him out as a serious dude. The President, Taoiseach and various dignitaries all attended. A few hours later, Sinn F\'e9in held its own re-enactment of the funeral complete with period costumes and all that jazz. Expect more jockeying for position to claim the mantle of real inheritor of the fallen leaders Ireland in the year to come. [media=bbw]2519070[/media] BROOKLYN The Irish movie of the year according to the critics and the box office. Saoirse Ronan (above right) plays the lead role in the film adaptation of Colm Toib\'edn s novel about emigration from Wexford in the 1950s. Ronan s performance has attracted much speculation about the possibility of Oscar action, but it remains to be seen whether this weepie from the oul country makes waves among the movie people on the west coast of the USA. Typical of the gushing reaction was that in the British Daily Telegraph, which said the director John Crowley managed to achieve something close to a miracle the kind of old fashioned shivers-down-the-spine serendipity that s hushed and special and can t be taught . CLERY S On June 12 the 350 staff at the iconic Dublin store were given 30 minutes to pack up and leave the building. The store had been sold and the new owners had new ideas for an enterprise that resonated with old Ireland. Trading had not been going well for at least a decade. Shopping habits had changed. Yet many felt that Cleary s could have a future with a little tweeking. The big issue was the treatment of staff. Some had worked there for more than 40 years. Many of them had come out and worked to save the store during a flood in 2013. Now they were simply being told they were excess to requirements, that a property ploy was in train and would they kindly clear off. For many, the episode was a searing example of modern capitalism. DONALD TRUMP This guy is the business, all hair and hot air and a capacity to tap into the basest instinct among a particular type of American. The Donald, as he is known, bought Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare in 2014 and arrived here like the Pope, greeted on the Shannon tarmac by a band of musicians and the minister for finance. In 2015 he concentrated on his race for the US presidency, outpolling a whole field of contenders for the nomination for the Republican party. The scary prospect that he could one day be US president is no longer a joke. At the very least, he is currently on track to get the nomination. Over the year he has managed to outrage by blaming Mexicans for US economic woes and suggesting in the wake of the Paris attacks that all Muslims in the US should be recorded on a database. He also managed to mock a reporter with a disability, just to show what a tough guy he is. On the upside, if he does become president, he is likely to retreat to Doonbeg for a little R&R, which will give our government the opportunity to bow and scrape before him on a regular basis. ENVIRONMENT Flash Gordon never had it this bad in his attempts to save the universe. Climate change kept coming at us throughout 2015, but as the curtain came down on the year the nations of the world gathered to join battle. The COP21 climate change conference in Paris went through some tortured negotiations before finally coming to an agreement to decarbonise as much as possible over the next decade. Among the world leaders in attendance was Enda Kenny, who gave a rousing speech about our responsibility to the planet, and soon after demounting the podium he explained to Irish reporters that this country would require a major derogation due to our reliance on agriculture. This may be the best little country in the world in which to do business, but as far as the environment is concerned, there s no getting away from farting cows. FENNELLY REPORT The report by Judge Niall Fennelly into the departure from office of former garda commissioner Martin Callinan was published on September 1. This could have been a banana skin for the Taoiseach. Did he, like a tin pot dictator, sack the police chief for political expediency? Not really, said Fennelly in a report notable for its Jesuitical nuances. No record had been kept of a meeting in April 2014 where the commissioner s fate was sealed. It is beyond argument that good administration would require that a proper record be kept of such an important decision. In effect, the report gave the Taoiseach enough cover to claim that he didn t sack Callinan, although he created the conditions to induce Callinan to sniff the wind and take a hike. One way or the other, the public gave the Taoiseach a pass on the matter. A man with his folksy smile and clumsy charm would never cut mustard as a tinpot dictator. GREECE On January 26, the left-wing coalition known as Syriza was elected to government in Greece, a country that was drowning in austerity. Led by Alexis Tsipras (below right, the party promised to tell the EU and ECB to clear off with their austerity. We don t want your bail-outs no more was the general message. The new departure was greeted with glee by the Left in Irish politics, which had long claimed that the Government should have talked as tough with the European powers that be. Gerry Adams had once said that the troika should be told to leave with their bail-out cash. Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis duly toured Europe, lecturing one and all that they had a moral duty to slash Greece s debt. Morality was on their side, but unfortunately they left the diplomacy at home. The result was another bailout with more onerous conditions, and a split. Tsipras returned to power in September after calling a general election, but Yanis split on his high-power motorbike, en route to the high moral ground. At year s beginning Syriza was all the rage among the left in Ireland. By year s end it was Sip what? Naah, never heard of them. HOUSING The year saw the housing problem balloon out of control. By December, around 80 families a month were becoming homeless in Dublin. In Cork, the Penny Dinners organisation had noticed a seven fold increase in those seeking its service over the last few year. Much of this was foretold. In a recent interview Sr Stanislaus Kennedy of Focus Ireland outlined how the housing charity saw what was down the tracks. In 2012, Focus Ireland informed the Government that families were at a tipping point with eight families becoming homeless every month. And in 2013 that number had risen to 20 every month. Last year 40 families were becoming homeless and now 70 families a month are, she said. The Government was concentrating on making the country the best little whorehouse in the world, sorry, the best little country in which to do business. Measures to alleviate the crisis have been announced, but it s going to drag on or a few years, leaving the current government with its most damning legacy. INVINCIBLE: THE CORK\~LADIES FOOTBALL TEAM It was the year when the Rebelettes went where few teams have ever gone before winning five All-Irelands in a row. The team beat Dublin by two points in a tightly contested final on September 27 in front of a crowd of over 31,083, a record for a woman s sports event in Europe. This was the team s second five-in-a-row and their 10th title in 11 years. [media=bbw]2522573[/media] On the night after the victory captain Ciara O Sullivan led the team to the South Mall in the city where they were greeted by hundreds of supporters. Manager Eamon Ryan paid the ultimate tribute to his winning charges. Over the past 12 years I ve been blessed to be working, not so much with great footballers as brilliant people, they are genuine and hard working and although some of the nearly rattle when they walk with all the medals, they don t have an ounce of eiri in airde about them. Fair play. JONAH LOMU The man who dragged rugby into popular culture died tragically on November 18. Lomu, the youngest ever All Black, was an iconic figure. Built like a second row forward with the speed of a gazelle, he burst into public consciousness at the 1995 World Cup when he scored four tries against England. [media=bbw]2552092[/media] He was forced to retire early due to a serious kidney condition. Off the pitch he was as warm and humble as he was fearsome on it. He died at the age of 40 soon after arriving home from last summer s World Cup in England. A major question haunted his departure over whether or not he should have been on a long-haul flight in light of his condition. Then, in a desperately sad postscript, it turned out that Lomu had been practically broke when he died. [media=bbw]2552998[/media] KAPUT Tony O Reilly was once the richest man in Ireland, but he was much more than that. A dashing rugby player and international business figure, he epitomised the aspirations of a nation that still suffered from an inferiority complex. Before leaving the state sector for corporate America he was also responsible for the setting up of the Kerrygold butter label, which remains a calling card for Bord Bia to this day. On November 21, O Reilly was declared bankrupt in the Bahamas, where he has a home. Earlier in the year he suffered the indignity of Irish banks moving in on his assets, including his main home in Castlemartin, Co Kildare, where his parents are buried. It was a spectacular fall for somebody with his record. In financial terms, he had flown too close to the sun for far too long. His downfall was largely attributable to ploughing good money after bad into Waterford Wedgewood in the belief that the company could be turned around. LONGBOAT QUAY In January this newspaper reported about the extreme safety measures that had to be taken in the Longboat Quay development in Dublin s docklands. Fire marshals were patrolling the 298 unit blocks 24/7 in order to allow residents remain in their homes. Further investigation uncovered that the building itself was a fire-trap, built in a dangerous and sub standard manner at the height of the building boom. It took until September before the residents and owners were given the full picture. Urgent work would have to be carried out in order to render the building safe. It was going to cost around 5m, and they who had bought homes in good faith, were expected to stump up. Since then, all parties have been in and out of court, Dublin Fire Brigade has served a fire notice demanding that the work be started, and still no resolution has been found. Longboat Quay is probably the worst example of the kind of building standards that pertained during the building bubble, and how the results are now seeping out of the shoddy walls. Unfortunately, the smart money says that more will emerge in the coming years. McMAHON TERRY Every so often a movie comes along that manages to disturb, entertain and affirm, and such a treat came in the form of Patrick s Day, the second offering from writer/director Terry McMahon. The movie was released in early February, following a showering of plaudits from a whole range of film festivals in the USA and beyond. Described by one reviewer as a fascinating collision of psychiatric drama and state-of-the-nation address , the movie was the subject of rave reviews, despite its difficult subject. Patrick, played by Moe Dunford, suffers from schizophrenia and is mothered by the overprotective Kerry Fox. He meets a distressed flight attendant on the national feast day, which also happens to be his birthday. Thereafter, McMahon weaves a tale that tells much about attitudes to mental health, and more about where the country is at right now. In a realm where so much dross is shovelled out on a weekly basis, Patrick s Day was the best of the Irish in a year that saw a number of other credible contenders, most notably Glassland. As for McMahon, watch this space. NAMA This was the year that a smell began to emanate from Nama, the state body which is the biggest property company in the world. The body s nemesis turned out to be none other than Mick Wallace, who was a fair-to-middling developer back in the day himself. Throughout the autumn, Wallace made a series of allegations under D\'e1il privilege suggesting corruption associated with the sale of Nama assets. Most of the issues were connected to the sale of Nama s assets in Northern Ireland in a deal called Project Eagle. The most serious allegation that \£37m sterling had been paid into an off-shore bank account turned out to be true. In October he said that three individuals, including a Nama official, were part of a cabal to seek payment for affecting the biggest property deal in the history of this State. He claimed the three had information above and beyond what was available in the data room . Nama has denied all allegations of impropriety by anybody associated with it. All of which means the whole shebang is moving inexorably to the Irish solution an inquiry. O HERLIHY, BILL Okey dokey, we ll leave it there. It is no exaggeration to say that Bill O Herlihy was a national treasure, and so news of his passing on May 25 led to a sense of national grieving. For nearly 40 years, O Herlihy had been moderator of the nation s greatest sporting occasions. He had presented 10 soccer World Cups and 10 Summer Olympic games, and always managed to capture the spirit of the nation in times of triumph. He was best known for extracting opinions from the three Amigos of soccer coverage, Giles, Brady and Dunphy, but there was much more to him than that. In a previous guise he had been an outstanding journalist and one of the pioneers of current affairs broadcasting. Meanwhile, away from the sports coverage he had also run a highly successful PR business. His death came less than a year after his last major gig, the World Cup of 2014. PARIS The City Of Light. The first outrage was perpetrated on January 7. Two gunmen burst into the offices of satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo and began shooting, killing 11 and injuring another 11. Outside, as they were leaving one approached a policeman who lay injured on the ground and shot him dead. The second outrage occurred on the evening of November 13. A series of co-ordinated attacks shot and blew up a total of 130 people, including 89 at the Bataclan Theatre, where they were attending a gig. The whole world reeled at the outrage. The attackers were nearly all European-born and bred, but had become radicalised and then affiliated themselves with the so-called Islamic state. Two days previously, a pair of suicide bombers from the same depraved outfit blew themselves up in Beirut, killing up to 43 people. The bombings didn t receive anything like the coverage that Paris did, a fact that was noted in some quarters afterwards. The reality is that the death-obsessed fanatics kill far more Muslims in the Middle East then they do Europeans, but after Paris many feel that a rubicon has been crossed. Time will tell. [media=bbw]2548779[/media] QUALIFYING FOR THE\~EURO CHAMPIONSHIPS At 7.45pm on Thursday, October 9, Irish soccer was in the doldrums. A miracle was required to get anything out of the game that evening with Germany, and even then the chances of pulling ahead of Scotland in the Euro championship qualifying group were very slim. Miracles happen. Shane Long put the ball in the German net. Take it out and wash it. A historic victory was achieved, and the Scots obliged by slipping in their match. In the space of 24 hours, Irish soccer took a well-worn path from despair direct to ecstasy. The following month, the play-off against Bosnia Herzegovina went according to plan. A 1-1 draw away achieved in pea-soup fog, and then a thrilling 2-0 win back in the stadium formerly known as Lansdowne Road. REFUGEES It took the image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, washed up on a Turkish shore like a piece of flotsam to awaken the wider world to the horror unfolding before your eyes. The boy was drowned on September 2 along with his mother aboard a rickety vessel en route to Europe, attempting to flee the conflict in Syria. Suddenly, it was brought home that this was a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale. The ongoing civil war in Syria, combined with a number of other smaller conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, has led to millions of refugees trying to enter fortress Europe. Throughout the latter half of the year biblical processions of desperate people moved across Eastern Europe in attempt to reach salvation in Germany. Initially, Germany adopted a lead position in welcoming the tired, huddled masses, but despite Angela Merkel s display of a generosity of spirit combined with Germany s demographic needs the domestic mood appeared to darken as the year wore on, with many asking why other European states weren t stepping up to the plate. The refugee crisis is destined to be one of the major issues facing Europe into the future. SKELLIG ROCK The force of nature collided with the force of Star Wars for a second year in a row when filming for the next instalment took place over three days in mid-September. This time around some of the fears of those who object to disturbing both the ecology and the archaeology of the world heritage site were realised. The Office of Public Works confirmed that some incidents occurred during filming which required remedial stone mason work to be undertaken. The news only leaked out because the environmental group An Taisce had photos from before and after showing some damage to locations, including the steps at Christ s saddle. The other issue around the filming which rankled was the decision of the minister for arts and heritage to provide a permit without recourse to the legislation under which it is governed. If she had invoked the law she would have had to consult the director of the national museum and the smart money says he would not have been too pleased at the venture. Despite that, the locals are delighted at the raised profile of the area and the prospect of tourist dollars. [media=bbw]2518402[/media] TRAGEDIES Two multiple tragedies cast dark clouds over the nation. On June 16 six students working for the summer in Berkeley, California died when a balcony collapsed. Five were Irish and the sixth from an Irish-American family. All were friends enjoying a rite of passage in the prime of life. They were Ashley Donohoe 22; Olivia Burke, 21; Eimear Walsh, 21; Eoghan Culligan, 21; Niccolai Schuster, 21; and Lorcan Miller, 21. Seven others were injured, some of them with life-altering injuries. While there was much public grieving at home, the response in some quarters was less sympathetic. The New York Times published a piece suggesting that Irish students were habitually drunk and an embarrassment to Ireland while on J1 visas. Former president Mary McAleese responded by calling the coverage insensitive and inaccurate , comments which elicited an apology from the august organ. In the early hours of October 10 a fire ravaged a temporary halting site in Carrickmines, south Dublin, claiming 10 lives. Thomas Connors 27, his wife Sylvia, 25, their children Jim 5, Christy 2, and five-month old Mary. Jimmy Lynch, 39, also died along with his brother Willie, 25, and Willie s partner Tara Gilbert, 25, and their children Jodie, 9, and Kelsey, 5. The public grieving soon gave way to other emotions as a controversy blew up about housing the 15 survivors from the fire. Local residents objected to a temporary halting site being located in their area, and initiated a blockade. People took sides. Old enmities were resurrected. A dark side of Irish life came out to disturb the public grieving. UK ELECTIONS It was supposed to be too close to call. The most unpredictable in decades according to the media wisdom and, more importantly, the polls. All the polls indicated that the UK was heading for a hung parliament when it voted on May 7. The big question was whether or not Labour or the Conservatives would have enough votes to attempt to form a coalition with either the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats. The electorate thought differently. David Cameron s Tory party was returned with a 12-seat majority. The post-election talk was all about how scientific polling could be so wrong. A consensus gathered around the idea that many voters preferred to keep their intentions quiet, but ultimately considered Cameron the safest bet. The other major issue was the spectacular rise of the SNP just months after it lost the referendum on independence. As the dust settled, the Labour party elected a new leader to follow Ed Miliband. Step forward long-in-the-tooth socialist Jeremy Corbyn who was supposed to be in the race to make up numbers. Since then, Corbyn has just kept giving as a story. VAN MORRISON From the dark end of the street, to the bright side of life. Van hit 70 on August 31 and the occasion was marked with two concerts on Cyprus Avenue, not far from where he grew up in East Belfast, and the location of a song title from his seminal Astral Weeks album. There s life in the old dog yet. During the year he also played the Marquee in Cork, a gig that received widespread plaudits. Later in the year, he did his thing at the 3Arena, the venue formerly known as the O2, formerly known as The Point. A postscript to the latter gig involved a couple of calls to RT\'c9 s Liveline complaining that the singer didn t interact with the audience and played for only 90 minutes. For the love of God. If you want a cosy chat between numbers go see Daniel O Donnell. Van Morrison is about the music, first, last and everything. WEB SUMMIT In September, the founder of the Web Summit, Paddy Cosgrave, said that the event was leaving Dublin for Lisbon next year. The declaration sparked major moaning wrapped up in a blame game. How could he just up and off? Cosgrave blamed the Government for failing to properly address either his ego, his demands or his requirements to host the conference, depending on who you believe. Correspondence was released which further muddied the waters. As is often the case with these matters, the truth appears to have kept its head down in no man s land. Some of Cosgrave s demands like traffic management and VIP treatment do appear to have been extreme. There was also, however, a general failure to engage with him in official circles. Irrespective, the world moves on. Dublin, and indeed Ireland, will survive Paddy s departure. X-RATED MURDER TRIAL On March 27, after seven hours of deliberating, a jury at the Central Criminal Court returned a guilty verdict against Graham Dwyer for the murder of Elaine O Hara. The verdict brought to an end a trial that had heard evidence which plumbed the depths of human depravity. The trial had heard graphic evidence of a master-slave relationship between the accused and the deceased, which involved sexual fantasies involving aspects of bondage, domination, submission and masochism. The depravity, though, was centred on Dwyer s manipulation of an extremely vulnerable woman who had psychiatric issues, which may have been surmounted in different circumstances. In the end, having used her for his own ends, the court heard that Dwyer performed his ultimate fantasy by murdering her. To complete the surreal atmosphere surrounding the trial, Dwyer issued a press release after being found guilty, protesting his innocence. A month later he was sentenced to life in prison. YES TO EQUALITY On Friday, May 22, the Republic of Ireland became the first country to bring in same-sex marriage by popular vote. A majority of 62.1% to 37.9% determined that for the first time those who are gay had the same rights as heterosexuals to cement a union in marriage. Only one constituency in the State, Roscommon South-Leitrim voted no as a majority, and that was only just at 51.4%. As such the result was nowhere near as close as had been predicted. [media=bbw]2447597[/media] Responding to the result on the day after the vote, he said: Today Ireland made history. With today s yes vote we have disclosed we are a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people. Yes to inclusion, yes to generosity, yes to love and yes to equal marriage. The outstanding feature of the referendum was the campaign run by the yes side. Fears that they would talk only to the converted, and lecture the conservative swathes of the country about rights were misplaced. A thorough, patient and comprehensive and perfectly calibrated media campaign ensured they won the day. ZOO TV The tour once undertaken by U2. The year saw U2 undertake a tour that elicited comparisons with the Zoo TV tour from the early 90s. The main instigator of this comparison was the compiler of the A-Z above on the basis that he was badly stuck for a Z. None of which should take from the plaudits the band received for its Innocence and Experience Tour which landed in Dublin on November 23. After 40 years on the road, it s fair to say that the four lads from the northside of Dublin still have something. The shows performed at the venue formerly known as The Point were out of the top drawer in terms of energy, visuals and performance by the band. Bono was in top form, straddling his roles as singer, preacherman and shaman, while delving into his own youth in the most personal manner he has shown yet. Whatever one may think of the relevance of their music these days, the fact they are still eating road with dollops of chuzpath is worth something in today s throwaway culture. Their longevity is a testament to the unlikely combination of talent, hard work and level heads. \</doc>

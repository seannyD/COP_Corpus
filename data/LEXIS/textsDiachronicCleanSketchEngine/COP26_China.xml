[Photo/Agencies] As the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties gets underway, Africans expect action from it on mitigation, finance and adaptation in the effort to combat climate change impact. Despite contributing only 2 to 3 percent of global emissions, the continent still stands out disproportionately as the most vulnerable region in the world. Barbara Creecy, South African minister for Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, said the Glasgow outcome should be a package deal that advances the negotiations and all three aspects of the Paris Agreement, namely mitigation, adaptation and implementation of climate action. "South Africa envisages an outcome at COP 26 on adaptation that will enable practical progress, including launching a formal program of work to implement the Global Goal on Adaptation," she said. Though countries have committed to open and transparent discussions and have shown a willingness for a successful COP 26 , financial issues remain the greatest challenge, Creecy said. Differences exist Huge differences exist between developed and developing countries on the financing required for developing and least developed countries to meet the challenges posed by climate change, she said. She cited Article 2.1.c of the Paris Agreement, which requires all parties to make financial flows consistent with a pathway toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development. "What is striking is that we have as yet no common global understanding or guidelines to implement Article 2.1.c. These issues together with the future of long-term climate finance deliberations under the convention will be a make or break for COP 26 , as was the case in Madrid at COP 25 in 2019." Developing countries cannot implement ambitious mitigation targets unless there is sustainable, cost effective financing from developed countries and other multilateral and philanthropic institutions. "South Africa is among the many vulnerable developing countries that are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. This is evident from the increased frequency of extreme weather conditions such as floods, droughts and heat waves that threaten lives, food security, and infrastructure," Creecy said. COP 26 must reestablish trust between developed and developing countries by ensuring existing financing commitments are honored, she said. Similar sentiments were shared by Akinwumi A. Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, who said action, and not promises, is critical in the key areas of mitigation, finance and adaptation. "Action to avoid the worst impacts of the climate disaster must start with developed countries making true on their commitment of 'new, additional' and predictable climate finance from a floor of $100 billion per year." Michael Olusanya, executive director of the environmental protection group GreenWay International Foundation in Ghana, said the outcome of COP 26 will determine the direction of key aspects of the fight against climate change. \</doc>

By ANGUS MCNEICE in Glasgow | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-08 09:20 Photo taken on Oct 31, 2021 shows a general view of the opening ceremony for COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the United Kingdom. [Photo/Xinhua] In the flurry of climate-related materials published last week during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , one annual study was among the most worrisome. The World Meteorological Organization's "State of the Climate 2021" report brought into sharp focus the fact that climate change is no longer tomorrow's challenge\u-243 the impacts of global warming are playing out all around us. Extreme weather events are the new norm, the report said. This year, Canadian glaciers melted rapidly, months' worth of rain fell in just hours in parts of Asia, Europe experienced severe flooding, and Madagascar remains in the grip of climate-induced drought and famine. It was against this backdrop that COP 26 opened in Glasgow on Oct 31. Negotiations are scheduled to end on Friday, though many previous climate conferences have run over. The ultimate aim of COP 26 is to ensure that nations meet the targets laid out in the Paris climate agreement, and ensure that global warming is kept under 2 C compared with pre-industrial levels, and preferably close to 1.5 C. New International Energy Agency analysis indicates that if COP 26 commitments are met, global warming could be held to 1.8 C. "This is a landmark moment: It is the first time that governments have come forward with targets of sufficient ambition to hold global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. COP 26 , 114 countries, including China, have agreed to halt and reverse deforestation over the next decade. In addition, more than 100 nations signed on to a global partnership to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. In addition, COP 26 President Alok Sharma said that developed nations are on course to raise $500 billion in climate financing for developing regions over the next five years, and 23 nations committed to targets for the first time to eventually phase out coal power generation. The conference also witnessed pledges on net-zero carbon emissions and updated emissions reduction targets\u-243 known as nationally determined contributions\u-243 from large emitters including India and major emerging markets such as Nigeria. China followed up its earlier pledge to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality before 2060 with an updated nationally determined contribution and detailed action plans to deliver on its emissions targets. The Energy Transitions Commission estimates that, in order to meet the Paris goals, carbon dioxide emissions need to be cut from the 43 gigatons that they could reach on a "business as usual" path to around 21 gigatons by 2030. If implemented, some of the COP 26 pledges could make substantial inroads into closing this gap, said Adair Turner, chairman of the commission. "The commitment to end deforestation, if supported by appropriate finance and delivered, would itself result in 3.5 gigatons of emissions reductions," Turner said. "Add it all up with the (nationally determined contributions) and the sectoral commitments, and we are probably on a path to about 9 gigatons of reductions out of the 22 needed." Negotiators will next tackle the transportation sector and the built environment, including high emissions industries such as steel, aviation and shipping. Turner said that, regardless of the outcome of commitments in these areas, the 22 gigaton goal will not be met. "We're not going to be able to go home from Glasgow saying 'job done'." The IEA's Birol warned that there is a difference between words and action. "Ambitions count for little if they are not implemented successfully," Birol said. Zhang Jun, China's senior envoy to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter, "Responding to climate change requires unbending determination and sustained action, not empty slogans." \</doc>

By Arvea Marieni | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-12 09:05 A general view of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 11, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] It has become clear at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow, Scotland, that the climate challenge is perceived as global. The tone has changed, as noted by Youssef Nassef, director of the UN Adaptation Division of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said that in the history of the conferences, "there has never been such a large number of voluntary initiatives". The question is whether this consensus is also reflected in global determination to substantially reform the economic system. That is a different order of challenge that is nothing less than civilizational. As Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said right before COP 26 , "We are changing the economic system." The focus rests on how to bring to the mainstream the innovation to accelerate the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. The first step, however, is to build a new system of rules for the ecological industrial system. New policies must be designed to ensure the scalability of solutions and the transformation of markets. A whole-economy carbon (and resource) price is what we need. This will transform our societies and the way we all live. However, in the history of climate negotiations, while environment ministers have made commitments to reduce carbon emissions, their colleagues in energy, agriculture and finance posts have promoted policies to support the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This contradiction has marked the entire long journey of the COPs. The global environmental challenge of climate change requires policies both to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy as well as to enhance natural carbon sinks. Energy, industry, transportation, agriculture, and taxation and incentives are the main sectoral policies to be involved in addressing climate change. To address environmental challenges, environmental management needs to shift toward social and industrial systems. We need to use carbon less intensively while bolstering the resilience of the environment by enhancing carbon sinks-things such as plants, soil and oceans that absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than they release. The rules of the new economy are simple: To bring climate regulation to the mainstream, we need to internalize the external environmental damage. Once these externalities are integrated into the market system, energy producers and national economies will have a level playing field. This industrial, economic and social revolution needs to happen quickly and globally. There is a sense of urgency. China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, believes that a broad deal on carbon markets is becoming possible. German State Secretary for the Environment Jochen Flasbarth said, "The new normal of COP 26 is speeding things up". Eventually, how we build forward better will make or break the success of the ecological transition. Even more than before, truly ecological standards are needed. What we need is an orderly transition. If rich states are unwilling to assume a fair share of the cost, in their own interest, we will all fail. The main task lies with private and green finance. New mechanisms are needed to address this demand. In addition, technical negotiations that revolve around clauses of the Paris climate agreement are moving on in Glasgow, with China playing an active role. As European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said, the Chinese "are ambitious on the transition to renewables". Beijing has put a concrete program on the table, and it has already been converted into law. The European Union is banking on collaboration. After the injection of optimism in Glasgow, it's time to move from words to deeds. The clock is ticking.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Alok Sharma, president of the ongoing United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, said Friday that he expected the negotiations for a deal will continue into Saturday afternoon. "I envisage formal plenary meetings in the afternoon to adopt decisions and close the session on Saturday," Sharma, president of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in a statement. "There will be no additional plenary meeting this evening so as not to delay current ongoing consultations," he said. The COP26 president said that he will convene "a short informal plenary meeting in the morning" of Saturday. Talks are going into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries and territories try to strike a deal on tackling climate change. Earlier Friday afternoon, Sharma cancelled a press conference as the talks went to the wire. The two-week COP26 was originally scheduled to end on Friday. Developed countries are urged not to pay lip service in tackling climate change. Developing countries called upon developed nations to honor their pledge of financial assistance to the developing world in their efforts to fight climate change. Enditem \</doc>

CANBERRA, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Trade Minister has urged his colleagues to support a 2050 net zero emissions target to protect trade, with the Glasgow Climate Summit less than a fortnight away. Dan Tehan, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, declared that Australia cannot afford to be left behind as the world rapidly moves to "decarbonize". "There is no doubt that when I've been in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, the US or Europe, the world is moving to decarbonize," he said, according to the Guardian Australia on Friday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that he will travel to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, also known as the COP 26 which begins on Oct. 31 and runs until Nov. 12 in Britain. While he is expected to take a 2050 net-zero emissions target to Glasgow, the Liberal and National parties, which together form the governing Coalition, haven't reached an agreement over the issue. Morrison, leader of the Liberals, has been working towards a net zero commitment since Joe Biden became the U.S. president and brought his country back to the Paris agreement. But the Nationals have expressed concerns that such a target will jeopardize regional jobs. Tehan said that committing to net zero will allow Australia to be "at the table" to push back against "protectionist forces" or countries, who may disrupt the global efforts to address emissions reductions. "My concern is if we're not at the table, signing up to net zero by 2050, then we're not there making sure that this is going to be done the right way and that those protectionist forces can't disrupt the approach that we think should be taken to addressing emissions reductions," he said.

The 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ), delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. As the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015, delegates are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions on climate change in the coming two weeks. A man walks past an Earth model at the conference hall of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, capital of Denmark, on December 17, 2009 (XINHUA) The conference comes at a time when the world has gone through a series of climate-change-related weather disasters, from severe flooding to wild fires. Issues high on the agenda include finalizing the rules for the Paris Agreement's market mechanism and wealthy countries' unmet finance pledge to the developing countries to help them tackle climate-related challenges. COP26 President Alok Sharma said in his speech at the opening ceremony: "We postponed COP26 by a year. But during that year, climate change did not take time off ... And we know that the window to keep 1.5 degrees within reach is closing." "We know that our shared planet is changing for the worse. And we can only address that together, through this international system ... And if we act now, and we act together, we can protect our precious planet," he added.

Agreement was finally reached on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which relates to carbon market mechanisms, paving the way for effective implementation of the Paris deal to cut emissions through market-based approaches. Negotiators also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation. GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations climate change conference concluded here Saturday after a one-day extension, with negotiators agreeing on a new global pact to tackle climate change. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Some encouraging progress was made. Agreement was finally reached on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which relates to carbon market mechanisms, paving the way for effective implementation of the Paris deal to cut emissions through market-based approaches. Negotiators also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26 , more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing actions on climate change in the 2020s, which are widely welcomed and believed to galvanize global collective actions. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action this decade to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries as well as multilateral processes. As COP26 wrapped up, however, some stubborn issues, notably climate funding, remain uncertain. There were commitments to significantly increase financial support through the Adaptation Fund as developed countries were urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. However, it remains to be seen whether developed countries, whose development is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, will heed the set timeframe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023.

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-19 10:24 Street artists paint a mural on a wall opposite the COP26 climate summit venue in Glasgow on Oct 13, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Corporate sponsors have reportedly complained about the alleged mismanagement of the upcoming United Nations ' climate change conference , COP26 . Estimates suggest it will cost around 250 million pounds ($343 million) to police the summit being organized by UK Cabinet minister Alok Sharma and businessman Nigel Topping, who the government has named its high-level climate action champion. Sharma and Topping hope to offset some of the policing cost through their corporate sponsorship program. But The Guardian said sponsors have complained about "very inexperienced" government workers being out of their depth in organizing the event. They have reportedly also expressed frustration at not being offered a chance to become more involved in the summit, and have said they have not been kept informed. The paper said sponsors have sent two letters to the organizers, the most recent of which was penned by broadcaster Sky and signed by GSK, Hitachi, Microsoft, NatWest, National Grid, Reckitt, Sainsbury's, Scottish Power, and Unilever. The Guardian quoted an unnamed source from a sponsor as saying: "They had an extra year to prepare for ( COP26 ) due to (COVID-19), but it doesn't feel like this time was used to make better progress. Everything feels very last minute." The paper said sponsors also expressed concerns about the event's Green Zone, which was supposed to host a series of public events alongside the COP26 summit but which seems to be well behind schedule. The Daily Mail said sponsors have vented about not having been granted adequate access to government ministers in the run-up to the event, which they say they had been promised. Linda Bauld, chair of public health at Edinburgh University, told The Independent there have also been questions around the wisdom of staging the event in-person while the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging, because it will inevitably draw huge huge crowds of activists and protesters. The Daily Mail said the organizers of the summit, though, have claimed most sponsors remain happy with the way things have been managed. The paper quoted a COP26 spokesperson as saying: "The majority of corporate sponsors, who are receiving unprecedented access to this event, tell us they are delighted with the support." \</doc>

By ANGUS MCNEICE in Glasgow | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-13 08:29 A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] COP26 President Alok Sharma released early on Friday morning the second draft of a Glasgow agreement on climate action, which included an expression of "deep regret" over climate finance failures and adjusted language on coal and fossil fuels. Sharma then engaged in a maelstrom of mediation, visiting dozens of national delegations in a bid to get the agreement over the line on the final day of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 . The new draft included several important tweaks to an earlier version and included for the first time a call to phase out coal use and end fossil fuel subsidies this decade. The latest version of the text softened this language, and now applies to "inefficient" fuel subsidies and "unabated" coal projects. Unabated means that a plant has not invested in abating technology, such as carbon capture and storage. Several campaigners took issue with this updated language, arguing that the qualifier "inefficient" presents loopholes and that abated coal projects still produce emissions. Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said the agreement is now "critically weakened". However, negotiators from several developing nations contend that the first draft unfairly shifted responsibility onto poor nations from rich ones, at a time when climate finance commitments remain unfulfilled. "Under the Paris Agreement finance is an obligation, finance is not charity to developing countries from the developed world," Bolivian negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza said on Thursday, speaking on behalf of the LMDC. The new draft of the agreement expressed "deep regret" that finance goals had not been reached and "urged" rich nations to deliver the annual $100 billion "urgently" through 2025. The draft also called on nations to raise their emissions reduction targets by 2022, a recognition that current pledges are not sufficient to keep the average rise in global temperature to within 2 C and 1.5 C, a target laid out in the Paris Agreement six years ago. The agreement urged action from nations that have not done so to deliver in 2022 updated emissions reduction targets and netzero plans. On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said governments need to step up action heading into the last day of COP26 . COP26 has delivered some notable deals on deforestation, fossil fuel subsidies, coal and methane reduction, and engagement with the private and finance sectors. "But they are far from enough," Guterres said on Thursday. "The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world." Negotiations over Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which concerns carbon markets and remains unfinished, continue to cause controversy. In a carbon market, countries that have exceeded emissions reduction targets can sell carbon credits to other nations or firms. \</doc>

By Angus McNeice in Glasgow | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-07 07:10 People carry a sign as they attend a protest during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 6, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Forty five nations signed on to a pledge to protect natural environments and combat emissions from agriculture during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland, on Saturday, as tens of thousands joined climate change demonstrations across the city. On a day dedicated to nature and land use, the United Kingdom government said in a statement fellow signatories had "pledged urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming". "If we are to limit global warming and keep the goal of 1.5C alive, then the world needs to use land sustainably and put protection and restoration of nature at the heart of all we do," COP26 President Alok Sharma said on Saturday. Agriculture, forestry and land use is responsible for around 25 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the UK Environment Department said there is an "urgent need to reform the way we grow and consume food in order to tackle climate change". "The commitments being made today show that nature and land use is being recognized as essential to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, and will contribute to addressing the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss," said Sharma. On Saturday, 160 stakeholders including government and agriculture companies joined the Global Agenda for Innovation in Agriculture, which the UK said will "lead the way" on the global transition towards climate resilient agriculture and food systems to more sustainable ways of farming. Environment Secretary George Eustice said that, in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, "we need action from every part of society, including an urgent transformation in the way we manage ecosystems and grow, produce and consume food on a global scale". Meanwhile, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Glasgow and in cities across the UK to bring attention to climate issues. Organizers, including the COP26 Coalition, said that an estimated 100,000 people marched in Glasgow alone for the Global Day of Action on Saturday. "I wouldn't be anywhere else on the planet but here right now, to speak out about the climate emergency," Bors Hulesch, a speaker for environmental activism group Extinction Rebellion, told China Daily. "My message to delegates at COP26 is I need to hear about leaving fossil fuels in the ground, I need to hear about stopping new fossil fuel investments." A good natured throng of demonstrators marched for about 4 kilometers, from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green in the city center, on an unpredictable day punctuated with heavy showers and short periods of sunshine. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was initially scheduled to deliver a speech, though she cancelled in order to share the spotlight with other campaigners, according to organizers. "The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe," Ugandan environmental advocate Vanessa Nakate told the crowd in Glasgow. "It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move." \</doc>

COLOMBO, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- People are pinning hope on a major breakthrough at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) due to the failures in building a unified and global response to climate change in the last two decades, a Sri Lanka-based conservation activist has said. The COP26 or the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement on climate change reached in 2015, kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. Global leaders are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions at the meeting delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Xinhua, Dilhan Fernando, CEO of Dilmah Tea, said that Sri Lanka has suffered multiple economic challenges, and he called for international support in the form of climate finance and technology transfer to build renewable energy options, strengthen waste-to-energy systems, upgrade electricity distribution, or modernize public transport. In his opinion, Sri Lanka and other climate vulnerable countries are anticipating a major breakthrough at COP26 . "Without exaggeration, therefore, everything depends on COP26 ... Some of the collaboration and actions proposed in COP26 are critical for Sri Lanka," Fernando said. Sri Lanka is a signatory of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the current government has committed to generating 70 percent of energy supply from renewable sources by 2030. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced in September that the South Asian country would suspend building new coal energy capacity and target achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Fernando noted that Sri Lanka has a low per capita carbon emission of around 1.02 tons and a cumulative global contribution at 0.03 percent, but it ranks among the countries at very high risk of extreme weather events according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Fernando is also director of Dilmah Conservation, which is actively involved in advocacy for biodiversity conservation in Sri Lanka and has undertaken projects to create eco-friendly tea gardens and encourage sustainable energy generation. Fernando said that he thinks climate change threatens Sri Lanka's economic development in a range of sectors including agriculture, fisheries, livestock, and tourism. He believes that urgent intervention is needed to enhance climate resilience. "The tourism appeal of Sri Lanka is significantly connected with its biodiversity, particularly where luxury or ecotourism is concerned. Sri Lanka's wealth lies in its beaches, forests, national parks, and culture which is intertwined with nature," Fernando said. In his opinion, "For Sri Lanka's rural economy to continue to sustain the majority of the country's population, the agriculture sector needs to be realigned to strengthen its resilience to climate change."

By Angus McNeice in London | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-14 06:20 COP26 President Alok Sharma gestures as he speaks during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 13, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Negotiators agreed on a climate deal at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow on Saturday night, after last minute concessions on coal pushed the agreement over the line. After performing weeks of mediation, COP26 President Alok Sharma was visibly emotional when he announced the Glasgow climate agreement. A key line in the text, pertaining to coal, was watered down for the second time this week in order to get the deal done. "I think we can credibly say that 1.5C is alive. But it's pulse is weak," Sharma said, referring to the target laid out in the Paris Agreement in 2015 to keep average global temperatures to within 2 and 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. "I apologize for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry," Sharma said. "I also understand the deep disappointment but I also think, as you have noted, that it is vital that we protect this package." Prior to the finalization of the agreement, representatives from several countries including China said that the text was not perfect but that had no intention to reopen it. A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] An initial draft had called for nations to "phase out coal" projects this decade, and this language was changed to "phase down", after stiff opposition from India. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the approved texts represent a compromise, and reaffirmed his support for earlier drafts. "They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions," Guterres said. "We must end fossil fuels subsidies. Phase out coal." Guterres said that COP27 "starts now" and attempted to reassure onlookers that leadership would continue to address the climate crisis. "I want to close with a message of hope and resolve to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading the climate action army. I know many of you are disappointed," he said. "The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches." India was most full-throated in its opposition to earlier drafts, saying that it was unjust for rich nations to require the phasing out fossil fuels in developing nations that are in the midst of industrialization and urbanization. "How can anyone expect that developing countries can make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when developing countries have still to deal with their development agenda and poverty eradication?" India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav asked on Saturday evening in Glasgow. \</doc>

DHAKA, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have come down heavily on the developed nations for climate "empty pledges" in the past decades. She also made a plea to the world leaders "to turn pledges into action." "If western leaders listen, engage and act decisively on what science demands of them, there is still time to make COP26 the success it desperately needs to be," she wrote in an article published by British daily The Financial Times Monday. "The inconvenient truth of our times is that while action on climate change has never been more urgent and achievable, governments are not cutting emissions fast enough to keep nations such as mine safe," Hasina wrote in her article titled "Bangladesh PM: We need a global 'climate prosperity plan' not empty pledges." She was critical of the western world ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26 , which is slated to be held in Glasgow, Scotland between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12. The developed nations are not taking seriously the needs of the countries most immediately affected by climate change, she said. In the north of Bangladesh, millions depend on fresh water stored every year in the Himalayan ice fields, "which warming air is now destabilising." In the south, sea level rise is exacerbating the threat from coastal flooding. Falling crop yields are another destructive change "we can anticipate", she said. Earlier this year, Hasina said that her government cancelled plans for 10 coal-fired power plants but that was a relatively small step. "Subsequently, with COP26 in view, we developed the world's first national 'climate prosperity plan' -- a vision under which we will enhance resilience, grow our economy, create jobs and expand opportunities for our citizens, using action on climate change as the catalyst." Under the plan, she said, they will obtain 30 percent of energy from renewables by the end of the decade. The plan is expected to simultaneously prevent up to 6.8 percent of the economic damage that would otherwise come not only from climate change but also increasingly uneconomic fossil fuel infrastructure. "I believe more developing nations will adopt such plans in the coming months and years, led by members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum," Hasina wrote. "This year's COP26 summit in Glasgow is the best opportunity we will ever have to make one," she mentioned. Although recent net-zero pledges from the European Union, the United States and others are welcome, she said that the 100 billion U.S. dollars per year finance pledge made 12 years ago remains unfulfilled. "Nor is their repeated refusal to take seriously the needs of those nations most immediately affected. Agreement to support the poorest in dealing with the losses and damages caused by climate change is far removed from implementation," she continued. "If developed nations wish to help they must address this. Cutting the cost of capital will substantially accelerate decarbonisation across the global south, yielding worldwide benefits." "If western leaders can not see the logic of this, perhaps recent events in their own backyards will help - for what were the extreme forest fires seen in North America and Australia or Germany's recent lethal floods, if not alarm bells clanging in regions of the world most responsible for climate change?" she wrote.

Negotiators agreed on a climate deal at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow on Saturday, after last-minute concessions on coal pushed the agreement over the line. The adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact included some historic progress, including the completion of Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which concerns the development of carbon markets. Zhao Yingmin, China's vice-minister of ecology and environment, said the pact "will help kick-start a new journey of global efforts to tackle climate change". "The new global deal, especially the finalization of the rulebook of the Paris Agreement, bears great significance for defending multilateralism and the implementation of the Paris Agreement," Zhao said. The conference, which started on Nov 1 and ended a day late on Saturday, delivered some notable deals on deforestation, fossil fuel subsidies, coal and methane reduction, as well as engagement with the private and financial sector. China and the United States also surprised COP 26 with a welcome joint declaration on climate change announced on Wednesday. Wang Yi, a senior scientific adviser in China's delegation, said this declaration helped bring about a broader consensus. "China and the US played a very important role to push the final outcome. A consensus between these big countries promoted the final multilateral cooperation," Wang told China Daily on Saturday. "Some countries expressed disappointment, of course, but I think in the future we should continue to build upon this result." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted this year's conference, said there is still "a huge amount more to do in the coming years". "But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a road map to limit global warming to 1.5 C," he said, referring to the target laid out in the Paris deal to keep average global temperatures to within 2 and 1.5 C this century. After performing weeks of mediation, COP 26 President Alok Sharma was visibly emotional when he announced the Glasgow pact. A key line in the text, pertaining to coal, was watered down for the second time this week in order to get the deal done. "I think we can credibly say that 1.5 C is alive. But its pulse is weak," Sharma said. "I apologize for the way this process has unfolded. I also understand the deep disappointment but I also think that it is vital that we protect this package." Sharma said that a "gulf remained" between what countries have promised on emissions reductions and what is needed to meet Paris goals, though he said he remained hopeful that future conferences could make meaningful progress. Before the agreement was finalized, representatives from several countries including China said that the text was not perfect but they had no intention to reopen it. An initial draft had called for nations to "phase out coal" projects this decade, and this language was changed to "phase down", after stiff opposition from Indian negotiators, who said that it was unjust for rich nations to require the phasing out of fossil fuels in developing nations that are in the midst of industrialization and urbanization. Bhupender Yadav, India's environment minister, asked on Saturday: "How can anyone expect that developing countries can make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when developing countries have still to deal with their development agenda and poverty eradication?" HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202111/15/61919776a31019b094bdba7b.png Link to Image Wang said the coal phase down "reflects not only China's but also the world's concerns and interests "and Zhao supported this perspective. "The current global warming has been caused mainly by the industrialization in the past 200 years, mainly involving the developed countries," Zhao said. "This historical responsibility has been clarified by the Paris Agreement, hence the 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries, therefore, must take the lead to cut emissions instead of requiring the developing countries to stop consuming coal; it is unfair." Zhao said rich countries "must implement their pledges of funding and technology support for the developing countries". "Only in this way can all countries jointly push forward the process of coping with climate change," he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the approved texts represent a compromise, and reaffirmed his support for earlier drafts. "They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions. We must end fossil fuels subsidies. Phase out coal," he said. Guterres said that COP 27"starts now" and attempted to reassure onlookers that leadership would continue to address the climate crisis. The Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh will host COP27 in 2022. "The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches," he said.

By ANGUS MCNEICE in Glasgow, Scotland | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-11-03 07:26 Delegates attend the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , on Tuesday in Glasgow, Scotland. [Photo/Agencies] China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said that Beijing will "honor its word" and peak emissions before 2030, as he encouraged other nations to back up climate targets with detailed action plans. Speaking to media at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow on Tuesday, Xie said that China is already taking concrete action to achieve its ultimate aim to reach net zero emissions before 2060. "We not only make promises, we honor our word," Xie said. "We have already released an action plan for peaking emissions." In response to calls from some stakeholders for the Paris Agreement to change the global warming limit to 1.5 C\u-243 instead of its current range of 2 to 1.5 C\u-243 Xie said he did not support any plan which could jeopardize previous progress. "If we are to only focus on 1.5 C, it means we are destroying this consensus between all parties," Xie said. "And maybe countries will demand a reopening of negotiations if we are to change the target to only 1.5 degrees, and that will be a long process." Xie also called on developed nations to make good on the promise of $100 billion in annual climate financing for the developing world, a goal that was missed last year. "Developed countries have largely failed to honor their commitment for climate finance, which has a negative impact on mutual trust between developed and developing countries." At the World Leaders Summit at COP 26 on Monday, United States President Joe Biden expressed his regret that his predecessor, Donald Trump, had taken the US out of the Paris Agreement. "I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accord and put us sort of behind the eight ball," he said. "We will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but, hopefully, leading by the power of our example." Participants were eager to hear from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his country entered the conference without an updated pledge on emissions' reductions. \</doc>

HAVANA, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Cubans on Tuesday planted 26 trees to greet the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to be held from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. Dozens of outdoor enthusiasts and environmental activists gathered at Havana's National Botanical Garden to plant 26 endemic pine trees to raise the awareness of environmental protection and the dangers that climate change poses to life on earth, according to organizers. Odalys Goicochea, the representative of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment of the Republic of Cuba, told Xinhua that COP26 will serve as a platform for taking collective climate action between participating countries and multilateral organizations. "The outcome of this activity has been very positive as we want to increase tree planting rates over the next few years," said Alejandro Palmarola, president of Cuba's Botanical Society. "The world needs to take more concrete steps to address the climate emergency." During the pandemic, Cubans have planted thousands of trees across the country as part of a national campaign to create greener public spaces, with a goal of planting 3.8 million trees in 2021, according to the daily Granma.

LONDON, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain have agreed to strengthen cooperation on biodiversity and work with all parties to achieve positive outcomes at global biodiversity conferences, according to a statement published Thursday by the Chinese Embassy in Britain. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Zeguang met Wednesday with Alok Sharma, president-designate of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), during which they suggested the two countries "should increase communication, coordination and mutual support and work with all parties to achieve positive outcomes" at COP26 and at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15), said the statement. Zheng and Sharma had an in-depth discussion on Sharma's upcoming visit to China, as well as on China-Britain cooperation "in areas including response to climate change and action on biodiversity," it said. The two sides agreed that COP15 to be hosted by China in October and COP26 to be hosted by Britain in November are "two important events in global ecological conservation and environmental governance," it said. They also agreed that the two countries should encourage their companies to step up practical cooperation at the bilateral level and in third countries in such areas as new energy and green finance.

BEIJING, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain both expressed willingness on Tuesday to strengthen dialogue and cooperation to tackle climate change and work together to achieve positive outcomes at global climate change and biodiversity conferences. The pledges were made during a meeting via video link between Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng and Alok Sharma, president-designate of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to take place in Glasgow in November. Stressing solidarity in the face of climate change, Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said it is hoped that COP26 will send a strong political signal to firmly uphold multilateralism, respect multilateral rules, and promote actions; actively call for all parties to transform climate goals into specific policies and actions; and complete the negotiations on the implementation details of the Paris Agreement to ensure that global climate governance continues on the right track. China and Britain have maintained a good cooperative relationship in coping with climate change and both put forward stronger independent contribution targets and carbon neutrality visions, the vice premier said, calling for further dialogue and cooperation from both sides. China currently holds the presidency of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15), and it is willing to work with Britain to promote the success of the two conferences, Han said. Hailing China's efforts in tackling climate change, Sharma said Britain looks forward to expanding exchanges and cooperation in climate finance, energy, carbon trading and other fields with China, and is willing to strengthen dialogue and coordination with China to achieve positive results of COP26 and COP15. \</doc>

by Xinhua writers Xu Feng and Guo Shuang GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- As extreme weather events hit more frequently and the specter of a disastrous temperature rise looms, the just-concluded United Nations climate change conference has brought the world renewed hope. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which concluded Saturday after a one-day extension. Meanwhile, developed countries, whose industrialization is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, were urged to pay their fair share. CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE ACTION COP26 was held at a time when the world has gone through a rapid-fire onslaught of climate change-related weather disasters, from severe flooding to wildfires. "The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. After six years of discussions, COP26 completed the technical negotiations on the so-called "Paris Rulebook," which fixes the transparency and reporting requirements for all countries to track progress of their emission reduction targets. The rulebook also includes the Article 6, which establishes a robust framework for countries to exchange carbon credits and is expected to facilitate emissions reduction. " COP26 resulted in the completion of the Paris Agreement rulebook and kept the Paris targets alive," the European Union said in a statement. The Glasgow Climate Pact "will help kick-start a new journey of global efforts to tackle climate change," Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP26 , told Xinhua. "The new global deal, especially the finalization of the rulebook of the Paris Agreement, bears great significance for defending multilateralism and the implementation of the Paris Agreement," said Zhao, who is China's vice minister of ecology and environment. Negotiators at COP26 also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26 , more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing actions on climate change in the 2020s, which has been widely welcomed and could galvanize global collective action. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action within this decade. DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' CLIMATE DEBT Developed countries in 2009 pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not lived up to their promises. Recent reports indicate that this goal could be pushed back to 2023. In the new climate deal hammered out by COP26 , there are commitments to significantly increasing financial support through the Adaptation Fund, with developed countries urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. "There is some progress. However, it still falls short of expectations. There remain lots of regrets. The developed nations have failed to well address the core concerns of developing countries over such issues as adaptation, finance and technological support," Zhao said. Guterres also urged developed countries to honor their climate finance commitment to restore political trust. "No more IOUs," he said. "We've been coming to the COP meetings ever so often. What we have seen is the leaders are making such good speeches ... but we cannot see commitment," Charles Nyambura, from Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, told Xinhua at COP26 . "It is not about giving us money. It is about paying climate debt. We want to see our people supported to build their resilience to tackle climate change," he said. It is "pretty disheartening" that the developed countries have failed to deliver their promises under the Paris Agreement, which has damaged the trust required for "a real partnership," Federica Bietta, managing director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, told Xinhua. Instead of pointing the finger at others, Western countries should change their behavior, cut out fossil fuels and improve their energy efficiency, Carlos Martinez, a British author and political commentator, told Xinhua. "Furthermore, they should actually be providing finance and assistance to developing countries." CHINA WALKS THE TALK China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. As a country known for walking the talk, China has translated its commitments into real action. China's carbon intensity in 2020 was 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment of achieving a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from 2005 levels by 2020. The drop in carbon intensity means a total reduction of about 5.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2020, and demonstrates that China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions. Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, explained that the measures countries around the world have been taking to cut emissions usually include improving energy efficiency, optimizing the energy mix, developing renewable energy, adjusting its industrial structure and developing forest carbon sequestration. "China's contribution in these said areas accounts for about 30 percent to 50 percent of the world's total," Xie said. According to the World Bank, China has accounted for more than half of the world's entire energy savings since 2005. China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics. The country is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranking first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction. "It's very clear China has been taking green sustainable development very seriously for many years, and has developed the concept of ecological civilization," said Martinez, the British commentator. "China's been putting significant resources into all of these projects." Martinez said that China's targets on carbon peaking and neutrality are "very ambitious" and China "will continue to make remarkable progress towards the goals." "China is a country which has taken probably the biggest U-turn in the world by shifting towards this concept of eco-civilization, which is based on low carbon development, which is based on nature-based recovery," Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam told Xinhua during COP26 . "What China is doing and the whole concept of eco-civilization is not talk," Aslam said. "It is action."

by Xinhua writer Wang Jiangang UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- President of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Abdulla Shahid has expressed his intention to boost more confidence in climate action prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow slated for next month. "We need to do something, and that something I believe, is to give confidence to our people that it is possible to have a better tomorrow," said the UNGA president during a recent interview with Xinhua, who is going to convene a high-level meeting themed "Delivering Climate Action: for People, for Planet and for Prosperity" on Tuesday. Before moving to Glasgow, Shahid said that efforts must be made to ensure that the United Nations, composed of 193 countries, gives itself one last chance "a push" to make sure that "we go to Glasgow united." "We go to Glasgow knowing that we have the courage to take that important step to correct our path. And that is why I'm convening this event on 26th of October," he said. "That together, humanity has the capacity to rise from this," the president said, noting that his presidency is the "presidency of hope." "The (COVID-19) pandemic has really taken a toll on all of us. We have all lost loved ones within family, friends, coworkers. People have lost their jobs," he said. However, Shahid said that "we have to celebrate the fact that we have been able to achieve a vaccine in record time. Humanity has today launched the largest ever vaccine rollout in human history." Therefore, the international community should do more and "we should communicate this to our people, give people the confidence that together humanity has the capacity to deal with this situation" facing all countries. By displaying the success of developing COVID-19 vaccines in a very short period, the president expressed the hope that countries, if united closely, could also find good solutions to the deteriorating climate change situation. "We are seeing the devastation, the wrath of nature, unleashed on us, like it has never before. We are seeing floods. We are seeing forest fires. We are seeing... you name it. We need to face this," he said. "Once again, as I have been saying, humanity has the scientific knowledge, has the technology," he said, noting the only problem is the "lack of courage." He pointed out that he is expecting that there will be a great number of countries represented, a great number of heads of state and government "joining us virtually" at the coming high-level event. Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the General Debate of the 76th UNGA that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. Last year, Xi said that China would achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. Shahid warmly welcomed China's pledges. "China, as one of the largest countries, the largest economies in the world, is ready to step up to the plate," he said, adding that "the fact that President Xi came out with this commitment is encouraging." According to Monica Grayley, the UNGA president's spokesperson, Tuesday's meeting will focus on the gap between current and required technical and financial capacities to achieve the 1.5-degree Celsius target and how that gap can be met through showcasing best practices. The meeting will also take stock of the ambition-raising initiatives from member states and stakeholders. Enditem \</doc>

LONDON, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Metropolitan police officer in London hit out Friday at a planned two-week campaign in the British capital by climate campaign group Extinction Rebellion. "They (Extinction Rebellion) do not have the right to cause serious disruption to London's communities and prevent them going about their lawful business ... Extinction Rebellion's intention is to once again cause significant disruption to London and to London's communities through acts of civil disobedience," said Matt Twis, deputy assistant commissioner at the Met. "Officers from the Met are developing a comprehensive policing plan alongside the City of London Police. Due to the time frame of Extinction Rebellion's activity, and experience of policing the previous occupations, the scale and complexity of resources needed to respond will stretch across all areas of the Met," said a spokesperson for the Met. According to the group, the demonstrations will start Monday in London's Trafalgar Square, moving to the City of London area in week two. The theme of the rebellion in Trafalgar square is Crisis Talks, as campaigners accused the British government of refusing to hold its own emergency talks with the British public. Campaigners also plan to make demands for a halt to all fossil fuel investment. Extinction Rebellion cofounder Clare Farrell described the upcoming COP26 climate conference as "not fit for purpose". The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26 , will be held in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, in November. Enditem \</doc>

A scale replica Formula E race car made of 100 kilograms of single-use plastic waste attracted the attention of participants at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow, the United Kingdom. The event, held from Oct 31 to Nov 12, attracted senior officials from countries around the world to discuss ways to collaborate and tackle the pressing issue of climate change. The race car, called Recover E, was the result of efforts initiated by Envision Racing, owned by Chinese greentech company Envision Group, in collaboration with Kids Against Plastic, a campaign group founded by teenage sisters Amy and Ella Meek. Envision Racing, the only racing team partner at COP26 and the only Formula E World Championship race team certified as being carbon neutral, chose to display the replica to raise awareness among young people about problems of using single-use plastic. Figures show the world produces more than 380 million metric tons of plastic annually, and up to 50 percent of that is for single use. Up to 10 million tons of plastic are dumped into the oceans each year, according to Plastic Oceans, a nonprofit organization. Sylvain Filippi, managing director and chief technology officer of Envision Racing, said plastic has long been regarded as a major issue when it comes to the environmental efforts of economies across the globe. Race Against Climate Change is a program started by Envision Racing in 2014. It aims to accelerate the transition to clean, secure and affordable renewable energy and speed up the mass adoption of e-mobility. Envision Group, a major owner of the racing team since 2018, announced it had become the total owner earlier this month. "We are proud to be owned by one of the world's leading, most sustainably innovative companies and this will inspire the continued success of Envision Racing and energize our Race Against Climate Change," said Filippi. Envision Group is a globally leading climate technology company. Earlier this year, it announced that it will achieve carbon neutrality in its operations by the end of 2022, and achieve carbon neutrality throughout its supply chain by the end of 2028. It ranked second on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list, in recognition of its decarbonization innovations for solving the world's toughest sustainability challenges. Fortune's Change the World list acknowledges companies that have made measurable progress addressing pressing social problems as part of their core business strategy. Franz Jung, vice-president of Envision, said: " COP26 is one of the best platforms to showcase the future of green mobility technology. Chinese green technology companies like Envision Group are proving to the world at COP26 that technological innovation is driving the future global net-zero transition and can engage more people in this exciting process in even cooler ways. "Partnering with Envision Racing helps to achieve this by showcasing the possibilities of electric vehicles, which supports Envision Group's commitment to achieving decarbonization," said Jung, who is also chairman of the board of Envision Racing. Besides owning Envision Racing, which competes in a championship that attracted 316 million fans last season, Envision Group designs, sells and operates smart wind turbines and smart energy storage systems through Envision Energy; AIoT-powered batteries through Envision AESC; and the world's largest AIoT operating system through Envision Digital. It also manages the 10-billion-yuan ($1.56 billion) Envision-Sequoia Capital Carbon-Neutral Fund. The group has a network of R&D and engineering centers across China, the United States, Germany, Denmark, Singapore and Japan. During this summer, Envision AESC achieved strategic cooperation with Renault and Nissan to make power batteries. Envision AESC also announced the building of new "gigafactories" in France and the UK, the combined annual capacity of which may finally reach 75 gigawatt-hours. "Both plants will be powered by 100-percent renewable energy and support our global ambition to make high-performance, longer-range batteries for electric vehicles more affordable and accessible for hundreds of thousands more motorists annually," said the company.

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- With extreme weather events increasingly impacting countries across the world, the United Nations (UN) on Monday underlined the importance of limiting temperature rise to the internationally agreed goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. "The entire planet is going through a season of fire and floods," primarily hurting fragile and vulnerable populations in rich and poor countries alike, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told a high-level meeting on climate action. Speaking via video message to the Dialogue on Accelerating Adaptation Solutions Ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), the annual UN climate conference, which will take place in Glasgow in November, the deputy UN chief noted already-visible impacts with a 1.2-degree rise. "Countries and populations worldwide -- particularly those most vulnerable and least responsible for the climate crisis -- will experience even more devastating consequences," she warned. "The effects will reverberate through economies, communities and ecosystems, erasing development gains, deepening poverty, increasing migration and exacerbating tensions," she added. With "bold and decisive steps" towards a net-zero global economy by 2050, Mohammed said that the world could still limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees. "Acting now is a question of climate justice. And we have the solutions," she said, calling for a "massively scaled-up investment" in adaptation and resilience, and stressing the importance of simplifying rules and easing access for underprivileged countries, especially those in Africa. With less than 80 days to COP26 , the deputy UN chief urged the participants to "act boldly now for people and planet before it's too late." Enditem \</doc>

ROME, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- The last ministerial-level talks before the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) later this month in Glasgow helped illustrate the urgency of the problem of climate change, according to media reports and analysts. The northern Italian city of Milan was the site of the pre-COP talks, the last and largest preparatory meeting before the COP26 conference, which will start on Oct. 31. The Milan talks focused on preparations for COP26 as well as input from youth participants, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who opened the talks on Thursday calling for major industrialized countries to "match their words with action" by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and raising billions of dollars to help poor and emerging countries adapt to climate change. There was also a large march in Milan on Saturday, calling for strong action in Glasgow. "What we have seen in Milan is important because it illustrates the importance of taking stronger action than ever before to confront climate change," Nino Rossi, a climate researcher and analyst with the University of Florence, told Xinhua on Sunday. "What is most important is that the people making the call are young people -- those who will suffer the most if action is not taken," Rossi said. Alok Sharma, a former British secretary of state for business and president-designate of COP26 , agreed with those remarks, telling reporters in Milan that "the energy that came forward from the youth did galvanize the ministers." Sharma went on: "As we go forward in the next few weeks and into the COP, we must always keep (those) voices in our minds." Sharma said that delegates in Milan agreed to do more to keep the target of limiting global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels within reach and to deliver on a pledge to raise at least 100 billion U.S. dollars for adaptation efforts in poor and developing countries. Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission for the European Green Deal, said that the Milan talks helped ensure countries "will arrive at COP26 with a game plan." He went on to say that "every government must take steps" and that everyone has to work "beyond their comfort zone." Timmermans characterized the COP26 talks as "a fight for the survival of humanity." Italian Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani, meanwhile, said it would be key for countries to "disincentivize the use of fossil fuels" at the Glasgow meeting, which will conclude on Nov. 12. Britain is the main host of the COP26 talks, with Italy in a key partnership in the hosting process. Italy's La Repubblica has referred to the span between the start of the Milan negotiations and the end of the Glasgow summit "50 days for the climate" and LifeGate, a news site, called the Milan event "the starting gun" for COP26 .

[Photo/Agencies] Young people from around the world are taking leadership on climate change, as evidenced by the award-winning projects, commercial solutions and films honored at the Global Youth Summit on Net-Zero Future, or the "Climate x Summit". The summit was held by the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate, which was formed in Davos during the World Economic Forum in 2019 and includes 15 prestigious universities from around the world, including Yale University and Tsinghua University. The summit featured a climate research competition, an ActNowFilm project and a mini-hackathon for climate change solutions. The competition alone received 150 project submissions from graduate students at over 50 universities in 12 nations. The awards ceremony was held simultaneously in the China Corporate Pavilion of the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, and at Tsinghua in Beijing on Friday. Qiu Yong, president of Tsinghua, conveyed his gratitude toward GAUC member universities and partners for their support of GAUC and the Climate x Summit. "This decade is an extremely important period in the history of humanity, as it will determine whether we can achieve a carbon-neutral future. Young people play a vital role in achieving this goal," Qiu was quoted as saying in the release. Nicolas Stern, chair of the GAUC Academic Committee and founding chair of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, emphasized the meaning of the theme of the Summit, "Climate x", according to Tsinghua. "The subject matter," he said. "We know the success of nature, biodiversity and health depends on the climate. And the success of acting on climate depends on the progress in other areas." Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, spoke highly of the host of the Climate x Summit in his speech. "GAUC is a network to exchange our best ideas with one another to get smarter, faster at the scale and speed of climate change and other shared global challenges," he said. Climate x Summit is a collective endeavor by GAUC's 15 member universities, with the strategic partnership of the COP26 Universities Network, a growing group of around 80 universities in the UK, the host country of the COP26 . \</doc>

GABORONE, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has started swapping out fossil-fuel-powered groundwater pumps in its wildlife areas for solar-powered ones, according to a government official. The pumps are used to water wild animals in the better northern part of the southern African country known for its magnificent flora and fauna and currently rely on diesel generators, said Botswana's Minister of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism Philda Kereng. "To ensure consistent water availability for wildlife in the area, we are currently switching from diesel-operated pump systems to the more reliable, efficient and economical solar operated pump systems," said Kereng when addressing Botswana's House of Chiefs Friday. To date, four boreholes have been converted from diesel to solar. These installations will ensure consistent water supply unlike with diesel-operated engines which require continuous refueling and maintenance, said Kereng. The just ended 26th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) held in Glasgow, Scotland saw nearly 200 nations reaching an agreement with an unprecedented reference to the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis. The latest landmark climate science report, published by the UN in August, called for emissions to roughly halve by 2030 and for the world to reach net zero by mid-century to have any hope in keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius.

By HOU LIQIANG | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-08 09:23 People carry a sign as they attend a protest during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, on Nov 6, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Historical emissions should be weighed in apportioning workload, experts say Editor's Note: As delegates look for a meaningful agreement at the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, calls are growing for concrete action to aid nations most at risk from global warming. Those seeking climate justice are raising their voice as delegates from almost 200 countries meet at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , with calls to consider cumulative and consumption-based carbon emissions in global climate governance. As the almost two-week summit passed its midpoint, thousands of people took to the streets in Glasgow, Scotland, where the summit is being held, on Saturday, the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. They were echoed by many demonstrators in other parts of the United Kingdom and some other countries. "We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice," said Asad Rehman, a spokesman for the COP 26 Coalition, which led the demonstrations. "The climate crisis has resulted from our broken, unequal societies and economies. We must transform our global economies into ones that protect both people and our planet instead of profit for a few." In an analysis published last month by Carbon Brief, a UK organization, the United States was said to have released more than 509 gigatons of carbon dioxide since 1850, which outnumbered that of all other countries and is one-fifth of the world's total. Over the same period China emitted 284 gigatons of the gas, it said. History matters because the cumulative CO2 emissions since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution is closely tied to the 1.2 C of warming that has already occurred, it said. The analysis found that even though certain developed countries have reduced emissions at home, they continue to rely on high-carbon imports from overseas. When consumption-based emissions are taken into account, the US and Japan, for example, each gain 0.3 percentage points more of the global cumulative total. China's share drops by 1.1 percentage points. Carbon Brief is endorsed by scholars and officials from many other countries, including Japan, Singapore, India and China. In Japan, for example, scholars including Keiichiro Kanemoto, associate professor of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, estimated that China's exports contribute to one-third of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Shimbun said. 'More from the US' Scientific research shows that per capita emissions of cumulative carbon heat-trapping gas by the US are eight times those of China, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian recently after being asked about a commentary by two Singaporean scholars in The Straits Times. Fang Li, country director of the World Resources Institute China, said China became a carbon-net-exporting country, especially after it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. "The world's demand is always there," she said. "The global industrial structure hasn't changed significantly. What dramatically changed is where the production occurs." Fang said there is a huge difference in per capita consumption between developed and developing nations, citing the US and India as examples. With six times per capita emission difference, a US citizen's endeavor in carbon reduction can mean a significant life improvement for an Indian, she said. If both the industrialized countries and developing countries realize zero carbon at their current development stages, the life standards of their people will be at completely different levels. "Can this be fair?" she asked. Tang Xinhua, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, said: "The calculation of each country's emissions cannot give a proper place to justice unless the global supply chain is taken into account." Considering the transfer and the historical emissions of rich countries, developing countries deserve support in funding, technology and capacity building to improve their capabilities in coping with the global crisis, he said. "The lack of support will jeopardize joint global climate action." Some developed countries have commitments to less developed countries that have not been fully met, but they want to levy import duties on countries with lower emission costs, mainly developing countries, he said. "This goes against climate justice, and it's immoral." Angus McNeice in Glasgow and Cai Hong in Beijing contributed to this story. \</doc>

LONDON, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation, rather than dissent and argument, should remain the default between China and Western countries to tackle climate change, a leading British expert on China said Monday. Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College of London, made the remarks as a week-long series of events to discuss China's role in tackling climate change was launched here on Monday. The China Week event, hosted by the Lau China Institute, consists of high-level panel discussions, webinar, film screenings, book launches, essay competition and photography exhibitions. The theme of China Week 2021 is climate change and the environment, with a particular focus on China's role in driving national and international climate action. "We decided to hold this series of events just before the COP26 summit on climate change and the environment, to highlight the key importance of China and global cooperation so far on this issue, and to deepen the dialogue so that we can take action going forward in deciding what we can do, together," Brown told Xinhua. "With so much disagreement and tension currently between different partners across the globe, and within specific countries, we wanted to stress that cooperation remains the default, rather than dissent and argument. We hope that this week will have an impact on policy makers and different key actors in the UK, Europe, China and elsewhere," he said. Topics covered during the week include China's 2060 carbon pledge and the economic transition to a low carbon future, the "green steel" opportunity, digital environmental activism in the China, biodiversity, the health impacts of climate change, the green Belt &Road, and the role of youth in driving change. The event will also feature speakers, special guests and leading China experts from Britain and across the globe. The COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. China has announced that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. \</doc>

LONDON, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain enjoy enormous potential for practical cooperation in the area of environmental protection, said Tuesday Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Zeguang. Zheng made the remarks during an online Joint Press Conference by China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Chinese Embassy in Britain on the issues of biodiversity and climate response, ahead of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland. He said the two countries' cooperation in environmental protection can be carried out in two areas: policy coordination and practical cooperation. In terms of policy coordination, the first priority for the two sides at the moment is to make sure the second part of COP15 and the upcoming COP26 are real successes, he said, adding that China is sincere in stepping up its communication and cooperation with Britain and other signatory parties for that purpose. The first part of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) was held from Oct. 11 to 15 in Kunming, capital of China's Yunnan Province, to be followed by the second part next year. In terms of practical cooperation, business communities from both China and Britain can work in many fields, including green technology, green finance, renewable energy, nuclear energy and electric vehicles, the ambassador said. Some progress has already been made in the area of electric vehicles, he said, noting that there are BYD electric buses and Geely cabs on the streets of London now. Some Chinese businesses have taken part in the development of vehicle battery, wind power plants and other relevant projects in Britain, he added. The ambassador said it is very important for the investment environment in Britain to be continuously improved so that Chinese investors are encouraged to come and invest. "It is our hope that Britain will work closely with China toward the same direction to create a favorable, enabling environment for businesses of our two countries to cooperate more productively," he said.

ANKARA, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and U.S. defense ministries held a meeting in Turkey's capital Ankara to resolve the conflict on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Turkish defense ministry said Thursday. The two sides also discussed financial issues of the program, said the ministry, noting the two NATO allies agreed to continue their talks. The discussion came ahead of a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow slated for early November. The most important subject of this meeting would be the F-35 issue, Erdogan said Monday, adding Ankara seeks the return of the 1.4 billion U.S. dollars payment made for the fighter jets. There are signals from Washington to deliver the F-16 warplanes in return for Turkey's money paid for the F-35 program, he said. Turkey's procurement of the Russian S-400 missile defense systems prompted the United States to remove Ankara from the F-35 program in 2019. Tensions between the United States and Turkey have since escalated over the deal, as Washington claimed that the S-400 systems would be incompatible with the NATO system and may expose its confidential military information to Russia. Last December, the United States imposed sanctions on Turkey over the S-400s, targeting the Turkish defense procurement agency and its officials. Enditem \</doc>

ROME, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Thursday thanked outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel for playing a "decisive role" in shaping the future of the European Union (EU). His remarks came at the conclusion of what likely was Merkel's last official meeting with Italy's top officials, as she prepares to leave the stage as soon as a new German federal government is formed after the recent parliamentary elections. "I thank the chancellor on behalf of the government and myself personally for the decisive role she has had in designing the future of Europe" over the past 16 years, Draghi said at a joint press conference here. In turn, Merkel noted that Draghi had played an essential role in safeguarding the euro. "I believe the euro symbolizes our (EU) unity, therefore no effort has to be spared to further strengthen and develop it and there is still much to be done in this field," she told reporters. Merkel's talks with Draghi touched on other issues, such as the goals of the G20, whose rotating presidency is held by Italy this year; the need to boost COVID-19 vaccine supplies across the world; and the situation in Afghanistan, on which Germany and Italy hold the same position. The two leaders also discussed climate change and environment protection in view of the major United Nations Climate Change Conference (or COP26 ) to be held in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12. \</doc>

BEIJING, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- China has submitted two documents on its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term emission control strategies to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said the country's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The two documents, titled "China's Achievements, New Goals and New Measures for Nationally Determined Contributions" and "China's Mid-Century Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy," were handed in on Thursday, according to the ministry. This is China's concrete action in implementing the Paris Agreement and reflects the country's determination and efforts in promoting green, low-carbon development and addressing global climate change, the ministry said. The document on China's achievements, new goals and new measures for NDCs has summed up China's policies, measures and results in implementing its NDCs since 2015, as well as key policies and measures for its new goals. It also expounds on China's basic stance on global climate governance, contributions and considerations on further promoting international cooperation against climate change, the ministry added. The other document, while summarizing China's key progress in controlling greenhouse gas emission, puts forward China's guiding principles, strategic visions, strategic priorities and policy orientations on its mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emission development, and its approaches and advocacies for promoting global climate governance. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) is scheduled from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. This is the first of its kind since the Paris Agreement came into force. \</doc>

LUSAKA, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is committed to biodiversity conservation, proper land management and fighting climate change to improve the socio-economic wellbeing of its people, a senior government official said on Thursday. Collins Nzovu, Minister of Green Economy and Environment said the government was aware that the conservation of biodiversity that constitutes natural capital was critical to ensuring that Zambia achieves its aspirations of a green economy and attainment of socio-economic development for all. "I wish to share with you my government's determination to ensure that the green economy, which entails low carbon, resource-efficient and socially inclusive approach drives the economic transformation and recovery that we so desperately need," he said during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, according to a release. Zambia, he said, was endowed with abundant fauna and flora hence the need to take biodiversity conservation seriously, adding that the creation of a dedicated ministry was meant to synergize efforts to cope with forests loss, climate change, biosafety and environmental protection. According to him, the bringing together of interrelated and critical functions under one ministry would promote a development path that considers natural capital as a critical economic asset and a source of benefit especially for the poor. The re-alignment of portfolio functions would enhance green investments that would spur renewable energy and resource efficiency, he added. "However, we are constrained to achieve most of these targets in time due to inadequate financial resources, making it difficult for us to make our fair share contribution to global efforts in addressing these multiple challenges," he said. Zambia, he said, was currently engaged with the global community in formulating a new post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Enditem \</doc>

SUVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Vanuatu and China have jointly called for the international community to come up with unprecedented ambition and action to address climate change at an online dialogue. The first Vanuatu-China Youth Dialogue with the theme of "Youth Contribution to China-Vanuatu Friendship and Addressing Climate Change" has been held via video link with the participation of officials and youth representatives from the two countries, the Chinese Embassy in Vanuatu said in a statement on Thursday. After intensive discussions, youth representatives reached a consensus that both China and Vanuatu attach great importance to addressing climate change and actively take part in the battle against climate change. The youth representatives also agreed to express their expectations and wishes to the upcoming COP26 (the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ) scheduled to be held in November. They plan to extend a joint appeal to COP26 and the international community, including upholding multilateralism, pursuing green development, following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, protecting a healthy, intact and sustainable ocean and emphasizing youth contribution. They hoped that COP26 could listen to the appeal from the younger generation and call on all the young people to be active champions, participants and promoters of climate efforts. Chinese Ambassador to Vanuatu Zhou Haicheng hailed the dialogue as being of historic significance, saying that this is the first time for young people from China and Vanuatu to conduct a bilateral dialogue and to discuss climate change. This is also the first time that China and Vanuatu have an in-depth exchange on promoting the younger generation's contribution to addressing climate change, he said. He also hoped that young people will make full use of this opportunity to enhance mutual understanding and friendship, discuss ways to jointly address climate change, contribute their wisdom and strength to the ever-growing China-Vanuatu comprehensive strategic partnership, and building a community with a shared future for mankind. Eslin Garaebiti, director general of the Vanuatu Ministry of Climate Change, said that dialogue is very much welcomed and it "gives an opportunity to our young people to be able to engage and learn from China's experience in its efforts to fight against climate change." The dialogue was co-sponsored by Vanuatu Ministry of Youth Development & Sports, Vanuatu-China Friendship Association, the Chinese Embassy in Vanuatu, Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and School of International Studies of Peking University. \</doc>

It might be more difficult to reach a climate change deal at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) summit than it was to find consensus for the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the president of COP26 , which will begin on Sunday in Glasgow. Alok Sharma, who is in charge of the gathering, told The Guardian newspaper that he is under no illusions about the size of the task ahead. "What we're trying to do here in Glasgow is actually really tough," said Sharma, who also is a United Kingdom minister of state at the Cabinet Office. "It was brilliant what they did in Paris, it was a framework agreement, (but) a lot of the detailed rules were left for the future." He said that with the need to iron out details now, the conference of 200 nations and territories, which will conclude on Nov 12, represents a global crunchtime. "It's like we've got to the end of the exam paper and the most difficult questions are left and you're running out of time; the exam's over in half an hour, and you go, 'How are we going to answer this one?'" he said. National leaders and negotiating teams will try to find ways to limit greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to ensure that the global increase in temperature does not exceed 1.5 C more than pre-industrial levels. "This is definitely harder than Paris on lots of levels," Sharma told The Guardian. " (But) what we have going for us is that there is an understanding that we need to deal with this." The UK published its road map to reducing its carbon footprint last week. Its net-zero strategy calls for $90 billion in mainly private-sector investment to be directed at its environmental initiatives. With Sharma highlighting the difficulty of the task ahead, climate activist Greta Thunberg told the BBC that people should not pin all their hopes on governments improving the situation. "The change is going to come when people are demanding change," she said. "So we can't expect everything to happen at these conferences." She said she will attend the COP26 summit, and that committing to producing less carbon won't be enough if countries "look for loopholes". With world leaders, senior politicians and officials heading for Glasgow, Scotland's Daily Record newspaper said the security services are monitoring "more than 800 potential terrorists" over fears they may target the event. MI5, the UK's counterintelligence and security agency, said the UK terror threat level is currently "substantial".

By VENKATACHALAM ANBUMOZHI | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-12-09 09:15 A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , has come and gone. It did not unveil a treaty on par with the 2015 Paris Agreement, but it exhorted countries to take steps to keep global temperature increases to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels until the end of the century. Leaders of developing nations demanded $1 trillion annually over the next three decades from developed countries to help the developing world adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Advanced countries, whose carbon pollution over generations caused the problem, agreed to this funding commitment with the goal of eventually achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Delivering on climate finance is the stickiest point of contention between developed and developing countries. Most of the nationally determined contributions in regard to emissions cuts are conditional on the availability of adequate financial support. Mobilizing $1 trillion every year seems like a daunting task. However, COP 26 witnessed extraordinary support from the global finance industry. The world's largest investors called for a robust, transparent and fair climate deal, promising that they will make money flow. And banks promised to find ways to promote and channel tens of billions of dollars into low-carbon investments. But private finance will not flow in a vacuum. There is a close relationship between the way in which incentives are handled and increased climate investments. The good news is that the financial industry is not short of savings. At the global level, some $300 trillion is represented in capital markets\u-243 a little more than half from commercial banks, and the rest from insurance and institutional investors. Against this, the clean $1 trillion looks quite modest. But financial markets still do not have enough money flowing in support of a net-zero economy. One of the reasons is that motivation for private financing of low-carbon infrastructure is not strong. If a carbon-intensive investment gives a greater return than that of a clean and green alternative, investors cannot ignore the business case of making profits. That is why over 300 financial institutions have urged world leaders to reach an agreement on climate financing. They are ready to pay a price for carbon if it makes their investment relatively more attractive, while gradually understanding the need for a stable climate and economy for safe investment. Moreover, most private investments for climate change mitigation in developing countries in Asia are not made by financial institutions but by big corporations. Huge economic rewards could be gained if these are directed toward low-carbon investments by pricing carbon in the markets. Though a lot of activities are taking place in finance systems, there is a long way to go to mobilize the $1 trillion. A major reason is that financial institutions themselves are not well structured to accelerate financial flows in the right direction. They inadvertently give preference to carbon-intensive investments over low-carbon ones. The same is true for accounting standards. Even though it is claimed that they are prudent, they do not question the value of stranded assets. The risk measures used to manage banks are backward looking and ill-adapted to foreseeing climate risks that lie ahead. Investment institutions, which have a fiduciary duty to care for the interests of their stakeholders, often ignore the effects of climate change on the population for which investment decisions are made. Shareholders, citizens and policymakers need to ensure that financial systems are fit for the purpose of achieving net-zero targets. In short, significant, coordinated efforts are necessary to compel future investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Some initiatives have been successful in several countries: ensuring that credit rating agencies offer ratings that incorporate long-term climate risks into their evaluations; encouraging companies to report openly on their carbon intensity and declare their improvement plans; creating standards of reporting for all companies that can raise money through public stock exchanges; getting banks and financial institutions to manage and minimize value at risk through proper screening, making them safer, and steering them away from carbon-intensive activities. In addition, trustees of investment funds could be encouraged to accept fiduciary responsibility; equity investors can be urged to integrate climate considerations into their engagement with companies and in voting for boards; and insurance companies could assist in identifying and creating climate resilience. Furthermore, multilateral banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and intensify their efforts to help countries advance the net-zero goals. Each of these is but one of many small steps. But taken together they would put the world on a very different course in mobilizing the clean $1 trillion.

THE HAGUE, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- With the world already lagging behind in curbing global warming, the international community should use the Glasgow climate conference as an opportunity to make new commitments and take ensuing concrete actions, experts say. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) is set to open on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, where countries are expected to reach new consensus on further curbing carbon emissions. EXPECTATIONS NOT HIGH "My expectations are not very high," Leo Meyer, a former project leader at the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and current director of the Netherlands-based ClimateContact Consultancy, told Xinhua in an interview. "At the moment we are more on the way to 3 degrees (Celsius) global warning instead of 1.5 degrees. Hopefully that will improve when a number of countries on the spot in Glasgow come with improved national contributions." During the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, countries agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Moreover, countries were committed to bringing forward national plans setting out how much they would reduce their emissions, called Nationally Determined Contributions. "So far it doesn't look good," Meyer said. "In addition to the degrees Celsius, we need better agreements about money. That is a stumbling block to get parties involved. The pressure is very high, higher than ever." IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY Sible Schone, advisor of climate bureau HIER, a Dutch foundation focusing entirely on climate change, told Xinhua that negotiations at the upcoming Glasgow conference will not be easy, but the implementation of commitments will be key. "Besides the commitments that will surely come, we also need the practical implementation," Schone added. "This summit is about objectives, but implementation is much more complicated." He noted that it is not impossible to replace coal-fired power stations with gas, but really major changes like speeding up the switch to electric vehicles, changes in air travel, etc. are much more difficult to achieve. "At this summit I do foresee commitments approaching 2 degrees, but the real problem is whether these commitments will become practice," Schone said. ACTION EXPECTED FROM RICH COUNTRIES At present, more is expected from rich and developed countries to set an example by translating targets into fast action. "The Netherlands and the European Union have made a significant commitment to a 55 percent CO2 reduction by 2030," Schone said. "That is a commitment and the European Commission has also made clear proposals to reach that in terms of measures." "But talks have yet to start about that. Europe must also take an extra step for acceleration. In addition, if the United States fails to make a hard commitment, the summit has a problem. I am not very optimistic," Schone said. CHINA IN "FANTASTIC POSITION" "China is in a fantastic position to win the race to the top of the world in terms of sustainability," said Meyer. "They have excellent scientists, universities, good projects, all knowledge and possibilities are available." "China has gold in its hands to make energy more sustainable. But yes, the current economic growth figures are a bottleneck ... in the long term it is possible," Meyer added. China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, which means that it has to realize an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions and move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality faster than any nation in history. "It is clear that China is taking steps," Schone said. Enditem \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday put forward a four-point proposal for global climate cooperation. China attaches great importance to tackling climate change and is ready to work with all parties to make the upcoming 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) a success so as to promote the comprehensive, effective and sustained implementation of the Paris Agreement, Zhang told a UN General Assembly high-level debate on climate action. The first proposal he made is to follow the rules. Zhang said that it is necessary to uphold the status of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as the main channel in global climate governance and implement the objectives, spirit, and principles of the Paris Agreement in a comprehensive and balanced manner. All parties should firmly uphold multilateralism, complete negotiations on outstanding issues concerning the details of rules in the Paris Agreement, and lay a solid political foundation for global climate cooperation. The second is to earnestly implement the commitments. All parties should move beyond political slogans and taking actions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, and capacity-building so as to promote significant progress at COP26 on issues of finance and adaptation. Developed countries should take the lead in significantly reducing emissions and effectively fulfilling their commitments to providing financial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing countries, Zhang further said. Thirdly, Zhang said, countries should adhere to the principle of each doing its maximum. Countries should respect each other's national conditions and abilities, follow the arrangements of Nationally Determined Contributions and give their best. Developing countries are facing the severe impact of COVID-19 and the arduous task of poverty alleviation. So, there should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to emission reduction. The fourth is to accelerate green transformation. Zhang said that the international community should vigorously promote the transformation and upgrading of economic, energy, industrial, agricultural and forestry structures, encourage the innovation of technologies and business models and achieve a win-win situation to combat climate change and attain sustainable economic and social development. To this end, there is a need to provide strong support and create a favorable environment for developing countries. Zhang said China keeps its word on climate change and has already exceeded its target of climate action for 2020 ahead of schedule. China is resolute in curbing the blind development of projects involving high energy consumption and high emissions. China has also launched the world's largest online carbon market and actively carried out South-South cooperation on climate change, thus making significant contributions to the global climate response. \</doc>

by Xinhua writers Gu Zhenqiu, Jin Jing GLASGOW, Britain, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- With the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) set to open on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, the high-profile international gathering is widely expected to be a crucial opportunity for reaching new consensus on further curbing carbon emissions. The two-week event, which was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, comes amid a lack of progress among some parties to narrow a worrisome financial gap to tackle climate change. For instance, a long-standing pledge by developed countries to channel 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to developing ones has not been honored so far, undermining trust and engagement at forthcoming climate negotiations. The stalled progress has raised concerns about COP26 's chance of success and sparked warnings that the conference may end in empty talks. At present, few can deny that climate change is a challenge facing all of humanity, and that it is imperative to successfully tackle the problem for the future of the planet. This extensive global consensus has been built for decades following melting glaciers and polar ice, record-breaking heat waves, droughts and rising sea levels, which are threatening the lives of billions of people and potentially wrecking economies across the world. In the face of the grave impacts, COP26 participants should take the global gathering as an opportunity to bring hope, rather than despair, to the effort of fighting the war that human beings cannot afford to lose. Just as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in October, " COP26 must be a turning point" of climate actions. To achieve that, all parties at COP26 should first of all translate climate goals into specific policies, and complete negotiations on the implementation details of the Paris Agreement to ensure that global climate governance continues on the right track. Adopted in 2015, the agreement aims to limit the global temperature rise in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to even further pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Second, the Glasgow conference should deliver a breakthrough in climate adaptation. Together with emissions reductions and financing for climate actions in developing countries, climate adaptation is one of the three key elements of the political package that Guterres has urged to be delivered at COP26 . As climate disruption is affecting more and more lives and livelihoods worldwide every year, especially among the most vulnerable, building resilience and adaptation must be a priority for all. Third, the success of COP26 lies on all parties' commitment to true multilateralism and genuine respect for specific national conditions of each and every developing country, on the basis of which the Paris Agreement was reached in the first place. To be specific, those developed countries with a few hundred years of industrialization and ecological debt should take the lead in climate actions, and stop pinning responsibilities on conscientious developing nations, such as China. As the world's largest developing country with a population of more than 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization, China has nevertheless honored its ambitious pledges to tackle climate change despite the difficulty. For years, China has voluntarily adopted nationally determined contributions and supporting policy measures, and actively taken part in global climate governance. Though facing other innumerable social and economic priorities, China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, which means that the country has to realize an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions and move from peak carbon to carbon neutrality faster than any nation in history. China has laid out a concrete road map towards greener development and means what it says. Therefore, any worry that it might fail to achieve its goal is unfounded, and any attempt to smear China's resolve to mitigate climate change and its progress in this regard will prove futile. No one is safe until all are safe. As the window of opportunity to prevent the worst climate impacts is rapidly closing, it is time for the international community, developed countries in particular, to show their joint determination to address this mighty challenge facing mankind. Taking collective, effective and prompt actions at the Glasgow conference is key for future success. Enditem \</doc>

Nov. 5 --China National Nuclear Corporation issued the following news release: Construction of the third unit at the UAE's Barakah nuclear power plant has been completed, and the unit is on track to start up in 2023, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has announced today on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow. Barakah is the Arab world's first multi-unit operating nuclear power plant, located in the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi. Unit 1 began commercial operation in April this year; unit 2, which started up in August, has been connected to the UAE grid and is currently undergoing power ascension testing. For unit 3, the focus will now turn to completing the operational readiness preparations, testing, regulatory inspections, and international assessments needed to obtain an operating licence from the UAE's Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR). The announcement, made during Energy Day at the United Nations climate change conference , "demonstrates the UAE's progress in transitioning to cleaner energy sources, rapidly decarbonising the power sector, cutting carbon emissions, and increasing power supply to meet the growing electricity demand," ENEC said. The UAE - with the endorsement of the member states of the UN's Asia Pacific group - is bidding to host COP28 in 2023. ENEC Managing Director and CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi said the completion of construction at unit 3 demonstrates the "steady progress" of the Barakah project. "As the world gathers at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the need for concrete actions to tackle climate change is indisputable and urgent. The Barakah plant, with its rapid decarbonisation of the power sector, is delivering climate solutions today and with unit 3 construction now complete, we are progressing smoothly towards supplying a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs completely carbon free," he said. "By developing nuclear energy in the UAE, ENEC is enabling sustainable growth and prosperity for the nation through the provision of abundant, 24/7 clean electricity, whilst underpinning intermittent renewables and creating a bridge to other clean energy technologies like green hydrogen. We are tackling climate change directly today and will do for the next 60 years to come," he added. Barakah unit 3 has already completed individual and combined system tests, including cold hydrostatic testing, structural integrity test, integrated leak rate test and hot functional test, as part of the first phase of its initial testing programme. In addition to FANR's review process, the unit and its operating team will now undergo a number of assessments by independent international nuclear energy experts from the World Association of Nuclear Operators, ENEC said. Construction of the four APR-1400 units at Barakah began in 2012 and the plant as a whole is now more than 96% complete, ENEC said. Construction of unit 3 began in 2014.

China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said that Beijing will "honor its word" and peak emissions before 2030, as he encouraged other nations to back up climate targets with detailed action plans. Speaking to media at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow on Tuesday, Xie said that China is already taking concrete action to achieve its ultimate aim to reach net zero emissions before 2060. "We not only make promises, we honor our word," Xie said. "We have already released an action plan for peaking emissions." In response to calls from some stakeholders for the Paris Agreement to change the global warming limit to 1.5 C\u-243 instead of its current range of 2 to 1.5 C\u-243 Xie said he did not support any plan which could jeopardize previous progress. "If we are to only focus on 1.5 C, it means we are destroying this consensus between all parties," Xie said. "And maybe countries will demand a reopening of negotiations if we are to change the target to only 1.5 degrees, and that will be a long process." Xie also called on developed nations to make good on the promise of $100 billion in annual climate financing for the developing world, a goal that was missed last year. "Developed countries have largely failed to honor their commitment for climate finance, which has a negative impact on mutual trust between developed and developing countries." At the World Leaders Summit at COP 26 on Monday, United States President Joe Biden expressed his regret that his predecessor, Donald Trump, had taken the US out of the Paris Agreement. "I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accord and put us sort of behind the eight ball," he said. "We will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but, hopefully, leading by the power of our example." Participants were eager to hear from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his country entered the conference without an updated pledge on emissions' reductions. "By 2070, India will achieve the target of net-zero emissions," Modi said, adding that India is aiming to meet half of its energy needs from renewable power by 2030. In a written statement sent to the leaders summit, President Xi Jinping reiterated the country's commitment to reducing emissions. "We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects," he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his frustration at the lack of progress made on climate change. According to new UN projections, current emissions' reductions pledges from COP members, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, will miss the 2 to 1.5 C target by a wide margin. Guterres said that as things stand the NDCs will "condemn the world to a calamitous 2.7 degree increase". "We are still careening toward climate catastrophe," Guterres said. "We are digging our own graves." United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is the host of COP 26 , likened global warming to a doomsday device, counting down toward disaster. "It's one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock and we need to act now," he said.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- As the highly anticipated 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) kicked off in Glasgow, Scotland, a British climate scientist urged immediate global actions to avert the grave impact of climate change. "We have to take into account what's going to happen in the future, and it makes utter sense to act now," Hannah Cloke, a Professor of Hydrology at University of Reading, told Xinhua in an interview. "So even if it does cost us a little bit now, we do have to do that in order to stop so much economic damage in the future, let alone people losing their lives," she said. The expert described the past year as "relentless," as the world was hit by a series of heat waves, floods and wildfires, among other natural disasters. "As a climate scientist, it's quite worrying to see all of these events unfolding and all of them seeming to break records and be really very, very destructive," she said, warning that the world lacks the "resilience" needed right now for these events. "So we know these things are going to get worse into the future. So it's absolutely essential that governments take this seriously, and invest in our future," she noted. The expert urged governments to turn emission reduction policies into actions, upgrade infrastructure and improve their early warning systems to minimize the loss of property and lives. Noting that China has become the world's leading manufacturer of green technologies, Cloke said it's very encouraging to see China, the world's largest developing country, invest in green energy and "really thinking about the future." China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics. China is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranks first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation. In a tremendous effort to tackle climate change, China has announced that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. COP26 comes as critics said developed countries, which bear the historic responsibility for carbon emissions, are not doing enough to provide sufficient support for developing countries in finance, technologies and capacity building to tackle climate change. Notably, the rich countries have failed to honor their longstanding pledge to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. The expert expressed concerns that COP26 could become a place of empty talks without concrete actions. "We need to go much faster if we're actually going to take a bite out of this problem. This is a little nibble. We need to really, really get our teeth into the problem. So I think there's a long way to go and that needs to happen quite fast," Cloke said. "Some of the main challenges of COP are getting past the hot air. Lots of talk and rhetoric, but actually (little is) moving towards actual actions and actual financing of those actions," she added. The expert also urged the world to act together to address common challenges like climate change. "I think governments working together on the climate crisis is absolutely essential. We will not be able to do this as individual nations. we need to come together as humanity to solve this problem because it is too big for us to solve on our own," she noted. Enditem \</doc>

By Hou Liqiang | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-12-16 17:23 A wind power plant in Dingxi, Gansu province. [Photo/Xinhua] A senior environmental official has called for intensifying efforts to explore green technological innovation as countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative work toward a green recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, by making use of an innovation center established in China. Zhao Yingmin, vice-minister of ecology and environment, made the remarks on Thursday as he addressed the opening ceremony of the 2021 BRI Green Innovation Conference. Held under the theme of "Green Recovery and Innovative Low-carbon Development", the conference took place in Shenzhen, a high-tech hub in Guangdong province where the Belt and Road Environmental Technology Exchange and Transfer Center is based. He said that during the COP 26 United Nations climate change conference "Innovation points the way to our future," he stressed. Zhao promised intensified effort from China in strengthening capacity building in Belt and Road countries for green recovery, as it strives to promote the development of low-carbon technologies. "We need to turn to low-carbon technology innovations to gain momentum for a green recovery," he noted. He said that Shenzhen boasts great advantages in technology, talent and capital as China endeavors to build the city into a platform for low-carbon technology innovation. He added that the Chinese government chose to set up the Technology Exchange and Transfer Center in the city in the hopes that Shenzhen will support Belt and Road countries and even the rest of the world in capacity building toward sustainable development. He called on BRI countries to intensify low-carbon cooperation on infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance to explore green solutions for climate change mitigation, upgrading industry and the development of a circular economy. "We will continue to deepen green cooperation and to make environmental awareness a defining feature of Belt and Road cooperation," Zhao said. \</doc>

SYDNEY, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- In an address on Thursday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Guy Debelle outlined the risks climate change and the green energy transition poses for Australia's fossil-fuel reliant economy. Debelle separated the risks into "physical risks," the direct impacts on the economy from climate events such as bushfires or floods, and "transition risks," the risks posed as Australia restructures its economy away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources. "It (climate change) has a broad-ranging impact on Australia, both in terms of geography and in terms of Australian businesses and households," said Debelle. The address came ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to be held in Britain's Glasgow between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12, 2021. The event is expected to further increase international pressure on the Australian government to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, a target which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously tip-toed around. According to the most recent governmental figures, over 98 percent of Australia's energy generation comes from non-renewable energy sources, dominated by coal, oil and gas. Debelle noted that as jurisdictions across the country implement policies towards net zero and investors adjust to climate risks, the cost to Australia's fossil fuel industries will rise. "Both of these are effectively increasing the cost of emissions-intensive activities in Australia. So, irrespective of whether we think these adjustments are appropriate or fair, they are happening and we need to take account of that. The material risk is that these forces are going to intensify from here." He said that Australia's path forward would soon need to be paved "in a much cleaner and more sustainable way," but warned that a transitional period would be necessary. "Countries and economies need to transition sustainably. Some projects that are not 'green' will nevertheless be needed to assist an economy transition to net zero," he said. "There are plenty of opportunities for Australia to continue to take advantage of its natural endowments of renewable resources and continue to be an exporter of energy to the world, but in a much cleaner and more sustainable way."

President Xi Jinping has said that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, using his address at the United Nations General Assembly to add to pledges to deal with climate change.  China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, Xi said in his pre-recorded video address at the annual UN gathering on Tuesday, in which he stressed China\' s peaceful intentions in international relations.  This is another remarkable step taken by China on its own initiative to cope with the global climate change, as Xi earlier announced China\' s pledge to strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, said Ruan Zongze, China Institute of International Studies executive vice president. United States climate envoy John Kerry quickly welcomed Xi\' s announcement, calling it a  great contribution and a good beginning to efforts needed to achieve success at the October 31-November 12 COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Alok Sharma, head of COP26 , also hailed the announcement.  It is clear the writing is on the wall for coal power. I welcome President Xi\' s commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad  a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China, he said on Twitter. Besides decreasing coal-fired power projects, China has pledged an additional US$3 billion of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic recovery.  Development holds the key to people\' s well-being, Xi said. He unveiled a six-pronged Global Development Initiative  staying committed to development as a priority, staying committed to a people-centered approach, staying committed to benefits for all, staying committed to innovation-driven development, staying committed to harmony between man and nature and staying committed to results-oriented actions. Xi spoke after US President Joe Biden gave his first UN address. Biden mapped out a new era of vigorous competition without a new Cold War. Xi called for building a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, and doing the best to  expand the convergence of interests and  achieve the biggest synergy possible.  One country\' s success does not have to mean another country\' s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries, he said, adding that differences and problems among countries need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.  Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm, Xi said. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People\' s Republic of China in the UN. Xi said China will solemnly commemorate this historic event and advance cooperation with the UN to a new level and make greater contributions to promoting the UN\' s noble cause. \</doc>

BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- China, a major contributor to tackling climate change and an active participant in climate talks, has been a source of strong impetus for global climate governance. "China has contributed to the conclusion and quick implementation of the Paris Agreement; with its own vision and action it has charted the course for a new form of global climate governance," stated a white paper released Wednesday, elaborating on China's policies, actions and progress in mitigating climate change. Deeming climate change "a task of great urgency" that needs to be addressed, the document said China has contributed to global unity on climate governance through its leaders' climate diplomacy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has on many occasions highlighted China's view on global climate governance and expressed China's firm support for the Paris Agreement, facilitating major progress at the global level. In 2015, Xi delivered a keynote speech at the Paris Conference on Climate Change, making a historic contribution to the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on global climate action after 2020. In September 2016, he deposited in person the legal instrument of China's ratification of the Paris Agreement. This came as a vigorous push for the quick implementation of the agreement, showing China's ambition and resolution in tackling climate change. Xi announced that China will scale up its nationally determined contributions at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2020, demonstrating China's resolve in applying its new development philosophy and its clear attitude to make further contributions to global efforts against climate change. At the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020, President Xi announced China's further commitments for 2030. China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent, increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts. The country will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, announced Xi at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, manifesting China's sense of responsibility as a major country. Earlier this month, Xi emphasized efforts to achieve China's carbon peak and neutrality targets when addressing the leaders' summit of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. China will continue to readjust its industrial structure and energy mix, vigorously develop renewable energy, and make faster progress in planning and developing large wind-power and photovoltaic bases in sandy and rocky areas, and deserts, he noted. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), scheduled from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, is the first of its kind since the Paris Agreement came into force. China looks forward to working with all parties to make progress at COP26 and promote full implementation of the Paris Agreement goals, said Ye Min, vice minister of ecology and environment.

by Liu Fang, Yu Shuaishuai, Chen Chen MARSEILLE, France, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Starting Friday, tens of thousands of representatives from some 160 countries and regions have gathered at the nine-day World Conservation Congress (WCC) in France's port city of Marseille to address Planet Earth's ecological plight. The congress, held jointly by the French government and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) under the theme "One Nature, One Future," prepares for the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP15) set for October in Kunming, China. From Marseille to Kunming, France and China are working steadfastly for global action on nature conservation. Addressing the WCC, French President Emmanuel Macron called it "part of a dynamic" which makes 2021 a very important year, as a third global event on environment, the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), is slated for November in Glasgow, Scotland. He urged the world to "re-synchronize" the two agendas -- one for climate and the other for biodiversity. "The urgency is to re-synchronize these two agendas, to get everyone understand that the battle for climate is linked intrinsically to the battle for preserving and restoring biodiversity," said Macron. "We are already too late in terms of biodiversity. We must catch up," he noted. By organizing this congress, France expects to confirm its commitment to supporting the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and more widely, its international role in environmental and climate issues. Six years ago, it was in Paris that climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change sealed the milestone climate pact aimed at reversing the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. China, which helped bring about some key breakthroughs during the negotiations, remains steadfast and active in addressing climate change and implementing the Paris Agreement. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, via video link, told the WCC that China's national carbon market, the world's largest in terms of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions covered, was launched recently, and China stands ready to work with all parties to build a clean and beautiful world. On further improving global ecological environmental governance, Li called on the world to adhere to the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and strive to promote the construction of a fair, reasonable and win-win global environmental governance system. Actually this is one of the core missions of the Marseille congress. During a series of in-person and online events, states, local governments, scientists, private sector and civil society representatives will discuss the major objectives of the post-2020 global framework for biodiversity, a key milestone expected to be achieved during the COP15 in Kunming. "Our post-2020 nature and biodiversity framework must be universal, innovative and transformative. It should support a post-COVID economic recovery respecting Nature while being just and inclusive," said IUCN President Zhang Xinsheng at the WCC opening ceremony. "The theme of the CBD COP 15 in Kunming, China, next month is 'Ecological Civilization -- Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth.' It is the proper segue towards what we all should seek to achieve," he added. In 2010, parties of the CBD set 20 goals during a summit in Japan's Aichi for the decade 2011-2020. "However, many of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been difficult to achieve," Zhang told Xinhua in an interview on the eve of the congress. "The degree of biodiversity loss and the degradation of the ecosystem have been approaching planetary limits and tipping points," he said. "If this loss and degradation still cannot be reversed by 2030, we will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals." "This IUCN congress can be seen as a prelude to the Kunming Conference. Both are milestones to see whether mankind can set a 10-year agenda to turn crisis into opportunity," said the IUCN president. For Patrick Giraudoux, a professor of ecology at the University of Franche-Comte, "we can already wait for a lucid assessment of the status quo, which is what IUCN in Marseille will tell us, such as which species are threatened, how fast they are threatened, etc. Then there are the decisions to be taken by the governments and this will follow what will be decided at COP15." "Practically all the governments of the great powers agree to move forward in this direction. The question is what will be done in reality," he said. China has vowed that it will continue to work to ensure the success of COP15. The first part of the COP15, including an official opening and a high-level segment, will take place both online and offline on Oct. 11-15. The second part, to be held in-person in the first half of 2022, will see broad and deepened negotiations towards an ambitious and practical post-2020 global biodiversity framework, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. For the post-2020 nature and biodiversity framework, working sessions and negotiations were in delay due to the sanitary context, France's Secretary of State for Biodiversity Berangere Abba told the press. "At the end of this congress, the Union (IUCN) and France will issue a 'Declaration of Marseille,' which will write down the ambition resulting from the reflections and negotiations that will take place in the coming days," she said. "We are very mobilized and attentive that this declaration, which will be a roadmap for the months to come and for the negotiations at the moment of COP15, is indeed the most ambitious possible," she added.

The State Council Information Office released a White Paper on Responding to Climate Change: China's Policies and Actions on Wednesday, providing the world with an overview of not only China's achievements in this regard but also specific steps it will take to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. With the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 26 During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), China supported an average annual economic growth of 5.7 percent with an average annual growth rate of 2.8 percent in energy consumption, and its energy conservation accounted for about half of the global total during the same period. Yet, the country has a lot of difficult tasks to fulfill even as it strives to realize its emissions goals. These range from upgrading its economic structure, advancing urbanization, promoting ecological conservation to the improvement of people's livelihoods, none of which it can afford to slack off on. That being said, China has to strike a difficult balance between its development goals and emissions reduction goals. Through exploring groundbreaking green development measures and embedding them into its pursuit of high-quality development, the country is trying to reconcile the internal tensions between growth and emissions reduction. The upgrading of the energy structure, the research into emissions reduction technology, the development of new energy and related industries, the opening of the national carbon trading market, the green financial sector that is poised to boom and the adjustment of the government evaluation mechanism that makes emissions reduction a key performance indicator for local governors are all advancing the restructuring of the country's economy, industry, society and governance in the direction of sustainable green development. In other words, through transforming its growth model, the country is trying to cultivate new growth drivers related to emissions reduction to make the process self-propelled and sustainable in the long run. Addressing climate change is the common cause of all mankind. China has set an example for other countries in emissions reduction. The international community should undertake its responsibility with unprecedented ambition and action. Countries should uphold sustainable development, multilateralism, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and carry out win-win cooperation. \</doc>

China on Oct. 27 issued a white paper titled "Responding to Climate Change: China's Policies and Actions," in the lead-up to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to be held in Glasgow. The white paper was released by the State Council Information Office. This marked the second time for China to have released a white paper on climate change, said Ye Min, Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment. The white paper fully demonstrates China's progress and achievements in coping with climate change, as well as the country's remarkable contributions to the global climate governance, offering a systematic description of China's proposal, wisdom and solution in dealing with climate change, Ye explained. As an active promoter and staunch follower of climate action, China in recent years has implemented a national strategy for actively responding to climate change, adopting a series of policies and measures such as upgrading industrial structure and energy mix, reinforcing efforts in energy conservation and greater energy efficiency, establishing market mechanisms, and enhancing forest carbon-sink, Ye introduced, adding that positive progress has been achieved. Greenhouse gas emissions have been effectively controlled. China\' s carbon intensity in 2020 was 18.8 percent lower than that in 2015. The figure was also 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment to the international community \- to achieve a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from the 2005 level by 2020. It demonstrates that China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions. Energy structure has been optimized. Preliminary calculations show that in 2020, non-fossil energy contributed 15.9 percent to China\' s total energy consumption, a significant increase of 8.5 percentage points compared with 2005, Ye introduced, adding that the country's reliance on coal consumption has significantly reduced. The national carbon emissions trading market has been constantly improved. According to the white paper, the national carbon market started online trading on July 16, 2021. A total of 2,162 power generation companies were involved, representing 4.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, making this the world\' s largest emissions trading system. Besides, China has continuously advanced low-carbon piloting and reinforced its ability to adapt to climate change. The Chinese society's awareness of low-carbon development has also been raised. While doing a good job in coping with climate change at home, China has also actively participated in and charted the course for global climate governance. It has played a historic role in promoting the conclusion, coming into effect and the making of implementation rules of the Paris Agreement. The white paper says that as the largest developing country, with a population of over 1.4 billion, China faces major challenges across a range of important areas including economic development, improving the people\' s lives, pollution control, and eco-environmental protection. In order to meet its targets in response to climate change, China has risen to these challenges and formulated and implemented a variety of strategies, regulations, policies, standards, and actions. As a responsible country, China is committed to building a global climate governance system that is fair, rational, cooperative and beneficial to all, and makes its due contribution to tackling climate change using its greatest strengths and most effective solutions, the white paper says. The COP26 is the first meeting of the parties since the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It will complete the negotiations on the remaining issues of the implementation rules of the Paris Agreement. "We hope that parties relevant can meet each other halfway. Developed countries shall be constructive and flexible, obey the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities," and adhere to the nationally determined contributions, so as to avoid backtracking and even renegotiation on the issues that have been agreed on," said Sun Zhen, an official with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. China believes the COP26 should make a strong political voice of safeguarding multilateralism and respecting multilateral rules, and all parties relevant shall implement the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the nationally determined contributions, so as to contribute to the global response to climate change, said Ye. Sun said China is willing to work with the UK that holds the presidency of the COP26 , to make negotiations open, transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-based. It will also maintain close communication and coordination to push for the completion of the negotiations on the remaining issues of the implementation rules of the Paris Agreement, he added. \</doc>

U.K., Boris Johnson, prime minister  We asked nations to come together for our planet at COP26 , and they have answered that call. I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal. Alok Sharma, business secretary and president of COP26 China, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of environment  I think our biggest success is to finalize the rulebook. Now we can start implementing it and delivering it on our achieved consensus. U.S., John Kerry, climate envoy  We are in fact closer than we have ever been before to avoiding climate chaos and securing cleaner air, safer water and a healthier planet. U.N., Antonio Guterres, secretary general  The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions. Greenpeace, Jennifer Morgan, intl. executive director  They changed a word but they can\' t change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending. If you\' re a coal company executive this COP saw a bad outcome. (CGTN) \</doc>

Financial institutions controlling 40 percent of the world's assets have aligned with the Paris Agreement, United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow on Wednesday. Under the stewardship of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, the financial sector will attempt to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy, Sunak said. The UK finance minister announced that 450 financial institutions from 45 countries have committed to limiting emissions and aligning with the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming below 2 C and preferably closer to 1.5 C by mid-century. Collectively, these banks and funds control assets worth around $130 trillion. "Six years ago, Paris set the ambition. Today in Glasgow, we are providing the investment we need to deliver that ambition," Sunak said. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero is chaired by UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney, who is also a former governor of the Bank of England, the UK's central bank. "What you're hearing today is that the money is here, but that money needs net-zero aligned projects," Carney said in Glasgow. "A pool of that capital has been carved out for the transition in emerging and developing economies, and not at some distant point in the future, but for this decade." Sunak also announced that the UK will become what he called the "first ever net-zero aligned financial center". He said the government will make it mandatory for companies to publish a "clear, deliverable plan" setting out how they will decarbonize and transition to net zero. Sunak said an independent task force will be set up to hold companies to account. Sunak also said he expects a target of $100 billion in annual climate finance from rich nations to developing nations will be met by 2023, after the target was missed last year. Several major deals were announced on Tuesday, the final day of the World Leaders Summit. China was among more than 100 countries that promised to halt and reverse deforestation during the next decade. The Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use involves the United States and the UK, as well as heavily forested nations including Brazil, Canada, Russia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its 114 signatories are home to 85 percent of the world's forests. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting this year's summit in Glasgow, Scotland, hailed the "landmark commitment" as one of the first major outcomes of COP 26 . So far, the pledge has secured $19.2 billion of public and private funding. China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, told reporters at COP 26 that the nation has already made large gains in its reforestation efforts. Last year, China reached a forest coverage rate of 23.04 percent, Xie said, up from 8.6 percent 70 years ago. Also on Tuesday, 105 nations signed up to a global partnership to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent during the next decade. The partnership, which was first announced in September by the European Union and the US, covers countries that emit around 40 percent of the world's methane, which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Another major deal saw more than 40 countries, including China, endorse the new Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda, which will see countries and businesses work together to scale up and speed up the development and deployment of clean technologies. Meanwhile, Nigeria became the latest large emerging economy to commit to a net-zero pledge on Tuesday, when it announced plans to achieve the milestone before 2060.

by Xinhua writers Sun Xiaoling, Liang Xizhi LONDON, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China is "wonderful and brilliant" on its carbon emission commitments and the City of London looks forward to continuing strong relationship and strengthening green collaboration with Chinese partners, said William Russell, lord mayor of the City of London. "It's very important to strengthen the collaboration between the two sides," the mayor told Xinhua in a recent interview. "One of the areas that we're very keen to strengthen is around green finance." Russell, currently serving as the co-chair for the UK-China Green Finance Taskforce alongside Dr. Ma Jun, chairman of the China Green Finance Committee, told Xinhua that both sides have had lots of virtual meetings recently in the run-up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to be held in Glasgow, Britain in November. The COP26 is "one of the biggest events for the UK and the world... I fear that climate change will be a lot worse unless we address it very quickly," he said. Talking about the collaboration with Chinese partners in green finance, Russell said: "I think China has made great progress, and it's moving very fast, and we will continue to work with China to help with that progress." "We're learning from each other and working together with each other," he added. Impressed by Chinese firms' understanding on how critical the ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) is for the world, the mayor said: "It was really refreshing to see how China is moving forward...China recognizes that has to come down not only for the world, but for the Chinese people." Highlighting how finance is crucial to get the world to net zero emissions, Russell said: "It's about greening finance and financing green. And eventually that word 'green' will not be in the word 'finance', because all finance has to be green and sustainable." Hailing China's commitments to striving to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, Russell said: "I think it's wonderful and brilliant that China has made those commitments and we respect that." "Knowing China as I do, it would not surprise me in any way if that came forward, because when China decides to deliver a commitment, normally not only delivers it, but normally delivers things ahead of time," he said. The mayor noted the rapid development of electric cars as well as solar panels in China. "So I look on always with huge respect and admiration of what China's achieved," he said. Asked about the current headwinds facing the two countries, Russell said despite some differences that the two sides have on certain things, "that doesn't mean we can't still be business to business." "Here in the City of London, we have a huge history about being a trading city. And that trade is what we will continue to do with China, whatever some of the geopolitics are," he said. Noting that China has opened the door wider and wider in the financial sector, the mayor said it is great news and "we will hope to continue to work with China as the door opens wide, and it will be reciprocal." The mayor also welcomed more Chinese financial firms to come to the City of London to set up their offices. "We will welcome that," he said. Enditem \</doc>

A flurry of major cash deals came through on Wednesday, which was themed Finance Day at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. Hundreds of banks and funds joined an alliance seeking to align the financial sector with the Paris Agreement, numerous nations promised improved climate finance for the developing world, and the United Kingdom announced the "first ever net-zero financial center". COP 26 President Alok Sharma said those deals and more were needed in order to "meet the commitments made in the Paris Agreement". "We need developed countries to deliver on public finance, and to unleash the trillions required in private investment to create a net-zero future and protect lives and livelihoods from the devastating effects of climate change," he said. On Wednesday, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney announced that banks and funds controlling 40 percent of the world's assets have aligned with the Paris target to limit global warming to below 2 C, and preferably closer to 1.5 C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ, has swollen its ranks to include 450 financial institutions from 45 countries, said Carney, who also chairs the alliance. The initiative was launched in April, with an initial 160 companies on board, responsible for assets in excess of $70 trillion. With a number of banks joining in Glasgow, the alliance now controls assets in the region of $130 trillion. All signatories to the alliance are required to set aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net-zero carbon emissions no later than 2050, in line with the Paris goals, which Carney estimates will require $100 trillion in finance. "We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance, so that every financial decision takes climate change into account," said Carney. "Only this mainstream focus can finance the estimated $100 trillion of investment needed over the next three decades for a clean energy future." UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said that the alliance represents a major step toward realizing the Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015. "Six years ago, Paris set the ambition," said Sunak, the UK's finance minister. "Today in Glasgow, we are providing the investment we need to deliver that ambition." Sunak also announced that the UK will become what he called the "first ever net-zero aligned financial center". He said the government will make it mandatory for companies to publish a "clear, deliverable plan" setting out how they will decarbonize and transition to net-zero. Sunak said an independent task force will be set up to hold enterprises to account. A number of rich nations upped their annual commitments to climate finance on Wednesday. The United States, the UK, Spain, Australia, Norway, Ireland and Luxembourg were among the nations increasing climate finance intended for regions vulnerable to climate change. Climate finance is one of the most contentious topics at this year's COP, since rich countries failed to deliver on a promise of a combined $100 billion in annual funds to developing countries by 2020. China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said that it is imperative rich countries make good on this pledge, telling reporters at COP 26 that missing the target "had a negative impact on mutual trust between developed and developing countries". Sharma said that finance from developed nations is now trending toward achieving the $100 billion target by 2022. "Over the five-year period from 2021 to 2025, we will likely be above $500 billion in aggregate," he added. This year's COP will also see the launch of discussions on a new global finance goal to replace the $100 billion goal from 2025. COP 26 Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa cautioned that pledges and targets are one thing, but that ensuring those funds are put to work on the low-carbon transition is its own challenge. "We also need to see how we are getting from these announcements to the mobilization of the trillions that are required," she said.

By Yang Feiyue | China Daily | Updated: 2022-01-19 08:22 Youth delegates pose for a photo at the China Pavilion during a side event of the 25th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP25, in 2019. CHINA DAILY Young people are taking the lead in addressing environmental and biodiversity challenges. Twenty-year-old Cheng Haosheng from Macao\u-243 currently studying at Tsinghua University's School of Environment in Beijing\u-243 is one of them. He easily recalls his experience late last year at the Global Youth Summit on Net-Zero Future held by the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate. The alliance was initiated by Tsinghua University and is now composed of 15 universities worldwide, including Oxford in the United Kingdom, Yale in the United States and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The summit featured more than 30 student-led events, such as a climate-research competition, a Voice Track where students delivered their multimedia messages about climate change and a hackathon to energize youngsters to come up with innovative solutions. It is aimed at being a springboard for the world's youth to take a more active role in mobilizing leadership and demonstrating the collective strengths of higher education institutions in facing pressing environmental issues, according to the alliance. "I recorded a video for the Voice Track, sharing what I witnessed during Typhoon Hato, my thoughts on climate change and the awareness campaigns and community work I have done in Macao," Cheng says. Cheng helped draft a youth declaration with students from around the globe during the summit. The declaration calls upon governments to take notice of the effects of the climate crisis. Cheng also played a positive role in writing media releases about each event during the summit and publishing them online. "I realized once again the importance of regional and global cooperation for combating climate change. Many scholars, students, young people and citizens from around the globe are already working on the issue," Cheng says. In November, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP26 ) displayed his video to its audience of global climate leaders. Cheng developed a sense of crisis when he was a teenager. "I learned we have been burning a lot of fossil fuels that could not be regenerated, and that if we do not start implementing energy reform, we will face a resource-scarcity crisis," he says. "No power and no light, and that was beyond comprehension for me, since I relied on electricity and electronic devices every day." He has since taken the lead in hosting various environmental protection activities throughout middle school. He shot a film publicizing the benefits of not using disposable water bottles and negotiated with grocery stores about encouraging students to prepare their own utensils with credit points. \</doc>

The two-week 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is underway in Glasgow, the U.K. As the largest climate conference since the 2015 COP21, COP26 has attracted worldwide attention. The climate conference is fraught with difficulties in negotiations and has been shrouded in a strong sense of crisis since the opening. This is precisely where the hope of mankind lies, turning this sense of crisis into practical actions to achieve the global climate goals. Climate change has driven mankind to form a real community with a shared future. The "Paris Agreement" reached in 2015 proposed to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 C compared with pre-industrial levels. COP26 , which was originally scheduled to be held in November 2020 but was postponed because of Covid-19, is the first Conference of the Parties held since the implementation of the Paris Agreement. COP26 has two main focuses: The parties should update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and should improve the "market mechanism," that was not agreed upon at COP25. The assistance of developed countries to developing countries has also received much attention. A few days before the opening of the conference, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report showing that under current emission reduction measures, the average global temperature will rise by 2.7 C by the end of this century, far higher than the goal set by the Paris Agreement. This would lead to catastrophic consequences. Many consider COP26 to be our last chance to prevent this, otherwise climate change and its consequences will be irreversible. However, at the G-20 Summit in Rome before COP26 , the climate negotiations between the leaders of the 20 countries - which together are responsible for more than 80% of global carbon emissions - made little progress. U.K. Prime Minister and COP26 host Boris Johnson has said that the conference is very likely to end in failure. On the first day of COP26 , United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres flatly denied that the climate is improving. He said that all nations' addiction to fossil fuels must stop to "save humankind" because right now, "we are digging our own graves." His sharp words are not an exaggeration aimed at scaring people. Unless the representatives of the 197 Parties make more serious promises at COP26 , the Paris Agreement will be a mere scrap of paper. Essentially, all this is caused by a flaw in the current global climate governance system - the "lack of a compelling force." Though the Paris Agreement proposed the goals for global climate governance, it has not allocated emission reduction tasks to each country. Instead, it is expecting each country to voluntarily submit their NDCs. On this basis, the results will be inspected every five years, as the goals are updated. The Paris Agreement does not have any compulsory constraints or punitive measures. Because of the hidden underlying problems in global climate governance, the rare cooperation between countries and their joint efforts under the framework of the Paris Agreement are highly commendable. The current sense of crisis highlights the urgency of the human response to climate change and the significance of the COP26 . This can be seen as an awakening and driving force of great significance. The key is each Party's willingness to act. COP26 still has a chance to bring about a positive change. As Johnson said, "We have to move from talk and debate and discussion to concerted, real-world action on coal, cars, cash and trees." As the climate crisis is getting increasingly serious, more and more countries start to take practical actions. However, some countries are still hesitating. Alhough they have made promises to follow their schedules of net-zero emission, they are not willing to give their words to the medium-term goal of 2030. This needs to change. Developed countries and large carbon emitters should lead the way in battling climate change. As the largest carbon emitter in the world, China has actively fulfilled its commitments and effectively showed its execution. On Nov. 1, President Xi Jinping pointed out in his written speech to COP26 that China expects reinforcing actions from each party to battle the challenges brought by climate change together with the rest of the world, making joint efforts to save the Earth - our one and only home. Recently, China submitted two documents to the Secretariat of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, and made its "dual-carbon goals" a formal commitment to its nationally determined contribution (NDCs). In addition, China has released the Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful Implementation of the New Development Philosophy and the Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030. It will also successively release implementation plans for key industries to form a "1+N" policy system for the two carbon goals. China's commitment and actions not only meet the needs of its own high-quality development, but also demonstrate its sense of responsibility as a major country. To tackle climate change and turn the sense of crisis into action requires the cooperation of all countries, especially the major carbon emitters. If they have any hesitation or bicker over historical responsibilities while taking little with no action, pointing to carbon emissions as something included in the "right of development," we will lose our last chance. Further, climate issues cannot be used as a bargaining chip when it comes to other issues. The game between countries in dealing with climate change is reminiscent of the "prisoner's dilemma," but no country can afford the consequences of opportunistic actions. No country can win if the Earth's ecosystem collapses. In the global action on climate change, it is vital to strengthen the cooperation between China and the U.S. Together, the two countries' carbon emissions account for more than 40% of the world's total. Given the current status of their relations, there is a lot of doubt whether they can finally cooperate to fight climate change and find an "oasis" in the "desert" of the China-U.S. relationship. Encouragingly, a few days ago, when the heads of the two countries spoke over the phone, the Chinese side specifically pointed out that the relevant departments of the two countries could continue the dialogue to promote coordination and cooperation on climate change and other major issues. The U.S. also said that they looked forward to strengthening communication and cooperation with China on climate change and other important issues to reach a wider consensus. This hard-won consensus should be reflected at COP26 . COP26 .

ROME, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- The summit of the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies is about to kick off in Italy's capital amid tight security measures and with a packed agenda. The summit will be preceded by a G20 Joint Finance and Health Ministers' meeting, which will also be hosted by Rome on Friday. VACCINES, CLIMATE AMONG TOP ISSUES According to Italy, holder of the G20 Presidency since Dec. 1, 2020, the summit's agenda will cover the most pressing global health and economic issues related to the coronavirus pandemic. These would include the need for the most developed economies to boost their efforts to ensure the fair and equitable global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, especially to low-income countries. Earlier this month, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres launched an appeal for some 8 billion U.S. dollars to speed up vaccination. The plan unveiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) aims at immunizing 70 percent of the planet's population by mid-2022. The G20 leaders are also expected to discuss climate change, digital transformation and sustainable innovation, along with such issues as the situation in Afghanistan, on which Italy called an extraordinary G20 meeting earlier in October. Since the G20 Summit is scheduled to take place just before the opening of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland (Oct. 31-Nov. 12), the leaders in Rome are expected to discuss a common strategy in coping with climate change. The G20 countries have yet to agree on whether they should commit to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by around mid-century and also on the timing of the related decarbonization process. Security will be tight in and around Rome's La Nuvola Convention Center in the EUR district, which will host the G20 Summit. Rome's airspace will be closed from Thursday to Nov. 1., although the city's Fiumicino and Ciampino airports will be allowed to operate. The Italian capital's police ranks will be bolstered by 500 extra officers, and Carabinieri (military police) and special units will be deployed across the city to ensure security. Set up in 1999, the G20 serves as a main forum for international cooperation on financial and economic issues. It comprises 19 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, plus the European Union. Together, the G20 members represent almost two-thirds of the planet's population and accounted for some 80 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and over 75 percent of global trade in 2020.

Britain\' s Queen Elizabeth has pulled out of the COP26 conference in Glasgow next week after she was advised by doctors to rest, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday, raising concerns about the 95-year-old monarch\' s health. A palace source said the decision not to attend had been taken as a  sensible precaution and to let everyone know in advance. The 95-year-old queen remains in good spirits and wants COP26 to be a success, the source added.  Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said.  Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the Evening Reception of COP26 on Monday, 1st November. The world\' s oldest and longest-reigning monarch stayed overnight in hospital yesterday after undergoing  preliminary investigations for an unspecified but not COVID-19 related ailment. Aides gave no details on what had prompted the medical attention, which followed the cancellation of a visit to Northern Ireland, and some royal correspondents said they hoped the official version of events painted the full picture. She carried out her first official engagement since the hospital stay earlier on Tuesday, holding two virtual audiences to welcome new ambassadors to Britain from South Korea and Switzerland. Elizabeth, who is queen of 15 other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand and next year celebrates 70 years on the throne, is known for her robust health. She is still carrying out many public duties. Last Tuesday she hosted a drinks reception at Windsor Castle for billionaire business leaders, including Bill Gates, attending a green investment conference ahead of COP26 . News of the cancellation is likely to raise concerns about her health. She was recently overheard saying she was irritated by world leaders who talked about climate change but did nothing to tackle it. The queen had been due to attend an evening event next Monday at the conference where world leaders will meet, including US President Joe Biden and the prime ministers of Britain, Australia and India. She will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded message, the palace added. Elizabeth\' s son and heir, Prince Charles, and his eldest son, Prince William, are still due to attend. Britain has cast COP26 , which begins on Sunday, as the last big chance to slow rising temperatures, and it hopes to persuade leaders to adopt tougher climate targets. Chinese President Xi Jinping is not expected to attend, however, and Russia\' s President Vladimir Putin is also not coming. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was  touch and go as to whether COP26 would succeed. \</doc>

Negotiators who have gathered at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , to find ways to ensure that the world meets its climate targets have been invited to put their faith in banks and global investors to save the planet. In an initiative that has been greeted with skepticism from climate campaigners, a coalition of banks, insurance companies and investment firms committed $100 trillion of private capital to help the world meet net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050. The idea is that these big spenders\u-243 they include some of the biggest international banks\u-243 will direct their clients' money toward planet-saving investments and shun the fossil fuels that are contributing to global warming. So far 450 financial institutions, spread across 45 countries, have signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a coalition convened by the United Nations in April under the leadership of Mark Carney, the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance. Carney, the Canadian former head of the United Kingdom's central bank, said, "We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account." The theory behind the idea is that governments alone do not have the resources to fund the energy transition and that private money is vital to ensuring its success. However, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero has been the target of criticism from climate campaigners because it allows the loophole of continuing to finance fossil fuel extraction during the transition. Carney believes big investors will have an interest in funding a clean energy transformation because that is where future profits lie. He said there was no reason investors backing low-carbon projects should have to make do with lower returns. Despite this lure of future profits, big banks were reported ahead of COP 26 to be resisting any commitment to end financing of all new oil, gas and coal exploration projects this year. Putting big investors in charge of saving the planet might seem tantamount to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse. Anyone who lived through the 2008 financial crisis can recall that it was prompted by the reckless mortgage investments of big banks looking for easy profits. It was left to governments to use taxpayer money to bring the world financial system back from the brink. Left to its own devices, investment money inevitably seeks out the most profitable projects, regardless of the implications for wider society. Big tobacco and big oil are among the sectors that have sought to maximize their profits by resisting pressure to limit the damage they cause. Developed capitalist societies have also tended to prioritize the concept of shareholder value, in which returns on investment are seen as more important than the goods and services any given company produces or the way it treats its employees and customers. That raises the question of whether the world can rely on the goodwill of asset managers and big corporations to do the right thing when it comes to the climate issue, or whether legislation will be required instead. COP 26 "This includes carbon pricing, bans on internal combustion vehicles, national targets to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures," he wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times. He invited investors to assess who was part of the proposed$100 trillion green transition revolution and to ask whether it includes their bank, insurer, mutual fund manager or pension fund. His remarks were an invitation to investors themselves to keep the banks and asset managers to their commitments. Investors and the corporations they finance have had to burnish their green credentials in recent years, reflecting pressure from ethical investors who demand societal benefits as well as a return on their money. COP 26 in part to convince customers and investors that they are doing their bit for the planet. Some climate campaigners have dismissed such tactics as "green-washing", a phenomenon linked more to image building than to genuine climate action. Activists challenge the credibility of banks that continue to finance fossil fuels. While the jury is still out on whether COP 26 will be judged as a success, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and her supporters have already declared it a failure. Perhaps with the banks in mind, she declared: "It should be obvious that we cannot solve the crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place."

By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-18 09:16 A lying Buddha statue is seen during the flood at a Temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand, on Oct 6, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Decisions make 'critical steps forward' but developed world yet to honor pledge Climate experts say that the Glasgow Climate Pact, signed at COP26 over the weekend, achieved key progress on international global warming policy, but did not go far enough on addressing the impacts of climate change in the developing world. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries and regions signed on to the pact at the 26th United Nations Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in the Scottish city on Saturday. Reaching a consensus was not guaranteed and was an achievement in itself, and parties reached landmark agreements in a number of areas including deforestation and fossil fuel reduction. But scientists have pointed out that collective emissions reductions targets, which are known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, are not enough to keep global average temperatures to within 2 and 1.5 C this century, a target laid out in the Paris Agreement. The pact itself recognizes that a gulf remains between what countries have pledged and what is needed to keep Paris goals in sight, and the text urges nations to come back to the table with improved NDCs. Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London, said he is "proud, hopeful, and deeply concerned" about the outcome of COP26 . At COP26 , negotiators finally agreed on key outstanding aspects of multilateral climate policy, including the finalization of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which concerns carbon markets. "I'm deeply concerned, because climate change is raging and is worsening each year we wait," Rogelj added. "The progress at COP26 was the best the world was willing to do at this stage-kudos to the UK COP26 team-but it is not enough, not by far." The Glasgow pact is the first to explicitly call for the "phasing down" of unabated coal projects and "inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies this decade. An earlier version of the text, which requested for the "phasing out" of coal, was amended following opposition by developing countries. Dann Mitchell, a climate science professor at the University of Bristol, said that the pact "is more than we expected, but less than we hoped". "While it is clearly disappointing that at the 11th hour India challenged the phrase 'phasing out of coal', their entire infrastructure is highly dependent on coal, something the richest countries used to become the global superpowers they are today," Mitchell said. "India's per capita carbon dioxide emissions are an order of magnitude lower than the highest-emitting countries, and clearly India felt that not enough was done to support their transition to green energy." During COP26 This finance is meant to support developing countries adapting to the impacts of climate change, as well as provide "loss and damage" compensations for those impacts that are not preventable. The Glasgow pact expressed "deep regret" that rich nations had missed finance goals and urged them to increase funding. "With respect to climate justice ( COP26 ) is a failure though, with the $100 billion from the developed countries still not committed and no real financial support for loss and damage," Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said. Alyssa Gilbert, director of policy and translation at the Grantham Institute, said that loss and damage was a "bigger and clearer discussion in this COP" than it was at previous conferences, though the issue was "still not addressed head-on". "This topic will remain essential to developing nations and an international compromise is not clear yet," Gilbert said. \</doc>

By XU WEI | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-10-30 06:52 The national flags of China and the United Kingdom flutter at World Expo Park in Shanghai on May 31, 2010. [Photo/IC] He highlights importance of mutual trust in phone talks with Johnson President Xi Jinping highlighted on Friday the need for China and the United Kingdom to ramp up cooperation, respond to challenges and enable bilateral relations to stay on the right course and attain steady and sustained development. Speaking during a phone conversation with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Xi underlined the importance of mutual trust, understanding and properly managing differences in bolstering bilateral ties. The talks were held as both leaders are scheduled to take part in the G20 Leaders' Summit over the weekend, with the UK set to host the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP 26 , starting from Sunday in Glasgow. China sees relations with the UK from a strategic and long-term perspective, and hopes the UK can respect facts and view China's development path and system from a comprehensive and objective perspective, he said. Ties between China and the UK, both permanent members of the UN Security Council and major world economies, face opportunities and challenges due to the lingering pandemic and the global economy experiencing an arduous recovery process, the president said. With 2022 marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level, the two nations must maintain good communication, enhance cooperation and help the world conquer the pandemic, achieve better governance and attain growth and prosperity. He welcomed the UK to export more high-quality products to China and to expand bilateral cooperation in healthcare, green development, the digital economy, finance and innovation. China hopes the UK can provide Chinese businesses with fair, just and unbiased treatment, and the nation will also offer British businesses convenience in conducting cooperation in China, he said. The two nations should use the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics as an opportunity to deepen cooperation in sports and people-to-people exchanges, he added. China and the UK should practice true multilateralism, Xi said, adding that he welcomes the UK taking part in the Global Development Initiative to inject impetus into the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The president explained that China's carbon peak and neutrality goals, along with a raft of specific measures to scale up its intended nationally determined contributions, will entail a wide-ranging and profound social and economic transformation and require a step-by-step process and arduous efforts. China's resolve in expediting green development remains unwavering, and it will honor its commitments as always, he said. Xi expressed China's support for the UK's presidency at the COP 26 , saying that it is important to adhere to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and enable different countries to transform their high ambitions into concrete actions. Johnson said he highly values the ties between the UK and China, and he agrees with Xi's views on the growth of bilateral relations. The two nations share consensuses and common interests on issues including global public health, the world economic recovery, the Iran nuclear issue and counterterrorism, he said, highlighting the need for candid conversation and friendly cooperation. The UK is ready to deepen cooperation in trade, economy, education and clean energy with China, and welcomes more Chinese businesses to invest in the nation, he said, adding that the UK will provide an open business environment to firms from China. He said he looks forward to maintaining close communication with China on the issue of global climate change and biodiversity protection, and striving to promote balanced and sustainable growth globally. \</doc>

By KARL WILSON in Sydney | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-02 09:11 Climate campaigners gather on Sunday in Amsterdam's Dam Square as they prepare to ride from the Netherlands to the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. KOEN VAN WEEL/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE Editor's Note: As delegates meet in the hope for a meaningful agreement at the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, calls are growing for concrete action to aid nations most at risk from global warming. Though the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow is yet to hit full stride, much of the focus has been on what the major polluters will bring to the table in terms of targets for net zero emissions in the coming decades. But, a world away from the Scottish city, few people fear the consequences of a warming planet as much as do the inhabitants of islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean. And little has been said about what the Pacific island nations stand to lose if no meaningful agreement is reached at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties. Many island nations scattered in the Pacific are already feeling the impact of climate change as sea levels rise. Many sit just meters above sea level. The Pacific Islands Climate Action Network met on Oct 22 and issued a list of demands to world leaders as COP 26 approached, telling them that they must provide "a safe and habitable future for the Pacific islands". The group called on wealthy countries to provide developing states $100 billion a year until 2025 and increase that sum to $750 billion a year beyond 2025 so they can invest in technologies to help live with a changing climate. The former president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, told the virtual gathering of Pacific climate-action organizations that the Glasgow meeting would be the last chance to save Pacific island nations from the worst effects of climate change. Siobhan McDonnell, senior lecturer in the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University in Canberra, said all governments must work harder to ensure that the urgency of the climate situation facing all Pacific island countries is heard at COP 26 . "These are actual costs that are borne now and into the future by Pacific island nations and their people in terms of spiritual loss of place, loss of aspects of culture, burial grounds and loss of attachment to place." "Despite their size, these small island nations as a bloc punch well above their weight on the international stage, and they are not prepared to go down without a fight," Morgan said. Christian Downie, an associate professor in the School of Regulation and Global Governance at the Australian National University, said the Pacific island nations face an existential threat from climate change. "They will be hoping that COP 26 delivers an agreement that is consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5 C." 'Things need to go right' For the Glasgow summit to be deemed a success, a few things need to go right, he said. "First of all, countries need to commit not simply to net zero targets by 2050, but stronger targets for 2030. Without them, there's zero chance the world will hold the rise in global temperatures to 2 C. Major emitters will also need to support developing countries with the finance and technologies to enable them to transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change impacts, including severe flooding and prolonged droughts." Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison late last month announced a plan for the country to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The program, which outlines Australia's whole-of-economy plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, is based on existing policies but is light on detail. Joe Fontaine, lecturer in fire ecology at Murdoch University in Western Australia, described the policy as having all the strength of a "wet paper bag". "All we see is the same rudderless policy vacuum that has been a headwind to investment and innovation to drive decarbonization of the Australian economy," Fontaine said. Referring to the Kyoto Protocol, a UN-sponsored treaty for action against climate change, the academic said: "Taking such a hollow policy to Glasgow will further solidify Australia's reputation as a climate laggard and cheater dating back to Kyoto in 1997." The consequences of such a weak climate policy will be felt by all Australians as the country becomes a dumping ground for old technology, he said. Ian Lowe, an emeritus professor of science, technology and society at Griffith University, said: "It is an extraordinary achievement to use 850 words to make a statement that tells us absolutely nothing about the plan the Australian prime minister says his government has to reach net zero emissions by 2050." \</doc>

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-09-22 09:16 Firefighters try to extinguish a fire in the village of Avgaria, on the island of Evia, Greece, Aug 10, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Their pledge\u-243 which was signed late on Friday by the leaders of Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain\u-243 was triggered by a year of catastrophic forest fires around the Mediterranean Sea that were blamed on climate change. "It's the first time that Mediterranean countries have come together to address such an incredible, common threat and that's hugely significant," the woman in charge of ensuring Athens is ready for rising temperatures told The Guardian newspaper. Eleni Myrivili, the Greek capital's senior advisor for resilience and sustainability, said the Athens Declaration on Climate Change and the Environment in the Mediterranean includes pledges from the nine nations to share information and skills in a wide range of areas. "Until now, we've been toddlers in our response to building climate resilience through transnational collaboration," she told the paper. "What has just been agreed, in both breadth and depth, is a game-changer." Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, said during the EUMed9 Summit that led to the declaration that collaboration will be needed at all levels; involving both the public sector, individuals, and enterprises. "The climate crisis is no longer a distant threat; it has landed firmly on our shores," he said. Greece is one of the EU nations most under threat from climate change and Athens, which sees temperatures in the late 40s C and which is Europe's hottest metropolis, has been tipped to become uninhabitable if temperatures rise too quickly. The country has fought back by appointing a government minister for climate change, and by asking Myrivili to help Athens prepare for extreme temperatures. The nation also hosted and led the EUMed9 Summit. "Kyriakos Mitsotakis is at the forefront of global initiatives to address the climate crisis and protect the natural environment," the Athens-Macedonian News Agency quoted Giannis Oikonomou, a government spokesman, as saying. "These initiatives are vital both for the quality of life and for the prosperity of our society, since tourism and our primary sector are inextricably linked to nature." AMNA noted that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, also attended the summit and said: "We all see that climate change is heavily affecting the Mediterranean region and we need to find solutions." The agreement was forged weeks before the COP26 United Nations climate change conference \</doc>

By Karl Wilson | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-02 08:54 Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks as National Statements are delivered as a part of the World Leaders' Summit at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, on Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] For years, Australia's conservative elite has been in denial of climate change. But now, even the right-wing press owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, which has for more than a decade given voice to climate deniers, has seen some light of reality. Before he became prime minister, Scott Morrison was famously remembered for bringing a lump of coal into the Federal Parliament in February 2017, showing it to the opposition and saying, "This is coal\u-243 don't be afraid!" Now, Morrison has traveled to Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , with a "climate plan". The plan is short on detail, long on rhetoric and, as one academic put it, "has about as much weight as a wet paper bag". Australia is one of the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, or CO2. It is also the biggest exporter of thermal and metallurgical coal, as well as one of the world's biggest exporters of natural gas. For months now, Morrison and his Liberal Party-led conservative coalition government have been coming under intense pressure from Australians and allies alike to accept the reality that climate change is real, and that Australia must change its course. So what will Morrison take to Glasgow? Morrison refuses to put together a comprehensive plan that will take Australia to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, fearing a massive electoral backlash from the agricultural and resource sectors of the country. As for the criticism of Australia and its weak attitude toward climate policy, he simply says, "I won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia." On Oct 26, Morrison told reporters in Canberra that the government would target net-zero carbon emissions by 2050"the Australian way", by balancing the risk of climate change without damaging the economy. "Our plan, most importantly, backs Australians to achieve what they want to achieve when it comes to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Australians want to do that, and our plan enables them to do that," Morrison said. But he refuses to release the modeling that he says will take Australia to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Treasury, meanwhile, has said that it has not modeled the effects of climate change and emissions reductions on the nation's economy for years. The United Nations Environment Programme said in a report released on Oct 26 that the latest climate commitments of nations fall far short of what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Even if all 2030 climate targets are met, the planet will warm by at least 2.7 C this century, it said. That would mean missing the Paris accord's goal to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 C. Business groups are backing limits on carbon emissions as the International Monetary Fund says the world needs a price on carbon, but the Australian government is ruling out both carbon caps and a carbon price. None of this sits well with Australia's Pacific neighbors, who were expecting more from the country. Nor does it sit well with many of Australia's allies, including the United States, which expected something more ambitious. Morrison has squandered a golden opportunity to show leadership on the climate issue in Australia. No one denies there will be pain as coal and gas give way to new, clean sources of energy, but that is where the real benefits will come from. A greener future will create new investment, new jobs and opportunities. Unless Australia embraces the new reality with a climate policy that looks forward rather than backward, it will become a dumping ground for old, useless technology and the cost will be felt by all Australians. What Australia, and indeed the world, wanted to hear from Morrison was a comprehensive analysis of how to get to net-zero under different scenarios, to drive technological change and economic development. They also wanted to hear about a clear path for investment in green energy and how the country will handle the inevitable social and regional impacts of transition. Here lies the reality for Australia: Like it or not, change will happen\u-243 except it will not be led by the federal government, but instead by the states and territories and the private sector. As one commentator put it: "A commitment to net-zero emissions is a ticket to entry to the international climate negotiations. Yet committing to 2050 targets without immediate actions to get there is simply another form of delay." The author is a China Daily correspondent based in Sydney.

By Prime Sarmiento and Yang Han in Hong Kong | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-16 20:13 The virtual meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden may help pave the way to a "pragmatic working relationship" that will benefit not only both sides but also other trading partners that rely on stable relations between the two major powers, analysts said. The Nov 16 meeting between the two leaders was the first of its kind since Biden took office in January, despite their talks twice over the phone, in February and September. During the three-hour discussions, Xi said China and the United States "should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation". He expressed the hope that Biden will demonstrate political leadership and steer America's China policy back on the track of reason and pragmatism. "As the world's two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development," Xi said. Lucio Blanco Pitlo III, research fellow at the Manila-based foreign policy think tank Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation Inc, welcomed the virtual meeting, noting that it is a "good signal for the world that the two major powers are finding ways to engage in a high-level dialogue". The China-US virtual meeting can lead to "a working relationship that is pragmatic and acceptable to both sides," said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. Oh said no one would like to see increased tension between US and China as that would also hurt trade and investment flows. He also cited Xi's statement on how a sound and steady China-US relationship can help resolve some of the world's most pressing problems. Xi said during the virtual meeting that sound and steady bilateral ties are key to finding effective responses to global challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that climate change can well become a new highlight of China-US cooperation. Oh said both countries have already taken the first step towards that direction when China and US have agreed to boost climate cooperation during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) that concluded on Nov 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. China and the US issued a joint declaration in COP26 where they pledged to enhance actions on climate change. The declaration was widely welcomed and is expected to strengthen global climate action. "Xi has identified the pandemic and climate change as potential areas for cooperation. In the recently concluded ( COP26 ) meeting in Glasgow, US and China worked well. They joined hands to lower (the global) temperature. That's a good start," Oh said. Pitlo of APPFI said the joint statement on climate change is a "good platform for cooperation". He also sees the China-US dialogue as a way to ease tension, noting that the two sides may use the dialogue "to manage strategic competition". Pitlo said that for member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the tense US-China relationship will continue to complicate efforts by ASEAN countries to engage both partners. During the meeting, Xi told Biden that China might have to take resolute measures, should the separatist forces for "Taiwan independence provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line." He attributed the new wave of tensions across the Taiwan Strait to the repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China. Koh King Kee, president of the Centre for New Inclusive Asia, a Kuala Lumpur-based think tank, said the key message from both leaders is that "both sides are sincere in wanting to reduce the tension between the two countries and improve their relationship". Koh expects the US' policy on China will likely to continue to involve competition, cooperation and confrontation. He hopes to see more cooperation than confrontation after the virtual meeting. "China will remain firm on issues like Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. China will not compromise however, I would expect some easing of trade relations. Very likely, the US side will lift some tariff on Chinese goods because the US is also pressured by (rising) inflation," he said. Koh said the ASEAN countries will welcome improved relations or eased tension between China and the US because ASEAN countries do not want to take sides in the China-US rivalry. "ASEAN centrality is the consensus of all ASEAN member states," he said. \</doc>

NAIROBI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference underway in Glasgow, Scotland is yet to come up with concrete steps to advance Africa's green agenda, campaigners said on Monday. Mithika Mwenda, executive director of Nairobi-based green lobby, Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) decried lackluster attention to the climate crisis in the continent at COP 26 . "Our priority issues like climate finance have not been placed at the heart of discussions at Glasgow summit and lack of political will from major economies will impair climate action in Africa," Mwenda said in a statement issued in Nairobi. He said the plea by the African Group of Negotiators for robust adaptation financing and technology transfer is yet to be heeded at the Glasgow summit, hence threatening the continent's realization of a climate-resilient future. According to Mwenda, failure to recognize and act on the unfolding climate crisis in Africa at COP 26 would be detrimental to the survival of grassroots communities and their habitats. He said declarations should be followed by tangible actions to strengthen the resilience of Africa's indigenous communities, subsistence farmers, fishermen and pastoralists in the face of climate-related disasters. Godwin Ojo, a Nigerian green advocate said the concerns of Africa's grassroots communities that have borne the brunt of the climate crisis have not been adequately addressed at COP 26 . He said that an inclusive dialogue is urgent to address the financing gap that has derailed climate action in a continent already reeling from extreme weather events that have in turn escalated poverty, hunger, water stress and infectious diseases. Ojo said the success of the Glasgow climate summit will be dependent on the industrialized north honoring carbon-cutting commitments alongside financial pledges to boost green transition in Africa. Robert Muthami, a Nairobi-based climate policy analyst said that an inclusive and transparent process at COP 26 was a prerequisite to delivering climate justice in Africa. Muthami said the Glasgow summit should prioritize the deployment of resources, technologies and best practices that could improve climate resilience in the continent. He cited early warning, green energy innovations, harnessing of nature-based interventions as crucial to tame climatic shocks that pose an existential threat to Africa's stability. Enditem \</doc>

Indian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav (first right) meets with UN Climate Change Conference or COP26 President Alok Sharma (first left) in New Delhi, India on Wednesday during Sharma's three-day visit to India for discussions with ministers and leaders from the industry and civil society on collaboration on climate action. Photo: AFP A global network of more than 1,500 climate NGOs called on Britain to postpone the upcoming COP26 summit, saying Tuesday that a lack of COVID-19 vaccines risked sidelining developing countries. An increase in COVID-19 cases, unequal global vaccine rollout, and stringent quarantine requirements for more than 60 "red list" nations or territories hoping to attend the 12-day UN talks mean that "a safe, inclusive and just global climate conference is impossible," the Climate Action Network (CAN) said in a statement. "We have concerns that those countries, most deeply affected by the climate crisis and suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines, will be left out," said Tasneem Essop, CAN's executive director. "There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis." But the United Nations rejected the call to delay the COP26 summit. "For now, no changes are planned, but we understand the concerns," UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said of the UN Climate Change Conference set to kick off on October 31 in Glasgow, Scotland. Host government Britain had also pushed back saying the climate crisis was too urgent for the meeting to be put off. A recently released UN climate science report shows "why COP26 must go ahead this November to allow world leaders to come together and set out decisive commitments to tackle climate change," COP President Alok Sharma told AFP, noting the conference has already been postponed once. "The global scientific community has made clear that climate change is now a global emergency," Haq said. "Only an urgent and major step up in climate action can keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach, and protect the most vulnerable countries from worsening climate impacts." He added that UN authorities are working with London "to make COP as safe and inclusive as possible, including offering vaccines to all participants and paying for hotel quarantine costs where quarantine is required."\~ Civil society campaigners, who play a crucial watchdog role as registered observers, will also likely face restricted access, CAN warned.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Saturday that the outcome of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, or COP26 , is not enough. "The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps. But unfortunately, the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions," he said in a statement on the conclusion of COP26 . "Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade, specifically, a 45-percent cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions, even if fully implemented, will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels," he said. He welcomed the agreement between the United States and China in Glasgow that pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s. To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, there is a need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how. This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies, he said. "I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage," said Guterres. "Adaptation isn't a technocratic issue, it is life or death. Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity. It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest." "We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe. Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility. That means finally delivering on the 100-billion-dollar climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs. It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition ... And it means, beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement, establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors." He said COP26 created some building blocks for progress: commitments to end deforestation, to drastically reduce methane emissions, to mobilize private finance around net-zero emissions. And the texts today reaffirm resolve toward the 1.5-degree goal, boost climate finance for adaptation, recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage. And for the first time they encourage international financial institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights. And finally, they close the Paris rule book with agreement on carbon markets and transparency, he noted. The UN chief remained cautiously optimistic about the future. "Success or failure is not an act of nature. It's in our hands. The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches. As the great Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson said: 'Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.' We have many more seeds to plant along the path. We won't reach our destination in one day or one conference. But I know we can get there. We are in the fight of our lives," he said. "COP27 starts now." \</doc>

A FLEET of 22 electric buses, jointly developed by Shenzhen-based vehicle manufacturer BYD and the U.K.\' s largest bus and coach producer Alexander Dennis Ltd. (ADL), will operate the official delegate shuttle service at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, BYD and ADL announced Thursday. The shuttle service is said to provide all attending delegates with a frequent link between the city center and the conference venue Scottish Event Campus during the conference. The fully electric buses, called BYD ADL Enviro200EV single-deckers, are built in Scotland by the BYD-ADL partnership. These buses can operate up to 160 miles (257.5 kilometers) on a full charge with zero emissions. The buses are partially funded through Transport Scotland\' s Scottish Ultra Low Emission Bus Scheme (SULEB), which aims to meet the Scottish Government\' s transport decarbonization targets. Frank Thorpe, managing director of BYD U.K., said,  It is an honor for BYD to be associated with such an important global event for climate change, with BYD ADL British-built electric buses in operation as part of the COP26 delegate shuttle service. In addition, on March 30 this year, ADL and BYD announced an order from Scottish public transportation operator First Bus for 126 zero-emission buses for Glasgow, composed of 91 double-decker buses and 35 single-deckers, the largest ever for electric buses in Scotland. These are also all partially funded by the Scottish Government. \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that COP26 UN Climate Change Conference is "a turning point" for the world. "I think the Glasgow COP26 is a turning point for the world. And it's the moment when we have to grow up and take our responsibilities," Johnson told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York following the closing of the Informal Leaders Roundtable on Climate Action. Calling on the rich countries to honor their pledge to provide each year 100 billion U.S. dollars for the climate action in the developing countries, the prime minister said that "it is the developing world that is bearing the brunt of catastrophic climate change in the forms of hurricanes and fires and floods and the real long-term economic damage that they face." "It's the developed world that over 200 years has put the carbon in the atmosphere that is causing this acceleration of climate change and, say, it really is up to us to help them," he added. Earlier, Johnson told the roundtable that "history will judge" the world's richest nations if they fail to deliver on their pledge to commit 100 billion dollars in annual climate aid ahead of COP26 . He placed the chances of securing the money before November at "six out of 10." "We cannot let climate action become another victim of coronavirus. Let us be the leaders who secure the very health of the planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come," Johnson said at the event. The prime minister also assured his country "will lead by example, keeping the environment on the global agenda and serving as a launch pad for a global green industrial revolution." However, he warned that "no one country can turn the tide, it would be akin to bailing out a liner with a single bucket." The roundtable follows the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, signaling a "code red for humanity," and comes less than six weeks before the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. The roundtable addresses the gaps that remain on the actions urgently needed from national governments -- especially the G20 -- on mitigation, finance and adaptation. Enditem \</doc>

GENEVA, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- The COVID-19 pandemic did not slow the relentless advance of climate change, and as the planet is committed to dangerous future global warming, the world is still significantly off-schedule to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations (UN) said in a report released on Thursday. Following a peak in 2019, last year COVID-19 resulted in an extraordinary drop in global fossil CO2 emissions from the use of coal, oil, gas and cement. However, the short-term reduction "will not significantly bring down emissions by 2030 unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization," said the "United in Science 2021" report compiled by multiple UN agencies, including the World Meteorological Organization, the UN Environment Program, the World Health Organization and other partners. "This is a critical year for climate action. This report by the United Nations and global scientific partner organizations provides a holistic assessment of the most recent climate science. The result is an alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. The report warned that rising global temperatures are fueling devastating extreme weather events throughout the world, with spiraling impacts on economies and societies. The average global temperature for the past five years was among the highest on record. There is an increasing likelihood that temperatures will temporarily breach the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the next five years. The signatories to the Paris Agreement, a 2015 landmark climate accord, pledged to keep global warming "well below" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and strive for a lower limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. But the global effort has already fallen way short of goals. "We are still significantly off-schedule to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement," the UN secretary general said. "This year has seen fossil fuel emissions bounce back, greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise and severe human-enhanced weather events that have affected health, lives and livelihoods on every continent. "Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be impossible, with catastrophic consequences for people and the planet on which we depend," he warned. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land, and the scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole is unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. Human-induced climate change is already increasing the frequency and intensity of weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. With the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Guterres has called on all countries to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, backed up by concrete long-term strategies, and to cut global emissions by 45 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-25 09:29 People take part in a Climate March in Brussels, Belgium, ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Oct 10, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Details of Paris Agreement need to be ironed out at UN's summit in Glasgow It will be more difficult to reach a climate-change deal at the United Nations' COP26 summit than it was finding consensus for the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the man in charge of the gathering that starts on Oct 31. Alok Sharma, the United Kingdom Cabinet minister who is also president of COP26 , told The Guardian newspaper he is under no illusions about the size of the task ahead. "What we're trying to do here in Glasgow is actually really tough," he told the paper. "It was brilliant what they did in Paris, it was a framework agreement, (but) a lot of the detailed rules were left for the future." "It's like, we've got to the end of the exam paper and the most difficult questions are left and you're running out of time; the exam's over in half an hour and you go, 'How are we going to answer this one?'" he said. National leaders and negotiating teams will be trying to find ways to limit the emission of greenhouse gases, to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5 C more than pre-industrial levels. Most greenhouse gases are attributed to the burning of fossil fuels, so finding ways to limit that will be a major part of the talks. But, with nations consuming more fossil fuels today than ever, and with less-developed countries pointing out that developed nations may want to compensate them for forgoing their industrial revolutions, there will likely be much compromising. "This is definitely harder than Paris on lots of levels," Sharma told The Guardian. " (But) what we have going for us is that there is an understanding that we need to deal with this." The UK published its road map to reducing its carbon footprint last week. Its net-zero strategy calls for $90 billion of mainly private-sector investment to be directed at its environmental initiatives. With Sharma highlighting the difficulty of the task ahead, high-profile climate activist Greta Thunberg told the BBC people should not pin all their hopes on governments improving the situation. "The change is going to come when people are demanding change," she said. "So, we can't expect everything to happen at these conferences." She said she will attend the COP26 summit, where the most important commodity will be the truth. "Be honest about where you are, how you have been failing, how you're still failing us," she said. She added committing to producing less carbon will not be enough, if countries then "look for loopholes". With world leaders, senior politicians, and officials heading for Glasgow, Scotland's Daily Record newspaper said the security services are monitoring "more than 800 potential terrorists" over fears they may target the event. Former colonel Philip Ingram told the paper the gathering amounts to a "very ripe target "for terrorists, and one that means there is a "high potential" someone will try something. MI5, the UK's counter-intelligence and security agency, said the UK terror threat level is currently "substantial". \</doc>

During the ongoing 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , the International Panel on Climate Change has emphasized that, unless immediate climate actions are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's temperature is set to rise 2.7 C within this century. But the global negotiations in Glasgow must operate according to the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including equity among the negotiating parties and common but differentiated responsibilities. Can COP 26 Countries have enough to worry about besides climate change, including the COVID pandemic, energy security, constraints to open trade and geopolitical strife. In the face of these mounting concerns, there is a risk that constantly discussing our shared responsibility for tackling climate change may even have the opposite effect, and that "climate fatigue" will result in people lowering the sights. Leaders need to deliver, as the time has passed for diplomatic niceties. The key to restoring the appetite for concerted action by developing countries to tackle climate change could lie in demystifying climate change. This could be done by shifting the negotiations from a generic discussion of carbon emissions and climate toward the tangible benefits of moving from a linear to a circular society, in which the smart reuse of resources\u-243 starting with energy\u-243 creates a competitive economy centered on the long-term good. Rather than following current resource intensive consumption, future climate actions should aim for co-benefits with lower initial investment cost. In other words, there is a need to engage the society in a narrative that highlights the very real benefits of a low-carbon future\u-243 benefits that are derived on both a personal and a collective level. It is often argued that funding is limited for climate action, considering the pandemic's impact and subsequent massive government deficits and high levels of unemployment. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit of the United Kingdom has estimated that by roughly doubling the global rate of annual improvement in energy efficiency from 1.3 to about 3 percent per year by 2030, the global energy bill would be reduced by $2.1 trillion per year. Making climate-smart infrastructure could create 6 million jobs by 2030, thereby reducing unemployment. These are persuasive figures\u-243 so where to start to capture these gains? The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, in a recent study titled "Rethinking Low Carbon Green Growth in the Post-COVID World: Toward Net Zero Economy", has proposed three key points of action. Second, investment must be scaled up. Mobilization of the private sector, including development banks, institutional investors and bond markets, is crucial to the financing of low-carbon green growth initiatives. Public financing and development aid are also critical for leveraging the private capital and to meet the Paris climate targets. Third, stronger international cooperation is needed to effectively share knowledge, technology and finance and to coordinate action leading to the effective implementation of strategies such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' Comprehensive Recovery Framework. As countries around the world struggle to repair their pandemic-battered economies, resetting policy measures toward climate actions is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for implementing hard reforms that will simultaneously require technology, regulatory policy and financing innovations. It is therefore in our own economic interests to take an ambitious approach to the COP 26 negotiations in Glasgow on a net-zero economy. That way, we can do the right things for our planet's future, in the knowledge that the economy and citizens will be the first to benefit. The real question is: Do we have the determined vision to see the light and embrace the opportunity at hand with conviction, ambition and commitment?

NAIROBI, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The high-sounding resolutions adopted at the conclusion of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) that took place in Glasgow, Scotland failed to add sparkle to Africa's quest for a future that is green and inclusive, campaigners said on Friday. Augustine Ndjamnshi, chair of the Political and Technical Committee at the Nairobi-based Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) said the continent's green aspirations were not fulfilled at the global climate summit. "After duly considering two weeks of debates, negotiations and decisions, we wish to express disappointment at lack of foresight and determination by parties at COP26 to squarely address the climate emergency in Africa," Ndjamnshi said in a statement issued in Nairobi. He said that African green lobby groups that attended COP26 were concerned by lackluster attention to the continent's unfolding climate crisis that is threatening the survival of local communities and their habitats. In particular, Ndjamnshi regretted that the Glasgow climate summit did not outline specific measures that could be rolled out to boost adaptation financing in Africa, address loss and damages linked to abrupt temperature rise. He noted that COP26 failed to exert sufficient pressure on the industrialized north to honor financial commitment and boost climate response in Africa amid economic and social disruptions triggered by extreme weather events. Ndjamnshi said that COP26 and other multilateral processes have not adequately delivered climate justice to Africa adding that greening the continent's agriculture, infrastructure, energy and tourism sectors remained a major priority. He lauded pledges made by several rich nations at COP26 to halt deforestation and cut down on methane emission adding that their impact will be felt in Africa if they are accompanied by practical measures to tackle climatic shocks like droughts, wildfires, cyclones and floods. Godwin Ojo, a Nigerian green advocate said that Africa is yet to witness genuine commitment by advanced economies to address catastrophic climate impacts like water stress, hunger and energy insecurity that were weighing down on livelihoods. Ojo said Africa was ready to decarbonize its key economic sectors but was constrained by failure among rich economies to deliver sufficient financial and technical support. Enditem \</doc>

A coalition of more than 1,500 environmental groups has called for the postponement of the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow at the end of October, claiming that lopsided global COVID-19 vaccine distribution makes attendance unequal. The talks, delayed by a year because of the pandemic, will run from Oct 31 to Nov 12, and aim to help countries progress toward the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in a bid to limit the impact of climate change. Usually, such a gathering would attract delegates from nearly 200 countries. But with so many places still facing COVID-19 crises, or having limited vaccine programs, protesters calling themselves the Climate Action Network said it is wrong for the summit to go ahead. "Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," Tasneem Essop, the group's executive director, told Reuters. With the issue of climate change having been so visibly demonstrated by extreme weather conditions all over the world this year, the issue's already high stakes were raised further this summer by a report from the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, compiled in conjunction with 234 authors and 195 governments. 'Code red' The report said it was now a "statement of fact" that humanity is damaging the climate, and it is "unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the findings a "code red" warning for humanity and said it increased the burden of responsibility on those taking part in the Glasgow summit. "There is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success," he added. In response to the vaccine protest, a spokesperson for Guterres said the proven urgent nature of the COP26 agenda meant that there was no way it could be delayed any further. The UK government has begun delivering vaccines to conference delegates for the event to take place in time, but the activist coalition said it has not acted fast enough.

US President Joe Biden (left), flanked by US Climate Adviser John Kerry, reacts as they attend a meeting focused on action and solidarity at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, on November 1, 2021. Biden apologized to other world leaders at the COP26 for the Trump administration's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement. Photo: VCG US President Joe Biden, who showed up at COP26 empty-handed, has tried to turn the summit into a "political show" by repeatedly name-checking Chinese and Russian leaders, so he is the real culprit in ceding the effect of negotiations, analysts said, in response to Biden's repeated criticism of the Chinese leader's absence at the summit. In addressing climate change, what we need are firm commitments and continued action. What we don't need are empty slogans, ever-changing policies, luxury motorcades and entourage, irresponsibly exposing numerous people to infection, Zhang Jun, the permanent representative of China to the UN, tweeted on Wednesday. Zhang's remarks were made after Biden, speaking at the end of the second day of COP26 in Glasgow, lashed out at both Chinese and Russian leaders for their absence at the climate summit. Biden also said that China has walked away from the biggest issue of our time, according to the New York Times. In response, Zhang said that "the Chinese leader addressed the meeting [via video link] to share China's solutions on climate change. The Chinese delegation attended the meeting in person. China announced its carbon peak and neutrality targets, and released an action plan and policies. China's achievements have been widely recognized." China has been supporting climate action and we are not the one who withdrew from the Paris Agreement, said Zhang, noting that "the US has backpedaled its climate policies many times. Instead of shifting blame, it should shoulder responsibility and take concrete actions." Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also refuted Biden's statement at a Wednesday briefing, saying that action prevails over hollow promises on tackling global warming.\~\~ We hope the US can shoulder its responsibility, make specific plans on cutting emissions, realize its financial promises and stop backpedalling on climate issues, said Wang.\~ "Leaders participated in the summit mainly for political mobilization. But Chinese leaders have done enough political mobilization on climate issues," said Wang Mou of the research center of urban and environment studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences during a recent online conference. Wang is also a member of the Chinese delegation to COP26 . Wang Mou said President Xi Jinping has participated in multiple meetings on climate change and environmental protection, and made promises at international conferences. "Our leader's determination to push the climate change agenda is unquestionable," he remarked. Biden has tried to turn COP26 into a political show, L\'fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. He said Biden arrived in Glasgow empty-handed, and made him diffident in engaging in climate issues. So he tried to push the political angle of the event.\~\~ The expert also doubted whether Biden really cares about climate change, citing video footage shared by a foreign journalist showing him dozing off and struggling to stay awake at the summit.\~ Some foreign media also chided China and several other countries for not signing a pledge led by the US and the EU to slash emissions of methane by 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels. Emissions of non-carbon dioxide gases, including methane, are not included in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) China submitted before COP26 , Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times. He noted that cutting methane emissions is already included in China's documents such as the Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development, and China is piloting this plan on oil and gas exploration and other areas.\~ The US is the real "hooligan" on the climate issue, said Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. He said that Biden set a high target on curtailing greenhouse emissions at COP26 , and signed a bunch of pledges. But the US Congress' approval is needed for the pledges to take effect, which is unlikely.\~ Xin said that throwing mud at China also exposed Biden's reluctance to contribute to the world's effort on climate change and economic recovery, as well as his attempt to blame China. Experts warned that Biden's politicization of the climate issue would not only obstruct negotiations at COP26 , but also threaten climate cooperation between Beijing and Washington. The US talks about cooperation on one hand, but publicly and technologically thwarts China on the other.\~\~ \</doc>

The virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden on Tuesday will help reduce tensions and open up more space for bilateral cooperation between the world's two largest economies, according to international relations experts. Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said on Wednesday in a tweet, "It looks as if the Biden-Xi meeting has put some 'guardrails' on the 'responsible competition'" between the two countries, and even opened the door to more cooperation and dialogue on key issues. "That's all to be welcomed," he said. "I guess both the US and China are seeking to make their competitive relationship more predictable, opening up also for necessary cooperation in key areas like climate," Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, had tweeted on Tuesday. At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , which ended in Glasgow last week, China and the US surprised many by announcing a joint declaration to work together to fight climate change. Andrey Karneev, head of the School of Asian Studies at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, described the intention of the meeting as "to reduce tensions and agree on regular contacts". "There are areas of the relationship where the prospect of finding a common approach is favorable. Such areas include climate change, the fight against the coronavirus and ensuring sustainability in the energy sector," he said. Harneev said he expects some progress in trade and economic ties, since Biden is facing a difficult domestic economic situation, including high inflation and a shortage of goods due to supply chain disruption. Kinji Matsuo, a philosopher and author in Japan, said the world is concerned about how China and the US will deal with their differences. "It is like two surgeons treating one wound at the same time. Are they going to cooperate well, or do they need a third person to help? We are looking forward to the answers," Matsuo said. Gayle Allard, a professor of economics at IE University in Spain, noting that the US-China relationship is at its worst since the 1970s, said, "It is always a step forward when leaders meet and talk, even if it is virtually, as the two presidents have done." Felix Valdivieso, chairman of IE University's IE China Center, said, "The conversation between the two presidents was ... necessary, fruitful and continuous." He added that this was perhaps the result of the two presidents knowing each other well, having maintained a good relationship since both were vice-presidents. David Shullman, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, said the virtual meeting was "critical to minimizing misperception and the risk of unintended conflict". Wang Xu in Tokyo and Liu Hongjie and Chen Yingqun in Beijing contributed to this story.

BYD, the Shenzhen-based world leader in electric vehicle (EV)technology and manufacturing, has joined government, business, and environmental leaders in signing three agreements at the Glasgow COP26 Climate Change Conference to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles and supporting infrastructure, according to the company. Combined, the three agreements call for global cooperation in speeding up adoption of zero-emission cars, vans, and medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, and creating charging infrastructure. BYD and the other signatories pledge to align public policy and funding as well as private business strategy, production and investment toward achieving ambitious zero-emission vehicle adoption goals. Isbrand Ho, managing director of BYD B.V., offered his expertise at panel discussions on zero-emission transportation infrastructure entitled  Nothing Moves Without It at the COP26 conference. In signing the first agreement, drafted by representatives of the United Kingdom, BYD will join the push for global sales of new cars and vans being zero-emission by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. The agreement calls for governments at all levels to make policies and investments to support EV sales. The agreement also calls for private businesses, such as BYD, to align their business strategies to reach this ambitious goal. BYD also signed an agreement endorsing a global memorandum of understanding calling for countries to have 30 percent of its new medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles to be zero-emission by 2030 and be 100 percent by 2040. BYD is joining government, businesses and environmental organizations to make the transition to zero-emission vehicles easier and more cost-effective by removing strategic, political and technical barriers, and accelerating EV adoption and deployment. This agreement was drafted by the Netherlands and CALSTART, a nonprofit seeking to build a high-tech clean-transportation industry. The third document signed by BYD calls for accelerating the creation of a comprehensive network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The document offers a set of recommendations to reach this goal, including developing e-mobility roadmaps, prioritizing investments in electricity network infrastructure, encouraging private investment, removing financial barriers to the installation of charging infrastructure, and developing charging networks that are open, user-friendly and scalable. BYD ADL pure-electric buses played a prominent role at COP26 . A fleet of 10 BYD ADL Enviro400EV double-decker buses provided zero-emission VIP transportation for world leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. The double-decker e-buses, built in Scotland as part of the BYD ADL partnership, were operated by Stagecoach, the U.K.\' s largest public transport operator. Additionally, BYD ADL e-buses were in operation by First Bus as part of the all-important shuttle service for delegates attending the conference. A fleet of 22 Enviro200EV zero-emission buses, all built in Scotland, were used for this purpose. (SD-Agencies) \</doc>

The political atmosphere in the United States is making Chinese observers cautiously optimistic about the prospect of climate change cooperation between Beijing and Washington, said Ding Zhongli, a geologist and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature. "Leaders from both China and the US have made positive remarks on climate change cooperation, but whether such goodwill can be maintained remains a test for US politicians," said Ding, who took part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2009. With the COP 26 conference on climate change currently taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, global warming is being widely discussed, and many people are looking to China and the US to lead. "Partnership between China and the US is the key to solving most of the world's problems", Ding, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told China Daily, "and that is the perspective from which we need to see climate change." He added that the two countries have the widest range of technologies for tackling climate change and a partnership between them is also key to the world's peaceful development. "President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of cooperation between China and the US, and climate change is no exception. Politicians on both sides have demonstrated positivity toward the matter," Ding said. Still, he warned that such a partnership cannot be taken as a given. "The strategic position of the US is not conducive to mutual benefit and coexistence", he said, commenting on the "competition, cooperation and confrontation" strategy adopted by the Biden administration in its policies toward China. "The US has already threatened to decouple in areas such as technological development, it's hard to say if this might extend to climate-related areas in the future." Ding also pointed out the uncertainty that is stemming from the domestic politics of the US and highlighted the country's track re-cord on international climate cooperation. Viewed from a historical perspective, former president Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is not the only U-turn the US has made on climate change, he said. Nineteen years ago, former president George W. Bush announced that the country would not implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a treaty his predecessor Bill Clinton had signed three years earlier. "A review of the US record on climate change demonstrates at least one thing, the country's two main political parties have not reached consensus on the issue," Ding said. The Trump administration was highly skeptical about climate science and took that skepticism to its logical extent by pulling out of the Paris Agreement last year. The Biden administration reversed the decision, and rejoined this year. For Ding, this going back and forth on the issue is worrying. Looking beyond China and the US, he stressed the importance of developed nations and developing nations enhancing collaboration on climate change. He highlighted the dilemma faced by developing countries, which often have to juggle between improving living standards and cutting emissions. "Developed nations have to fulfill their promises, actively share their technology, and provide financial aid to developing nations," he said, "so developing countries can set a higher starting point for green development."

Xie Zhenhua (C), China's special envoy for climate change, speaks with John Kerry (R), U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, Nov. 13, 2021.Photo: Xinhua Nearly 200 countries seized humanity's "last and best chance" at the COP26 climate summit, during which they reached an agreement to curtail the worsening impact of carbon emissions on the climate, including keeping the all-important goal of 1.5 C alive.\~ Climate scientists hailed the "unprecedented determination of tackling global warming" demonstrated by summit participants, especially developing countries including China and India, as not only underscoring the urgency of the climate issue, but also a stimulus for developed countries to match their promises with actions.\~ The curtain has fallen on COP26 , but nations' race to meet their targets has just begun, and scientists warned countries not to put posture over substance, saying that countries trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and forcing developing countries into unrealistic pledges won't succeed. Global negotiators signed a historic Glasgow Climate Pact on Saturday night to strengthen their 2030 emissions reductions targets by the end of 2022, and asked rich nations to "at least double" the amount of money they give developing countries to adapt to climate change. The final text commits the 197 parties to the Paris agreement to "phase down" unabated coal power and "phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies."\~ The announcement came several hours after the scheduled Friday evening deadline.\~ When the deal was struck, China Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua told reporters, "We have a deal," and gave a thumbs up sign. China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued a statement on Sunday, saying COP26 has been "concluded smoothly," and a new journey for the international community to deal with climate change had begun. During the summit, the Chinese delegation actively participated in negotiations with all parties, said the ministry's statement, noting that China insists all parties have common but differentiated responsibilities, and all countries should stick to their own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). It asked developed countries to further honor their financial promises to developing countries.\~ All participants of COP26 , especially developing countries, have demonstrated unprecedented ambition and determination to tackle climate change, Pan Jiahua, director of the Institute for Urban and Environmental Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.\~ He cited India as an example of a country with a relatively low income, which vowed a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070. "It's almost a mission impossible for India, which relies on coal for 75 percent of its electricity," said Pan, praising India for showing "valuable determination." However, this determination was played down by Western media as they began to chide China and India for weakening coal pledge. In the last-minute change the coal commitment was changed from "phase out" to "phase down." Pan said that with the proportion of coal in its total energy consumption mix being more than twice the world's average, China faces a much more complicated situation in phasing out coal consumption than developed nations. In some European Union countries, the proportion is insignificant or even close to zero. "Developing countries such as China and India are not on the same starting line as Western countries, thus it is unfair to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to ask us to stop using coal altogether," Pan explained, noting that the change of wording actually shows that China will rigorously stick to its promises made on COP26 , "so it strives to make sure the deal is feasible for China in the near future." In contrast, climate analysts pointed out Western countries' hypocrisy in agreeing to at least double their financial assistance to developing countries, considering they are still lagging behind in meeting the $100 billion climate fund pledge, a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\~ Xu Huaqing, a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said in an exclusive interview with Global Times last week that $100 billion should also be a starting point for developed countries to further sustainably increase the funding of climate actions to help developing countries in their efforts and improve the traceability as well as the transparency of climate funds. Setting an example\~ During this widely-watched summit, a joint declaration between China and the US that agreed to accelerate its phasing down of coal this decade surprised the world.\~ The joint declaration between Beijing and Washington injected much-needed stability into COP26 , Li Shuo, Senior Policy Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Global Times. He hailed the two countries' cooperation on the climate issue as laying a political foundation for the conference's breakthroughs, and setting an example for the international community on how to cast aside differences and push forward multilateral cooperation. After the joint declaration was announced on Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted that he welcomed the agreement between China and the US to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade. "Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction," he said.\~ Pan said that the curtain has fallen on COP26 , it is now time for countries to race against time to realize their promises. "Countries' ambitious pledges on COP26 underscore the urgency of tackling global warming, and of our actions, cooperation and respect for common but differentiated responsibilities," he said, warning that any shirking of responsibilities, political bickering and selfishness would deter the world from seizing the last chance of reversing global warming.\~ \</doc>

One of the main outcomes of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) was the agreement to stop logging forests. The countries that have signed the pledge, including Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States, are home to around 85 percent of the world's forests. This agreement is an important achievement as retaining these natural forests are critical for a number of reasons. Old-growth or primary forests provide many services to mankind, such as the provision of water and soil protection, acting as refuges for endangered plants and animals, as well as their critical carbon sequestration role. Clearing natural forests to create plantations, as has happened in many countries, is a harmful practice, and hopefully the new COP 26 agreement will curb it. But where natural forests have been logged in the past, where the remaining forests are degraded or where land is being eroded, planting trees is an important way of restoring the essential natural processes. The scientific advisory body to the Paris Accord, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has recognized tree planting as a particularly effective way of reducing carbon dioxide. In light of this, many countries have embarked on afforestation drives. Planting trees to create carbon sinks to offset current emissions is, however, not enough. Offsets should be the last resort to deal with residual emissions, after serious efforts have been taken to mitigate and reduce ongoing emissions. The intention to reach carbon-neutrality within the coming years is actually far from sufficient to support the aim of keeping global warming within 1.5 C, as this means little or no reduction has taken place and the ongoing emissions are simply balanced by offsets. Critics of tree planting for carbon sequestration also point out that there are serious questions about the environmental value of such planted woodlots as they are often monoculture plantations. Scientific studies have shown that woodlots of one or two species are more vulnerable to pests and diseases than mixed forests, and monoculture forests also have lower biodiversity benefits than mixed forests. The choice of species is another aspect that can raise concerns. The introduction of eucalyptus gum trees throughout the world has not been beneficial in all cases. Leaf-fall from the gum trees does not help soil fertility as the leaves are poisonous, and not many plants can be intercropped with eucalyptus for the same reason. Eucalyptus plantations therefore have limited benefits, apart from fuel wood and poles for construction and infrastructure. There is often a question of local ownership of new plantations, and without local involvement, planted forests may not flourish. One of the key challenges to planting trees on common land is the maintenance of the plantation, as young trees can be eaten by browsing animals, or uprooted by trespassers, and they typically need irrigation during the first years of growth. There are many examples of well-intended afforestation projects that failed because the trees did not survive. Involvement of local people is critical for the establishment and survival of planted woodlots. But, there is more to planting trees than CO2, as China has shown during its "Grain for Green" afforestation program that was launched in 1990. Grain for Green involved 124 million people in 1,897 counties in 25 provincial-level regions and by 2010, around 15 million hectares of farmland and 17 million hectares of barren mountainous wasteland were restored for natural vegetation. Some of these forests have bamboo as the main species, and bamboo development is another area where China is leading the world. According to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China now has nearly 7 million hectares of bamboo, half of which was planted specifically for human and industrial use. Their fast growth, resilience to changing weather patterns, extensive root structure and the ability to flourish in soils that are not of much use for other crops, have created the foundation for a national economic sector in China that is worth the equivalent of $50 billion. The trade comprises food, furniture, construction and interior design materials, textiles, pulp and paper and other products made from bamboo and bamboo fiber. It is important to consider reforestation and afforestation in a wider landscape context. Many modern land use systems are a patchwork of natural protection areas, agriculture developments and other rural development, including infrastructure and villages. Plantations can form an important component of such a diverse landscape, and a combination of different species in different sections of the area will contribute to the overall health of the environment. Tree planting should not be restricted to the rural landscape alone. A lot of recent research has indicated that trees are good for well-being and health, and trees in cities provide shade and keep the streets cool. Trees can also be used to help restore brownfields and regenerate polluted land. Existing forests must be protected where possible, but degraded land must be restored and cleared areas reforested. Not all trees are good for every situation though. We need to find the right trees for the right place and the right time. And whatever initiatives are promoted, the involvement of local people is critical to ensure a successful establishment of a healthy woodlot.

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- In its starkest warning yet, a new landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Monday stressed that climate change is "widespread, rapid, and intensifying." However, one of the report's authors told Xinhua that there is still time to halt this trend if urgent global action is taken. The report warned that the human-caused climate crisis is "unequivocal" and that temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years, triggering more extreme weather events worldwide. According to the report, many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years. In an interview with Xinhua, one of its authors warned that extreme weather events such as the devastating rainfalls and wildfires seen across Europe this summer would further increase and intensify. "We're now able to attribute many more changes to human activities and to greenhouse gas emissions," Gian-Kasper Plattner, senior scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), said. "The report assesses that these extreme weather events have increased, and that this is related to human actions. Climate models that we run with scenarios show that these extremes will intensify and get stronger with increasing temperatures." The IPCC Working Group I report "Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis" was approved on Friday by 195 member governments of the IPCC at a virtual session. It stressed that strong and sustained reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other greenhouse gases could still limit climate change. However, while benefits for air quality would come quickly, it could take 20-30 years to see global temperatures stabilize. The report gave an updated perspective on the chances of meeting the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels in the coming decades. It finds that without immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in emissions, this will be beyond reach. While Plattner called for urgent individual action to stop global warming, he stressed that developed nations in particular must step up their fight. Noting that cutting emissions to net zero by mid-century requires global action, Plattner said: "Developed countries have a huge responsibility to act now and not wait for other countries to follow." "Countries like Switzerland really have a huge responsibility to take despite the small number of people we have here and a comparable small number of emissions but they matter. Each tonne of CO2 that is emitted matters." Asked whether Paris Agreement goals could still be reached, he said: "If we take these scenarios that we've run and the greenhouse gas emissions in these scenarios, cutting emissions to net zero by mid-century or shortly after, then this goal of 1.5 degrees is still within reach and the 2 degrees goal as well." "But it's clear that strong, rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed to achieve these goals." China last year announced the country's ambitious climate target to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. "I think China and its government have really made huge steps forward," said the scientist. "It's really important to follow the steps that have been indicated in the recent past, also in the run-up to the next climate negotiations at COP26 . All countries must play their part." The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26 , will be held in the city of Glasgow, UK, later this year. "I really hope that world leaders will make a big advance in terms of agreeing on reducing emissions," said Plattner, adding that he expected world leaders would "make the next step towards actual measures" to being able to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The IPCC is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988. It aims to provide political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.

HARARE, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday said he will use the forthcoming Climate Change ( COP26 ) summit in Glasgow, Scotland, to lobby for multilateral support to fight against the effects of climate change. He will also take the opportunity to extend the hand of re-engagement to fellow global leaders as he undertakes his first visit to the United Kingdom in early November. In a message posted on his Facebook page, Mnangagwa said he was eagerly looking forward to attending the 26th Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ). He reiterated that Zimbabwe had committed to reducing emissions by 40 percent, urging other nations to put words into action. "While we will offer to hasten our economic transformation, we do need to remain alive to the shocks of drought and the impact of climate change through necessary social safety nets. "I will be appealing for multilateral support to supplement our efforts. Zimbabwe has come a long way over the past three years. I hope our presence at COP26 and our commitment to the global fight against climate change will be recognized as part of our ongoing re-engagement campaign," he said. Mnangagwa said COP26 was coming at an extraordinary time in world history when many countries were still battling the COVID-19 pandemic while having to undertake immense changes to their economies to meet climate goals. The discussions at COP26 were going to be an important step in agreeing to a collective way forward, he added. "For Zimbabwe, we feel the impact of climate change more than others. Our temperatures have risen by approximately 2 degrees Celsius over the past century - which has seen a significant increase in extreme weather. "In the past two decades alone, we have had to deal with 10 droughts. If the world doesn't step up, we will see jobs lost, livelihoods destroyed, and people will lose their lives. "That is something we must avoid and why Zimbabwe is coming to the table with ambitious plans to tackle climate change," he said. The Zimbabwean leader in September also warned that thousands of Zimbabweans would lose their jobs, and even their lives, if climate change was allowed to continue at the current pace. He said then that COP26 should be about action and the fulfillment of decisions of the past, while concrete financial support was essential to combat climate change beyond mere rhetoric.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- World leaders on Monday called for concrete actions to tackle the challenges of climate change at the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ). "This COP must be a moment of solidarity. The 100 billion U.S. dollars a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries must become a 100 billion dollars climate finance reality," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his speech at the World Leaders Summit at COP26 . "This is critical to restoring trust and credibility," he said. In 2009, developed countries, who built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and have contributed most to the climate crisis, pledged 100 billion dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge. Recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. Guterres added that beyond the 100 billion dollars, developing countries need "far greater resources" to fight COVID-19, build resilience and pursue sustainable development. "Visions will come true only when we act on them," Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a written statement. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country hosts the two-week climate gathering, said, "while COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can and it must mark the beginning of the end." Admitting that developed nations' support for developing countries is "still falling short," U.S. President Joe Biden said, "there's no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves." "This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes; the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases," he said. Seychellois President Wavel Ramkalawan said he is "scared" of the impact climate change will have on his country as "the beautiful archipelago of 115 islands may be reduced to less than 50 islands as the coral islands disappear." COP26 , delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. It is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015. \</doc>

It was exciting to hear Brazil's Environment Minister Joaquim Alvaro Pereira Leite announce freshly formalized national commitments for tackling greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow on Nov 13, 2021. These commitments, including halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, realizing carbon neutrality by 2050, and ending illegal deforestation by 2080, can help save the seven biomes in the world and control the global rise in temperature. China and Brazil have developed a comprehensive partnership at many different levels. Both public and private stakeholders from China have invested in Brazil's agribusiness and agriculture-linked infrastructure building since 2014.Maintaining economic growth while promoting food security plays an increasingly important role in this bilateral relationship. Brazil has established instruments, mechanisms and programs to meet its targets. These experiences are referential to sustaining China's imports, the sectoral development in China and of value for China to achieve its carbon emissions reduction goals. One of the most eye-catching public-private initiatives is the production of the first carbon-neutral beef product in the world\u-243 Viva\u-243 by Brazilian agricultural research company Embrapa, and a leading beef company, Marfrig. After spending five years and 10 million reals ($1.8 million) on investigating the concept, protocol, techniques and the certification mechanism, Viva-certified meat has been available in over 10 supermarkets in the state of Sao Paulo since 2020. There is little doubt that addressing greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector, which accounts for 14.5 percent of man-made emissions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's calculation, is a significant challenge. This number is larger for leading agricultural production countries such as the United States, New Zealand and Brazil. In the livestock sector, cattle ranching is responsible for methane emissions, which is directly responsible for habitat conversion. The whole life of beef production, from the beginning of ranching-induced land-use change to food wastes, emits the highest amount of greenhouse gas compared to other ruminants, according to statistics from Our World in Data. Decarbonizing the farming stage, especially cattle's enteric methane emissions, is an essential step for combating climate change. Brazil took the first-mover position in addressing beef-pertinent greenhouse gas emissions. Its designed methodology is to neutralize the enteric methane of cows by planting trees in pastures, called Livestock-Forestry or Crop-Livestock-Forestry system. Embrapa found that methane emitted by 11 adult cattle per hectare per year could be offset by 200 fast-growing trees such as eucalyptus per hectare, bearing in mind Brazil's average stocking rate of 1.2 cattle per hectare. The logic of planting trees in the agricultural system indicates reducing logging and sequestering emissions. Eucalyptus also increases or maintains organic carbon in the soil and is harvested for making value-added wood products such as furniture, which stores carbon even longer. This further provides additional income to farmers and producers. This quite comprehensive system is a smart agricultural technique, the rationale of which technically facilitates Brazil to achieve its new ambitious goals as confirmed by Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. Several stakeholders in both Brazil and China are cooperating to promote this innovative practice and to enable Brazil to enjoy first-mover advantages. On the one hand, to green the trade relationship, both sides from the ministerial level at the COP 26 to institutional level are negotiating on the potential distribution of carbon-neutral soft commodities, including farm produce. This ensures the incorporation of criteria such as low carbon and carbon neutrality into the current business model. On the other hand, scaling up and localizing Brazil's carbon-neutral methodology in China's livestock sector are of great interest to many stakeholders in China as this aligns with China's carbon emissions peak and neutrality targets. At the trading level, for China's business sector, sealed commodities with a carbon-neutral certificate are appealing. Certification is a pragmatic market-based approach with an instrumental function. Many members of the China Chamber of Commerce of Import and Export of Foodstuffs, Native Produce and Animal By-Products prefer holding sustainability-linked certification just like purchasing American soybeans with Sustainability Soybeans Assurance Protocol. Domestically, to certify China's beef sector and to notarize Brazil's certificate, the China Environmental United Certification Centre thoroughly analyzed the methodology and believed that a complicated and comprehensive methodology could be developed, although it is hard for farmers achieving it on the ground to apply for the certificate. However, the essence of certification is to raise the bar and provide a level playing field in the industry.

By Barry He | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-18 09:24 [Photo/IC] Hydrogen energy is a potential game changer in the search for practical renewable power. The ability to convert water, the most abundant resource on Earth, into a clean energy source is the stuff of dreams. The field has promising applications already in powering vehicles, with the majority of research and development taking place in China. The country has a strong track record of making other green technologies, such as solar power, more accessible, with many hoping that the same will be true for hydrogen. Wind and solar are the A-list celebrities of the renewable energy world. The average member of the public would be able to explain, roughly, how solar panels or wind turbines create electricity; however, the same cannot be said for hydrogen derived from water electrolysis. A dark horse in the fight against climate change, the element is gradually playing a greater role. Studies from the International Energy Agency show that in the last decade, hydrogen fuel production has increased nearly tenfold, to 0.36 million tonnes. This is a significant amount considering how light the gas is: it was, after all, used to float airships in the 20th century. But more needs to be done to develop hydrogen infrastructure and reduce costs to the point where mainstream adoption takes place. Currently, a hydrogen-powered car is four times more expensive to run than conventional petrol counterparts. Keen to lead by example, China was the first country in the world to create a hydrogen-fueled tram capable of carrying several hundred passengers, a feat actively being replicated around the world. In Guangdong province, such modes of public transport are now a common sight. In the past three years, China has also built several dozen new hydrogen refueling stations, no mean feat considering the fact that storing the gas under such high pressures has been one of the main technical barriers towards progress. More recently, hydrogen-powered planes have also completed successful flights within the country, promising news for the carbon emission-heavy airline industry. The blueprint of China's success with solar energy must be followed if progress is to be made with hydrogen. The country has increased solar capacity by as much as 50 times since 2012, growth that has been in tandem with decreasing production costs. These have fallen by around one dollar per watt, making China one of the most solar-friendly countries in the world. Likewise, hydrogen costs are expected to halve by 2050, meaning that by that point, facilities for refueling, storage and production will all become commonplace. Both government and private support will be invaluable in the uptake of hydrogen derived from the clean method of water electrolysis. Fresh from the recent COP26 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow, Scotland, many nations, including China, will enter climate change commitments with a new resolve. Governments hungry for inspiration will be keen to look toward areas in which such collaborations can find success first. Beijing has a strong track record of applying innovative regulation with a private sector motivated by business opportunity. This combined catalyst is being replicated around the world, with a $5 billion hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia under construction, in collaboration with United States gas giant Air Products and Chemicals. Germany is also working with private innovators to increase the efficiency of hydrogen fuel storage, with the nation currently boasting the potential to store 37 million cubic meters of the gas. When it comes to climate change, scientific victories know no borders, and a technical achievement in one country will directly benefit everyone.

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-09-09 10:45 Protesters from the Climate Coalition demonstrate, with 100 hundred days to go before the start of the COP26 climate summit, in Parliament Square, London, Britain, July 23, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow at the end of October, claiming global COVID vaccine distribution makes attendance unequal. The talks, delayed by a year because of the pandemic, run from Oct 31 to Nov 12, and aim to help countries progress toward the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in a bid to limit the impact of climate change. Usually, such a gathering would attract delegates from nearly 200 countries, but with so many places still facing major COVID-19 crises, or having limited vaccine programs, protesters calling themselves the Climate Action Network (CAN) say it is wrong for the summit to go ahead. "Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," CAN Executive Director Tasneem Essop told the Reuters news agency. With the issue of climate change having been so visibly demonstrated by extreme weather conditions all over the world this year, the issue's already high stakes were raised further this summer by a report from the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, compiled in conjunction with 234 authors and 195 governments. It said it was now a "statement of fact" that humanity is damaging the climate, and it is "unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the findings a "code red" warning for humanity and said it increased the burden of responsibility on those taking part in the Glasgow summit. "There is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success," he added. In response to the vaccine protest, a spokesperson for Guterres said the proven urgent nature of the COP26 agenda meant that there was no way it could be delayed any further. "The global scientific community has made clear that climate change is now a global emergency and only an urgent and major step-up in climate action can keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach and protect the most vulnerable countries and communities from worsening climate impacts," he said. The British government has begun delivering vaccines to conference delegates to enable them to be vaccinated in time for the event to take place, but CAN said it has not acted fast enough. Alok Sharma, the British government representative overseeing the summit, said anyone needing to quarantine would have their costs paid by the government, so the talks could go ahead as planned. "Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority ... if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow," he said. \</doc>

By OWEN FISHWICK | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-01 09:32 Toyota displays its product lineup at the 2021 China (Shenyang) International Auto Show, held from Oct 1-6, 2021. [Photo by YAN BO/FOR CHINA DAILY] With the ongoing 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) being held in Glasgow in the United Kingdom, where decisions will be made on reducing carbon emissions, the world's largest car company seems to be at odds with a sizable chunk of global opinion when it comes to electrification. Japan's Toyota was an early adopter of hybrid electrification for its vehicles, innovating with the Prius model, but has fallen behind when it comes to full electric vehicles. The company's senior management have even made statements against going toward full electric. At Toyota's annual meeting in January, CEO Akio Toyoda denounced the Japanese government's proposals to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles by the mid-2030s. He claimed that electric vehicles produce more emissions than internal combustion engines. He added that electric vehicles are too expensive and that the car industry would collapse if internal combustion engines were phased out. The first point has been proved false by numerous studies. The second is somewhat correct, with the cost of mass-market electric vehicles significantly higher than comparable internal combustion models. But prices are coming down. It has even been reported that the Japanese automaker has lobbied lawmakers in the United States to dissuade them from all-electric future. More importantly, Toyota seems to be at war with itself. While its CEO attacks a market that is growing at a significant pace, it must invest in electrification to mitigate strategic risks. Toyota has joint ventures with Panasonic and China's BYD, and is building a $1.2-billion electric vehicle manufacturing base in Tianjin. But its electrification pales in comparison to major rivals such as Volkswagen. While hydrogen technology has been advanced by the Japanese carmaker in recent years, battery electric vehicles have improved at a faster rate across many metrics-efficiency, range, charging network, price and popularity. But Toyota is making some effort, despite the grumblings of its CEO. The company claims that it will have 70 electric models by 2025. Currently, it has three pure electric models on sale in China. Compared to rivals such as Tesla and Volkswagen, and Chinese brands such as BYD and GAC, Toyota is lagging far behind in the world's largest car market. A total of 296,000 pure electric vehicles from all brands were sold in China in September alone. Another danger for the Japanese marque is that it can't rely on its rich history of innovation and reliability. A host of pure electric startups are following the charge of Tesla and are potentially hovering up the current and future market share of traditional manufacturers. These startups are examples of how staying well-informed about the demands of the market can pay rich dividends. It's not being said that hydrogen fuel-cell technology isn't an environmentally friendly and achievable solution for future mobility, it is. But at the moment, pure electric is outperforming hydrogen and the marketplace has made its decision for now. Toyota's mantra is to invite people to go on a journey: "Let's Go Places". However, if it doesn't react more quickly to the current climate for pure electric, the only places Toyota's customers will be going are to its competitors. \</doc>

Climate Photo: VCG While commending China for its actions in recent years to combat climate change in a speech on Monday, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called on China to set "ambitious" goals to combat the environmental crisis in the run-up to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to be held Glasgow, the UK.\~ Coming at a time when the US and some Western countries appear to be stepping up pressure on China to make more commitments ahead of the key summit, Guterres's remarks were quickly seized by certain Western media outlets to repeat clich\'e9 claims and criticism of China's commitments to combat climate issues. In doing so, they blatantly disregard China's bold plans and efforts, while completely ignoring incredible inaction on the part of the US, one of the world's biggest polluters.\~ Indeed, ahead of the Glasgow summit, there is an increasingly apparent trend that the US and some of its Western allies are attempting to mount pressure on China into signing up to more pledges and even use the climate change issue as a new tool in their geopolitical containment campaign against China. That won't bode well for the most important climate talks since 2015. Apart from targeting China, the US and other Western advanced economies will also likely try to exert pressure on developing nations, such as China and India, to win more concessions at the Glasgow summit. Developing countries have long criticized developed countries for their double standard and lack of sufficient efforts that match the damage they have done over the years.\~\~ As far as China is concerned, contrary to the skepticism and pressure, the country has made what has been widely considered as bold commitments and has been moving swiftly to realize them. China pledged to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon-neutral by 2060. In September, China announced that it would stop financing new overseas coal-fired power stations. It is already making targeted efforts in these areas. On Tuesday, China's State Council, the cabinet, issued a new action plan to reach those targets, vowing to increase wind and solar capacity to as much as 1,200 gigawatts by the end of 2030. Such actions are in line with China's domestic policies and long-term development goals. The Chinese economy is in the process of transforming into a high-quality growth model by shifting away from energy-intensive industries. It is also worth noting that a large component of China's greenhouse emissions is closely intertwined with economic and trade ties with the US and Europe, highlighting the need for global coordination and cooperation in this regard. However, there is no way for the US and its allies to use climate commitments as a weapon against China. It would be unrealistic for them to use the issue to force China into making concessions that run counter to its national interests.\~ Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi already made this position clear when meeting US climate envoy John Kerry in early September. The US hopes to make climate cooperation an "oasis" within broader China-US relations, but if the "oasis" is surrounded by "desert," the "oasis" will sooner or later become desert, Wang said.\~ Climate change is a common challenge facing all mankind, but the pace of climate actions varies from country to country due to varying development stages. The Glasgow summit offers a desperately needed platform for coordinating global efforts. However, allowing certain powers to play geopolitical tricks will certainly undercut any potential outcome of the meeting. \</doc>

Motorists make their way through a water-logged street amid heavy rains in Hyderabad city, India on Monday, the morning after cyclone Gulab made landfall between the coastal Indian states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Photo: AFP After asking Tesla to make its electric vehicles (EV) in India, the South Asian country appears to be working on new plans to target major global EV battery makers as part of its effort to promote new-energy vehicles on its bumpy roads. India will host five roadshows starting next month in a number of countries to encourage battery makers to invest in setting up EV battery production facilities locally, Reuters reported, citing an anonymous source inside the Indian government. Major global players in the battery industry, including Tesla, LG Energy, Samsung, Northvolt, Panasonic and Toshiba, are the targets Indian officials will be trying to convince. If the report of the plan is accurate, India deserves a degree of credit for its new initiative in hope to boost the clean transport supply chain to reduce emissions ahead of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). But hope is not enough to support a deliverable plan, which also requires coordinated support. Given the current state of the Indian economy and its manufacturing capabilities, there is too much uncertainty in its appeal to global EV battery makers. First and foremost is that question about whether making EV batteries profitable in the Indian market. Merely 3,400 electric cars were sold in India during its most recent business year, compared to sales of 1.7 million conventional passenger cars, according to Reuters.\~ Also, reports continue to emerge that US automakers shut down production lines in India. Last month, Ford Motor announced plans to stop making cars in India after recording losses of more than $2 billion over 10 years. Before that, General Motors and Harley Davidson also withdrew from the Indian market. The decisions underscore the difficulties for foreign carmakers to navigate the Indian auto market, and the same may be true for makers of EV batteries and other components. For years, the Indian government has seen the wide use of EVs as a shortcut solution to both curbing pollution and reducing its dependence on oil imports. According to a proposal by NITI Aayog, a federal think tank chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India could slash its oil import bills by as much as $40 billion by 2030 if electric vehicles were widely adopted. While there has never been a shortage of ambitious incentive plans for promoting EVs in India over the years, there are also a lot of problems still standing between tough realities in the country and its plan for broad adoption of EVs. For instance, certain Indian industrial policies are often criticized as being at odds with the goals of promoting EVs. India has made clear that it wants to boost local manufacturing of EVs and other components, but imposing high tariffs on imports to protect domestic industries only drives up costs when there is no sound supply chain locally. That is detrimental to EV consumption. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that global major battery makers such as Tesla and LG already have production capacity in China, which has become a leader in EV development with a lion's share in the global battery supply chain. A lesson from that for India is that whether it is for manufacturing electric cars or batteries, it needs a more pragmatic approach toward planning and cooperation, especially when its poor infrastructure and unstable market performance may stymie investment sentiment. \</doc>

China will continually optimize its financial policies to achieve low-carbon development targets, officials and experts said at a key event in Shanghai over the weekend. In this context, focus will be on promoting energy transition and involving climate-related factors in assessing financial risks. The move is part of a high-level policy guidance issued over the weekend to meet carbon neutrality goals by 2060. In addition, an action plan for peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and a set of policies and measures in key industries are in the pipeline, said Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change affairs. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, from Sunday to Nov 12. "Multilateralism" is a key principle for all parties to achieve the global warming control targets as determined in the Paris Agreement. Countries should take common, fair, but diversified responsibilities depending on different capabilities and national conditions, Xie said at the 2021 Bund Summit in Shanghai on Saturday, which was organized by China Finance 40 Forum. Developed countries should honor their investment commitment of $100 billion per year to transfer to developing countries, as well as guide the investment of public funds. "Based on that, they need to actively develop green finance, optimize policy framework and information disclosure systems and lead social investment to low-carbon development fields," he said. A senior official of the People Bank of China, the central bank, said at the summit that China will build a system of standards for financing the energy transition. So-called transition finance should support the fields that meet standards of coal consumption reduction and substitution, while financing for highly polluting projects and those that entail high energy consumption should be withdrawn. Compared with green finance, transition finance will be more flexible and effective to meet the huge financing demand for transforming the country's energy structure, said Liu Guiping, deputy governor of the PBOC. Promoting the transition toward a low-carbon development model has gained broad support from policymakers to scholars, and from business leaders to multilateral organizations. Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said in a video dialogue at the summit that right now, despite the conflicts, competition and differences among nations, issues like public health and climate change underscore global common interests. China has decided to stop financing coal energy projects, primarily for the benefit of humanity, and "I think it is a constructive contribution for the sake of all of humanity," said Kissinger. A latest research report from China's central bank showed that in the long run, the low-carbon transition will foster economic growth and support price stability. In the short term, however, the transition will probably raise production costs, drive up prices of traditional fossil energy and exacerbate inflationary pressure, said Zhu Jun, head of the PBOC's international department. The recent rise in energy prices globally reflects the instability of energy supply caused by climate change and extreme weather events, so the risk of low-carbon transition should be well controlled, said Zhu. "Internationally, China and the European Union are studying to promote the convergence of green taxonomies, and plan to release a common catalogue of sustainable finance in the near future, which will provide a basis for forming a globally consistent green taxonomy system," she said.

This autumn, global attention is focused on Kunming and Glasgow; with China hosting the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (COP15) last month, and now the U.K. welcoming the countries of the world to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) this week. These two events coinciding is a once in a generation opportunity to get the world back on track to address the enormous threat of climate change and biodiversity loss. It is also a demonstration of the vital leadership role that both the U.K and China have in addressing the climate emergency that humanity is facing. The U.K. has demonstrated its support for China's COP15. We had the strongest presence of any country, including an appearance and speech from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. Both Prince Charles and President Xi made critical points around the need to protect and live in harmony with nature. The challenge posed by climate change is huge. But we know what we need to do; because China, the U.K. and the global community have already agreed on what we're aiming for. In 2015, the world signed the Paris Agreement, an international deal to tackle the climate crisis. That agreement commits us to limit global temperature rises to well below two degrees, aiming for 1.5 degrees, because the science tells us that would avoid the worst effects of climate change. However, since these targets were set, not nearly enough has been done. Estimates are that even if countries keep to their current emissions reduction targets, we are still on course for average temperature rises of 2.4 degrees. The stakes couldn't be higher. In the U.K., we are seriously concerned about the increased risks from flooding and extreme weather. I know that the Chinese people too were tragically affected by extreme weather events this year. Climate change is not simply a threat to future generations; it is a live issue affecting peoples' lives in the here and now. The recovery from Covid-19 presents us with a huge opportunity to reimagine our economies; and build a better future through green jobs. Over the past 30 years the U.K. has achieved the fastest decarbonization rate in the G-20 (44%) whilst growing our GDP by 78%. The U.K. and China can work together to make the case globally that greening our economies is not only the right thing to do for humanity, but also makes sound economic sense. As I said in my speech at China International Fair for Trade in Services, climate change could be the greatest commercial opportunity of all time. Global trade in low-carbon goods and services is expected to grow to over \£35 trillion by 2050. All of this is what makes the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow so critical. The U.K, China and the global community must unite behind four key goals this COP26 . First, we must work globally to put the world on a path to driving down emissions, until they reach net zero by the middle of this century. The U.K. and China must show leadership on this, and push for action on the most polluting sectors of our economies. The U.K. welcomes President Xi's commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad. If we are serious about the Paris Agreement goals, Glasgow must be the moment we consign coal power to history, and signal the end to polluting vehicles. China's expertise on this will be crucial - and its commercial relationship with the U.K. is key. China is already the world's largest electric vehicle market - the cost of electric vehicles is falling rapidly, in large part thanks to China's innovation in the sector. On offshore wind, the U.K. is home to the largest global market and has welcomed Chinese investment into this sector. The U.K. continues to partner with China to encourage growth of the domestic wind industry. Our second goal is to protect people and nature from the worst effects of climate change. The climate crisis is already with us and we must build flood defences, warning systems and other vital measures to minimize, avert and address the damage caused by climate change. The U.K.'s work with China under the Newton Fund is developing cutting edge techniques for simulating the future climate, building our understanding of future extreme weather scenarios. This helps the U.K. and China, and ultimately the global community manage risks, and predict events like typhoons up to a year in advance. Our third goal is finance, without which the task ahead is near impossible. Developed countries must deliver the $100 billion a year they promised to support developing countries. The U.K. is leading by example, having committed \£311.6 billion between 2021 and 2025. We must also make finance easier to access and increase the sums available to protect people and nature. The U.K. and China have maintained long-standing partnerships on green finance since 2015, supported by the vice-premier level U.K. China Economic and Financial Dialogue. At the 10th Dialogue the U.K and China reiterated their recognition of each other as their primary partner in green finance, and capital raising. Fourth, we must work together to deliver on these goals. That includes building consensus among governments. We must bring businesses and civil society on board behind our COP26 goals, and build international collaboration in critical sectors. Our engagement with 200-plus Chinese businesses in the run up to COP26 has led to four major Chinese companies joining the U.N.'s Race to Zero Initiative. Collaboration between China and the U.K on climate change already showcases some of the best achievements of our bilateral relationship. Last month saw the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China taking up the Chinese seat at the U.N. Both of our countries occupy a position of responsibility in the multilateral system; and we must therefore show leadership. The U.N.'s COP26 is the best opportunity we've had in a generation to do so. The world hopes to see the highest levels of leadership and commitment possible from China. Caroline Wilson is the British ambassador to China.

By CHEN WEIHUA in Brussels, REN QI in Moscow,REN QI and BO LEUNG in London | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-11-19 07:21 President Xi Jinping in Beijing meets with US President Joe Biden via video link on Tuesday. President Xi attaches great importance to the China-US relationship and has been consistently pushing for its sound and steady development. [Photo/Xinhua] The virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden on Tuesday will help reduce tensions and open up more space for bilateral cooperation between the world's two largest economies, according to international relations experts. Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said on Wednesday in a tweet, "It looks as if the Biden-Xi meeting has put some 'guardrails' on the 'responsible competition'" between the two countries, and even opened the door to more cooperation and dialogue on key issues. "That's all to be welcomed," he said. "I guess both the US and China are seeking to make their competitive relationship more predictable, opening up also for necessary cooperation in key areas like climate," Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, had tweeted on Tuesday. At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , which ended in Glasgow last week, China and the US surprised many by announcing a joint declaration to work together to fight climate change. Andrey Karneev, head of the School of Asian Studies at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, described the intention of the meeting as "to reduce tensions and agree on regular contacts". "There are areas of the relationship where the prospect of finding a common approach is favorable. Such areas include climate change, the fight against the coronavirus and ensuring sustainability in the energy sector," he said. Harneev said he expects some progress in trade and economic ties, since Biden is facing a difficult domestic economic situation, including high inflation and a shortage of goods due to supply chain disruption. Junichiro Kusumoto, a professor on the faculty of law at Toyo University in Japan, said: "Frictions between China and the United States are not irrelevant to Japan, and I just hope that everything will be resolved peacefully." Kusumoto added that the US-China relationship will have a significant impact on the geopolitical situation in East Asia. Kinji Matsuo, a philosopher and author in Japan, said the world is concerned about how China and the US will deal with their differences. "It is like two surgeons treating one wound at the same time. Are they going to cooperate well, or do they need a third person to help? We are looking forward to the answers," Matsuo said. Gayle Allard, a professor of economics at IE University in Spain, noting that the US-China relationship is at its worst since the 1970s, said,"It is always a step forward when leaders meet and talk, even if it is virtually, as the two presidents have done." Felix Valdivieso, chairman of IE University's IE China Center, said, "The conversation between the two presidents was... necessary, fruitful and continuous." He added that this was perhaps the result of the two presidents knowing each other well, having maintained a good relationship since both were vice-presidents. David Shullman, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, said the virtual meeting was "critical to minimizing misperception and the risk of unintended conflict". Wang Xu in Tokyo and Liu Hongjie and Chen Yingqun in Beijing contributed to this story. \</doc>

LONDON, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government published its climate strategy on Tuesday ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, outlining how the country plans to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050. Setting out the plans, the British government said it would support 440,000 well-paid jobs and leverage up 90 billion pounds in private investment by 2030, meanwhile reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels which has put the country at risk of global price spikes. Supporting the delivery of the strategy, Britain's first Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework was also revealed on the same day, which sets out key net zero research and innovation priority areas for the UK over the next 5-10 years. The announcement came days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change. The Net Zero Strategy will be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as Britain's second Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy under the Paris Agreement, according to the British government. However, critics have pointed out that the strategy, which runs to more than 360 pages, does not provide enough policies or investment to drive the transformation needed to reach net zero.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of single-deck electric buses glided through the streets leading to the iconic armadillo-shaped auditorium in Glasgow. Their bright collage of the colors red, purple, and green added vibrancy to the Scottish city as dreary winter sets in.Jointly built in Britain by BYD, China;';s leading new-energy vehicle manufacturer, and Britain;';s largest bus and coach manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL), these e-buses have been shuttling delegates attending the ongoing United Nations climate conference here, known as COP26 .With their zero-emission service for the global event where countries are negotiating future actions to address climate change, these buses are examples that through cooperation, the world can make a positive difference and can be hopeful to turn the tide of climate change. "We absolutely believe that collaboration should be borderless. It;';s about seven billion people that we want to save, and this is a very tall order. We should remove all the flags and work together," He Yipeng, general manager of BYD Europe, told Xinhua on the sidelines of COP26 .He said the e-buses were an instant hit as they;';re quiet, comfortable and equipped with USB charging and multiple entertainment systems.The British government has recently pledged further investment to support the switch to cleaner vehicles. Paul Davies, ADL;';s president and managing director, told Xinhua that by working with BYD, his company has been able to bring world-leading technology to Britain and fast-track a zero emissions agenda for clean energy buses."Before BYD, the bus battery technology in the UK was very immature," Davies said. "China has been the starting point for new energy vehicles. We;';re very proud to partner with them here in Britain for electric buses. "The cooperation has been very successful, he added. The two companies have delivered 500 e-buses since 2016, and by the end of this year, the number will reach 1,000, which is "incredibly fast," he said. "There are a lot of Chinese companies with the right know-how, with the right brain power and also the experience operating in China, and they can replicate that experience here in Europe," BYD;';s He said."I;';m very optimistic about what humankind can do to provide for the future. The governments should be working together even more closely to make things happen," He said.The BYD manager expressed hope that concrete actions will follow after this climate gathering ends. "This is COP26 . This is the 26th time we;';re having this kind of conference. I hope the outcome of COP26 will be action, real action on the ground," he said. \</doc>

LONDON, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- A COP26 -branded pure electric bus, jointly made by Chinese and UK manufacturers, started an 11-day trip from London to Glasgow on Monday. The "Road to Renewables" bus tour set off from Northumberland Park bus garage in north London, one of Europe's largest overnight charging garages for electric buses. The vehicle used on the tour is a pure electric double-decker, built in Britain by Chinese clean energy car maker BYD, and the UK's largest bus and coach manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL). It has a range of 160 miles, meaning it could get from London to Sheffield on a single charge. It is the UK's best-selling electric double-decker bus, and one of 1,000 BYD ADL electric buses already on the road or on order. The bus will reach Glasgow three days before the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference begins in the Scottish city. On the tour, participants will meet green engineers at a 500MW offshore windfarm at Greater Gabbard, the UK's most easterly point, as well as the businesses and local authorities driving the decarbonization of cities like Oxford and Peterborough. A fleet of ADL-BYD's electric single-deck vehicles will serve as shuttles for delegates at the COP26 conference. Trudy Harrison, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, said the bus tour launch event on Monday was "a wonderful example of the collaboration and innovation" required to reach emissions targets that came just before COP26 . The British government has recently pledged further investment to support the switch to cleaner vehicles. Paul Davies, ADL's President and Managing Director, told Xinhua that by working with BYD, one of the biggest battery companies in the world, it has been able to bring world-leading technology to the UK and fast-track zero emissions agendas for clean energy buses. "Before BYD the bus battery technology in the UK was very immature," he explained. "China has been the starting point for new energy vehicles. We're very proud to partner with them here in the UK for electric buses." The cooperation has been very successful, he added: the two companies have delivered 500 electric buses since 2016, and by the end of this year the number will reach 1,000, which is "incredibly fast." Green energy buses are also playing an important role in achieving net zero (emissions) targets, by supporting thousands of skilled green jobs. "Our British-built zero emission buses can not only reduce local air pollution and support the transition to net zero, but also help to underpin the opportunities for the bus manufacturing industry to prosper," he said. Frank Thorpe, BYD UK Managing Director, said BYD has delivered over 68,000 eBuses around the globe. "We believe in a collaborative approach and work in partnership with organizations that share our vision. It is through these win-win collaborations with a range of local partners, that we bring our pioneering battery technology and continuously contribute to a zero-emissions future." \</doc>

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation to COP26 wants all parties to work together in the same direction to reach consensus on the issues at the heart of the conference and make sure it is a success, the head of the delegation has said. Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told Xinhua in an interview that the Chinese delegation has held close exchanges with other parties during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. "We hope to contribute to the success of the conference through constructive communication and consultation," he said. The two-week conference was scheduled to conclude on Friday, but is likely to extend into the weekend due to unresolved issues. In particular, developed countries need to take seriously the concerns of developing countries over such core issues as finance and adaptation. They must also strive to deliver on promises made a long time ago, to enhance mutual trust and ensure the success of COP26 , Zhao said. Financial support has been the main issue of concern for developing countries. During the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009, developed countries promised 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help developing nations strengthen their resilience to climate change by 2020. "Twelve years on, the developed countries have failed to honor their commitments, which has tremendously jeopardized political mutual trust," Zhao said. It is "very unreasonable and unfair" that while developing countries have submitted ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in line with the Paris Agreement, developed countries have failed to deliver financial support. This issue is also affecting the progress of COP26 , Zhao said. The issue of finance is one of the core issues of difficulty that affect the progress of COP26 , Zhao said. "The developed countries have not yet shown their sincerity and confidence in delivering their pledges. Therefore, both sides are still negotiating. It seems that more efforts are still needed." Apart from finance, the main sticking points in the final phase of negotiations include temperature control targets, adaptation, and the rulebook of the Paris Agreement, Zhao said. In order to effectively tackle the climate crisis, the parties need to "completely and comprehensively" deliver their promises according to the Paris Agreement, Zhao said. This must be done in line with the principle of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, and respective capabilities as well as taking into account national conditions. "We must realize that climate change has been an imminent challenge, but it must be addressed based on science and rules," Zhao said. These rules are specified in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. "Those are the cornerstones of global effort to tackle climate change, which should not be shaken. Otherwise, it would be hard to achieve our common goal." On Wednesday, China and the United States released the China-U.S. Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s. It was the result of numerous meetings and consultations between the two sides, and was released at a key moment in the conference. Zhao said the document had demonstrated cooperation between China and the United States, contributed to the global fight against climate change, and injected positive energy into the UN conference. It was also welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who tweeted: "I welcome today's agreement between China and the USA to work together to take more ambitious #ClimateAction in this decade. Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction." Enditem \</doc>

Climate change is no longer a looming threat of the future but a destructive reality that is already happening and threatening all humanity. The international community has paid growing attention to the climate change issues since the early 1990s by formulating and adopting various strategies, conventions and treaties to address the challenges. But we might have been simply too obsessed with formulating and joining international treaties with too ambitious goals as targets that have never been fully realized. It is encouraging to note that an increasing number of countries and companies are making a commitment to the Net Zero 2050 initiative. But setting that ambitious target does not guarantee that the desirable outcomes will be achieved. To reach the targets we have set and make real changes, we must take real actions. Our actions to tackle climate change have unfortunately taken a back seat to the pressing challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, it appears that the efforts are concentrated on addressing social and health issues and reviving economies that have been severely disrupted by the pandemic. The challenges before us are unprecedented. Historically, economic policies have mainly focused on stimulating economic growth while controlling inflation and unemployment. This time, however, we have to revitalize the global economy while managing the massive social crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and also pursuing decarbonization. The challenge we are facing now is, in fact, operationalizing the concept of sustainable development. The idea of sustainable development was adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where the international community unanimously welcomed the idea of enhancing economic growth while protecting the environment as well as promoting social development. But despite this, the climate crisis has been exacerbated. Social disparities have widened and income and wealth inequalities have been aggravated. The pandemic and climate crisis are wake-up calls that we do not have any more time to spend in formulating strategies and setting goals, we have to initiate immediate and practical actions to operationalize the concept of sustainable development. Although countries are well aware of the needs for increasing investments in climate actions, they are still hesitant to decarbonizes their energy and industry, believing that it might damage their economies and might lead to job losses. It is a sheer manifestation that understanding of the sustainable development as well as the interactions among economy, social and environmental development still remain rudimentary and not well established. But we can no longer remain timid and hesitant. Deep decarbonization of industry and transformation of the energy system toward renewable energy should be viewed as an opportunity to promote green economic growth and job creation, while increasing investment in public health systems and social protection schemes should be regarded as a foundation for dealing with the current challenges and building back better from the COVID-19 crisis. Although we understand the need for investing in a green economic recovery, we are still seeking the best way to operationalize the concept into real actions. Previous theories and knowledge can offer a very limit insight on how to do this. This is why we have to pool our wisdom and share best practices through international cooperation. Unprecedented challenges such as the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic call for even stronger international collaboration and partnership. Carbon neutrality is not just a matter of energy transformation. Realizing the Net Zero 2050 objective requires a drastic departure from the traditional economic system where the price of carbon emissions is neither considered nor paid. We have to rebuild our economies and industry by taking into account the price of the carbon we are emitting. Carbon neutrality requires innovations in energy technologies and industrial policies. Among others, carbon pricing should be introduced in the energy market, industrial restructuring and tax reform. We can no longer depend on the conventional approach of exploiting cheap fossil fuel without paying the price of carbon for rapid economic development. Investments in renewable energy and transformation for decarbonization are the drivers for achieving green and sustainable economic growth. The paradigm shift toward a post-pandemic green recovery based on renewable energy and deep decarbonization has to be pushed by concerted and collective actions among major economies of the world. Peer pressure and collaboration among major economies mean they can lead on climate change, as they correct the market distortions caused by fossil fuel exploitation, and thus construct more favorable conditions for our carbon neutral future. Collaboration among major economies for green recovery and decarbonization is necessary but not sufficient. Substantial support for the many developing countries lacking the capacity for energy transformation and green recovery is essential. It has to be effectively institutionalized through the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Climate Agreement. Many important issues have to be extensively addressed and agreed at the upcoming COP 26 in Glasgow to be held in November this year. The United Kingdom, the host country, has an ambitious goal of accelerating actions for the mitigation of carbon emissions and scaling up of finance and support for developing countries. We have spent enough time since 1992 when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was first signed, and learned enough to know that setting ambitious targets and delivering real climate actions to reduce emissions are two different things. In this regard, I sincerely hope that the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference does not make the mistake of confusing enhanced National Determined Contributions targets with the real climate actions. I have seen too many COPs wasted by simply being obsessed on haggling over the target numbers, but missing the core issues such as carbon pricing and fiscal reform for decarbonization and mitigation. It is very important that the Glasgow COP act as a platform to implement real actions for decarbonization and to deploy concerted global actions for mitigating carbon emissions as well as to provide financial support to climate actions of developing countries.

Photo taken on Sept. 21, 2019 shows the United Nations Youth Climate Summit held at the UN headquarters in New York, Sept. 21, 2019. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday said he saw a change in the momentum of global climate action thanks to the ongoing youth movement. (Xinhua/Li Muzi) Britain started hosting climate and environment ministers from 51 countries on Sunday for "critical" climate talks ahead of November's COP26 summit in Glasgow. British minister Alok Sharma, president of COP26 , is leading the two-day meeting, which London said will address "key issues that require resolution" at the summit. Sharma "hopes to build common ground and sketch the outline of the Glasgow outcome," according to a statement released by the British government. Environment and climate ministers from the US, India and China are among those taking part in the closed-door meeting, which includes both virtual and in-person attendance. "We are facing perilous times for our planet and the only way we will safeguard its future is if countries are on the same path," said Sharma. "It is essential that together we roll up our sleeves, find common ground and collectively draw out how we will build a greener, brighter future for our children and future generations." The event will cover the goal of keeping to the 1.5 C temperature rise limit, exploring topics such as climate finance, efforts to adapt to climate change, and finalizing the "rule book" for implementation of the Paris Agreement.\~ Negotiators from 196 countries, along with businesses, experts and world leaders are expected to attend.\~ US climate envoy John Kerry said this week that the summit marked a "pivotal moment for the world to come together to meet and master the climate challenge. "Glasgow is the place, 2021 is the time and we can, in a little more than 100 days, save the next 100 years. "Above all we need to provide action, and we need to do it now, because time is running out," he added.\~ AFP \</doc>

Once hailed as a prime mover on net-zero emissions commitments, the United Kingdom is redrawing its plans for homegrown fossil fuels in response to the hike in global gas prices and the crisis in Ukraine. Britain's nascent fracking industry looked set to fizzle out entirely in February, when regulators instructed oil and gas company Cuadrilla to pour concrete and seal up the only two shale gas wells in the nation, which were mothballed after a 2019 fracking moratorium. Fracking in the UK has proved complicated for an array of reasons, and, for many, persevering with the controversial method of drawing fossil fuel from the ground is at odds with the country's pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But Cuadrilla has now been told not to cap its wells for another year at least, since the UK is considering lifting the fracking ban. Prime Minister Boris Johnson then followed up in the recent Energy Strategy with plans to give the "fields of the North Sea a new lease of life" and greenlight new projects for offshore gas and oil. The surprise moves kept coming this week, when reports emerged that the UK may soon get its first new coal mine in 30 years. If given approval early in the summer, British company West Cumbria Mining will set about extracting coal from beneath the Irish Sea, The Telegraph reported on Tuesday. Environmentalists and opposition politicians have criticized this flurry of activity in the UK fossil fuel sector, which the government admits will do nothing to lower rapidly rising household energy bills. Prime Minister Johnson added in the Energy Strategy that "net zero is a smooth transition, not an immediate execution, for oil and gas". This represents a softening of rhetoric from November, when the UK urged other nations to scale back new fossil fuel projects at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP26 , in Glasgow. It appears that for Johnson and his Cabinet, security has risen above the green transition on the energy agenda, at least for now. Earlier this month, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that the conflict in Ukraine meant that the government should "keep all possible energy generation and production methods on the table". A return to fracking is controversial in the UK, which imposed a moratorium on the practice in 2011 and again in 2019 after drilling caused minor tremors. In the newly launched consultation, the government asked the British Geological Survey to report back on any "new developments in the science of fracking" that could "reduce the risk and magnitude of seismic events". Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh, said this line of inquiry is unlikely to bear fruit. "It's clear that there is no new evidence on fracking in the UK," Haszeldine said. "I expect that Cuadrilla will not argue fracking progress in science, but will argue that the felt effect of these tremors at the surface was very small." In theory, fracking could bolster UK domestic gas production, which has not met overall demand since North Sea reserves entered a notable decline after the turn of this century. But estimates of how much gas resides below British soil vary hugely, from around 4 trillion cubic meters to 65 trillion cubic meters, depending on the study. Optimistic estimates suggest that shale gas reserves are capable of meeting demand in the UK for around 40 years. But Haszeldine said that recent laboratory analysis of rock samples indicates that reserves would be depleted after just four years. "Shale gas was likely generated during burial 280 million years ago," Haszeldine said. "That is a very long time ago, and the gas has leaked away through the very abundant fractures and faults of UK geology." "The UK has no suitable industry of deep drilling for horizontal holes and no high pressure fracking industry," Haszeldine said. Danny Gross, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said that fracking is a waste of time and resources that could be used on less speculative technology. "Renewable energy, alongside a massive program to insulate the country's inefficient homes, is the quickest and cleanest way to bring down soaring energy costs," Gross said. Motive questioned Some have questioned if the government's plans for new fossil fuel projects are partly politically motivated, as the energy crisis has provided ammunition to a group of 30 members of Parliament known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which opposes the 2050 net zero pledge. The group has risen in prominence after linking the cost-of-living crisis to environmental levies intended to help fund the green transition.

By Harvey Morris | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-06-01 09:08 The influential International Energy Agency has called for a halt to all new oil, gas and coal exploration in a bid to secure the future of the planet by reducing carbon emissions to net zero by midcentury. In a report released on May 18, the IEA also said that investment in green technology would have to double to $5 trillion over the next 10 years to meet the 2050 net zero target. The recommendations come six months ahead of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow in November, when world leaders will meet to discuss progress on curbing global warming and consider future action. But what are the prospects that the talks on enhancing the 2015 Paris accord on climate change will look to the IEA proposals as a blueprint for an action plan? And is its call for zero exploration feasible? The Paris-based agency was set up in 1974 by major industrialized countries to respond to an oil embargo imposed by members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries and linked to the Arab-Israeli War of the previous year. The so-called first oil shock saw crude prices quadruple and signaled a shift in power from consumers to predominantly developing country producers. More recently, the IEA has evolved from an organization that was set up to ensure secure oil supplies into one that has embraced global efforts to enhance the switch to clean energy in a bid to tackle climate change. Launching the agency's latest report, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said the gap between rhetoric and action on climate change was widening. Although more countries were signing up to net zero emissions targets, global emissions were still on course to surge by 1.5 billion metric tons this year, he warned. Although governments accept the need for a switch from carbon-based production to green energy, there has already been resistance to the IEA's call for an embargo on further exploration. Some have expressed the view that curbing oil and gas, without adequate clean resources to replace them, will only lead to energy insecurity. Japan and Australia have both expressed reservations about the IEA plan, with the latter's resources minister, Keith Pitt, saying: "Coal, oil and gas will continue to be a big part of Australia's energy mix." Meanwhile, Akihisa Matsuda, deputy director of international affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said his government had no plans to freeze its oil, gas and coal investments. "The (IEA) report provides one suggestion as to how the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, but it is not necessarily in line with the Japanese government's policy," he said. "Japan needs to protect its energy security, including a stable supply of electricity, so we will balance this with our goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050." It is a debate in which no side contests the need for a fundamental shift in energy production in the coming decades. But differences remain about how to get there, particularly at a time when governments are under pressure to revive their economies as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The IEA itself acknowledged that, despite the impact of the pandemic, the world's renewable energy capacity had jumped 45 percent in 2020, spearheaded by a 90 percent rise in wind power capacity. It noted that a record amount of renewable power had come on stream in the fourth quarter of last year, with China alone adding more than triple the capacity it added in the fourth quarter of 2019. Despite China's massive investment in green energy, coal-fired plants remain the main source of energy supplies during the transition. Similarly, the United States relies on coal for one-fifth of its energy capacity. In Europe, Finland and Spain lead the pack, allocating 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of recovery funds to green spending, according to recent statistics. Ministers of the G7 group of mainly Western industrialized countries have meanwhile agreed to end direct funding of coal-fired power stations in poorer nations by the end of this year. That falls somewhat short of the IEA's call for a halt on such projects but is a step in the direction of the agency's war on coal. Its recommendations are unlikely to be followed to the letter, but they will provide part of the backdrop to COP26 . Governments may continue to debate the route to a cleaner planet, but there is no argument about the urgent need to reach the destination.

As host of the recent COP26 climate summit, Britain\' s drive to help slash global carbon emissions will involve keeping to its own target of phasing out diesel trains over the next two decades, industry bodies and observers say. According to the latest government data, about 29 percent of the UK train fleet still runs on diesel and freight trains run almost entirely on it. On Thursday, the government unveiled plans to electrify an additional 288 kilometers of track in a new rail strategy. This would help  to meet the ambition of removing all diesel-only trains from the network by 2040, the Department for Transport said. While electric trains emit 60 percent less carbon than their diesel counterparts, only 42 percent of the UK rail network is currently electrified, according to official data. That places the UK far behind its European neighbors, such as the Netherlands, where 76 percent of the network is electrified. With the current surge in electricity prices, some electric-run operators have recently been forced to revert to diesel locomotives, trade body the Rail Freight Group said last month. The RFG described the switch back to diesel as  regrettable. But the organization insisted it was only a temporary setback. Its director general, Maggie Simpson, highlighted a need for  more electric wires to support the investment in newer locomotives. Britain\' s rail freight is presently 90 percent hauled by diesel engines.  Of course, in the long term, we need to move to a decarbonized economy, so more use of electric traction is going to be a huge part of that, Simpson said. Train operators are taking the opportunity to transition also via hybrid models in much the same way as carmakers. Chiltern Railways, which runs passenger services between London in southeast England and the country\' s Midlands, recently announced investment in a hybrid battery-diesel train, developed by rolling stock owner Porterbrook and Rolls-Royce, the maker of aircraft engines. As well as increasing electrification of its rail tracks, Britain is in the early stages of producing trains that can run on the renewable energy hydrogen. French train manufacturer Alstom has announced plans to deliver the UK\' s first-ever fleet of new hydrogen trains, as opposed to rolling stock that has been remodeled. \</doc>

WINDHOEK, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's President Hage Geingob on Wednesday said the country has a unique opportunity to lead the discourse on combatting climate change globally as well as reap the substantial economic rewards that come with it. While giving a briefing on his trip to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , Geingob said these ambitions are matched by the highest levels of political commitment domestically. "As the most vulnerable country in Sub-Sahara Africa to climate change, adaptation is a priority in our updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). But clearly given our natural endowment for renewable energy, we need to do more to reduce our own emissions which are a mere 0.003 percent of global emissions. We are not the main culprits when it comes to warming the earth's atmosphere, but we suffer the consequences, nonetheless," he said. This is why I have explicitly included the development of a green and blue economy, as well as a green hydrogen industry, as cornerstones of the Second Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP-II), Geingob said. While at the conference, Namibia announced the winner of the Green Hydrogen project which will see the country aiming to generate about 5 gigawatts of renewable energy. According to Geingob, the announcement signaled Namibia's commitment to accelerating the development of green hydrogen that could be used to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors regionally and globally.

GENEVA, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- For Europe, the summer of 2021 has by no means been easy -- from unprecedented floods to wildfires, the continent has been seeing the devastating consequences of delayed climate action clearer than ever. For many scientists, this havoc is just the start of even more extreme weather events ahead, unless the world takes immediate steps to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To raise global awareness to potential human-induced climate changes, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body of the United Nations, released a report titled "Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis" on Monday. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS Forest fires are common during Greece's hot, dry summers, but the scale of the current ones this summer has been unprecedented. Lenio Myrivili, a Greek expert in urban resilience and climate adaptation, told Xinhua in a recent interview that Greece, under a moderate scenario in the next few decades, may experience a mean temperature rise in the summer months between 2-3.8 degrees Celsius, which means 15-20 days of heatwaves more per year and 12 percent less rainfall per year on average. Myrivili was recently appointed by Athens' mayor as the city's Chief Heat Officer, the first post of its kind in Greece and across Europe. "It acknowledges the fact that heat is becoming more and more an issue for cities ... and we have to start really mobilizing around," Myrivili said. In Albania on southeastern Europe's Balkan Peninsula, wildfires which erupted two weeks ago continued on Monday in various mountainous areas, where large areas of forests, pastures and fruit trees were scorched. People still have fresh memories of the recent torrential rain and deadly floods in western Europe, about which German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said, "the German language hardly has words for the devastation that has been wrought." German government officials said that this year, with storms, floods, heavy rain and hail on record, could turn out to be one of the most damaging since 2013. In Belgium, according to the country's crisis center, around 120 cities and towns were affected by the floods after days of torrential rains and burst rivers that had been unseen in Belgium for almost 200 years. ALARMING CLIMATE CHANGE Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, and also a review editor of the IPCC report, believes that it is becoming clearer that extreme weather events -- in the form of violent storms, floods and forest fires -- are linked to climate change. "A decade ago, we could not say anything about whether a heat wave in southern Europe was climate change or completely natural fluctuations. Now we have many more studies and methodologies that allow us to comment on it," Christensen told Denmark's science website videnskab.dk. Stefan Rahmstorf, an expert with Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told local media that events such as the recent severe flooding disaster in western Germany are becoming "more frequent as a result of global warming." "With average temperatures rising, the probability of having periods of strong rains also increase, because the hotter the air gets, the more it can contains water steam, so that can potentially create more rains," Swiss meteorologist Mikhael Schwander told Xinhua. Gian-Kasper Plattner, a Swiss scientist and one of the authors of the latest IPCC report, warned that extreme weather events such as the devastating rainfalls and scorching wildfires across Europe this summer would further increase and intensify. "We're now able to attribute many more changes to the human activities and to greenhouse gas emissions," he told Xinhua, adding, "We can actually attribute them to human activities. Climate models that we run with scenarios show that these extremes will intensify and get stronger with increasing temperatures." CLOSING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY According to the latest IPCC report, regardless of future levels of global warming, temperatures will rise in all European areas at a rate exceeding global mean temperature changes. Moreover, the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, including marine heatwaves, have increased in recent decades and are projected to keep increasing on the continent. "Despite strong internal variability, observed trends in European mean and extreme temperatures cannot be explained without accounting for anthropogenic factors," the report said. "Multiple climatic impact-drivers have already changed concurrently over recent decades. The number of climatic impact-driver changes is expected to increase with increasing global warming," the report added. For Rebecca Shaw, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) chief scientist, the latest IPCC report is truly "a game changer" because it allows scientists to pinpoint humankind's role in driving extreme weather events with more accuracy and certainty than ever before. "Scientists are certain that emissions from human activity have caused dangerous and permanent damage to the planet. Our window to reduce emissions and limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius is still possible, but it's closing rapidly," Shaw wrote in an email to Xinhua. Describing the report as an important moment in the lead-up to COP26 , the 26th United Nations climate change conference scheduled for Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 this year, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who leads the WWF global climate and energy practice, stressed that things will continue to get worse unless people immediately change course. "That's why world leaders must use every opportunity, especially the upcoming G20 Summit and COP26 , to deliver climate action that responds to the ambition needed to ensure the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement does not slip out of reach," he urged.

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-12 09:37 SONG CHEN/CHINA DAILY Less than one month before the start of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, leading international banks are reportedly showing reluctance to sign up to the most direct way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. In April this year, the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, set up a group called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz), which drew support from almost 300 global financial bodies with combined assets of $90 trillion. But just weeks away from the start of the gathering of world leaders, which United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutteres has called "a critical milestone in our efforts to avert climate catastrophe", the Financial Times reports that Gfanz negotiators have failed to convince many major banks to put an end to financing new fossil fuel exploration projects. Instead, many of the 59 banks are more interested in trying to achieve targets set by global warming scenarios presented by the UN-backed International Panel on Climate Change, which although it has much in common with the Gfanz report, allows for continued financing of such projects. Carney's plan follows guidelines published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in May this year, but a source close to the bank discussions told the FT that organizations were reluctant to sign up for them as "they think it's a fairy tale". More pressure has been put on Carney by the publication of a letter in several newspapers around the world, including the FT, written on behalf of around 90 climate groups, urging him "to stop greenwashing financial institutions that continue to invest in expanding fossil fuel infrastructure" by failing to win them over to the IEA proposals. "There is growing concern that in the run-up to the conference, financial institutions are using industry initiatives like Gfanz as cover for their continued support for coal, oil and gas expansion," explained the letter. Richard Brooks, climate finance director at Canada-based environmental protest organization Stand.earth, said Gfanz's work was almost being counter-productive. "The membership requirements for these net zero initiatives are set too low and as a result these alliances are doing the opposite of what they're supposed to," he said. "Rather than forcing banks and other financial institutions to step up their climate action, they're giving them the cover to continue their dirty financing of fossil fuel companies. We are running out of time and can't waste it on more greenwashing talk." In a recent speech in his native Canada, Carney also spoke of the need for economies to take preemptive action in dealing with the human fall-out of the move towards a greener economic future, by helping workers whose jobs will be impacted. " (We need to ensure) that the resources of a country, Canada in this case, can be properly dedicated to retraining, to building the resources of the future, to reinvest in the areas that are undergoing these adjustments," he said. "And now is the time to do it\u-243 not at some cliff\u-243 edge point down the road when there is a sharper adjustment." \</doc>

As the United Nations (UN) climate conference, billed as a "turning point for humanity," begins in Glasgow on Sunday, several issues are considered by environment experts to be critical: global carbon market, climate finance, and actual implementation. During the delayed 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ), which is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015, global leaders are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions. The conference, lasting two weeks, also comes at a time when the world has gone through a rapid-fire onslaught of climate-change-related weather disasters, from severe flooding to wild fires. To make the climate gathering meaningful, progress has to be made on such fundamental issues as finalizing the rules for the Paris Agreement's market mechanism, wealthy countries' unmet finance pledge to the developing countries, and the ability of the world's governments to transform words into action. "PARIS RULEBOOK" In 2015, COP21 in Paris passed a climate deal uniting almost all countries across the world in agreeing to cap global warming at well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. While Paris climate agreement was hailed as "historic, durable and ambitious," negotiators have failed to agree on Article 6 of the deal, which is about some technical details of the implementation of the deal in building the market mechanisms, especially the global carbon market. COP25 in Madrid failed again to reach an agreement on Article 6. Without working out final details of what has been referred to "The Paris Rulebook," the world's governments lack the necessary market-based approaches to attain the grand goals laid out in the Paris Agreement. "Getting these rules right is critical for fighting climate change: depending on how they are structured, Article 6 could help the world avoid dangerous levels of global warming or let countries off the hook from making meaningful emissions cuts," said the World Resources Institute, a global research non-profit organization. "I see a COP that is being pushed by developing nations. They want solutions, they want the rule book to be complete to start implementing the Paris Agreement," Gibson Mwangi, an expert on climate change from Kenya, told Xinhua. Discussions around Article 6 have long been dominated by issues like how to avoid double counting of emission reductions. All eyes are on COP26 to see if it will solve them and produce the much-needed Paris Rulebook. CLIMATE FINANCE Developed countries built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and have contributed most to the climate crisis, from which lower-income countries now disproportionately suffer even though they have done little to cause climate change. To pay their climate debt, wealthy countries in 2009 pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. The Tursday-published Foreign Affairs magazine said in an article that the wealthy countries' commitment reflected in part a recognition of "the deep injustice at the heart of the climate crisis." A UN-appointed independent expert group on climate finance said in a report published in December that this commitment is "the bedrock of the entire international climate finance system." "We hope the western countries would meet their financial pledges, and we all hope that this conference will succeed because it will bring good to the whole world," Magdy Tawfik Khalil, professor of environment at Ain Shams University in Cairo, told Xinhua. He explained that people in North Africa are concerned about future ice melt due to global warming that would raise the level of the Mediterranean Sea or any sea, which in turn would submerge coastal areas and many cities. ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION As COP26 gets underway, experts have underscored the importance of translating high ambitions into concrete actions. "The climate summit in Glasgow is the last attempt to avoid a catastrophe and reach an agreement on climate change," Ivana Antunovic Jovic, editor at Croatian Television, told Xinhua. "There have already been many similar gatherings, but there are no results, and the consequences of climate change are becoming more visible," she said. "In recent years, we have witnessed the United States ignoring the (climate) problem during the former administration. I hope that the new administration will understand the problem and try to solve it," Croatian climatologist Tomislav Peric told Xinhua. In his phone conversation on Friday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China is unwaveringly committed to accelerating green and low-carbon development, and has always walked its talk. China submitted two documents on its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term emission control strategies to the UN this week. It aims to strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Last month at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, China also pledged that the country will not build new coal-fired power stations overseas. It is never easy for a developing country with a population of more than 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization to make such promises. China will complete the world's most dramatic reduction in carbon emission intensity, and realize carbon neutrality from carbon peaking in the shortest time in global history. But the actual results have showed that China is serious about pursuing green development, and is honoring its pledges with an aim to contribute to humanity's better shared future. For example, the country's carbon intensity in 2020 was 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, exceeding its commitment of achieving a reduction of 40-45 percent in carbon intensity during the same period. "The pandemic has really raised the urgency. We recognize now more than ever that human well-being and planetary well-being are intrinsically linked with each other," Akanksha Khatri, head of Nature and Biodiversity at World Economic Forum, told Xinhua. "The real negotiations, of course, take place behind closed doors. I hope everyone at the table can get over their tensions, in the interest of the whole Earth," said Leo Meyer, former project leader at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and current director of Dutch-based ClimateContact Consultancy. \</doc>

The sixth plenum of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held from Nov 8 to 11 in Beijing, called for common prosperity in developing China's economy to avoid the kind of class distortions and gap between rich and poor now seen in North America and Europe. The meeting emphasized national rejuvenation as a concept that embraces Chinese traditional values while simultaneously projecting China forward during the 21st century by advancing technology, medical care and green energy systems. The timing of the sixth plenum coincided with the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. While International heads of state attending the conference pronounced breakthroughs in the fight against climate change, activists protested en masse, calling the meeting a sham. Past UN climate change conferences have focused on carbon trading (a mechanism embraced by investment banks and capital markets that fails to actually reduce emissions) and remedial funds (required for environmental repair after the damage). They have not focused on the core issue of transforming the energy grid of each nation away from reliance on fossil fuels to green energy. That is a proposition most Western politicians, who depend on fossil fuel corporations for campaign funds, would prefer to avoid. China's commitment to this transformation has now become national policy with very specific targets, as underscored at the sixth plenum. Ecological civilization as a national policy has been recognized as one of the achievements of the CPC. This national environmental policy has even been enshrined in the CPC's Constitution, making the CPC technically the most green political party in the world. Let us look at the big picture to understand what is happening in China. When the ecological civilization policy was first adopted in 2015, China relied on coal for almost 80 percent of its energy needs. Under the ecological civilization policy, China will have adopted green energy systems for 80 percent of its needs by 2030. This will require political decisiveness to make such a dramatic shift in energy usage. Few Western politicians could make such a commitment, as it would sideline traditional fossil fuel interests. The CPC's determination to transition China's energy grid away from reliance on fossil fuels in adopting new technologies for green energy places China in a position to lead the world in the battle against climate change. And China has an overarching, coordinated policy approach under which different sectors work together to achieve a shared goal. The concept of ecological civilization takes into consideration comprehensive approaches in order to achieve national goals of energy grid transformation. Fixed-asset investment into constant upgrades of infrastructure has been a hallmark of China's economic development. The ecological civilization policy will require such investments to focus on overhauling the electricity grid to shift it away from fossil fuels toward green solutions. Inherent in this process will be green financing, with local governments issuing green bonds, whereby funds raised will go into new green energy and water conservation solutions. Technology will play a key role and education will focus on new standards of engineering and system conversion to promote green energy solutions nationwide. Moreover, public education will promote a national commitment to saving rather than consuming. While many European nations have very advanced technology for green energy, some of these nations only have a population of several million\u-243 less than the size of a mere district in any Chinese city. So by enhancing green technologies through expansion of their footprint, the costs drop considerably, allowing China to scale these solutions on a more cost-effective basis than fossil fuels. These new solutions, green infrastructure and technologies can now be offered to developing nations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative that need to upgrade their energy approaches. At the crux of this is GDP, the old measurement of economic success that often does not broadly cover economic health. In the past, local officials were promoted based on their ability to deliver high GDP rates. Now local officials are subject to a natural asset evaluation of their region. Promotion or demotion now depends on whether they can preserve, protect and even enhance the natural environment of their region. So, in many ways, the sixth plenum has set new standards for officials to achieve in their careers and new technology thresholds for future generations. \~ The author is a senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization. \</doc>

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- As the world marked the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer on Thursday, a leading scientist hailed recent efforts to protect this thin part of the Earth's atmosphere vital for the survival of mankind as a rare "success story," but urged more international cooperation to tackle climate change. "The Montreal Protocol was actually extremely successful, so the ozone layer is back on its way to recover," Dr. Zita Sebesvari, deputy director at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security based in Bonn, Germany, told Xinhua. "One of the largest holes was above the Antarctic, and WMO (World Meteorological Organization) recently reported that that hole is closed by now so that's one of the recent developments," said Sebesvari. The WMO declared in January that the record-breaking 2020 Antarctic ozone hole finally closed. It was the longest-lasting and one of the largest and deepest holes since the ozone layer monitoring began 40 years ago. In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Sept. 16 as the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, commemorating the date of the signing, in 1987, of the Montreal Protocol. It is a landmark multilateral environmental agreement that regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances (ODS). "We really succeeded with the Montreal Protocol to stop the production and consumption of these harmful gases and with that we are on a very good way to actually recover the ozone layer. It's not yet there but it's on a very good way," Sebesvari said. The ozone layer, a fragile shield of gas, protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, thus helping preserve life on the planet. Human activity has damaged this protective layer of the stratosphere and while ozone layer health has improved, there's still much to be done. "The ozone layer is a layer in the atmosphere around 15 to 30 kilometres above the Earth's surface with a high concentration of ozone and it's protecting us, and generally life on Earth from the harmful impacts of UVB waves," said Sebesvari, also one of the lead authors of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. "It's filtering out around 97 percent, 99 percent of these UVB waves. That means that it has an incredible impact on life on Earth. If the ozone layer would be depleted or missing, there would be no life on Earth, in fact." "In the 70s, scientists raised awareness that we are depleting our ozone layer by using substances which are aggressive to the ozone layer. I think the subsequent international action, and the Montreal Protocol is a really good example how international cooperation can actually help to solve a major global issue and to have society to actually survive," she said. NO TIME TO REST Sebesvari also emphasized the impact of the protection of the ozone layer on climate change. "There's a very recent paper published in Nature from this year, which shows based on modelling that if the Montreal Protocol wouldn't have been put in place, we would have seen an additional global warming of 2.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century." "This shows that taking action in one specific area, like here for the ozone layer, was extremely beneficial for halting climate change and that international action can actually be successful," the expert said. "We do not have too many success stories, but this is definitely one." Asked about China's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and how the country could help to further mitigate the impact, she said, "it's important that we do not forget about how important it is to further observe and respect the Montreal Protocol, and also monitor if such ozone depleting gases are still produced or still omitted." "We can't just rest on the success. We need to continue following and respecting the protocol and monitor our emissions. All countries need to do more, in terms of curbing further our greenhouse gas emissions. China is within the boat, but not alone there so the entire international community needs to increase ambition." The theme of World Ozone Day 2021 is "Ozone for Life: 36 Years of Ozone Layer Protection." It comes as the crucial 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26 , will be held in the British city of Glasgow in November. Enditem \</doc>

On the eve of a landslide reelection victory in Barbados, Prime Minister Mia Mottley pledged a new housing program based on Chinesebuilt, pre-engineered homes. It was the latest sign of an increasing engagement between the Caribbean island and China that has ruffled feathers in the West, including in the United States, which sees the region as in its own backyard. In the week of the snap election on Jan 19, Mottley visited one of the first Chinese prefabricated houses to be constructed on the island and said that they would be an integral part of her plans to build at least 10,000 new homes over five years. On election day, Mottley's Barbados Labour Party scored a landslide\u-243 all 30 seats in Parliament\u-243 a repeat of the 2018 election result that brought her to power. As the leader of a small nation of less than 300,000, she has emerged as a substantial figure on the regional and even the international stage, not least at the 26th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , in November. She warned fellow delegates there of the climate perils facing nations such as hers and said: "Failure to provide enough critical funding to small island nations is measured in lives and livelihoods in our communities. This is immoral, and it is unjust." Mottley again made headlines later that month when Barbados became a republic after her government made the decision to replace Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The move was largely symbolic, as the former colonial power had exercised no direct authority since the island became independent in 1966. It will remain a member of the Commonwealth, the association that groups the UK and its former colonies. Although the decision was accepted with equanimity by the UK monarchy\u-243 Queen Elizabeth's son and heir, Prince Charles, attended the handover, at which he acknowledged the "appalling atrocity of slavery"-it was the occasion for others to allege Chinese interference in the island's affairs. One UK Conservative member of Parliament claimed Chinese pressure had driven Barbados to remove the Queen as its head of state. Without providing details, MP Tom Tugendhat claimed, "China has been using infrastructure investment and debt diplomacy as a means of control for a while." One UK commentator lamented: "For all its talk of post-Brexit global ambitions, the British government has failed to invest in the Commonwealth's soft power. China, meanwhile, has (plowed) hundreds of billions of dollars into Commonwealth countries in recent years." Others dissented, with the widely published UK-based commentator Sebastian Shehadi asserting that the decision of Barbados to become a republic was an entirely reasonable one and had been hijacked by a zerosum narrative of China versus the West. The most effective rebuttal came from Prime Minister Mottley herself. Challenged by a BBC interviewer to explain whether a country in the "backyard" of the US was swapping one superpower for another, Mottley hit back: "We don't call ourselves America's backyard. We established relations with China 44 years ago, and China has investment across the world. "For you to focus on the Caribbean or Africa  without recognizing the role China is playing in Europe or in other North Atlantic countries, is a bit disingenuous," she said, "and really reflects more that we are being seen as pawns, regrettably, rather than countries with equal capacity to determine our destiny." The closer investment relationship with China is hardly a surprise, since Barbados joined the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative in 2019, one of eight regional states to do so. Aside from the housing project, China is also involved in providing technical assistance in a number of sectors and launching educational programs. Barbados has, meanwhile, showcased its domestic brands at trade exhibitions in China. The relatively high-income island state is on the lookout for investment after the COVID-19 pandemic hit an economy heavily dependent on tourism alongside financial services, compounding an existing challenge posed by high levels of debt. In January last year, tourist numbers plunged to around 4,000 from more than 60,000 in the same month of 2020. Visitor numbers are picking up again as tourists, predominantly from Europe and North America, are attracted back to its tropical beach resorts, golf courses and Caribbean culture. Before the pandemic struck, Barbados was actively engaged in encouraging tourism from China. Its ambassador to Beijing, Lloyd Erskine Sandiford, called for a special focus on the markets of China and East Asia as the most promising and resilient. That ambition may have been stalled in the short term by COVID-19. But there seems little doubt that the overall ties between Barbados and China will continue on an upward trajectory.

The China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, released in November as a result of continued in-depth discussion and extensive action from various sectors in both China and the United States, is of great significance. It has not only contributed to the positive outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) in Glasgow, but also enhanced confidence that the world can effectively address climate change. The COP 26 The world has also been encouraged by the two countries' statements in support of accelerating the transition to a global zero-carbon economy. Over the past two years, more than 100 countries and regions have proposed their "zero carbon" or "carbon neutrality "goals, with more than 30 countries issuing formal policy declarations. Mankind is facing an unprecedented crisis, but it is also an unprecedented opportunity to step into a new era of prosperity driven by clean energy. Both China and the US have made significant and positive progress in their respective domestic policies, and proactive actions from all sectors have laid a solid foundation for bilateral collaboration between the two countries. Overcoming the climate crisis requires cooperation, especially from the leading economies. Although significant differences exist between China and the US in terms of development stage, energy mix, industrial structure and other macroeconomic indicators such as urbanization rates, the two countries have the potential and advantages to engage in substantive climate collaboration. And their willingness, as shown by the Glasgow declaration, has certainly injected vigor into translating the potential into reality. There is all-round eagerness to see this cooperation flourishing in the power sector, where both countries have set ambitious targets. The US aims for its power system to be zero-carbon by 2035. China has proposed the construction of a new power system with renewable energy dominating. To achieve these goals, however, both China and the US are facing big challenges. According to the official report by the US Department of Energy, by 2035, the shares in the power system should be 40 percent for solar, 36 percent for wind, 11-13 percent for nuclear, 5-6 percent for hydroelectric and 1 percent for biomass, with nonfossil energy accounting for more than 90 percent of power generation. In 2020, the US added 15 gigawatts of solar capacity, which is just 3 percent of its power generation. Achieving 40 percent of its power generation from solar power by 2035 will require an average of 30 GW of solar capacity installed per year between now and 2025 and 60 GW per year from 2025 to 2030. China has proposed that non-fossil energy will account for about 25 percent of its primary energy consumption by 2030, and the total installed capacity of wind and solar power will reach over 1.2 terawatts. It is currently producing renewable energy on a large scale. By 2025, renewable energy will account for more than 50 percent of the total installed capacity. It is expected that renewable energy will account for about two-thirds of China's additional power consumption and more than 50 percent of the additional primary energy consumption, becoming the main source of additional power consumption. HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202111/30/61a57cf3a31019b094bddd68.png Link to Image By 2060, the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption in China should reach about 80 percent. But achieving these goals is no doubt going to be a difficult task. Despite their different resource endowments and stages of development, China and the US share common challenges with regard to decarbonization. These are in many aspects and all of them can be considered as focus areas for cooperation. Take the power sector as an example. Increasing renewable energy's proportion to 70-80 percent will pose significant pressure and risks to the operation and scheduling flexibility of any power grid; large-scale, long-distance transmission of renewable energy will be a key element needed in both China and the US given their vast size; and the coordination between the supply side and the demand side, the electrification of end-use energy and demand response are also the inevitable means and approaches for the decarbonization of power sector in any geography. According to the joint statement issued at Glasgow, the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s has launched a new approach of cooperation, in which "policymakers lead while all stakeholders engage and contribute". It is particularly thrilling to follow, participate and contribute under this new cooperation model, so as to facilitate the strengthening of communication, exchange of best practices and the joint exploration of decarbonization pathways for the future. Upgraded policy measures, technology innovation, and market design will lay the foundation for a zero-carbon world. Despite intensified competition, win-win cooperation is not only an inevitable way for mankind to cope with the climate crisis, but also inevitable to benefit from technological progress and the new industrial revolution, and to achieve a better and more equitable society. China is demonstrating a brand-new pathway in which its experience in moving from poverty eradication to common prosperity and carbon neutrality will be valuable for less developed and vulnerable countries. The new round of prosperity led by clean energy will fundamentally improve human production in a cleaner and smarter way, completely overturning the sources and ways of human energy use. Both China and the US are expected to lead this trend through comprehensive and in-depth cooperation on climate change.

As extreme weather events hit more frequently and the specter of a disastrous temperature rise looms, the just-concluded United Nations climate change conference has brought the world renewed hope. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which concluded on Saturday. Meanwhile, developed countries, whose industrialization is responsible for most of today\' s climate change impacts, were urged to pay their fair share. After six years of discussions, COP26 completed the technical negotiations on the so-called  Paris Rulebook, which fixes the transparency and reporting requirements for all countries to track progress of their emission reduction targets. \</doc>

Right now, 25,000 representatives from around the world are gathered at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, to avoid a climate catastrophe. A few weeks ago, China hosted a global conference in Kunming, Yunnan province, focused on averting the catastrophic loss of nature. Both climate change and biodiversity loss are very real threats that require a strong and unified global response. Given the complex geopolitical situation, it is really heartening to witness and be a part of the ongoing positive cooperation between the European Union and China on climate and environment. This cooperation is bearing tangible fruit. Last month, a joint EU-China communique was released that contains breakthroughs on key issues, such as tackling global deforestation, greening supply chains, strongly implementing rules for the global biodiversity framework, and new areas of climate cooperation, including transitioning away from coal, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and reducing non-CO2 emissions, including methane. The communique followed the second "High Level Environment and Climate Dialogue". EU Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans has been very confident about this cooperation with China. Bilateral contacts between the EU and China on climate have intensified since 2018. In June that year, the first activity of the EU-China Environment Project took place in Brussels, attended by top experts and officials, including Timmermans and Xie Zhenhua, China's special climate envoy. The meeting, held in cooperation with the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, discussed how to strengthen global environmental governance. The pivotal role of the EU and China was underscored by all participants. This mutual trust is translating into better outcomes for the world, as can be witnessed from all sides really stepping up their game. Take, for example, President Xi Jinping's pledge to the UN in September to step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and to no longer build new coal-fired power projects abroad. This is in my mind still the best news for the climate we've had this year. China's just-released "1+N" climate action plan sets a strong, overarching policy framework for the peaking, and subsequent constant reductions, of carbon emissions. It emphasizes strict responsibility for implementation: "Taking a whole-of-nation approach, we will strengthen top-level design, hold both CPC committees and governments responsible, and ensure responsibilities are fulfilled by all parties." This comes as no surprise, as the central government has already deployed some of its most powerful instruments in an effort to rein in rising emissions. Market-based approaches are clearly emphasized in the plan, as is the role of nature. China's "1+N" plan is similar in structure to the European GreenDeal. Both come with an overarching design, and strategies for key sectors such as energy, industry, buildings, transportation and agriculture. The EU's Green Deal is a little ahead, in that most of the sector strategies have already been developed and contain helpful numerical targets. And many sectors in Europe are already seeing steady declines in carbon emissions. As China and Europe implement these strategies, there will be countless opportunities for two-way cooperation, giving China the opportunity to build on successful approaches in Europe, and vice versa. Both sides can also benefit from comparing approaches to tackle similar challenges, such as safeguarding energy security throughout the transition. Throwing more coal at the problem isn't sustainable, so the focus shifts to finding solutions to rapidly upscale renewable energy, energy and resource conservation, grid-level energy storage, transforming to smart, interconnected grids, and developing price-driven and responsive power markets. All of these approaches are strongly reflected in both the Chinese and the European strategies. Amid China's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, coal consumption has quickly risen. To meet the climate targets set in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), emissions must be brought under control, while at the same time ensuring a healthy economy. This is a major challenge that should be addressed through green economic stimulus. Monetary policy and large-scale fiscal spending should support the strategic sectors of the future, rather than unnecessarily extending the lifeline of polluting sectors, which should be gradually phased out. This brings Europe and China to another common challenge: Green stimulus and greening financial markets come with a risk of "greenwashing", where companies and even government departments might be falsely using environmental claims and green labels, undermining the entire system. Strong mechanisms for disclosure and multi-stakeholder supervision are needed to safeguard against this risk. In Europe, the environmental law organization ClientEarth regularly brings legal complaints and court cases to challenge such behavior. Sometimes approaches are different, but they seek to achieve the same goal. Challenging greenwashing is a good example of this. In addition to rolling out environmental information disclosure requirements, China might soon deploy its prosecutors in this effort. China has established teams of public interest prosecutors around the country, bringing thousands of legal cases on behalf of the environment, against polluting companies and government departments. Zhang Xueqiao, deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, recently announced that these prosecutors are actively exploring climate change litigation, and they have just assigned a team of prosecutors to work with the stock market regulator. These prosecutors complement the role of civil society in providing a legal assurance to the green transition. Mutual confidence of the EU and China on tackling the climate and nature crises is critical. This in-depth cooperation helps give confidence to other countries that the climate and environment ambitions of two of the world's largest economies will continue to develop, and will be fully implemented. Quoting from the speech of naturalist David Attenborough at COP 26 in Glasgow: "If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilize our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it." \~ The author is chief representative for China of environmental law organization ClientEarth and team leader of the EU-China Environment Project. \</doc>

HONG KONG SAR -Media OutReach- 18 January 2022 -With sustainable development drawing increasing attention, the eyes of the world have turned to tackling the crisis of global warming following the 26supthsup United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), which took place in November last year. In Hong Kong, enhanced strategies and targets for combating climate change and achieving carbon neutrality have been set out. Arup, a global built environment consultant, recently organised the 'Envisioning a sustainable Hong Kong' video competition to raise awareness among young people, aiming to extend a positive influence on their peers, family and the community to enhance the city's future. The Hong Kong government and various sectors have been taking proactive steps to address challenges including aging population, the landfill problem, and climate change. On top of it, it is important to pool together the efforts of all members of the community, especially the younger generation, empowering them to channel their opinions and play a greater role in driving sustainable development. This competition offered youngsters a precious opportunity to draw up their own blueprint for the future Hong Kong and amplify their voices and aspirations through video production. As part of its 45supthsup anniversary celebration in Hong Kong, Arup shared with young people an array of sustainable engineering and design solutions, riding on its impactful projects in the city, from Tai Kwun the largest revitalisation complex, to TPARK the first waste-to-energy facility, and to Neuron a digital platform for smart building management. The participants were also guided to develop an innovative mindset and leadership skills in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Unleashing creativity with videos The competition received an overwhelming response, attracting more than 230 entries from teams formed by 480 students across 51 local secondary schools. From using animations and 3D models to creating a game-like experience, the participants unleashed their creativity in a 45-second video, showcasing their visions of Hong Kong with insights on infrastructure, building design, waste management and urban planning. The results of the competition were announced at an award presentation ceremony last month. At the event, Michael Kwok, East Asia Region Chair of Arup, said that sustainable development is more than just a global issue, but one closely related to our city and lives with far-reaching impact on our descendants. By co-envisioning the city's future with the younger generation, he hoped to gather new impetus to drive innovation that makes Hong Kong greener, more liveable and resilient. Broadening horizons to pursue a better future Many students were pleased with what they took away from the competition. Among the winners, Sun Ka-ying from Good Hope School, who won the Champion award, reflected that the activity has deepened her understanding of Hong Kong. From conception to producing the video, she got to explore different corners of the city, leading her to imagine a more sustainable Hong Kong where people and spaces are connected and our cultural heritage can be passed on. Other winning teams addressed topical issues such as the urban heat island effect, overpopulation and land shortage. Kwok Chi-lok and Chan Yu-him, from Carmel Pak U Secondary School, expressed that by creating a 3D model, they aimed to project a sustainable city in a simplistic and easily understandable way while underlining the importance to balancing economic, environmental and social needs. On the biggest gain of the competition, Au Cheung-lok from TWGHs S. C. Gaw Memorial College shared that he learned much more about sustainable development and enjoyed working as a team in conducting research and devising meaningful solutions such as vertical farming for Hong Kong. The competition was supported by social welfare organisations including the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong, St. James' Settlement, The Women's Foundation, and The Zubin Foundation. Various learning opportunities were provided during the competition, including an online workshop with experts sharing to enhance students' understanding of the UN SDGs and video production techniques. The students also met Arup's engineers to explore their aspirations in the engineering and design sector. Outstanding participants will be given a visit and job shadowing opportunities at Arup. Details of the results are as follows and the winning entries are available for viewing on Arup's YouTube channel.

By PRIME SARMIENTO in Hong Kong | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-10-06 06:57 Pledges are a 'monumental signal' to accelerate shift to renewable energy President Xi Jinping addresses the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video on Sept 21, 2021. [Photo/Xinhua] China's pledge to help other countries with green energy while ceasing to build new coal-fired power projects abroad will help other developing nations in Asia reduce their dependence on coal and meet their commitment to cut carbon emissions, analysts said. They said that China's commitment to low-carbon growth is crucial as Southeast Asian governments prepare their climate commitments ahead of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ), which will be held from Oct 31 to Nov 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. Analysts hailed Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, in which he said that China will support other developing countries' green and low-carbon energy projects. "If the global fight against coal was a novel, President Xi's statement is the paragraph that opens the epilogue," said Renato Redentor Constantino, executive director of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, a Manila-based climate policy think tank. Constantino said Xi's statement is a "monumental signal" to Southeast Asia's governments to accelerate the region's transition to renewable energy. "After decades of addiction to fossil fuels, it will certainly be challenging for governments in the region to phase out coal in a time frame that allows Southeast Asia's power sector to establish irreversible pathways to modernization. But having China as a partner will be nothing less than a massive boost that can transform visions into reality," he said. Cesar Carlito Baclagon, regional finance campaigner for Asia of 350.org, an international environmental group, congratulated China on its "wise decision" to stop support for external coal investment. "A push against coal power plants sends a clear message that China and the rest of Asia, especially member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, can play a leadership role in building a fossil-free future," Baclagon said. He expressed his hope that Xi's statement will encourage the regional bloc "to push other wealthy countries to step up and get their financial institutions to do better" at the COP 26 . Tata Mustasya, climate and energy campaign strategist at Greenpeace Southeast Asia, welcomed China's move, noting that financing from China and other wealthier countries is needed to build green energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia. "The key is energy transition, because 60 percent of global emissions come from the energy sector," Mustasya said. Prior to the pandemic, Southeast Asia was one of the world's fastest growing regional economies, boosting energy demand. The International Energy Agency said that growing ownership of household appliances and air conditioners, as well as increasing consumption of goods and services, have increased electricity demand by more than 6 percent annually over the past 20 years. Greater demand for electricity has also expanded the construction of coal power plants. The IEA said Southeast Asia is one of the few regions of the world where coal-fired generation has been expanding, with close to 20 gigawatts of new coal-fired generating capacity under construction, mostly in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Some Southeast Asian governments have made a commitment to decarbonize, but analysts noted that such statements have to be matched with concrete policies and programs. Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, is also among the world's biggest coal producers and exporters. Indonesia is also the biggest electricity consumer in the region and coal accounts for around 60 percent of the country's electricity generation. The capital city of Jakarta alone is surrounded by more than 20 coal-fired power plants within a 100-kilometer radius and is one of the most polluted cities in Southeast Asia, according to Greenpeace. State-owned utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara said in May that it will stop building coal-fired power plants after 2023 to meet Indonesia's goal to slash emissions. But environmental experts believe that the country must stop building power plants now and start investing in renewable energy sources to meet its climate goals. In the Philippines, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said last year that the country is imposing a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants and will allow 100-percent foreign ownership in large-scale geothermal exploration, development and utilization projects. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob highlighted low-carbon development in a plan he presented to the nation's legislature on Sept 27. He said carbon pricing and a carbon tax will be introduced so that Malaysia can become carbon neutral by 2050. Matthew Ashfold, associate professor and head of the School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences at the University of Nottingham Malaysia, said the prime minister's commitment to transform Malaysia into a carbon-neutral country indicates that there's a "wider consensus" in ASEAN to move away from coal-powered plants over the longer term. Ashfold said if ASEAN wishes to meet its commitment to the Paris Agreement, it has to reduce its dependence on coal as soon as possible given the "multidecade lifetimes" of power plant infrastructure. "So ideally new green energy infrastructure is not only seen as an alternative to new coal power stations, but it will be sufficient to also allow the early retirement or retrofitting of existing coal power stations," he said. Ashfold said that apart from meeting climate goals, a shift to renewable energy sources can reduce health impacts from fossil fuel-related air pollution in ASEAN member nations, citing a February 2020 report from Greenpeace which revealed that air pollution has caused more than 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia. "Such huge, diffuse costs are typically not accounted for when evaluating the economic case for investments in fossil fuel technologies," Ashfold said.

GENEVA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Robert Mardini, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), has called on the more than 100 world leaders attending the ongoing United Nations (UN) climate summit, to prioritize the world's most vulnerable populations who face the dual challenge of armed conflicts and the dire consequences of climate change. Mardini spoke to Xinhua on Tuesday on the sidelines of the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Glasgow, Scotland. He identified three main priorities for the participants. "The first one is for the international community to acknowledge that actually people living in armed conflicts and in contests affected by climate change are the most vulnerable and are to be really prioritized. The second one is ... the collective bold effort from the international community to focus on genuine and meaningful mitigation measures to reduce carbon emissions and to avert the climate crisis in the first place," he said. "And the third one is ... really linked to the most vulnerable (populations). They should be top of the list in terms of support, (but) the fact of the matter today (is) they are totally neglected." Between 2018 and 2020, Mardini was head of the ICRC's delegation and permanent observer to the UN in New York. During his 22 years with the ICRC, he also led the ICRC's Water and Habitat Unit, which managed projects in over 40 countries, such as Rwanda and Iraq. On the eve of the current COP26 meeting, he visited Mali, where he gained first-hand experience of how climate change is pushing families to the brink in a country also battered by nearly a decade of conflict. "I think Mali and many of the countries in the Sahel region exemplify really the 'perfect storm,' where communities find themselves being at the intersection of conflicts, violence, and also the consequences of climate change that are more and more visible," he said. "I was in Mali last week and I could see first-hand how those double challenges are hitting hard communities ... I spoke with a woman for instance in a (displaced) camp, and she told me how she lost her house twice. The first time she lost it to floods, the second time she lost it to violence because of armed competition and violence around shrinking water resources and grazing lands," he said. "This is the story of millions of people living across the Sahel, in Niger, in Burkina Faso, including in places like Afghanistan. Out of the 25 countries that are today the most vulnerable to climate change, 14 are actually countries that are torn by armed conflict. So, you can imagine how challenging it is for those populations to face this double adversity," he noted. According to the UN, climate hazards have already damaged around 80 percent of the farmlands in the Sahel region, drastically reducing food sources. Some 29 million people in the region were reported to need humanitarian assistance and protection, more than ever before. Whether in Mali, Niger or Afghanistan, where the ICRC is present, "if I put really myself in the shoes of ordinary people who are struggling with the consequences of climate change, with the more frequent floods, drought, desertification, declining of water tables and hardship, I think that we are reaching a point where ... the collective action needs to be taken by all states today." Mardini said that the ICRC has witnessed conflicts that are more fragmented, more deadly for the civilian population, and are harder and harder to solve politically. "So the key here is for the international community and the warring sides to reach settlements, to really create political consensus to solve conflicts in the long term," he said, urging the international community to "put everything in place to ensure respect for the rules and for international humanitarian law, which when respected, will reduce human suffering." Asked about China's role, Mardini said that "the decisions China will take will have a great influence on the planet. The good news is that the ICRC and China are already working a lot together." He said that the ICRC has had a delegation in Beijing since 2005 and has been engaging with China everywhere across the globe "in the very contexts that are on the frontline of conflicts and climate change, trying to engage in multilateralism ... to ensure respect for international humanitarian law." "I myself had a very good experience in New York. We genuinely engaged with China in the UN around the importance of multilateralism and international humanitarian law, which, by definition, is a great example of how multilateralism can work to garner support around the basic rules that would limit the human suffering ... We are really committed to continue engaging with China." Mardini said he considers multilateralism a central element of humanitarian diplomacy. "The planet is burning with the massive challenge around climate change and I think what is happening in Glasgow, even if not perfect, is still important to make sure that all countries can rally around the common goal." "I'm sure that China has a huge role to play in this endeavor to make sure that multilateralism is also focused on very concrete problems that are putting millions of people under huge pressure today," he said.

From my window on the 18th floor of a Beijing office building, I can see distant mountains on three sides, standing out against a clear blue sky. The contrast is striking compared to the smog-wrapped city I first visited in the years running up to the 2008 Summer Olympics. As athletes, sports fans and political commentators prepare for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, amid geopolitical tensions and climate risks, what lessons have been learned from the two-decade effort to clean up Beijing's skies? Efforts to improve the air quality have resulted in clear skies known as "Beijing Blue" which became the new normal after the Chinese government intervened. According to the International Olympic Committee, to fulfill its commitments made in the 2000 bid, China invested $21 billion in air quality improvements, including upgrading 60,000 coal-burning boilers and converting more than 4,000 public buses to run on natural gas. Concrete achievements, not just rhetoric, are what enabled China to gain international acknowledgment and create "a lasting environmental legacy", according to a United Nations Environment Programme report. As anyone who has breathed Beijing air for the past decade can attest, the path to blue skies has not been linear, but China's commitments highlight measurable progress. The fight against air pollution is an example that foreshadows China's ability to take action on climate change and redeem global trust for a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable future. President Xi Jinping's ambitious pledges that China will peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 have motivated industries to take action and prompted other countries to up their game on emissions. Figures show that China's carbon intensity in 2020 was 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, fulfilling China's commitment to the international community to achieve a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from the 2005 level by 2020. Now the"1+N" policy framework, meaning a general guideline plus various specific action plans, is dedicated to putting actionable policies in place in response to President Xi's initial commitment. This Herculean task gained momentum with the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) in late 2021. The two nations have also reached a consensus on climate finance and nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. As the World Economic Forum President Borge Brende has said, future cooperation between China and the United States is crucial. "The only way (to move) forward is to realize that we are in the same boat and we have to collaborate." However, the picture is not entirely rosy. PricewaterhouseCooper's 2021 Net Zero Economy Index shows that currently we are reducing the carbon intensity of our activities at less than one-fifth of the rate we need\u-243 12.9 percent a year. Along with other studies, the report concludes that such a huge transition cannot be achieved without a systematic and complex rewiring of the entire global economy. But declining trust among the public further dampens this prospect. A global climate study by the WEF, covering 28 countries, found that only around one-fourth of respondents trust business sustainability claims and most participants feel strongly that current environmental protection efforts are not sufficient. To restore trust, the WEF is committed to supporting all stakeholders to find a common language on sustainability targets and actions. In 2020, in collaboration with other leading institutions in the field, the WEF co-developed a comprehensive set of metrics to fill the gap in consistent environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting standards. A follow-up report on the ESG landscape among Chinese companies concluded that a measurable global language of sustainability that accords with global green investing priorities while helping Chinese companies along the journey to reach national environmental targets is increasingly relevant and would be appreciated by Chinese stakeholders. Meanwhile, the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road demonstrate the commitment of Chinese stakeholders to uphold climate action beyond its borders by supporting developing and emerging countries to harness green finance and technology to scale up low-carbon infrastructure. Not only climate, but other global environmental concerns such as biodiversity, are high on China's priority action list. The WEF began publishing its New Nature Economy Report Series in 2020, using data to identify pathways for businesses and governments to join the transition to a nature-positive economy. Looking back at events over the past two years, it is clear to the world that collaboration and trust are not just important\u-243 they are essential\u-243 if human beings are to survive and thrive. World leaders will have the chance to renew the world's trust in their commitments to improve the state of the world at the upcoming Davos Agenda Week which will be convened virtually. Outside, the cloudless sky gives an impression of timelessness, but we should not forget that it was not achieved instantly, effortlessly or single-handedly. To ensure that future generations can still enjoy the gifts of nature, we must shoulder the responsibility: working together, restoring trust.

The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference that concluded on Saturday in Glasgow, Scotland, has made it clear that the transition to a zero-emissions economy must be based on translating aspirations into concrete actions and all parties agreeing on practical solutions based on the principle of equity. But these actions should not affect the sustained economic development of countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In the foreseeable future, the countries will unavoidably use fossil fuels, and the banks still need to provide financing to the high-emissions industries. Some people are urging the banks to stop such lending, and the countries to stop using fossil fuels. But although green technologies and renewable energies have developed quickly, they cannot replace fossil fuels overnight. Doing so will force hundreds of millions of people into poverty, and collapse the world economy. Which is unfair and unrealistic. So the developed countries need to make a choice between that and taking practical measures to help the less-developed countries maintain their development while facing up to the challenges of climate change. In other words, the world must respect the emerging market economies' rational needs to improve their people's livelihoods, and to pursue new development. The developed countries' financing and technology assistance to the less-developed countries is the key to filling the gap in emissions reduction between countries. The funds and technologies should be used to promote the development of infrastructure for sustainable development and renewable energy, and green technology research and development. Those opposing banks' lending to fossil fuel companies should be practical as these companies can play a huge role in accelerating the development and application of green technologies, and creating jobs, boosting growth and generating tax revenues in the emerging market economies. Now is the time for the banks and governments to work together to verify the most needy entities and sectors to receive funding and technology assistance. To address a common challenge entails the coordinated efforts of all parties.  21st Century Business Herald \</doc>

HONG KONG SAR ;- ;Media OutReach ;- 3 November 2021 - ;The combined impacts of climate change and overfishing mean Asia's fisheries are at risk of collapse in the coming decades, according to new research released today. Photo credit: Calton Law, further press materials available here. ; The report Sink or Swim: The future of fisheries in the East and South China Sea shows that growing demand for fish-based feed in the aquaculture industry is an emerging driver of fisheries overexploitation in the East and South China Seas. ; Under a severe climate change trajectory, which indicates a 2 C warming by 2050, the South China Sea is likely to experience significant declines in key commercial fish and invertebrate species, placing many regional fishing economies at risk of devastating failure. ; Scientists call for immediate action to reduce fishing effort in the next ten years in order to prevent irreparable damage to Asia's key oceans. As the two most important fishing areas in the West Pacific in terms of productivity and economic value, the East and South China Seas have a combined trade valued at approximately US$100 billion. ; Parts of these marine areas have experienced warming ten times the global average, whilst subject to decades of overfishing. Many commercially important species, such as chub mackerel or large yellow croakers, are currently classified as overexploited. ; The research, conducted by University of British Columbia (UBC) fisheries scientists and ADM Capital Foundation, highlights key threats and risks of economic losses under a range of climate change and fisheries management scenarios. ; The fisheries team applied advanced ecosystem modelling techniques to project the impacts of climate change and overfishing on fish populations and the revenues generated by the fisheries of the East and South China Seas. ; "Under certain climate change scenarios, seafood species that are mainstays of the Hong Kong seafood market, such as groupers and threadfin breams, could be reduced to a fraction of their present population by the end of the century \- if not driven completely to extinction," explained Dr. Rashid Sumaila, Professor at the Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries and the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at UBC. ; "This is especially the case in the tropical waters of the South China Sea, where many fish species are already facing the limits of their heat tolerance," he added. ; The analysis specifically focuses on seafood species that are valuable to Hong Kong, where 95% of seafood consumed is imported and the annual value of imports rank amongst the highest in the world. ; The severe climate change scenario estimated losses in revenues upwards of US$10bn annually for South China Sea fisheries. By comparison, US$3-7bn in losses are projected under a mild climate change scenario, equating to 1 C in global warming by mid-century. ; Combined with the effects of a severe climate change scenario, continued business-as-usual fishing intensity is expected to result in a 90% drop in key commercial species, by weight (biomass) in the South China Sea by the end of the century. This translates to a projected US$11.5bn of annual revenue losses. ; The East China Sea is similarly expected to lose 20% of the biomass of its key commercial species under this same set of conditions. However, in a scenario where fishing intensity is reduced by 50% in the next ten years and climate change is mild (i.e., 1 C warming by mid-century), the East China Sea has the potential to gain 20% in marine fisheries biomass by 2100 compared to present day. ; The overexploitation of Asia's fisheries has in part been driven by the growth of the aquaculture industry. Many commercial vessels now opt for a 'quantity over quality' approach to produce feed for farmed fish and animal feed \- known as feed-grade fishing. ; "Many people are unaware that aquaculture can contribute to overfishing, rather than counteract it," said Dr Yvonne Sadovy, Honorary Professor at the University of Hong Kong. "By using wild-caught fish for aquaculture feed, we are harvesting juvenile fish of commercially important species and potentially jeopardizing future regional food security." ; The research highlights an urgent need to seek alternative protein sources for the aquaculture industry. By allowing juveniles to mature in the wild, modelling predicts that regional fisheries revenue would be over ten times higher than if current feed-grade fishing practices are continued. ; "The research sets the foundation to initiate regional dialogues to collectively manage East and South China fisheries, especially including themes of climate change adaptation," said Ashley Bang, an author of the report. ; "With a strong commitment to regional fisheries management and climate change mitigation, our oceans can continue to support Asia's human, social, and economic well-being to infinity," said Dr. Rashid Sumaila of UBC. "The choice is ours to sink or swim." ; All eyes are on this week's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ; Read the full report here. ; \</doc>

WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday again pushed back the timeline for a vote on a 1-trillion-U.S. dollar infrastructure bill amid resistance from progressive House Democrats. "As you know by now, the House will postpone the vote on the BIF (Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework)," Pelosi said Thursday evening in a letter to House Democrats. "The good news is that most Members who were not prepared for a yes vote today have expressed their commitment to support the BIF," she said. "As you may recall, we are ready for the Floor vote on the BIF, because the debate on the rule and the bill have already occurred," said the Democratic speaker. The decision to delay the vote came hours after Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said that the so-called Build Back Better Framework announced by U.S. President Joe Biden earlier in the day was not enough to get progressives on board. "Members of our Caucus will not vote for the infrastructure bill without the Build Back Better Act. We will work immediately to finalize and pass both pieces of legislation through the House together," Jayapal said in a statement. Biden on Thursday morning unveiled a framework for a 1.75-trillion-dollar social spending package, known as the Build Back Better Framework, in a bid to pave the way for House Democrats to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was approved by the Senate earlier this year. Progressive House Democrats have held up the Senate-passed bill for months, demanding a vote on the larger social spending plan. Delaying the infrastructure vote again is a significant setback for Democrats with Biden making clear privately for more than a week he wanted passage of the bipartisan measure before he arrives at a United Nations Climate Change Conference \</doc>

At their recent meeting in Tianjin, China's special envoy on climate Xie Zhenhua and the U.K.'s President of the upcoming U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), reportedly held "candid, in-depth and constructive" talks regarding arrangements for the meeting, and cooperation on climate change between the two nations. A constructive and in-depth approach is certainly needed. COP26 , being held in Glasgow in November, offers an opportunity for leaders to act together to avert the worst impacts of global warming. The U.K. and China have pivotal roles to play. The U.K. is co-hosting the conference with Italy, so is responsible for setting the bar high and doing the diplomatic work in the run up necessary to ensure success. The U.K. also has to demonstrate it has plans in place to meet its own ambitious emissions reduction goal. And China, as a global superpower and a major emitter of greenhouse gasses, could set an example to other emerging economies of enhanced ambition and commensurate action to speed up the transition to a low carbon future. New HYPERLINK https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/09/climate-change-risk-assessment-2021 research from Chatham House This year alone, record-breaking floods have ravaged China, Germany, Belgium and Bangladesh, deadly wildfires have ripped through Australia, Siberia, the U.S. and Turkey, and heatwaves have claimed lives in southern Africa, southern Europe and central and western U.S. According to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, weather disasters are striking four to five times more often and causing seven times more damage than in the 1970s. Climate change is here and it is set to get worse. The current pace of global decarbonisation efforts put the world on track for at least 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, which would have devastating consequences. Without a radical change to the status quo, by the 2030s, 400 million people a year are likely to experience heat so extreme that they are unable to work outside; the number of people exposed to temperatures so hot that they are life-threatening is likely to surpass 10 million a year; and by 2040, some 3.9 billion people will probably experience major heatwaves annually, 12 times the historic average. By 2040, almost 700 million people each year are likely to be exposed to droughts of at least six months' duration, nearly double the global historic annual average. No region will be spared, but East and South Asia will be worst-hit - with, respectively, 125 million and 105 million people a year likely to be affected. When it comes to food and the world's ability to feed a rapidly growing global population, the scale of the crisis is evident. Food production will need to increase by 50% by 2050. But without rapid and sizeable emissions reductions, agricultural yields are set to decline by 30% by the same date. By the 2040s, the probability of a 10% yield loss, or greater, within the top four maize producing countries - the U.S., China, Brazil and Argentina - rises to between 40% and 70%. Beyond the quantifiable risks, there is the growing possibility that climate-related events could trigger a sequence of connected incidents across regions and sectors. A total of 70 experts convened by Chatham House agreed these cascading risks could drive higher mortality rates, trade disruption, food insecurity, increased migration flows, a rise in infectious diseases and even armed conflict. With each point of a degree increase in global temperatures, there is a growing likelihood that these incidents compound one another and combine to create a negative feedback loop where each incident further amplifies the effects of the others. Soberingly, this is not even the worst-case scenario. Climate scientists have long since identified the prospect of tipping points, whereby abrupt changes occur as a critical earth system threshold is passed, such as the disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet. There is now growing concern that current models may underestimate their potential influence. To avert catastrophe, all governments will have to do more. Climate Action Tracker's latest analysis rates just a single country - Gambia - as having overall climate action that is consistent with the target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, a target agreed by governments at the U.N. climate meeting in Paris in 20215. While some countries have submitted revised plans - known as "National Determined Contributions" - ahead of COP26 that move in the right direction, the actions of the majority, including many of the highest emitters, are highly insufficient. Australia, Indonesia and Brazil - all hugely exposed to climate risk - have said they won't improve on the pledges they made in Paris in 2015. Meanwhile, India and China are yet to submit their new proposals. Collectively, there is still a yawning gap between where we are and where we need to be, and each moment of delay puts the 1.5 degree target further out of research. The coming weeks will be critical for the future of our planet and life on it. There is no time to lose. Daniel Quiggin is a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.

At the recent G7 summit in Cornwall, Sir David Attenborough described the decisions currently facing the world\' s richest countries as  the most important in human history. He is right. The summit was held against a backdrop of crises, including the pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, rising inequality, and an  infodemic of misinformation. These challenges have made this a decisive decade for global action. While we welcome the G7\' s new commitment to halve carbon dioxide emissions and become  nature positive by reversing biodiversity loss all by 2030, these steps represent the minimum of what is required from the wealthiest countries on Earth. As 126 Nobel Prize laureates note in a recent call to action,  The future of all life on this planet, humans and our societies included, requires us to become effective stewards of the global commons. This consensus emerged from the first-ever Nobel Prize Summit, Our Planet, Our Future, which was jointly hosted by our organizations in late April. Nobel laureates and other experts from around the world came together to assess the risks posed by our hyper-connected world. In an era characterized by acceleration, scale, and systemic shocks, we explored what can be achieved now and in the coming years to put the world on a more sustainable path. The challenge is as daunting as it is straightforward. Unless we embrace transformational action this decade, we will be taking a colossal risk with humanity\' s future. Collectively, we are failing to appreciate the value of social and environmental resilience by allowing for large-scale, irreversible changes to the Earth\' s biosphere. Given the stakes, the ambitions that governments bring to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in November must be commensurate with the scale and urgency of the challenge. We are hurtling toward dangerous tipping points. We know this not just from scientific theories and complex equations supported by computer models, but from what we can see with our own eyes. Major parts of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting. Major stores of carbon in the roots, trunks, and soils of the Amazon rainforest and in permafrost regions are weakening and potentially destabilizing as we speak. Social inequality The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation that redistributes heat globally is slowing down. At the same time, many countries\' politics are being destabilized by high levels of social and economic inequality and the increased spread of misinformation and disinformation. As this process has now been fully industrialized by digital technologies and platforms, the infodemic threatens our ability to respond effectively to global crises. The Our Planet, Our Future meeting highlighted the need to invest more in science so that we can make sense of the world and drive socially beneficial innovation. COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time because we had already invested in more than a decade\' s worth of basic research on messenger RNA and immunogens. G7 governments have now committed to pursuing closer international cooperation in research and development. But we also will need to explore new business models to ramp up the sharing of scientific knowledge and investments in basic research. International networks of scientific institutions also will need more investment. Universities should embed concepts of planetary stewardship in their curricula. And education at all ages should include a strong emphasis on the nature of evidence and the scientific method, in order to help build herd immunity against lies and misinformation spread by special interest groups and partisan media. The end of the fossil-fuel era entails a monumental economic transformation that is already underway. But we will not make the progress that we need without economic dynamism. While G7 countries have signaled an intention to phase out coal, most have yet to specify a clear date and strategy for doing so. With a rapidly dwindling carbon budget, such dithering is not compatible with preserving climate stability at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, relative to preindustrial levels. Finally, all countries should recognize that increasing disparities between rich and poor feed resentment and distrust, undermining the social contracts that are needed for difficult, long-term collective decision-making. To mitigate these risks, we should complement GDP with other metrics that better capture the well-being of people and nature. Today\' s leaders need to be bold in serving the ultimate expression of justice: the right of coming generations to a livable biosphere. Humanity\' s long-term survival depends on the decisions that we make right now. World leaders gathering at the G7, the G20, and the biodiversity and climate summits this year must think in terms of centuries and generations, not years or months.

LONDON, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth II will not attend the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, which starts this weekend, Buckingham Palace announced Tuesday. A palace statement said: "Following advice to rest, the Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle" and she "has regretfully decided" that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 on Monday, Nov.1. The Queen "is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message", said the statement. The 95-year-old monarch spent a night in hospital for "some preliminary investigations" last Wednesday, after she cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland as she was given medical advice to rest for a few days. She had been scheduled to attend events in Scotland as part of royal COP26 engagements between Nov.1 to Nov.5, the Sky News reported. Enditem \</doc>

China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-23 07:52 [Photo/IC] The Glasgow Climate Pact the United Nations Climate Change Conference produced in the Scottish city on Nov 13 is in line with the world's expectation. But it is nothing to brag about. It is good to see that more than 100 countries reached agreements in reducing methane emissions and deforestation, and some countries made pledges on halting the use of coal. But despite these, what was achieved at the conference was mainly the reiteration of the previous pledges countries had made and evaluating their respective performances. No substantial breakthrough was made. Worse, most of the objectives on carbon emissions reductions stipulated in the Paris Climate accord have not yet been realized. Experience shows that the developed and developing countries must make concerted efforts to reduce emissions through resolute actions to phase out fossil fuels and develop renewable energy resources. And to blaze a trail of green development in the less-developed countries, which manufacture life necessities for the developed world, the developed countries should provide them with necessary fund and technology support. The developed countries seem to be aware of that more than before. But still they are reluctant to shoulder their overdue responsibilities for the developing world. That's why UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the developed countries to fulfill their promise of providing developing countries with $100 billion each year to help them respond to climate challenges. As the largest developing country, China has never counted on the developed countries' assistance, and instead it has rolled out a systemic action plan to transform its fossil fuel system to a low-carbon energy system, and to develop renewable energy industries. To peak its emissions before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality before 2060, China has to rely on emissions reduction and the research and application of relevant new technologies at the same time. The opening of a national carbon emissions trading market system is a key step to optimize the distribution of resources. These should serve as an example for other developing countries. At least, they should let the price of their exports reflect the costs of emissions reduction, and take the initiative to transform emissions reduction efforts into a drive to upgrade their industries and restructure their economies. \</doc>

chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-14 20:00 A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] The Glasgow Climate Pact that was adopted at COP 26 on Saturday will hopefully prove to be a milestone for the global response to climate change, as it acknowledges that the emissions commitments made by countries so far are nowhere near what are needed to avert this existential threat to humans and other life on Earth. In reaching a consensus on the need to come up with increased targets and actions to prevent planetary warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, although it has not yet averted the impending climate cataclysm, has hopefully set us on the path to doing so. Especially as the pact for the first time calls on countries to reduce their reliance on coal and stop subsidizing fossil fuels. And a promise has been made to end deforestation by 2030. What has added to this encouraging news is the joint declaration in the final days of COP 26 by China and the United States on enhancing responses to climate change in the 2020s. With a ray of hope in sight that the temperature rise can be kept to the 1.5 C target, it is important for all countries to take real actions. China has already made specific plans to ensure that its CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and it achieves carbon neutrality before 2060. However, whether developed countries will deliver on their commitment to supporting developing countries in their adaptation to and responding to climate change is the key to averting catastrophe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on this pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. It is essential for developed countries to realize that the financial and technological support they give to their developing counterparts is not charity. The emissions they discharged during their industrial development were much more than what the developing countries do today and they should be held responsible for most of the impacts from climate change. To a certain extent, this financial and technological support is the cost developed countries have to pay for the accumulated emissions they discharged in the course of their development. That explains why the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be maintained when dealing with climate change. Developed countries need to realize that their support in terms of both funds and technologies will make it possible for developing countries to do a better job in reducing their emissions and do their bit in the global fight against climate change. From this perspective, their support is crucial for more effective global climate change action. \</doc>

THE hard-fought Glasgow Climate Pact sent a clear message to global companies and executives: reassess business strategies and carbon footprints to reap monetary rewards, or lag and risk losses. The deal announced late Saturday, ending two weeks of fraught negotiations between nearly 200 nations, pushes countries to do much more to curb climate-warming carbon emissions. That pressure will increasingly be imposed on investment and industry to bring emissions associated with their businesses in check. The Glasgow pact also delivered a breakthrough on rules for governing carbon markets, and took aim at fossil fuel subsidies. Beyond the political negotiations, the Glasgow gathering brought in many of the world\' s top CEOs, mayors, and leaders in industries, including finance, construction, vehicles and aviation, agriculture, renewable energy and infrastructure.  COP26 has unleashed a wall of new private sector money, said Gregory Barker, executive chairman at energy and aluminium company EN+ Group, by email.  For business everywhere, one thing is certain, big change is coming and coming fast. Two separate investment conferences on the side of the U.N. climate summit touted profits to be made for those who meet environmental conditions for the cash. Many deals were announced, including plans for a standards body to scrutinize corporate climate disclosures that will challenge boardrooms. Goal of 1.5 degrees With the pact reaffirming a global commitment to containing global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, along with  accelerated action in this critical decade, boards can expect tougher national pollution policies across all sectors, particularly in transport, energy and farming. That will leave the companies without a plan to adapt to a low-carbon economy looking exposed, U.N. High-level Climate Action Champion Nigel Topping said.  If you haven\' t got a net-zero target now, you\' re looking like you don\' t care about the next generation, and you\' re not paying attention to regulations coming down the pipe, Topping said.  Your credit rating\' s at risk, and your ability to attract and keep talent is at risk. Adding to the pressure, financial services firms with around US$130 trillion in assets have pledged to align their business with the net-zero goal. Increasingly, they will lean on the boards of corporate climate laggards. Carbon markets The summit\' s deal resolving rules for the global trading of carbon offset credits was applauded by business for its potential to unlock trillions of dollars in finance to help countries and companies manage the energy transition. Observers said the agreed rules addressed the biggest worries and would likely prevent most abuses of the system. The nonprofit We Mean Business coalition, which works with corporates on climate, said the rules  have the potential to unleash huge investments. By putting in place the framework for a global trading system, the pact also brings the world closer to having a worldwide price on carbon  demanded as a priority by investors and companies before the talks. A global price would allow companies to more accurately assess the value of assets, as well as costly externalities  driving more climate-aligned decisions on anything from where to build factories to which companies to buy or products to launch. With carbon offsets tied to efforts to preserve nature, more than 100 global leaders during the conference pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Companies and investors also said they would ramp up forest-protection efforts. Fossil fuels For the first time, the deal saw countries acknowledge that fossil fuels were the main cause of climate change, and called for an end to  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It did not say how to determine if subsidies could be justified. It singled out coal, the most polluting of the fossil fuels, though later switched from urging a  phase out in coal-fired power to a  phase down. The change in wording, following objections by coal-dependent nations, was seen by developing economies as an acknowledgement that industrialized nations are mostly responsible for the climate problem. But many in wealthy economies worried it could mean years more of unbridled emissions as developing nations grow. Calling the move  dangerous and damaging for the climate, Germany\' s biggest industry association warned it could hobble its industries as they are forced to abandon the cheap fossil fuel international competitors can still use.  This concentrates emissions in countries with less stringent climate measures and unilaterally wears on companies that already need to cope with large financial burdens, the Federation of German Industry said Sunday. Still, the very mention of coal and fossil fuels in the Glasgow pact was hailed as progress in U.N. climate talks, which for decades have skirted the issue. Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of the international business of asset manager Federated Hermes, said the result would put pressure on some oil companies that were  not as forthcoming as others. He also said  coal companies will have to think very carefully about their future plans. Meanwhile, the world\' s biggest economies are driving the shift. The top two, the United States and China announced plans to cooperate on climate action, including bringing down emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Elsewhere, six countries, including France, joined the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, committing to halting new oil and gas drilling. Twenty countries including the United States and Canada pledged to halt public financing of fossil fuel projects overseas, and 23 nations promised to phase out coal-fired power. A number of companies in sectors including transport are already betting big on increased electrification, with U.S. carmakers Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) among those saying they will phase out fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. The Glasgow talks have  drawn attention to the great opportunities arising from a different form of development  stronger, cleaner, more efficient, more resilient and more inclusive, said climate economist Nicholas Stern. The breakthroughs  seek to make clean and green production competitive in all these areas by 2030. (SD-Agencies) \</doc>

HONG KONG SAR - ;Media OutReach ;- 30 November 2021 - Climate change is without doubt the most pressing concern in the world today. At the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, world leaders agreed on two major initiatives to tackle the problem: Ending deforestation and reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 as compared with 2020 levels. Hong Kong is eager to help, and earlier this year launched the first "Advancing Net Zero" (ANZ) Ideas Competition to help drive net zero solutions in the building sector. Organised by the Hong Kong Green Building Council (HKGBC) with Swire Properties as the Principal Partner, the competition attracted great interest and the winners were announced today. The competition invited experts from around the globe to contribute innovative design ideas and practical solutions in two categories: (i) Future Buildings and (ii) Existing Buildings and under three main themes: (i) Zero carbon & ultra energy efficiency, (ii) Embodied carbon, (iii) Health and sustainability. Participants could propose their ideas based on the real data of two office towers \- site of One Taikoo Place and Oxford House in Taikoo Place, so that the solutions generated could be realistic and the implementation feasibility could be enhanced. The overall aim was to move Hong Kong's building sector towards a sustainable future and actively meet the Hong Kong Government's target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 by fostering innovative solutions for the city. Ar Prof Ada FUNG, Chairperson of the Organising Committee of the Competition said: " Hong Kong is a signature model for a subtropical, high-rise and high-density urban context which is always a challenge for designers and architects when it comes to decarbonisation. Targeting the commercial building sector which accounts for 65% of electricity consumption in the city, we were delighted to see so many multi-disciplinary professionalal teams from around the world participate in the competition. In total, we received 22 entries from 58 organisations and companies. The entries were all of a very high standard and we have seen lots of inspiring and avant-garde concepts for both the local and global building sectors. We are glad to see some similar innovative ideas and trends emerging from different teams. Harvesting these ideas and solutions, we would build a Knowledge Bank to help accelerate their adoption by the industry to achieve net zero." ; Professional Jury of Global Experts The Jury Panel was composed of well-known experts from different industries including Ms Tanya COX, Chair of the World Green Building Council; Professor JIANG Yi, Director of the Building Energy Research Centre of Tsinghua University; Mr William MCDONOUGH, the founding partner of architects William McDonough + Partners and a globally recognised leader in sustainable development and design; and Ms Meaghan LLOYD, Partner at Gehry Partners, the acclaimed firm founded by Pritzker Prize Laureate Frank Gehry. The Winners The jury selected three Winners and five Merit Awards from the eight shortlisted finalists in the Future Building and Existing Building category.

In a few days all eyes will be on Glasgow, where the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) will be held. Some 200 states and regions will be represented, and more than 100 leaders are due to attend. But China, the European Union and the United States will be the most important participants at the conference, for a simple reason: Together, they are responsible for around 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, China contributes 28 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the US 15 percent and the EU 8 percent. Historically however, a different picture emerges. Over time, the US has contributed 29 percent to all man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the EU 22 percent and China just 13 percent. All three have set themselves ambitious emissions reduction goals for the next decade and beyond. In his address to the 2020 UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping announced that China will peak of greenhouse gas emissions before 2030 and that it will become carbon neutral before 2060. The Joe Biden administration has pledged that the US will reduce its emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050. The EU has pledged a reduction of 55 percent by 2030 and to also become carbon neutral by 2050. Over the past years, China has seen a spectacular development of its low carbon technology. Today, 45 percent of all wind turbines and 72 percent of all solar panels worldwide are produced in China. But while China is clearly a world leader in renewable energy, it is still dependent on coal. In his address to the 2021 UN General Assembly, President Xi stated that China will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. That is a significant development. Yet the importance of coal within China is considerable. In 2020, China commissioned more than three times as much power from coal than the rest of the world combined. As the concept of "ecological civilization" is enshrined in China's Constitution and has just again been stressed by President Xi in his address at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, it is to be hoped that the country can be weaned off coal. The Donald Trump administration left the Paris Agreement, thus putting the sincerity of the US commitment to the fight against climate change in doubt. The Biden administration was quick to reverse that decision and announce ambitious undertakings. The problem with the US is that climate policy is a deeply partisan issue, with Democrats favoring ambitious goals and Republicans much more reluctant to subscribe to deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. With the midterm elections just a year away and the next presidential election in 2024, it is difficult to foresee the trajectory of US climate policy over the next decades. That, however, is a requirement if other countries are to be induced to make and implement major commitments. The EU has been fairly consistent in its climate policy. Its 2021 Climate Law even makes adhering to its targets a legal obligation. The EU's problem, however, is\u-243 as so often\u-243 the divergence in the views of its 27 member states. While some countries, such as Germany, favor even more ambitious cuts, other countries, in particular those in Central Europe, are more cautious. And whereas Germany regards nuclear power as outdated and plans to switch off all its remaining nuclear reactors by 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron has just announced a new policy under which France, now generating 70 percent of its electricity from its more than 50 nuclear reactors, may add a large number of small modular reactors over the coming years. The EU and China have long established some degree of cooperation on climate issues. From the 2005 Joint Declaration on Climate Change to the 2018 Leaders' Statement on Climate Change and Clean Energy, there is a good basis on which further cooperation can be built. Collaboration between the US and China can be advanced with the Joint Statement Addressing the Climate Crisis released in spring 2021 as a starting point. The EU and the US also issued a joint statement this year in which both sides committed to greater cooperation to counter the climate crisis. Such cooperation will be necessary to tackle a number of contentious issues. One of them is the carbon border adjustment mechanism that the EU wants to introduce to stop "carbon leakage". It would essentially be a new tax on goods imported into the EU from countries with less stringent regulations on limiting greenhouse gases. China has already made clear that it does not favor the introduction of new instruments that could hinder trade, and the US, too, is less than enthusiastic. Yet still larger challenges loom. The World Energy Outlook, recently released by the International Energy Agency, shows that global energy-related emissions, after a short fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will rise this year, and it will in absolute terms be the largest increase since 2010. Even if all announced pledges by governments were to be implemented, the demand for natural gas and oil until 2030 would be much higher than required to move toward a net zero scenario. Governments therefore need to do a lot more to fully deliver on their announced pledges. The lofty goal that the international community has set itself can only be achieved by even more stringent national contributions, strict adherence to these pledges, and close cooperation, in particular among the three major players on climate policy. That, in turn, requires teamwork across the board: One cannot expect fruitful cooperation on climate while rivalry or even hostility on other issues persists.

AT the end of the year, many institutions around the globe are selecting  Word of the Year. Oxford\' s pick is vax (short for vaccine, vaccinate, and vaccination), followed by perseverance from Cambridge Dictionary, NFT from Collins Dictionary, and vaccine from Merriam-Webster\' s Dictionary. I used to teach at Soochow University\' s English Department in Taiwan, where I was in charge of picking  Taiwan\' s English Word of the Year. Now as a teacher at Sanda University\' s English Department in Shanghai, I am keen to carry on this tradition in Shanghai, with Dr Men and Dr Yang, my colleagues here. The three of us agreed to use Shanghai Daily, the only English-language newspaper in Shanghai, as the source of the corpus data for 2021. We were able to conduct relevant studies on the basis of the PDF file of this year\' s newspaper. Well, the Word of the Year does not have to be a word in the strictest sense. It can be a phrase or even a short sentence. The key point is that this  word should reflect the ethos of the year, with the intensity and length of the word\' s impact fully assessed. All the candidates had gone through several rounds of rigorous pre-selections, evaluations, and reappraisal to make it to the shortlist. We are well prepared that many will not agree with our decision. Unanimously, we settled on vaccine as Shanghai Daily\' s Word of the Year 2021. In our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the word vaccine has been here and everywhere, as testified to by our research of the newspaper corpus. There are also many instances of vaccinate and vaccination, but they are fewer, and could be well seen as derivatives of vaccine. Three others also made to the shortlist. CPC, short for Communist Party of China. This year marks the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and Shanghai has a special role to play in CPC history. Climate. With the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow, UK, and China\' s determination on mitigating climate changes, the choice of this word should not be a surprise. Delta, a Covid-19 virus variant. This mutant strain emerged in the middle of the year, and its impact is overwhelming. Omicron, the latest Covid-19 virus variant, deserves a special mention. Omicron entered our virus-fighting battlefield when the word selection process is underway. However, its rather relatively late debut means it will probably be shortlisted next year.

John Kerry, the US president's special envoy for climate, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Monday and called for the two countries to cooperate in tackling global warming. The United States and Russia, being among the leaders in greenhouse gas emissions, must act together on climate change, Kerry said to Lavrov, adding that he wanted to set out some proposals to get the two countries to work together. Kerry, who is visiting Russia from Monday to Thursday, told Lavrov that Washington wanted to work with Moscow ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow in early November, something Lavrov said Russia also wanted. Lavrov, who is also the climate envoy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he viewed Kerry's visit as a positive signal for bilateral relations and that Russia was hoping for close cooperation on climate issues ahead of the Glasgow meeting. "I consider your visit to be an important and positive sign for the development of bilateral relations, for a reduction in tensions, and for the establishment of professional substantive work in those areas where we can find common denominators," Lavrov said. Kerry noted that Washington is glad that Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in the virtual summit on climate in April, and that the White House believes that the Geneva summit was constructive and important for both countries. Kerry did not publicly say what the US proposals were. "The deal is to be able to deal with the climate issue separately. It's too important, too significant, and we very much need to move together. "We are among that small group of 20 nations that is the equivalent of 80 percent of all emissions. What we do, what we decide to do is critical," Kerry said. He underscored that the cooperation between Washington and Moscow on climate must develop despite the existing disagreements. "Russia attaches great importance to problems associated with global climate change and will continue to cooperate on climate issues on international platforms, primarily with parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change," said Lavrov. Putin and US President Joe Biden singled out climate change, during their summit in Geneva last month, as one of the few issues where Washington and Moscow could cooperate.

by Olatunji Saliu ABUJA, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- Jet Motors, a Nigerian startup electric vans assembler, has said it is aspiring to deepen cooperation with Chinese partners to tap into the African automotive space and bring about a revolution in the automotive industry in Nigeria. With a view to accelerating Africa's advancement in the mobility space by producing affordable electric vehicles for mass transportation while helping to reduce carbon emission on African roads, the Nigerian automobile manufacturer said it aims to achieve its goals with technical support from China and other international partners. "China has advanced so much in terms of technological know-how, in terms of the EV (electric vehicle) space. Sixty percent of lithium-ion battery manufacturing in the world are coming from China. It is a no-brainer to have this relationship with Chinese partners," Chidi Ajaere, the chief executive officer of Jet Motors, told Xinhua in a recent interview through video link. The firm is currently in talks with a number of Chinese partners, with an aim to deepen cooperation toward making electric vehicles, which are rare in most parts of Africa, Ajaere said. Speaking further on aspirations and the proposed partnership with Chinese firms, he explained that Jet Motors, which started operation in 2018, is having a long-term plan to develop such battery-powered vehicles as the mainstay in Nigeria and the African continent by making the EV market cheap for Africans. "Even in the West, many of the EV manufacturers have their base in China. It was a no-brainer for us to work with the best part assemblers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in China to be able to assemble an electric vehicle that is qualified for the African roads," he said, noting that China has been able to rapidly develop its EV market. "We don't need Nigerians or Africans having to necessarily leave Africa to go to China. We can bring many of those OEM parts and build high-quality batteries that are situated in China. We can have it in Nigeria in partnership with the Chinese but producing locally for Nigeria and for the rest of Africa," he said. POTENTIAL OF EVs IN AFRICA In Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, electric vehicles currently have "a very small niche market," Ajaere noted. However, there is hope for a brighter future, as electric vehicles or artificial intelligence-powered vehicles are, according to him, "the inevitable future." The automobile manufacturer says there is a target market in mind for fleet operators, cargoes, ambulances, security vans, and cases like that for now. The first electric van, produced by Jet Motors, got on the Nigerian road a little over a month ago, Ajaere said, while acknowledging the urgent need to work with the right partners to build charging stations across the board. "Around Nigeria, we have built the first five charging points, mostly in Lagos city. That is where we have our first use case. Our partnerships both with the government and investors will continue to expand those numbers," he said. "The easiest way to get mass adoption for EVs will be by giving people access to be able to charge these vehicles. We can build solar-powered charging stations across the continent," Ajaere said, noting that Nigeria, as well as other countries in Africa, boast of abundance in sunshine for solar power. With the evolution of this technology, Jet Motors says it aspires that the mass production of electric vehicles will be a catalyst to boost the economy in African countries. "Through Nigeria, we want to create for Africa, and we want to situate it in such a way that the kind of product that we are aspiring to produce and supply to everyone across the African continent is such that it will be a global product. It will be a major boost for the economy," said Sanjay Rupani, the firm's marketing and sales director. The EVs, Rupani noted, will create opportunities for more skilled people to get jobs and get more knowledgeable; people's lifestyles will also evolve positively as they get acclimatized to that positive aspect of technical knowledge that the charging stations will reshape. COOPERATING WITH CHINA TO CUT CARBON EMISSION IN AFRICA As the potential for electric vehicles continues to grow in Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari has been calling for investment in renewables. With fuel combustion causing a lot of pollution and damage to the environment, Jet Motors also eyes cooperation that will be geared toward Africa's 32 percent reduction of carbon emission by 2030 under the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The Nigerian government also pledged to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent under the same agreement. Africa is currently developing a strategy for greenhouse gas emissions to be presented to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26 , coming up in November. "I believe that China is making one of the major significant moves in terms of aligning with the climate and innovating in the space of renewable energy. I know that China is leading that space," Ajaere said. The ambition of reducing carbon emission will be met across Africa and the deficient levels of life expectancy as a result of the damage caused by fumes and smog will be greatly addressed, he said. "I think it is essential that Africa is also at the forefront of something that is so important to the existence of humanity. People need to move from one place to the other, cleanly, easily, and efficiently," Ajaere added. Enditem \</doc>

ROME, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Luigi Mattiolo, a senior diplomatic advisor to Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, said on Tuesday that the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) Leaders' Summit will broadly focus on three main areas: climate change, health and the global economic recovery. Speaking to reporters via video conference, Mattiolo said that the discussions about climate change will assess progress made in the run-up to the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP-26 ) to be held in Scotland, while the health-related negotiations will focus on issues such as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ways to improve pandemic preparedness. The negotiators will also consider ways to strengthen the post-pandemic global economic recovery and to make economic growth more sustainable, according to Mattiolo. The G20 summit, slated for this weekend, will also aim to help confront global crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, and will assess the situation in Afghanistan following the collapse of the country's government. The long-standing ministerial-level talks on finance, labor, education, foreign affairs, development, environmental protection, energy, culture, trade and agriculture are also on the event's agenda. The highlights of the ministerial meetings this year include: the finance summit focused on the international tax reform; the labor talks focused in part on gender equality; the negotiations on education, including the impacts of the pandemic on the education systems; and the discussions on the environment and energy, in preparation for the upcoming COP26 climate summit. Each one of the series of talks held earlier in the year concluded with a final declaration that will be formally presented to the heads of state and government for its adoption. "The big summit's main role will be to review and adopt the conclusions of the many working groups, task forces and ministerial meetings," Antonio Villafranca, research coordinator and head of the European Program at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a think tank, told Xinhua. "In Rome, the leaders will assess what has been done and what can still be done." One of the issues left to be decided, according to Villafranca, is whether the leaders would call for the curbing or elimination of the incentives that support the use of fossil fuels in the G20 countries. This decision will be significant since the G20 member states account for around 80 percent of the world's primary energy use, according to an ISPI report. If the leaders agree to reduce fossil fuel incentives it would also provide a boost to climate negotiations ahead of the COP26 climate negotiations, which get underway just as the G20 Leaders' Summit closes. But according to Raffaele Marchetti, an international relations professor at Rome's LUISS University, the effectiveness of the G20 should not be measured by its ability to make decisions. "The correct way to look at the G20 is as a forum for conversations between global leaders on important topics," Marchetti told Xinhua. "It's not necessarily a body for making major decisions. But those decisions can emerge from the discussions in the G20 context." "Other forums like the United Nations or the World Health Organization or the World Trade Organization are too large to be focused, and the G7 (Group of Seven) is too narrow and too dominated by western countries," Marchetti said. "But the G20 includes eastern and western powers alike. In most areas, it's the best forum where the major powers -- the United States, China and the European Union -- are all involved."

by Christopher Guly OTTAWA, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Women will play a key role in the new federal cabinet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled on Tuesday in Ottawa, a month after his Liberal Party secured a third consecutive mandate in a general election. Melanie Joly, who represents a Quebec riding in the House of Commons and has served in Trudeau's cabinet since 2015 when he became prime minister, becomes Canada's new foreign affairs minister. Joly replaces former astronaut Marc Garneau, who was only in the job since January and has been dropped from Trudeau's cabinet. Canada will also have a woman leading the national defense department. Anita Anand, who as procurement minister led Canada's efforts to secure vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, succeeds Harjit Sajjan, a Sikh and former Canadian military reservist who made global headlines when he was appointed to the defense post in 2015. But over the past six years under his watch, Canada's Armed Forces has been mired in complaints of sexual misconduct from within the military. It has involved the most senior ranks, including Admiral Art McDonald, who voluntarily stepped aside as chief of the defense staff in February after an internal investigation was opened into an allegation of sexual misconduct against him. Chrystia Freeland remains as Trudeau's top lieutenant, and will - as the prime minister indicated before Tuesday's swearing-in ceremony - continue to serve as deputy prime minister and finance minister. Assigning three senior cabinet positions to women could also signal succession planning on Trudeau's part. It is widely expected that the three-term prime minister will not seek a fourth mandate in the next general election, which could be triggered any time by the opposition in the House of Commons voting against the Liberal minority government Trudeau leads. So far, high-profile Freeland, who has previously held the foreign affairs and international trade portfolios in Trudeau's cabinet, is widely viewed as following him to become the first female leader of Canada's Liberal Party. Trudeau sent another important signal regarding his commitment to climate action with the slots he filled in his 39-member cabinet, which includes him. Less than a week before the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference begins in Glasgow of Scotland, Trudeau named Steven Guilbeault - an environmental activist before he was first elected to Canada's Parliament in 2019 - the country's new environment and climate change minister, and Jonathan Wilkinson, who worked in the green-technologies sector and previously held the environment portfolio, as Canada's next natural resources minister.

LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday announced a series of bills as the British government pledged to "level up" the country while recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking from the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, the Queen said in her speech that the British government's priority is to "deliver a recovery from the pandemic" which will "level up opportunities across all parts of the United Kingdom, supporting jobs, businesses and economic growth." The Queen's Speech was meant to set out the government's legislative agenda for new parliamentary session. The government will "deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before," she said. She also said the government will "strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure." Meanwhile, the Queen announced that proposals will be taken forward to transform connectivity by rail and bus with the High Speed Rail Bill. Legislation will be introduced to support a "lifetime skills guarantee" to enable people to access to high quality education and training throughout their lives, she said. The Queen said the government will provide additional funding to support the National Health Service (NHS), bringing forward legislation to allow the NHS to "innovate and embrace technology". Patients will receive more tailored and preventative care closer to home, she added. On the environment, the Queen said the government will invest in new green industries to create jobs. She reiterated Britain's commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Britain will host the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow in November. The Queen also introduced other bills covering such issues as education, women's rights, social care and mental health. Earlier Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government's plans will put "rocket boosters" under its "levelling up" agenda. However, the main opposition Labour Party has urged the government to deliver "action" rather than "rhetoric". The Queen's Speech is part of the normally grand State Opening of Parliament, but some ceremonial aspects of the event have been scaled back this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. Enditem \</doc>

By Alfred Romann | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-30 09:02 Delegates talk during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain on Nov 13, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] The world continues to inch closer to climate catastrophe but, thanks to the 26th Session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, or COP 26 , we now know a couple of things. One, the path to a catastrophic outcome is pretty well marked out. Two, the rich countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of this big global mess that we are in, are not wholly committed to cleaning it up or settling the overdue payment for cleaning it. An obvious conclusion that emerged from COP 26 , which was held from Oct 31 to Nov 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, is that the world needs to take immediate, drastic, sustained and multilateral action to limit the worst impacts of climate change. The world cannot afford to have any single country not participate. This may not be fair but, as it turns out, only the people on the wrong side of fair seem to be most worried about this. Everyone else is particularly concerned with saving cash. The unfairness built into all multilateral solutions is plainly visible if you take a look at history. In all the fear and talk about the dark future for the world, the past is often overlooked. Global warming did not start this year, this decade or even this century. The ramping up of human-caused climate change began when people started imposing their will upon nature by building cities, mass producing all manner of goods, burning things, extracting resources, clearing tracts of land for agriculture and all the other things people do to generally improve their lives. A drastic uptick in emissions started in the 1950s. Emissions have doubled over the past three decades and quadrupled in the last six. Since 1850, people have pumped a cumulative 2.5 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By various estimates, that leaves another 500 billion tons for global warming to stay within 1.5 C above preindustrial levels. By the end of this year, we will have burned through about 86 percent of our global "budget", according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A relatively small number of people in developed countries have accounted for a disproportionally high share of all those emissions. An analysis of historical emissions by Carbon Brief-a UK-based website that covers climate science, climate policy and energy policy developments-points out that the United States has, by far, been the largest producer of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The US, which under former president Donald Trump backed out of the Paris Agreement of 2015 on climate change and ramped up fossil-fuel extraction, accounts for about 20 percent of the CO2 in the atmosphere, even though it is home to a little more than 4 percent of the world's population. By one roundabout calculation, every person in the US basically took away the ability of four other people elsewhere to produce any kind of greenhouse gas and allow the world to stay within its "budget". China, with about four times as many people as the US, is second at 11 percent. China's ramp-up in emissions is relatively young and the country accounts for about 18 percent of the global population. Russia, Brazil and Indonesia come in third, fourth and fifth place, respectively, but in large part this is due to their large landmass and the way their land produces CO2. Other rich nations, mostly in Europe, have also punched way above their population weight in terms of emissions. The United Kingdom has produced 3 percent of global emissions with less than 1 percent of global population, excluding emissions from its colonies when it had them. The agreement reached at COP 26 is basically a watered-down compromise that aims to burn less coal instead of targeting all fossil fuels and sets global rules for trading carbon credits. However, the agreement does note that countries will need to cut emissions in half over the next decade. None of the three criteria that the UN had set to determine the success of the conference were met, including $100 billion in financial aid annually from rich nations to poor ones for efforts to adapt to climate change. The rich world basically agreed to talk about paying for the climate damage it caused, but ultimately failed to make any reparations. The climate mess is still there. The bill has come due.

MEXICO CITY, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- The achievements of the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) have filled the region "with encouragement and hope," Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Saturday. Among the achievements highlighted by the official are the constitution of the Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency, the creation of the Fund Against Disasters and Climate Change Effects in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the approval of the guidelines and proposals for a regional health self-sufficiency plan. Ebrard described the summit as successful and highlighted the final declaration of 44 points that include important agreements among the CELAC countries, as well as the special declarations on the need to end the U.S. blockade on Cuba and the body's common position on the situation of the Malvinas Islands, known as Falklands in Britain. The organization also agreed on a common position for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which is scheduled to be held in November in Glasgow, Scotland. The foreign minister highlighted the fact that the political and ideological differences among the members of CELAC did not prevent the meeting from reaching important agreements that will make it possible to face common challenges and seek greater regional integration and development. Undersecretary for American Affairs at the Argentine Foreign Ministry Juan Carlos Valle Raleigh said at the summit that CELAC is the "natural space to jointly promote the interests of the countries of our region at the global level and together build dialogue with strategic partners." Valle Raleigh said, "The objective of the meeting is to consolidate the regional bloc, prioritizing actions carried out to face the pandemic: self-sufficiency in health, economic recovery, food security, climate change, and international cooperation to position Latin America and the Caribbean as a key player on the international stage." "We must consolidate the progress achieved under the leadership of Mexico and project it into the future so that this forum continues to be a space of unity, which respects diversity, and in which the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean can see that, from the commitment between our nations, there are concrete improvements for all," he said. Also speaking at the summit, the executive secretary of United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Alicia Barcena, said the region requires "political unity and will" to face the emergency generated by COVID-19 as well as future pandemics through guaranteeing access to vaccines. "We have to better coordinate in health, economy, industry and finance, and promote a pharmaceutical industry. We can and we have the regional capacity for universal access to vaccines," said Barcena. Enditem \</doc>

Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry are meeting in Tianjin from Tuesday to Friday in the lead-up to this year's United Nations climate change conference . The talks send an unmistakable message to the outside world that China and the US are aware that they need to cooperate on climate change. This is Kerry's second trip to China this year as climate envoy. In April, Kerry traveled to Shanghai to hold talks with Xie, the trip making him the first high-ranking official of the Joe Biden administration to visit China. As the world's largest developing country, China has long been committed to sustainable development, and it attaches the highest priority to realizing its emissions goals. In September last year, China announced that it would peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Achieving these goals will require much effort and a lot of sacrifice, but China is determined to take concrete actions to attain them. China has also made it clear that it is willing to cooperate with the US and other members of the world community on emissions reduction and related issues, as climate change is an acute existential threat to humanity. Given this, promoting cooperation should be a non-negotiable responsibility for both countries. But the US should not presume that this means China will cooperate in specific areas handpicked by the US while bearing the strategic pressure and injustice incurred from the US policy to contain China. China's stance in this regard is best reflected in State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's remarks to Kerry via video link on Wednesday: The two sides' joint efforts to combat global warming are an "oasis", but surrounding the oasis is a desert, and the oasis may be desertified very soon. Indeed, with the Biden administration emulating its predecessor in pursuing a strategy to contain China, the once flourishing field of interactions is rapidly being transformed into a desert. The US has also tried to set up a new "iron curtain" against China by canvassing support for its containment policy from its allies. Against such a backdrop, how can the Biden administration expect Beijing to cooperate with it to address US concerns if it is not willing to reciprocate by addressing the major concerns of China. China-US climate cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment of China-US relations. The onus is on the US side to create the right conditions and atmosphere for fruitful dialogue and cooperation. It should stop viewing China as a threat and rival, abandon its containment policy against China, and make concrete moves to improve bilateral ties. \</doc>

RAMALLAH, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestine on Monday slammed the remarks of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett related to opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 border. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Palestinian presidential spokesman, told state radio Voice of Palestine that Bennett's remarks "won't change anything of the reality or the international legitimacy, because the Palestinian people's rights are clear." Abu Rudeineh called on Bennett "to understand well that peace with the Palestinian people is peace with all Arab states and Arab nations." Before heading to Glasgow to attend the UN conference on climate change , Bennett told reporters that "creating state-like entities doesn't work," referring to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are claimed by the Palestinians, in the 1967 Middle East war and has controlled them ever since. The Palestinians want to establish a Palestinian state on these territories. Direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which were sponsored by the United States, had stalled in 2014 following deep disagreements on Israeli settlements and the recognition of establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 border.

GENEVA, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- Syngenta Group, a world-leading agriculture company, has urged rapid action and more innovation to protect the planet's biodiversity and fight climate change. Speaking to Xinhua via a video call, Jeff Rowe, president of Syngenta Seeds, said that farming relies on biodiversity, which is crucial for plant pollination, healthy soils, and water purification. Maintaining agricultural biodiversity is of vital importance to feeding the world, said the official of the Switzerland-based seeds and crop protection firm owned by ChemChina. In the next 30 years, 50 percent more food needs to be produced to feed 2 billion more people on a planet with finite resources, he said. "Crop diversity is really critically important. We're also interested in soil biodiversity, which is a new area for us," he said, adding the company looks forward to working with farmers in China and elsewhere in this regard. He also said another important way to protect biodiversity is to limit and possibly stop deforestation, and "one of the best ways" to do that is to improve the productivity of existing arable land. Rowe's opinion comes as China is hosting a key biodiversity conference, calling for pooling strength to build a community of all life on Earth. During the ongoing 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in China's southwest city of Kunming, world leaders, international organizations and experts have warned of alarming biodiversity loss and the urgent need to come up with ambitious and effective solutions. "Food security, much like biodiversity, is one of the big societal issues that we face across the globe," he said, adding that his company has invested 10 billion RMB (about 1.55 billion U.S. dollars) in new product research and development every year to help China modernize its seed industry and deal with food security. "We bring science to these types of problems," he said, adding that its company pays attention to improving productivity for growers so that people won't go to bed hungry every night. Asked about the company's role in tackling climate change and the upcoming 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, which would be held in Glasgow, Rowe highlighted the need for more research and innovation to develop seeds that can withstand extreme weather events. "Climate change is affecting all of us around the world. Agriculture in general has not been as active or as involved as we should be as an industry on this very important topic. It's something that the Syngenta Group leadership spends a lot of time on." "We want to bring our innovation and our ability to connect with the public and understand policymakers' objectives so that agriculture becomes part of the solution," he noted. Enditem \</doc>

By ZHANG XIAOHUA | China Daily | Updated: 2021-12-10 08:38 LI MIN/CHINA DAILY China can play a leading role in establishing an efficient clean energy supply chain The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) managed to bring global leaders to Glasgow, Scotland, and delivered much-needed outcomes to the world despite the COVID-19 pandemic. It also strengthened global determination to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. More importantly, it declared a war against dirty fossil fuels. Up to now, more than 140 countries with 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have committed to carbon neutrality. The goal of clean energy transition is clearer than ever now. The recent International Energy Agency report on net-zero emissions by 2050 concludes that renewable energies will dominate global energy supply and the share of fossil fuels will decline from 80 percent to less than 20 percent by 2050. Solar and wind energy will need to be scaled up rapidly, reaching annual additions of 630 gigawatts and 390 GW respectively by 2030, four times the record levels set in 2020. Electric vehicles will need to go from around 5 percent of global car sales to more than 60 percent by 2030, 18 times of the 2020 level. Thanks to increased efforts in recent decades, the technologies needed for the clean energy transition are available at affordable prices and the policies seem to be working. However, one question remains unanswered: what is the implication from the supply chain perspective to ensure the acceleration of clean energy transition at such a scale? The development of renewables in China is the most remarkable story that can shed some light on this. In 2020, new installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power generation units in China reached 48 GW, more than 40 percent of the global new installed capacity. China's total installed capacity of solar PV units reached 253 GW, which is one-third of the global total and exceeds that in the European Union and the United States. The picture is similar for wind power. In 2020, the new installed capacity of wind power in China reached a record-breaking 72 GW, bringing total installed capacity to 281 GW, 38 percent of the total global capacity. Why is China so successful with modern new energies? This is often attributed to its massive investments and conducive policy environment. However, the role of the supply chain is often underestimated. Take solar PV as an example. China accounted for 80 percent of the global PV module production in 2020. The world's top five manufactures are all from China. According to the current plan, the production of solar PV in China will reach at least 350 GW by 2025.China also dominates the supply of solar inverters, another key component for grid connection. Six of the top 10 inverter manufactures are from China, accounting for 60 percent of global production. Likewise, seven of the world's top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are Chinese, producing 55 GW capacity in 2020. Other leading manufacturers such as Vestas and Gamesa have also set up production bases in China. Furthermore, China has developed a full supply chain from key components to construction and operation of wind farms. Longyuan Power has been the world's leading wind power operation company since 2015 and is currently running 200 GW of wind power generation. Chinese companies are catching up quickly on EV manufacturing, too. Two of the world's top five EV producers are from China, which seemed impossible in the traditional car manufacturing landscape. More impressively, China is leading the supply of EV batteries. CATL and BYD account for a combined 40 percent of the global EV battery market. China's success stories tell us that supply and demand are two sides of the same coin. The necessary global clean energy transition can happen if backed by a more powerful clean energy supply chain. All countries need to collaborate more closely to create an inductive environment and cultivate the supply capacity instead of putting up barriers. For many developing countries, the role of supply chains should not be confined to just the provision or purchase of final products. These countries need to be part of the supply chains so that the solutions can be customized to country-specific needs. They also need knowledge and experience to build their capacity in developing their own clean energy systems, which are essential for the long-term endeavor toward a low-carbon green development pathway. After President Xi Jinping announced in September that China will no longer fund new coal-fired power plants overseas, China is rapidly expanding its clean energy cooperation with many developing countries. Promoting climate cooperation and low-carbon development has been elevated to be a key component in advancing the Belt and Road Initiative. Clean energy cooperation is also being highlighted on the bilateral level. For example, a China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations clean energy cooperation center was proposed by President Xi at the recent China-ASEAN summit to enhance technology sharing in renewable energies. President Xi also announced at the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Dakar, Senegal, on Nov 29 that China will build centers of excellence in Africa to promote low-carbon development and climate change adaptation. It is encouraging to see the increasing momentum of clean energy cooperation led by China. However, this is not a task solely assigned to China. All governments, NGOs, businesses and academies should work together to cultivate such collaborations particularly for developing countries. Only through joint efforts can we build a green engine powerful enough to boost the global energy transition and achieve the common goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 C.

by Xinhua writer Liu Yanan NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) continues to be seen as an opportunity of development especially for developing countries as global decarbonization efforts and their ramifications come into focus ahead of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. China's recent announcement about stepping up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy and not to build new coal-fired power projects abroad makes the BRI more appealing, experts have said. VIABLE MODEL The BRI remains attractive to the majority of countries in the world as it addresses development needs neglected by other institutions or initiatives, experts said. "The BRI remains the most ambitious developmental initiative inspired by a major economy in the 21st century," said Vasilis Trigkas, postdoctoral fellow with Schwarzman College of Tsinghua University. China's pledge not to build new coal-fired power projects abroad makes the BRI more "clean and green," Trigkas told Xinhua on Thursday. "China offers the most successful model of poverty eradication in human history. It has shown the world that infrastructure-led development works," said John Pang, senior fellow at Bard College, New York. This announcement on coal-fired power projects suggests that the BRI can be grounded in a viable model of public leadership, finance and economic growth, Pang said. Citing data from the World Health Organization, Pang noted, "one third of the world's population is still without safe drinking water in the 21st century," which testifies to the insufficiency of the current development model led by existing financial institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The BRI remains attractive to developing nations because it is the pathway defined by the scientific education of workforces, the transfer of advanced energy-intensive technologies, and the integration into a modern system of high energy use per capita, said Richard A. Black, the Schiller Institute's representative at the United Nations. "The BRI is already a bright white pearl amidst a shore of dull sand," Black told, voicing high expectations for the initiative. China offers an alternative, which reconnects the "underdeveloped" parts of the world with each other for common development, said Pang, who believes that the BRI may help with the return of a multi-polar world marked by true globalization. TACKLING ENERGY POVERTY A more balanced approach has been called for as decarbonization at the cost of development triggers deep concerns and market volatility. China's Global Development Initiative calling for "a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth" and staying committed to development as a priority is the most important and revolutionary proposal at the just-concluded United Nations General Assembly, Black said. Climate change and energy poverty are the two sides of the same coin, which needs to be addressed by the global community, said Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. "We are facing energy poverty in the vast countries of the developing world" and what is happening in Britain and many parts of Europe is what many people around the world live day after day, Barkindo said at an online dialogue on Monday. All sources of energy will be required for the foreseeable future and what is required is the deployment of appropriate technologies supported by appropriate policy measures, he added. It's high time for political leaders in the rich West to speak the truth, admitting that "we can't today have a 100 percent renewable-based energy system because you can't store renewable energy," said Majid Jafar, CEO of Crescent Petroleum, headquartered in the United Arab Emirates. Jafar warned that trying to stop investment in the oil and gas industry would be dangerous and people will end up turning to dirtier and cheaper fuels like coal even in Europe. Underinvestment in the oil and gas industry is the driving factor for today's fuel price spiral in Europe with switch from gas to coal and to a lesser extent Asia seeing switch from gas to oil, said Shirley Zhang, principal analyst with Wood Mackenzie. Suppliers, traders and investors have all become extremely cautious when responding to prices due to the rising pressures from environmental, social and governance push, Zhang told Xinhua. Zhang said that since coal remains the cheapest reliable fuel in most of the Asia-Pacific till the end of the decade, project cancellation or cessation of potential funding would certainly increase energy cost and supply chain risk in key manufacturing bases such as Vietnam. NEXUS OF PRIORITIES Right now, policymakers in countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia deem low-carbon priorities as a cost on top of that already unaffordable figure, according to Pang, a senior fellow at the Rajatatnam School of International Studies under the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. "This impossible-looking situation can only be turned around if green development becomes cheaper and they get richer. They need transformative, market-making steps that lower the cost of green development and price-in the environmental cost of fossil-fuels. At the same time the region must continue to grow," Pang said. "The nexus between these priorities is going to be the Belt and Road's building of connectivity with each other and with their largest trade partner. This is its infrastructure-linked growth multiplier," Pang said. China has dramatically lowered the cost of solar and wind energy, high-speed rail and telecommunications and demonstrated the snowballing effects of infrastructure-led development, said Pang, adding that China can do the same for green development. China's own development miracle in terms of poverty alleviation and application of advanced technologies has motivated other countries to join the BRI, according to Black. It perhaps is a promising path for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to join forces with the IMF, the WB and the Asian Development Bank in prompting green and low-carbon projects in other developing countries, Trigkas said. The combined technical and capital pool of those institutions is extraordinary. If they manage to strategically pool their resources together in this regard, they can really have a significant impact in humanity's "war" against climate change, he added. Enditem \</doc>

World leaders promised to protect Earth's forests, cut methane emissions and help South Africa wean itself off coal at the U.N. climate summit yesterday [Macau time] - part of a flurry of deals intended to avert catastrophic global warming. Britain hailed the commitment by more than 100 countries to end deforestation in the coming decade as the first big achievement of the conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow, known as COP26 - but experts noted such promises have been made and broken before. More than 120 world leaders were heading home after two days in which they received stark warnings about the state of the Earth from Johnson, naturalist David Attenborough, Queen Elizabeth II and - most powerfully - the people of countries and regions already facing climate upheaval. Johnson said at a news conference that it was important to "guard against false hope," but added that he was "cautiously optimistic" about the outcome of the talks. The conference aims to keep the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - the goal set at the Paris climate conference six years ago. Johnson had a message for negotiators from around the globe who will strain over the next 10 days to turn politicians' climate promises into reality: "The eyes of the populations of the world are on you." The U.K. said it has received pledges from leaders representing more than 85% of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with massive forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged toward the plan. Experts and observers said fulfilling the pledge will be critical to limiting climate change, but many noted that such grand promises have been made before - to little effect. "Signing the declaration is the easy part," U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said on Twitter. "It is essential that it is implemented now for people and planet." Alison Hoare, a senior research fellow at political think tank Chatham House, said world leaders promised in 2014 to end deforestation by 2030, "but since then deforestation has accelerated across many countries." Forests are important ecosystems and provide a critical way of absorbing carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere. But the value of wood as a commodity and the growing demand for agricultural and pastoral land are leading to widespread and often illegal felling of forests, particularly in developing countries. Indigenous peoples are often among the hardest hit. "We are delighted to see Indigenous peoples mentioned in the forest deal announced today," said Joseph Itongwa Mukumo, an Indigenous Walikale and activist from Congo. He called for governments and businesses to recognize the effective role Indigenous communities play in preventing deforestation. "These are billions in investment towards environmental preservation, but it's very difficult for this money to reach Indigenous communities, reach traditional communities," said Chief Ninawa, a leader of the Huni Kui people from the Amazon attending the summit. Some campaigners said the forests pledge was a step forward. Luciana Tellez Chavez, an environmental researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there were "quite a lot of really positive elements." She said it was positive to see China and Brazil pledging to protect forests, but noted that Brazil's public statements don't yet line up with its domestic policies and warned that the deal could be used by some countries to "greenwash" their image. Brazil's government has been eager to project itself as a responsible environmental steward in the wake of surging deforestation and fires in the Amazon rainforest and Pantanal wetlands that sparked global outrage in recent years. Critics caution that its promises should be viewed with skepticism, and the country's president, Jair Bolsonaro, is an outspoken proponent of developing the Amazon. On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden launched a plan to reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. The announcement was part of a broader effort with the European Union and other nations to reduce overall methane emissions worldwide by 30% by 2030. Clamping down on methane flaring and leaks from oil wells and gas pipelines - the focus of the Biden plan - is considered one of the easiest ways to cut emissions. Reducing methane from agriculture, in particular by belching cows, is a trickier matter. Helen Mountford, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute, said the agreement "sets a strong floor in terms of the ambition we need globally." Separately, the U.S., Britain, France and Germany announced a plan to provide $8.5 billion in loans and grants over five years to help South Africa phase out coal. South Africa gets about 90% of its electricity from coal-fired plants, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. But campaigners say the world's biggest carbon emitters need to do much more. Earth has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100. Increased warming over coming decades would melt much of the planet's ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, scientists say. "I don't think that activists are being heard here," said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist from the Philippines. "We have to make sure that we really rally together and make sure that we're so loud that the world leaders can't keep ignoring us," she said. "Because every fraction of a degree, every step towards the right direction is what matters here." At his end-of-summit news conference. Biden acknowledged the fierce skepticism from climate activists who say world leaders are not moving with enough haste.

chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-09-02 21:36 An aerial photo of the Bianshan wind farm in Changxing county, East China's Zhejiang province. [Photo/Xinhua] Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry are meeting in Tianjin from Tuesday to Friday in the lead-up to this year's United Nations climate change conference . The talks send an unmistakable message to the outside world that China and the US are aware that they need to cooperate on climate change. This is Kerry's second trip to China this year as climate envoy. In April, Kerry traveled to Shanghai to hold talks with Xie, the trip making him the first high-ranking official of the Joe Biden administration to visit China. As the world's largest developing country, China has long been committed to sustainable development, and it attaches the highest priority to realizing its emissions goals. In September last year, China announced that it would peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Achieving these goals will require much effort and a lot of sacrifice, but China is determined to take concrete actions to attain them. China has also made it clear that it is willing to cooperate with the US and other members of the world community on emissions reduction and related issues, as climate change is an acute existential threat to humanity. Given this, promoting cooperation should be a non-negotiable responsibility for both countries. But the US should not presume that this means China will cooperate in specific areas handpicked by the US while bearing the strategic pressure and injustice incurred from the US policy to contain China. China's stance in this regard is best reflected in State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's remarks to Kerry via video link on Wednesday: The two sides' joint efforts to combat global warming are an "oasis", but surrounding the oasis is a desert, and the oasis may be desertified very soon. Indeed, with the Biden administration emulating its predecessor in pursuing a strategy to contain China, the once flourishing field of interactions is rapidly being transformed into a desert. The US has also tried to set up a new "iron curtain" against China by canvassing support for its containment policy from its allies. Against such a backdrop, how can the Biden administration expect Beijing to cooperate with it to address US concerns if it is not willing to reciprocate by addressing the major concerns of China. China-US climate cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment of China-US relations. The onus is on the US side to create the right conditions and atmosphere for fruitful dialogue and cooperation. It should stop viewing China as a threat and rival, abandon its containment policy against China, and make concrete moves to improve bilateral ties. \</doc>

By Zhang Yue | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-11 10:57 A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] The key to carbon pricing is sending a clear signal to market players, while market players need to play a key role in the actual formulation of carbon prices, experts said. While speaking on Monday via video at a subsession during the ongoing COP 26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, the United Kingdom, Zhu Xian, vice-president and general secretary of the International Finance Forum (IFF), noted that while governments of all countries have been putting great efforts into carbon pricing, actions should also be taken by market players, particularly from the private sector. "Their role in the formulation of carbon pricing is equally important. And this is particularly the case for developing countries, like China," he said. Zhu urged that a proper benchmark for carbon pricing is particularly important, because "without a benchmark, the market cannot really get a signal to do the right things." In developing countries, since the scope of the market is relatively small, he believes it is more important for them to get prepared in infrastructure building, such as information disclosure. He believes developed economies like the European Union have gained rich experience in this respect and can share this with countries like China. "This will save time for China and other emerging market countries to do the right things, and then eventually make the process much smoother," he said. He also believes that as China's current carbon market is still relatively small and still restricted to energy companies, it can be expanded to other sectors -- including important ones such as steel, cement and the shipping industry -- so that the role of carbon pricing can be more widely leveraged. Tom Howes, head of the Energy and Environment Division at the International Energy Agency (IEA), also believes that carbon pricing will be a flexible tool to help deliver a signal for change. "It will be an effective tool for getting markets to change their behavior. And as it is flexible, the market will be able to plan investment horizons well in advance," he said. He urged governments of all countries to take swift action so that market players will get clearer signals. "Governments need to move from the pledges to the road maps, strategies and policies they're going to use. Carbon pricing can easily be a part of their own domestic measures," he said. "All countries will need to introduce measures. All countries can benefit from the introduction of carbon pricing. We need to start taking action in the short term to make sure we do start to implement it and see changes in a very short period of time." \</doc>

BERLIN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- As a developing country with a huge population and loads of socio-economic priorities, China has demonstrated great courage and strong commitment in its climate goals and efforts, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has said. China champions global climate actions in such aspects as technology-based advancement of renewable and clean energy, ensuring access to clean electricity in remote regions, and sparing no effort in afforestation, Espinosa said in a recent interview with Xinhua. "I am very impressed by the efforts of the Chinese government in making the transformational changes towards building a green and low-carbon circular economy. It is apparent that climate actions have become the strategic undertaking in China's transition to a sustainable economic growth," she said. These efforts have helped create policy certainty and reflect the Chinese government's determination in its policy objectives, she added. China has remained committed to reducing the use of coal and has become a new global leader in renewable energy, showing tremendous opportunities in the energy sector, according to Espinosa. "I am confident that with a clear roadmap and action plan, China will be able to achieve its ambitious goals," said Espinosa, adding that China's efforts will in turn contribute greatly to the 1.5-degree-Celsius targets under the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding, multilateral agreement and "we need a just transformation that leaves nobody behind" the complete global economic and social transition to a sustainable path required by the agreement, said Espinosa. "And this can only be achieved through multilateral cooperation," she said, "No single nation can solve this global problem on their own, and my sincere thanks go to China for emphasizing the need for multilateral cooperation." Speaking of the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" that China proposed for the global climate governance, Espinosa said it is also a principle of the UNFCCC and called on all parties of the Paris Agreement to commit to it. Espinosa said that as countries were busy grappling with the pandemic during the past year, much of the urgent work in climate remained outstanding, she said. It is crucial to "get back on track" of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , which was scheduled for November in the British city of Glasgow, she said. "Above all, governments need to agree on the rules to implement the Paris Agreement. This critically important work can only succeed with strengthened cooperation among all nations, and especially among the major powers," Espinosa stressed. "It is a time for leadership, courage and solidarity among global leaders, especially the major powers. It is also a time for ambition, commitment and political will to achieve the milestones that need to be achieved this year," she said. Enditem \</doc>

November 4, 2021 at 4:47 PM Representatives from across the U.S. solar industry on Wednesday aired out their disagreements over whether and how to extend Trump-era safeguard relief measures on solar products set to expire next year. Two U.S. solar panel manufacturers, Auxin Solar Inc. and Suniva, Inc, in August filed a petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission asking to extend tariffs imposed in 2018 on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and cells under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. The tariffs were set at 30 percent in 2018 and scheduled to decline by 5 percentage points each year before expiring in February 2022. Then-President Trump announced last year that he would set the 2021 tariffs at 18 percent instead of 15 percent, as originally planned. The first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells were exempted from tariffs in each of the four years. In response to Auxin Solar and Suniva's petition, the ITC opened an investigation under Section 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 to determine whether continued relief is necessary to "prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition," according to a statement from the ITC. During a public hearing on Wednesday held as part of that investigation, Auxin Solar CEO Mamun Rashid said the intended impact of the remedy had been blunted by a post-remedy exclusion for bifacial modules granted by the Trump administration. The two-sided modules are said by some to be more efficient and better suited for utility-scale projects than monofacial modules. The exclusion was in place for 34 months until the administration reversed its decision, saying the exclusion would undermine the remedy. The Biden administration in March called for the Court of International Trade to dismiss a complaint brought by some U.S. solar industry groups seeking to block the reversal. Rashid said the remedy's impact also was undermined by stockpiling ahead of the imposition of tariffs and by the pandemic. "We thought we would finally benefit from closing the bifacial loophole after all inventories had been drawn down, but COVID hit us squarely between the eyes," he said. Auxin Solar and Suniva are asking for the remedy to be extended for four years without any change to the 2.5-gigawatt tariff-rate quota level on cells -- while others in the industry are arguing for the quota to be raised. Suniva President and Chief Operating Officer Matt Card said U.S. cell manufacturers have seen "little benefit" from the remedy as a result of what he called the "exceptionally high" TRQ, which President Trump set above the level recommended by the majority of ITC commissioners. As a result of the quota, he said, "not a single imported solar cell has ever been subject to the safeguard tariffs." Representatives from LG Electronics USA, Hanwha Q Cells USA and Mission Solar Energy -- companies that produce solar modules in the U.S. -- also support extending the relief but said raising the TRQ on cells was essential to efforts to support growing manufacturing in the U.S. and meeting climate change goals in the absence of U.S. cell production. "Cell factories have not come online in the prior four years, and they won't be available in 2022," Brian Lynch, director of solar sales for LG Electronics USA, told the commissioners. Paul Mutchler, director of commercial operations for Mission Solar, said the 2.5-gigawatt quota likely will be met "this term." Hanwha Q Cells Director of Strategy and Market Intelligence Scott Moskowitz told the commission the quota should be raised to a point "such that it is not hit in the next few years." Representatives from the American Clean Power Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association, among others, meanwhile, voiced opposition to extending the remedy. ACPA represents companies "from across the clean power sector" while SEIA describes itself as a trade association for the U.S. solar industry. Matt Nicely, a partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP who represented those groups in opposing an extension, said it "should not be lost on any of us that the commission is holding this hearing while world leaders meet in Glasgow at the COP26 ," referring to the United Nations Climate Change Conference underway in Scotland. Without "a significant volume of imports," he said, it is "literally impossible to come anywhere close" to meeting the Biden administration's climate goals. "Now is not the time to extend trade restrictions on these products," he added. "Now is the time to eliminate such restrictions and allow solar to flourish unabated." The representatives from both Auxin Solar and Suniva urged the commission to consider the national security implications of relying on the foreign solar industry, which is dominated by China. "The United States does not have to be wholly dependent on China and its proxies to be successful and its goals for solar deployment," Card said. "The respondents offer you a national energy security strategy \'c9 of an America that is perpetually addicted to cheap solar panels driven by a foreign power that is undermining our climate goals by massively increasing their use of coal-fired energy to produce those very solar panels and continues the use of morally reprehensible forced labor." The commissioners also heard from Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), founder of the bipartisan Congressional Solar Caucus, who described the original remedy as a failed experiment. "Constituents of mine are deeply concerned that extending the Section 201 tariffs on non-Chinese produced and imported polysilicon solar products may cause greater harm than the potential benefits," he said. He told the commission that in 2019, before the pandemic, there were 10,000 fewer solar jobs in the U.S. compared to 2016. Most of those losses, he said, were in solar installation and were attributable to the safeguard measure. "We've run the experiment with Section 201 tariffs, and it caused a net job loss," he said. "We can't have that continue." Krishnamoorthi commended the Biden administration for banning solar products made with forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China and said "we must work to counter all unfair trade practices by the Chinese government." He also noted that he supports financial incentives for U.S. solar production under consideration as part of the Build Back Better Act. Nadia Bour ly, minister-counsellor for economic and trade policy at the Canadian Embassy, also testified, telling the commission that if it recommends extending the safeguard it should exclude Canadian imports from the remedy -- as it had in the original investigation. She noted that the Canadian solar industry has invested more than $100 million in solar manufacturing in the U.S. A commercial attach at the Indonesian Embassy, meanwhile, said Indonesia should be excluded from any extension of safeguard duties because of its status as a developing country and because its solar exports to the U.S. remain "negligible." Representatives from Vietnam and Malaysia urged the commissioners not to extend the remedy, saying their exports are critical to expanding solar energy in the U.S. The ITC's investigation should culminate in a report to the president, due on Dec. 8, according to an August statement from Auxin Solar. The president would then decide whether to extend the remedy. -- Margaret Spiegelman ( HYPERLINK mailto:mspiegelman@iwpnews.com mspiegelman@iwpnews.com \</doc>

The world\' s poorest countries have said they may struggle to meet visa requirements and cover all COVID-19 quarantine costs for the COP26 climate summit, raising concerns that some might not be able to attend in person. The UN conference, meant to spur countries to make bigger commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions, is due to start in Glasgow on October 31.  We\' re still concerned about the possibility of getting our delegates to COP26 , to negotiate key issues about the global response to climate change that will have such a profound effect on our people, Bhutan\' s Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries group, told Reuters. Britain said last week that government ministers traveling to COP26 , plus two staff members, would be exempt from quarantine requirements when they arrive. But other delegates from countries on Britain\' s coronavirus  red list, such as Angola, Ethiopia and Haiti, must quarantine in a hotel for up to 10 days before attending the summit. The government has said it will cover the cost of hotel quarantines for delegates from poorer nations. Wangdi said some countries\' delegations were not led by ministers, meaning they would need to visit a visa center to complete their application to attend COP26 . Delegates from 25 of the poorer countries would have to leave their territories to go to visa centers in another state  a challenging process during the pandemic.  Whether or not a minister is attending COP26 should not determine the possibility of technical negotiators and government representatives getting to Glasgow, Wangdi said. Asked about the LDC group\' s concerns, a COP26 spokesperson said:  The participation of ministers from all nations in all parts of the world will be fundamental for achieving global agreement on climate outcomes. Britain has resisted calls to delay the COP26 summit over concerns poorer countries will struggle to attend. \</doc>

By ZHOU WENTING in Shanghai | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-08-23 09:36 Tourists take photographs on a boat crossing Lemaire Channel on Jan 3 last year in Antarctica. PI YANYONG/FOR CHINA DAILY Warming water and receding sea ice in the western Antarctic Peninsula is changing the local plankton community, with potential consequences for climate change, according to research led by Chinese and Western scientists. The study found water temperature and sea-ice cover to be the dominant factors affecting the makeup of microscopic sea life in the region, with declines in species richness and the evenness of their spread leading to less ocean absorption of carbon dioxide, the gas associated with global warming. "This plankton community is like an invisible forest in the ocean that sucks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so changes to it are incredibly important," said Lin Yajuan, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of biogeochemistry at Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, Jiangsu province. "The research suggested that the 'forest' may be doing less of this in the western Antarctic Peninsula." A paper about the research, a joint effort by scientists at Duke University in the United States and Duke Kunshan University initiated in 2012, was published by the scientific journal Nature Communications, which is based in the United Kingdom. Researchers said the study was the longest one ever conducted to gather DNA evidence of the plankton community structure and continuous carbon export in the Antarctic region. Over a five-year period, the research team made trips to the region to collect samples. They collected DNA samples of microbial sea life, including algae and microzooplankton, and they employed a mass spectrometer to monitor carbon sequestration levels. Following each trip, researchers spent months analyzing the samples using high-throughput DNA sequencing technology, which allowed them to measure species numbers, community composition, carbon levels and other features in the microscopic samples. The results for the first time quantitatively linked plankton community structure to carbon export potential along the Antarctic coast, Lin said. They found significant changes in the community of microscopic sea life, as organisms that were better adapted to a warmer environment with less ice survived and others perished. "Such changes may have an impact on climate change, as analysis of the changing community showed a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide it absorbed from the atmosphere," Lin said. "Also, the western Antarctic Peninsula has been the fastest warming ocean globally, so the findings from there are likely to be an indicator of what might happen elsewhere as a result of rising water temperatures." Their findings also suggested that as climate change continues to affect coastal Antarctic regions, there could be substantial declines in plankton biodiversity and biological carbon drawdown, impacting the Southern Ocean's capacity to mitigate carbon emissions into the atmosphere, she said. Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations published a report that detailed the dangers of changes to the world's oceans, ice caps and land in the coming decades. The 15th meeting of the parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity is scheduled to be held in October, followed the next month by this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference . "Our research results added to the data about climate change and biodiversity, and they could help provide us with a clearer picture of what's happening on Earth," Lin said. "However, a longer study will be needed to confirm the pattern." \</doc>

During the Conference of Parties in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, wealthy countries, which are responsible for emitting the bulk of the greenhouse gases that are heating up the planet, pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle the problem. Twelve years later that commitment is yet to be met. The issue has been a simmering point of contention in United Nations climate talks for some years now, and has received renewed attention in the climate talks of the COP 26 climate summit, now on in Glasgow, Scotland. "The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should guide all collaboration on environmental and climate matters," said Jorge Chediek, the UN secretary-general's former envoy on South-South cooperation. "The leadership of China, as the largest developing country and as a member of the G77+China, is essential for this dialogue to succeed, and also to get the developed countries to finally contribute their fair share." The failure of developed countries to fulfill their financial commitment sparked anger from developing countries as the COP 26 began in Glasgow a week ago. Leaders of developing countries argued that rich countries, which built their economies through industrialization, are to blame for global warming. "Africa is suffering the worst consequences from this phenomenon, economically, socially and politically," Bloomberg quoted Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi as saying. Other countries, including Gabon, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Libya and the Maldives, made similar appeals last week. Some said the failure to honor promises eroded trust between developed and developing countries. The Alliance of Small Island States said in a statement that "the impact this has had on trust cannot be underestimated". 'Not enough' "Developed countries are not doing enough to support developing nations in their transition to clean energy or their struggles to adapt to climate change," said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program in the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. "The extreme weather exacerbated by climate change is increasingly the result of historic and present fossil fuel emissions, which has been overwhelmingly caused by just a few industrialized countries. It's unjust that developing nations now have to bear the brunt of the resulting flooding, droughts, sea level rise and more intense storms, among other climate impacts, when they have the fewest resources to protect themselves and their residents." HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202111/08/61886f0ea31019b094bdaad9.png Link to Image Developing countries need money for things such as building sea walls and moving residents to safe areas in extreme weather, as well as technologies to deal with droughts, he said. Other possible investment included "a modernized, clean electricity grid" that would help them reduce carbon emissions. The biggest challenge for developed countries in meeting these financial commitments is "really political", Elkind said. "The key is to find a sweet spot where foreign aid can also bolster each countries' ties to each other, in ways to further promote their national security or economic development through trade." Lacking resources Developing countries, especially the least developed and small-island states, are among the most vulnerable to natural disasters. Due to the coastal location of small-island states, they are more prone to natural disasters. Eighty percent of the 1,200 islands that constitute the Maldives are less than 1 meter above sea level and face the threat of disappearing under the rising sea. Such countries lack the financial resources to defend themselves against extreme weather events, which usually cost billions of dollars. It was in this context that countries developed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which included the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities". It acknowledges the different capabilities and responsibilities of countries in tackling climate change. It was also in line with this principle that developed countries committed to a collective goal of spending $100 billion a year by 2020 to help their less developed counterparts mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Climate finance provided by developed countries rose to $79.6 billion in 2019, 2 percent more than in 2018, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, the kind of figures that have disheartened many environmental experts. 'Limited progress' "The limited progress in overall climate finance volumes between 2018 and 2019 is disappointing, particularly ahead of COP 26 ," the OECD Secretary-General, Mathias Cormann, said on Sept 17. "While appropriately verified data for 2020 will not be available until early next year, it is clear that climate finance will remain well short of its target. More needs to be done." In fact, even $100 billion is far from enough for developing countries to transform their energy systems and achieve net-zero emissions. The UN Environment Programme estimates that developing countries would need between $140 billion and $300 billion by 2030 to cope with climate change. During the UN General Debate in September, US President Joe Biden pledged to work with Congress to double the climate finance from Obama-era levels to $5.7 billion. However, observers said the new commitment does not reflect a fair share of the US' gross national income and cumulative finance. It should provide between $43 billion and $50 billion each year in climate finance, according to analysis by the Overseas Development Institute, a think tank in London. Furthermore, many developed countries have chosen to provide finance in the form of loans rather than grants. With interest to be paid, this adds to the financial strains on developing countries, already reeling from financial losses because of climate change. Countries also tend to provide finance for mitigation measures, which help developing countries mitigate the impact of climate, instead of adaptation measures, which help countries switch to green economies, thus adapting to the effects of extreme weather. Adaptation projects are usually costly and do not generate a tangible financial return. About 70 percent of funding between 2013 and 2018 supported mitigation efforts, and only 21 percent was used for adaptation, which is the most pressing need for developing countries, the Council on Foreign Relations in New York said.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke highly of Chinese President Xi Jinping's proposals of upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions and accelerating the green transition to address global climate change. Guterres made positive comments Monday on Xi's written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change when he held talks with Xie Zhenhua, special representative of Xi and China's special envoy for climate change, and Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP26 and vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Guterres said he hopes the Chinese delegation would, as always, give full play to its influence at COP26 , strengthen communication and coordination with all parties, and contribute to the success of COP26 . The two sides also exchanged views in depth on issues that include strengthening pragmatic cooperation among all parties, promoting the green transition, enhancing political mutual trust between the South and North, fulfilling the pledges of financial and technical support to developing countries, and working together to cope with climate change. \</doc>

By KARL WILSON in Sydney | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-11-23 07:01 FILE PHOTO: Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks as National Statements are delivered as a part of the World Leaders' Summit at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain November 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] In carbon-intensive Australia, it didn't take long for a government plan aimed at boosting the uptake of electric vehicles to run into its first pothole. Less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Nov 9 the much-anticipated policy on electric vehicles, news emerged that the company behind a proposed electric vehicle plant in the state of Victoria had scrapped its plans. SEA Electric told the Victorian government on Nov 10 that it was ending its agreement to build the factory in the Latrobe Valley. No reason was given for the decision. The reversal on the factory has fed into doubts on Canberra's ability to reduce carbon emissions in an economy reliant on fossil fuels. Morrison has also had to contend with widespread skepticism over a pledge\u-243 announced in the lead-up to the COP 26 climate summit\u-243 that the country will reach carbon neutrality by 2050. As Morrison unveiled the government's new strategy, he said it was "built on the back of the core principles technology, not taxes; choices, not mandates". Under the strategy, the government will spend A$250 million ($182 million) to build charging stations around the country for heavy commercial vehicles, passenger cars and households. Light on details But analysts said the government's strategy was light on details, such as how it defines zero-emission vehicles. Behyad Jafari, chief executive of Australia's Electric Vehicle Council, said the nation's new strategy ignored the most important measures to improve EV uptake, including subsidies, tax incentives and sales targets. "The strategy has identified some of the correct benefits and pathways, but it does little to realize them," Jafari said. Australia's car manufacturing industry closed in 2017, ending 70 years of domestic vehicle assembly as General Motors-Holden, a subsidiary of General Motors of the US, Ford and Toyota ceased large-scale production of conventional vehicles in the country, citing cost as a major factor. The SEA Electric deal in Victoria was seen as an attempt to give new life to the sector and give Australia a foothold in the market. News of the project's demise comes amid a renewed focus on electric vehicles after the climate summit in Glasgow this month. The Victorian government has not said how much money had been paid to the company or whether any had been repaid, saying the matter was "commercial" and in "confidence". In contrast to the approach announced by Morrison, governments in many countries are offering massive subsidies and tax incentives to make electric vehicles more affordable. In 2019, during the last federal election, the opposition Labor Party took a policy on electric vehicles to the people. But Morrison tore the policy apart, claiming it was a war on the family weekend. "They (EVs) cannot pull trailers, caravans or boats," he was famously quoted as saying during the election campaign. But in his defense, Morrison now says he was not against those vehicles but "simply opposed to government telling people what to do". \</doc>

People walk past an Eden Project display inside the COP26 venue in Glasgow, the UK on Monday, on the first day of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference being held in the city. Photo: AFP With the UK hosts warning that "lights are flashing red on the climate change dashboard," the COP26 UN climate summit kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, marked by pointed warnings of growing threats as emissions-cutting pledges still fail to add up. "I do not underestimate the challenge" of reaching an effective deal to adequately slash emissions, Alok Sharma, Britain's COP26 president, told delegates at the talks' opening. But he added, "I believe that we can resolve the outstanding issues." COP26 , and a fallen tree blocked train lines from London, forcing some red-faced delegates into last-minute flights or rental cars. Others struggled to master the phone apps governing a daily coronavirus testing regime for attendees, some of whom showed up to the venue of one of the first major international gatherings since the start of the pandemic with negative tests in hand. "This is not a normal COP," Sharma admitted. But the biggest hurdle facing COP26 may be the outcome of the G20 meeting of major economies in Rome this weekend, where leaders backed a 1.5 C limit on global temperature rise but offered few new concrete commitments to achieve it. As world leaders arrive at the talks in Glasgow on Monday, more ambitious emissions-cutting pledges will be crucial for the COP26 hosts to meet their overarching goal to "keep 1.5 alive." "If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26 , then world leaders fluffed their lines," Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement, describing the G20 outcome as "weak." Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think-tank E3G, noted that "much hard work - especially on issues of climate finance - remains ahead, if COP26 is to reach agreement" on keeping the 1.5 C goal in sight. 'Out of excuses' At the Glasgow conference's opening session, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa admitted that the task of swiftly shifting the world's economy onto a greener trajectory, to avoid increasingly deadly climate impacts, was enormously difficult. "The transition we need is beyond the scope, scale and speed of anything humanity has accomplished in the past. It is a daunting task. But humanity is a species defined by its ingenuity," she said. She encouraged negotiators to "keep the big picture in mind" as they haggled over details on things like finance and carbon markets, reminding them to think of "what we are trying to achieve together... and the trust invested in you by billions." Abdulla Shahid, president of the UN General Assembly, urged negotiators to "be honest with each other and with the rest of the world" about past failures to act fast enough on climate threats and to "choose the hard but necessary actions." "We have run out of excuses. It is time to do the right thing," said Shahid, also foreign minister of the Maldives, a nation of low-lying Indian Ocean islands. Mayor Frank Cownie of the US city of Des Moines said changes were not just being seen in the poorer countries considered most vulnerable to climate change threats. His Midwestern city, in the US state of Iowa, has seen much more extreme weather in recent years, including 10 inches (250 millimeters) of rain falling in just three hours and hurricane-like 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour winds. "This is a global catastrophe that we all need to jump on, [with] all hands on deck," said Cownie, president of ICLEI, an association of sustainable local governments. Cities set the pace But cities and other local governments are often leading the way in low-carbon changes, and offer examples national governments can scale up, Ryuzo Sugimoto of Japan's Ministry of Environment, told a press conference with city officials. He noted that 160 local government bodies in Japan, governing 17 million people, had made carbon-neutral commitments before Japan's national government followed suit in 2020. Now, with the need to speed up large-scale emissions cuts by 2030 - on the way to net-zero by 2050 - the world requires a "decarburization domino effect," with local governments often good testing grounds for what is possible, Sugimoto said. Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow's city council, said such changes also had to happen in a fair way, focused on "taking our citizens with us." The decline of Glasgow's industrial might, starting 30 or 40 years ago, left the city with enduring mental and physical scars, she said, including a legacy of unemployment. Now a rapid switch to a greener economy, based on clean power, needs to be far more just and inclusive, as governments invest "unprecedented sums" to tackle climate change, she said. "Climate justice and social justice are indivisible." Reuters \</doc>

Editor's Note: Scheduled to close on Friday, the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties( COP26 )in Glasgow, Scotland has entered its most intense time in its final hours. As the first conference after the Paris Agreement entered the implementation phase, what outcomes the conference could achieve might be crucial to the future of mankind. On Wednesday, China and the US released a joint declaration on tackling climate change during the ongoing COP26 in Glasgow, including setting up a working group and reducing methane and CO2 emissions, marking a significant move on global climate actions and sending strong positive signals for the success of the COP26 . China has made great contributions to global climate governance through its green development, participation in international negotiations, and multilateral cooperation. During the COP26 , the Global Times (GT) reporters Shan Jie, Chen Qingqing and Zhao Yusha talked with Xu Huaqing (Xu), a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation to understand China's position and expectations to the achievements of COP26 . GT: What is China's main proposal and position at this conference? Xu: At COP26 , based on the principles including common but differentiated responsibilities, developed countries should fulfil their promises as soon as possible, discuss the solutions of global energy transition and security jointly and make greater contributions to the global climate governance system. The first is to promote the fulfilment of finance commitments. Developed countries fulfilling the promise could be a key to COP26 success, which will help build confidence in the climate process. Though during COP26 , US President Joe Biden said he would "double funds by 2024 to $11.4 billion per year to help developing nations deal with climate change," to achieve success of COP26 in finance issues, other developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and the UK must promise to add an extra annual finance of $2-4 billion. It also called for the trust and support of African countries, the least-developed countries, and Alliance of Small Island States. The second is to explore ways of energy transition. China has vowed to strictly control the coal-energy projects and to support low-carbon development in developing countries, providing its solution to the international society. Although President Biden emphasized at the COP26 that the US will invest in clean energy in the recovery of the economy, he did not announce substantive measures. Similarly, the technical assistance initiative proposed by the COP26 chair country's Energy Transition Council neither listed financial and technical support required for the transition. Xu Huaqing, a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation GT: China's commitment and practice in cutting emissions is gaining global attention. US President Joe Biden has chided China for not "showing up" on the climate issue. Do you feel the pressure of some Western criticism and what is your response? Xu: Climate change is a severe challenge faced by the whole humanity. Since the industrial revolution, human activities, especially from developed countries have skyrocketed the amount of greenhouse emission and hastened global warming. Thus those countries were asked to lead the task of cutting emission by accords such as the Paris Agreement, and provide developing countries with finance and technology to help them deal with the task. Hence, US and other Western countries' criticism against China's actions and policies on climate change and China's achievement in this field, is arrogant, prejudicial and impractical.\~ China has unwaveringly stuck to a green, low carbon and sustainable development path, and contributed China's wisdom and plan of tackling global warming to the world. The country's roadmap of hitting peak emissions before 2030 and for carbon neutrality by 2060 is way shorter than that of the developed world. The word "before" in those two goals reflected China's scientific respect toward future uncertainties, and the courage and responsibility of China as a responsible developing country.\~ Plus, China also actively participated in the global governance of global warming. It played an active role in pushing forward the Paris Agreement, and looking forward to conduct dialogues with US and European countries. It also joined the South-South cooperation in helping developing countries improve their capacity of dealing with climate change. In a nutshell, China is an important participant, contributor, and leader of global ecological rebuilding and international cooperation on climate change.\~ China is a developing country with 1.4 billion people. We also have the responsibility of improving people's lives. Currently, China's emissions per capita are only half those of the US, and cumulative historical carbon emissions per capita account for only one eighths of those by the US. Meanwhile, China, as a world factory, also bears large amounts of carbon emissions for other countries as it supplies commodities to other countries.\~ The COP26 GT: Climate negotiations are always difficult, and it involves competition of interests. Western media and observers claim that there are not too many new goals or much new content in China's latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs). What are your thoughts on that? Xu: China recently submitted its updated nationally determined contributions with a number of specific targets such as peak emission, percentage of non-fossil fuel energy in energy consumption and installed capacity of renewable energy. Compared to the NDC submitted in 2015, the new targets on peak emission, decline in carbon emission intensity, and an increase of proportion of non-fossil fuel energy are much more ambitious in the latest NDC, with new added goals of total installed capacity of wind power and solar power to reach 1.2 billion kilowatts and above. The updated NDC is not only China's great contribution to global governance but also higher requirements for the country's work on combating climate change.\~ To achieve these new goals, the updated NDC also clearly stated 13 new measures in reducing emissions such as promoting a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development, advancing the green and low-carbon transformation in the industrial sector and building market-oriented mechanisms like carbon trading.\~ We should also understand that China is facing huge challenges in reaching those NDC targets as a developing country with a population of 1.4 billion. Its also a country rich in coal but poor in oil and gas, which is now in a crucial period of transforming its development mode. And it will take more time to realize the energy restructuring as it is difficult to fundamentally change the coal-based energy structure in the short term. GT: Ahead of COP26 , G20 leaders agreed on a 1.5C global warming target. How do you see this target? What does it mean for China?\~ Xu: Like Xie Zhenhua, China Special Envoy for Climate Change, told media recently that China has never been opposed to the 1.5C target, which was also included in the Paris Agreement - a milestone in multilateral climate change cooperation.\~ While it should understand that the long term goals set by the Paris Agreement require developed countries to set the example in reducing emissions, which is also the key to achieving a global zero emission target as soon as possible. Also, countries need to take strong concrete actions rather than making empty slogans. China's target to achieve carbon peaks by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 in order to achieve the targets set by the Paris Agreement means that as the world's largest developing country, China will achieve the largest decline in carbon emission intensity in the shortest time in history.\~ A polar bear Photo: AFP GT: The issue of funding for developing countries is also a much-debated issue. If we cannot meet the funding demands of developing countries, what impact will it have on COP26 ? What contribution has China made in South-South climate cooperation? Xu: Climate funding lays an important foundation for maintaining mutual political trust in the multilateral climate process and achieving the goals of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. It is also a core concern of developing countries. At present, developed countries have still not fulfilled the political commitment of providing $100 billion in climate funding to developing countries each year made by the Copenhagen Climate Conference, and the public funds provided by themselves account for a relatively low proportion, which is difficult to meet the funding demand of developing countries in dealing with climate change. Developed countries should fill the $100 billion annual climate funding gap before 2020 as soon as possible, create a positive and constructive atmosphere for the success of COP26 , and make concrete efforts to maintain mutual political trust among all parties and the seriousness of the multilateral climate process. This $100 billion should also be a starting point for developed countries to further sustainably increase the funding of climate actions to meet the demand of developing countries' efforts and improve the traceability as well as the transparency of climate funds. \</doc>

By Ma Aimin | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-11-16 07:52 A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which concluded Saturday after a one-day extension. Meanwhile, developed countries, whose industrialization is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, were urged to meet their funding pledge. In the new climate deal hammered out by COP 26 , there are commitments to significantly increasing financial support through the Adaptation Fund, with developed countries urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. Climate change is a serious challenge facing the world, along with other challenges such as sustaining economic development, alleviating poverty, providing good healthcare for all, better protecting the environment and ecology, and safeguarding national security. And since no country is immune to climate change, building a community with a shared future has become even more important. There is also a need to make the world order fairer, equitable and mutually beneficial in order to meet the climate challenge, as a winner-takes-all mechanism like the one for US presidential election would be neither sustainable nor effective. For years the climate talks have focused on emission-reduction targets, for example, by how much countries should reduce their emissions and by when. Indeed, the UNFCCC says that parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities", and that developed countries should "take the lead" in doing so. However, some countries and groups have been trying to water down, even scrap the "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" principle\u-243 and thus destroy a key basis for cooperation in the global fight against climate change. Worse some countries are wrongly accusing the developing countries of dragging the world down in the global climate fight, especially the emissions reduction efforts, and asking them to contribute more to the global climate fight by peaking their carbon emissions and realizing carbon neutrality much earlier than possible. This is against the Paris Agreement, and without the correct understanding of the agreement, comprehensive cooperation in the next phase could face problems. Some developed countries demand that for the world to realize global carbon neutrality by 2050, the developing nations should also achieve carbon neutrality by that time, ignoring the Paris Agreement clause that asks the rich countries to take the lead in this field. What the rich countries need to do instead is to create more room for the growth of developing countries, by providing the latter with adequate funds, new technologies, and taking effective and practical measures to realize carbon neutrality. Since countries are exploring policies, regulations, technologies, management and other options to better combat climate change, they should share their knowledge and experiences with each other to boost the joint fight against climate change. The world knows that the volume of carbon emissions developing countries can reduce depends on the funds and technologies at their disposal. And that's precisely why the new climate agreement requires rich countries to provide funds and technologies for the developing, especially the least-developed, countries. The developed countries should provide funds, transfer technologies and support the developing countries to fight climate change. In the past decade, the rich countries have not only failed to fulfill their promise of helping the developing countries but also have been pressuring them to contribute more to the global fight against climate change. In stark contrast, China has established the South-South Cooperation Fund on Climate Change to provide material and technological support to other developing countries while accelerating its own low-carbon, green economic transformation, which highlights its sense of responsibility as a major country. Countries need to deepen cooperation and collaboration to better fight climate change. Some economies should stop taking unilateral measures in the name of environmental protection. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism that the European Union has proposed could trigger a chain reaction once introduced, and have negative impacts on the global climate management system, even the trade system. Such unilateral measures violate the "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" principle and constitute discrimination in international trade. But even as the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to increase and the effects of climate change become more real and harmful, some developed countries have been trying to give the "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" principle a quiet burial, and asking poor countries to shoulder more responsibilities while being silent on the rich world's failure to provide funds and technological support to the developing countries. Unfortunately, this situation is not likely to change anytime soon. As for China, it should continue making efforts to meet its UNFCCC and climate agreement goals, and strengthen exchanges with all parties to help build a just, reasonable and mutually beneficial global climate management system. The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily. The author is deputy director of National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. \</doc>

Almost 200 nations accepted a compromise deal yesterday [Macau time] aimed at keeping a key global warming target alive, but it contained a last-minute change that watered down crucial language about coal. Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change promoted by India to "phase down," rather than "phase out" coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. "Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe." Nation after nation had complained after two weeks of U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, about how the deal did not go far or fast enough. But they said it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress, if not success. In the end, the summit broke ground by singling out coal, however weakly, by setting the rules for international trading of carbon credits, and by telling big polluters to come back next year with improved pledges for cutting emissions. But domestic priorities both political and economic again kept nations from committing to the fast, big cuts that scientists say are needed to keep warming below dangerous levels which would produce extreme weather and rising seas capable of erasing some island nations. Ahead of the Glasgow talks, the United Nations had set three criteria for success, and none of them were achieved. The U.N.'s criteria included pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030, $100 billion in financial aid from rich nations to poor, and ensuring that half of that money went to helping the developing world adapt to the worst effects of climate change. "We did not achieve these goals at this conference," Guterres said. "But we have some building blocks for progress." Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the change will make it harder to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times - the more stringent threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said governments had no choice but to accept India's coal language change: "If we hadn't done that we wouldn't have had an agreement." But he insisted the deal was good news for the world. "We are in fact closer than we have ever been before to avoiding climate chaos and securing cleaning air, safer water and healthier planet," he said later at a news conference. Many other nations and climate campaigners criticized India for making demands that weakened the final agreement. "India's last-minute change to the language to phase down but not phase out coal is quite shocking," said Australian climate scientist Bill Hare, who tracks world emission pledges for the science-based Climate Action Tracker. "India has long been a blocker on climate action, but I have never seen it done so publicly." Others approached the deal from a more positive perspective. In addition to the revised coal language, the Glasgow Climate Pact included enough financial incentives to almost satisfy poorer nations and solved a long-standing problem to pave the way for carbon trading. The agreement also says big carbon polluting nations have to come back and submit stronger emission cutting pledges by the end of 2022. Negotiators said the deal preserved, albeit barely, the overarching goal of limiting Earth's warming by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial times. Governments used the word "progress" more than 20 times Saturday, but rarely used the word "success" and then mostly in that they've reached a conclusion, not about the details in the agreement. Conference President Alok Sharma said the deal drives "progress on coal, cars, cash and trees'' and is "something meaningful for our people and our planet.'' Environmental activists were measured in their not-quite-glowing assessments, issued before India's last minute change. "It's meek, it's weak and the 1.5 C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters," said Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan, a veteran of the U.N. climate talks known as the Conferences of Parties. Former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking for a group of retired leaders called The Elders, said the pact represents : the pact represents "some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster [...]People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty." Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav argued against a provision on phasing out coal, saying that developing countries were "entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels." Yadav blamed "unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns" in rich countries for causing global warming. After Yadav first raised the specter of changing the coal language, a frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the 27-nation EU's climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations. Kerry and several other negotiators said that good compromises leave everyone slightly unsatisfied and that countries had more work ahead of them over the coming years. "Paris built the arena and Glasgow starts the race," the veteran U.S. diplomat said. "And tonight the starting gun was fired." Chinese negotiator Zhao Yingmin echoed that sentiment. "I think our biggest success is to finalize the rulebook," Zhao told the Associated Press. "Now we can start implementing it and delivering it on our achieved consensus." As negotiators left the final session after congratulating themselves, they passed a young lone protester who sat silently with red blood-like writing on crossed arms that said: "We are watching."

JAKARTA, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Joko Widodo left here on Friday for his visit to Italy, Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Widodo will attend the G20 summit in Italy's capital Rome on Oct. 30-31, before taking part in the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Britain, on Nov. 1-2. "At the two summits, I will also hold bilateral meetings with several countries," Widodo told a virtual press conference on Friday. The G20 summit will end with the handover of the presidency from Italy to Indonesia which will officially take place on Dec. 1, 2021. The COP26 meeting to be chaired by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be attended by around 120 heads of state and government. The issue of climate change is important for Indonesia, home to the world's largest tropical and mangrove forests. The Indonesian president will also visit the UAE on Nov. 3-4. Enditem \</doc>

By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-12-03 11:00 A smoke billowing from a chimney is pictured, as the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) takes place, in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, in this Nov 6, 2021 file photo. [Photo/Agencies] The United Kingdom has some of the most ambitious emissions reduction goals in the world but lacks a plan to fully implement them, the UK Climate Change Committee has said in a new report, which called for the strengthened delivery of Britain's net-zero strategy. In a report assessing the outcomes of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, the committee, also called the CCC, recommended that the UK focuses on taking concrete actions toward deliverable and achievable goals, instead of setting ever-tougher targets. In its report titled COP26 : Key outcomes and next steps for the UK, the CCC noted that the UK's nationally determined contribution, or NDC, is "one of the most ambitious 2030 targets for reducing emissions in the world". "What the UK doesn't have is all the steps in place to deliver it," Chris Stark, who is chief executive of the CCC, said on Twitter. Stark said that the UK's plans for agricultural and land decarbonization in particular are lacking. He then noted that the UK Net Zero Strategy, which the government published in October, did not emphasize consumer and behavior change, with little content on diet change and limiting aviation. He also said that the government has not yet agreed with the CCC recommendation of net-zero tests for new buildings, which Stark fears will leave the door open for emissions-intensive development. Stark also suggested that the UK Treasury department might review the role of the tax system in the net-zero strategy. He said that low pricing for fossil fuels is "effectively a subsidy", and that the Treasury should consider "how higher and more consistent carbon prices" can be achieved across the economy. "Some have called for a tougher UK 2030 NDC," Stark added. "UK efforts should focus on strengthening delivery of the net-zero strategy, rather than inflating the gap between ambition and implementation. Steps to complete the strategy need to be brought forward, filling in the gaps." This sentiment aligns with that expressed by Chinese delegates at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, who repeatedly called for "sustained action, not empty slogans" from participating nations, and pointed out that ambitions count for little if they are not implemented successfully. Following a September 2020 commitment to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2060, China released five key documents just before the COP26 conference detailing how it will achieve its goals. "Instead of pushing China for more ambitious targets, I think it's probably more effective to try to support China in terms of translating such goals into credible actions," Zhu Xian, vice-president and secretary-general of the Beijing-based International Finance Forum, told China Daily in a previous interview. "China recently announced action plans industry by industry-that probably is more important than trying to place on China a more ambitious agenda." Stark also said that the UK must play a key role in coordinating climate finance for the developing world, which was a major source of tension in Glasgow after rich countries failed to make good on a promise to raise $100 billion in annual climate finance by 2020. \</doc>

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-06-22 09:37 Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change poses, in Bonn, Germany, February 15, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] With less than five months to go until the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, the United Nations' head of climate change has warned that heads of government remain "far away" from securing a deal to limit the full consequences of global warming. In an interview with British newspaper the Observer, Patricia Espinosa said previous promises to make one hundred billion dollars available each year to developing countries, for investment in green technology, had not been kept. "I'd have really hoped for a clearer signal on how and when we will be able to see the commitment to mobilize the $100 billion fulfilled," she said, when asked about the prospects for a breakthrough before the conference starts on Nov 1. "There isn't much time. We are already in the second half of June," she continued. "This is one condition to be able to have a good basis to have a successful COP26 . It is essential. We cannot afford a lack of success. COP26 should be able to give some sense of hope to the world." At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 196 countries signed an agreement pledging to reduce fossil fuel emissions, in an effort to limit temperature rises preferably to 1.5 percent, compared to preindustrial levels. The gathering in Glasgow will be the first chance to assess what difference this has made, but after three weeks of discussion at the UN Climate Change intersessional meetings earlier this month, there was clear disappointment and frustration about what assistance has been made available to developing countries. "The issue of climate finance still remains the most difficult part of all these negotiations," Molwyn Joseph, environment minister for Antigua, told the Financial Times. "I do not believe that particular aspect was dealt with as it should have been." The United Kingdom currently holds the presidency of the G7 and former UN climate envoy Rachel Kyte told the Observer that the country needed to show leadership and pull countries together before COP26 , to ensure a positive outcome. COP26 . (Prime Minister Boris) Johnson has to muster the world to significant climate finance commitments, purposing development finance and detail behind the global Marshall plan that (United States) President (Joe) Biden calls Build Back Better World. Then, and only then, can we get the agreement we need in Glasgow," she said. COP26 was supposed to have happened last year but was postponed because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The current intention is for it to be a physical meeting, but there are contingency plans in place. \</doc>

CHINESE President Xi Jinping on Monday called on all parties to take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge. Xi made the remarks in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland in the U.K., from Monday to yesterday.  I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all, he said. The adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action, he said. Xi made a three-pronged proposal to address climate challenge, including upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions, and accelerating the green transition.  When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription, he said. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. In terms of green transition, Xi said it is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern. Guided by the vision of a community of life for man and nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development, he said.  We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects, he said. He added that China will speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. World leaders Monday also called for concrete actions to tackle the challenges of climate change at the COP26 . British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country hosts the two-week climate gathering, said,  While COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can and it must mark the beginning of the end. Admitting that developed nations\' support for developing countries is  still falling short, U.S. President Joe Biden said,  there\' s no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves.  This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes; the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases, he said. Seychellois President Wavel Ramkalawan said he is  scared of the impact climate change will have on his country as  the beautiful archipelago of 115 islands may be reduced to less than 50 islands as the coral islands disappear. COP26 is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015. (Xinhua) \</doc>

GENEVA, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) issued ten recommendations on Monday on how governments can maximize the health benefits of tackling climate change in a variety of sectors, thereby avoiding the worst health impact of the climate crisis. Ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, WHO released its COP26 special report, "The Health Argument for Climate Action." The ten WHO recommendations highlight the urgent need, and numerous opportunities for governments to prioritize health and equity in the international climate regime and sustainable development agenda. Above all, the WHO urges governments to commit to a healthy, green recovery from COVID-19. "The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment. The same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people," said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests," he added. The report comes as unprecedented extreme weather events and other climate impacts are taking a rising toll on people's lives and health. Increasingly frequent heatwaves, storms and floods, have killed thousands and disrupted millions of lives. Changes in weather and climate are also threatening food security, driving up disease, and negatively affecting mental health. "Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity," the report says. "While no one is safe from the health impacts of climate change, they are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged." As well as recovery from COVID-19, the report also puts health and social justice at the heart of the UN climate talks. It calls for a fair and inclusive transition to renewable energy, particularly from coal combustion, and promotes sustainable, healthy urban design and transport systems, as well as more affordable, nutritious diets. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said COP26 is a crucial opportunity to fulfill the promise of the Paris Agreement. That means reducing emissions to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; providing 100 billion U.S. dollars each year to the developing world for climate action, and financial support for mitigation and adaptation, the UN chief said at a ministerial meeting in Milan, Italy, via a video link last month.

The world's top carbon polluters, China and the United States, agreed yesterday [Macau time] to increase their cooperation and speed up action to rein in climate-damaging emissions, signaling a mutual effort on global warming at a time of tension over their other disputes. In back-to-back news conferences at U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and U.S. counterpart John Kerry said the two countries would work together to accelerate the emissions reductions required to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. "It's beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole that two major powers in the world, China and the U.S., shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations," Xie told reporters. "We need to think big and be responsible." "The steps we're taking ... can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going, and help China and us to be able to accelerate our efforts," Kerry said. China also agreed for the first time to crack down on methane leaks, following the lead of the Biden administration's efforts to curb the potent greenhouse gas. Beijing and Washington agreed to share technology to reduce emissions. Governments agreed in Paris to jointly cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep the global temperature rise "well below" 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, with a more stringent target of trying to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius preferred. Both sides recognize that there is a gap between efforts taken globally to reduce climate pollution and the goals of the Paris deal, Xie said. "So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations," he said. A U.S.-China bilateral agreement in 2014 gave a huge push to the creation of the historic Paris accord the following year, but that cooperation stopped with the Trump administration, which pulled the U.S. out of the pact. The Biden administration brought the U.S. back in to that deal, but has clashed with China on other issues such as cybersecurity, human rights and Chinese territorial claims. "While this is not a gamechanger in the way the 2014 US-China climate deal was, in many ways it's just as much of a step forward given the geopolitical state of the relationship," said Thom Woodroofe, an expert in U.S.-China climate talks. "It means the intense level of US-China dialogue on climate can now begin to translate into cooperation." The gesture of goodwill comes just days after President Joe Biden blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping's and Russian President Vladimir Putin's failure to attend talks in person for the lack of more progress in climate negotiations. The U.S. and China will also revive a working group that will "meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade," the declaration said. Both Washington and Beijing intend to update the world on their new national targets for 2035 in 2025 - a move that is particularly significant for China. The declaration also said China will "make best efforts to accelerate" its plans to reduce coal consumption in the second half of this decade. The announcement came as governments from around the world were negotiating in Glasgow about how to build on the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of global warming. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the move "an important step in the right direction." Some experts noted the deal was short on commitments that would significantly reduce heat-trapping gases. "It's a good sign that the world's two biggest emitters can actually work together to face the biggest crisis of humanity but there's not a lot of meat there after the methane stuff,'' said Byford Tsang a China policy analyst for the European think tank E3G. Earlier, a draft of a larger deal being negotiated by almost 200 countries in Glasgow called for accelerating the phasing out of coal - the single biggest source of man-made emissions - although it set no timeline. Setting deadlines for phasing out fossil fuels is highly sensitive to countries that still depend on them for economic growth, including China and India, and to major exporters of coal such as Australia. The future of coal is also a hot-button issue in the U.S., where a spat among Democrats has held up one of President Joe Biden's signature climate bills. Greenpeace International director Jennifer Morgan, a long-time climate talks observer, said that the call in the draft to phase out coal would be a first in a U.N. climate deal, but the lack of a timeline would limit the pledge's effectiveness. "This isn't the plan to solve the climate emergency. This won't give the kids on the streets the confidence that they'll need," Morgan said. The draft also expresses "alarm and concern" about how much Earth has already warmed and urges countries to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about half by 2030. Pledges so far from governments don't add up to that frequently stated goal. The draft is likely to change, but it doesn't yet include full agreements on the three major goals that the U.N. set going into the negotiations: for rich nations to give poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate aid, to ensure that half of that money goes to adapting to worsening global warming, and the pledge to slash global carbon emissions by 2030. It acknowledges "with regret" that rich nations have failed to live up to the climate finance pledge. Currently they are providing around $80 billion a year, which poorer nations that need financial help both in developing green energy systems and adapting to the worst of climate change say isn't enough.

BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday urged developed countries to lead by example on emissions reduction. Developed countries should fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments of climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries, Xi said while addressing the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit via video link. "This is critically important for the success of the upcoming COP26 ," he said, referring to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will open on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. Xi said the G20 needs to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, push for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and support a successful COP26 and the COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity. China has all along undertaken due international responsibilities commensurate with its national conditions, he said. "We have actively advanced the green transition of our economy, and raised the ambition of our climate actions on our own initiative." In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity. The construction of the first batch of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of about 100 million kilowatts was launched in an orderly fashion, he said. Xi reiterated that China will strive to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. "We will honor our words with actions and work with all countries to pursue a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development," he said. Enditem \</doc>

World leaders began descending on the Scottish city of Glasgow yesterday for the United Nations COP26 summit, billed as a make-or-break chance to save the planet from the most calamitous effects of climate change. Delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, COP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  the limit scientists say would avoid its most deadly consequences. Meeting that goal, agreed in Paris to much fanfare in 2015, will require a surge in political momentum and diplomatic heavy-lifting to make up for the insufficient action and empty pledges that have characterized much of global climate politics. The conference needs to secure more ambitious pledges to further cut emissions, lock in billions in climate finance, and finish the rules to execute the Paris Agreement with the unanimous nod of the nearly 200 countries that signed it.  Let\' s be clear  there is a serious risk that Glasgow will not deliver, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told leaders of the Group of 20 rich nations last week.  Even if recent pledges were clear and credible  and there are serious questions about some of them  we are still careening towards climate catastrophe. The existing pledges to cut emissions would see the planet\' s average temperature rise 2.7 degrees this century, which the UN says would supercharge the destruction that climate change is already causing by intensifying storms, exposing more people to deadly heat and floods, killing coral reefs and destroying natural habitats. The signals ahead of COP26 have been mixed. A new pledge last week from China, the world\' s biggest polluter, was labelled a missed opportunity that will cast a shadow over the two-week summit. Announcements from Russia and Saudi Arabia were also lackluster. The return of the United States, the world\' s biggest economy, to UN climate talks will be a boon to the conference, after a four-year absence under president Donald Trump. But like many world leaders, President Joe Biden will arrive at COP26 without firm legislation in place to deliver his own climate pledge as Congress argues over how to finance it and new uncertainty about whether US agencies can even regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Leaders of the G20 meeting in Rome this weekend will say they aim to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees, but will largely avoid firm commitments, according to a draft statement. The joint statement reflects tough negotiations, but details few concrete actions to limit carbon emissions. The G20, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the US, accounts for about 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but hopes the Rome meeting might pave the way to success in Scotland have dimmed considerably. Adding to the challenging geopolitical backdrop, a global energy crunch has prompted China to turn to highly polluting coal to avert power scarcity, and left Europe seeking more gas, another fossil fuel. Ultimately, negotiations will boil down to questions of fairness and trust between rich countries whose greenhouse gas emissions caused climate change, and poor countries being asked to de-carbonize their economies with insufficient financial support. COVID-19 has exacerbated the divide between rich and poor. A lack of vaccines and travel curbs mean some representatives from the poorest countries cannot attend. COVID-19 will make this UN climate conference different from any other, as 25,000 delegates from governments, companies, civil society, indigenous peoples, and the media will fill the event venue. World leaders will kick start COP26 today with two days of speeches that could include some new emissions-cutting pledges, before technical negotiators lock horns over the Paris accord rules. Any deal is likely to be struck hours or even days after the event\' s November 12 finish date. \</doc>

The West did not play fair by chiding China and India for changing the wording of a coal deal at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, climate scientists said, noting that many developing countries still don't have enough energy supply. To solve the divergence, wealthy countries must help finance the energy transition in developing nations. Western media heaped criticism on China and India for weakening their coal pledge. In the last-minute change,the coal commitment was changed from "phase out" to "phase down" at COP26 . "China and India are going to have to explain themselves to the most climate vulnerable countries in the world," UK lawmaker Alok Sharma, who led the COP26 negotiations, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday. In response, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a Monday briefing talked about China's policies on curbing coal consumption, and said phasing down coal is a gradual process, during which developing countries' need for sufficient energy supply should be considered. "We encourage developed nations to stop using coal first, and remember their promise to provide sufficient financial and technological support to developing countries in energy transition," Zhao said. Developed countries should understand developing nations, who are the biggest victims of climate change, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times. He said that it is impossible for China and India, the world's biggest developing countries, who are also developing their economies and encountering disasters brought by climate change, to phase out coal in the near future. China cut its coal use to 56.8 percent at the end of 2020, while coal accounts for over 70 percent of India's electrical output. "Developing countries must have the opportunity to improve the lives of their people. This is where the 'stock' of greenhouse gas emissions matters. Developed countries have played the biggest role in causing climate change, and to let the rest of the world develop they have to acknowledge this," Kishore Mahbubani, distinguished fellow at the Asia Research Institute of the National University of Singapore, and a veteran diplomat, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. "It is simply unfair for those developed countries, which have been relying on coal to fuel its economic development unrestrained for centuries, to ask developing countries, who just started an economic take off, to abandon coal completely," said Lin. The expert said that the only way to solve this divergence is for rich countries to finance the energy transition of developing states. Yet even days before the COP26 convened, a report pointed out that developed countries are still lagging behind in meeting the $100 billion climate fund pledge, a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Developed countries could have taken a big step toward this by fulfilling their pledge to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing countries. Sadly, they have not done so, said Mahbubani, noting that "by trying to shift the onus for climate on developing countries and not doing more to help them, they have neglected the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities." Climate scientists said that China and India share a similar stance and requests on climate change negotiations. During the COP26 , most of the developing nations sought at least $1.3 trillion per year from wealthy countries in climate financing starting 2030. Despite border disputes, China and India have been shepherding developing countries on climate issues, making sure developing countries stick to their own nationally determined contributions on climate, instead of being coerced by rich countries, Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy, told the Global Times. \</doc>

Photo: AFP Britain, host of the COP26 climate change summit in 2021, called Monday for net zero global shipping emissions by 2050 and the launch of non-polluting commercial vessels by 2025. The UK government wants to "chart a course" for cleaner shipping, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on the first day of London's international shipping week maritime event. The zero target needs agreement from the International Maritime Organization, the Department for Transport added in a statement, noting that shipping currently accounts for 3 percent of global emissions. "As a maritime nation with a rich history, and host of COP26 , we are proud to be at the forefront of the greener era for maritime, charting an international course for the future of clean shipping," Shapps said in the statement. "Taking action now allows us to lead the charge on this global shift, creating highly-skilled jobs for British workers and shaping the landscape for what clean shipping and trade will look like for future generations." Johnson's Conservative administration, which also seeks to reduce Britain's carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, will in November host the COP26 United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Shipping companies, buoyed by keen demand, are currently splashing out cash on expanding their fleets with newly built ships. As a result, new shipping capacity is forecast hit a record-matching level by 2023, according to a Banchero Costa' recent estimate. AFP \</doc>

For an NGO observer who has been to 10 of the annual climate COPs (Conference of Parties), following the COP26 Glasgow Conference remotely is a new experience. Close to 30,000 participants were reportedly registered to attend physically or virtually. In the middle of a lasting pandemic and slower-than-expected global economic recovery, this sounds like a surprisingly big crowd. The volume of online blogs and commentaries is also overwhelming compared to the previous COPs in Poland and Spain. Under the rainy grey skies of Glasgow, it seems the tides of enthusiasm to solve climate crisis are high, amid strong winds still tearing continents apart. Past two years saw significant progress on global climate momentum: "net zero" and "carbon neutrality" announcements from governments lined up, CEOs came up with plans to purchase wind and solar power, and investors built better ESG profiles. Outside of the conference rooms, climate related disasters have been hitting unexpected spots. Rainstorms poured down streets of large cities; bush fires forced families to abandon their suburban estates. Climate change has become more personal to millions more around the world. It turns out we all share the vulnerability. Maybe that's why climate talks are regaining media attention. Climate change might be one of the few issues nowadays that can accommodate wide spectrum of differences. Yet the global politics remains worrying. Power wrestling and unfavorable public sentiment toward some diplomatic issues cast a shadow over the nerves of delegates. Finger pointing at other countries as an excuse to inaction, as usual, can be expected too. The U.K. - which holds the COP26 presidency - has worked hard with the U.N. to make sure this COP delivers. By branding Glasgow COP26 HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/around-120-leaders-gather-at-cop26-in-glasgow-for-last-best-chance-to-keep-1-5-alive/ the last, best chance HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021 UN Emission GAP report The Paris Agreement managed to strike a delicate balance between a collective longer-term vision of 1.5 degrees pointing toward mid-century and beyond, and the insufficient short-term action pledges. Five years after the agreement, it's time for countries to build the next level of the Babel Tower of climate action. This is going to be a test to the " HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-ratchet-mechanism-within-the-paris-climate-deal ratchet up mechanism COP26 . How much could these advances add up? Can countries move further ahead? Phasing out coal will also be a hot topic in Glasgow - a pinpoint with promising outcome the U.K. presidency is pushing under the ambition debate. Another key topic to watch is to mobilize the money needed to tackle the climate crisis. The finance debate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has been focused on public funding, from rich countries to those who suffer the most yet contribute the least to climate change. There lies another "gap" - the unmet goal of $100 billion total pledge per year. And there's not much good excuse for this failure. Some heads of states landed in Scotland with a big check to table. Hopefully good intentions trigger more benevolence acts. Meanwhile, COP26 Glasgow is not short of brilliant minds trying to crack the puzzle of incentivizing and channeling of financial flows. In https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/net-zero-will-require-the-biggest-economic-transformation-ever-seen-in-peacetime-says-nicholas-stern/ a recent event celebrating the 15 anniversary of his landmark report "The Economics of Climate Change: Stern Review," Nicolas Stern argued that "climate action requires a trade-off with economic development and growth" is a misconception. This is also probably why an unusual guest, my favorite Science Fiction writer alive, Kim Stanley Robinson, gets invited to attend multiple events at COP26 . In his best-selling speculative novel "The Ministry for the Future" with UN Climate COPs in the 2030~40s as key stages of the story, he proposed to create "Carbon Coin" - a new international currency reflecting the true value of carbon reduction appreciating alongst time, backed by central banks working together. His optimism of global collaborations amongst governments is inspiring, even healing. After all, the faith in multilateralism and the potential of global community acting together is the fundamental reason of why we are paying attention.

NAIROBI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Progress towards the realization of carbon neutrality in Africa has accelerated thanks to capital flows, technical and knowledge transfer to the continent facilitated by China, a Kenyan expert said on Monday. Adhere Cavince, an international relations scholar noted that China has been in the frontlines of the transition to low carbon and sustainable development pathways in Africa, where climate change has taken a toll on livelihoods and vital ecosystems. Adhere said in a commentary published by Capital FM, a local radio station news website that as Africa's largest partner and source of foreign direct investment, China has injected vitality into the continent's quest for climate resilience. While observing that funding and technological bottlenecks have derailed Africa's green transition, Adhere hailed China's support towards the implementation of the continent's renewable energy programs. "China has been the leading partner in the continent's desired to switch to solar and wind energy," Adhere wrote against a backdrop of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) underway in Glasgow, Scotland. Quoting statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Adhere observed that between 2009 and 2018, China upgraded solar capacity in Africa from 739 to 5,500 megawatts while wind energy installations during the same period jumped from 108 to 6,100 megawatts. He said that a China-built 50-megawatt solar plant located in Kenya's eastern county of Garissa has increased the share of renewable energy to the national grid to 93 percent. Adhere emphasized that concrete actions are required to realize a climate-resilient future for humanity. He said that China's progressive actions ahead of COP26 that including launching a fund to promote biodiversity conservation and the pledge to discontinue financing coal plants abroad will revitalize climate response in the global south. Adhere noted that China's climate stewardship nudged major economies to make tangible commitments at the ongoing COP26 to help developing countries withstand shocks related to a warming planet. According to Adhere, the forthcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit in Dakar, Senegal, provides a platform to explore innovative ways the long-standing partners can reinvigorate the climate fight. \</doc>

JERUSALEM, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he will fly to Bahrain on Monday to meet with Bahraini Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, in a first visit by an Israeli prime minister to the Gulf country. The two leaders will discuss "additional ways to strengthen bilateral ties," the Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement, adding they will exchange views on "the importance of peace, advancement and prosperity in the region, and especially the advancement of diplomatic and economic issues, with an emphasis on technology and innovation." Bennett has as well scheduled meetings with Bahraini ministers and representatives of the local Jewish community. When meeting at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow last November, the Bahraini crown prince invited the Israeli prime minister for a first official visit. In September 2020, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirate (UAE) agreed to normalize their ties with Israel under U.S.-brokered agreements, known as the Abraham Accords. In December 2021, Bennett visited the UAE for the first time. Enditem \</doc>

Chinese President Xi Jinping calls on the world to promote a more robust, greener and healthier global development while addressing the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit in Rome, Italy via video link on October 31, 2021. Photo: Xinhua On the same day when the highly expected COP26 convened, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed at a G20 session that concrete actions are essential for international community to properly respond to outstanding global challenges of climate change and energy issue, and developed countries should honor their green commitments and provide financial support to developing countries.\~ President Xi called for G20 members to take the lead in promulgating the application of advanced technologies, and countries should fully, effectively implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The group adopted "Rome Declaration," on Sunday night, agreeing to help developing countries increase the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, key medical products and raw materials, and address related supply and financing constraints. The declaration also says the G20 members look forward to the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing, hailing them as an important opportunity for worldwide athletes to compete and a symbol of human resilience. As COP26 , the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP), started in Glasgow on Sunday, the world's attention will focus on how leaders and delegations from more than 190 countries will deliver on their climate change promises.\~ Developed countries need to lead by example on emissions reduction, fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments to climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries, Xi told another G20 session on Saturday. This is critically important for the success of the upcoming COP26 , he noted.\~ As a major contributor and participant in global climate governance, China has submitted an updated climate pledge, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UN days ahead of the highly expected meeting. It also issued a white paper last week to share with the world its dedication and experience in tackling global warming, which said China's target of achieving peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 marks the world's highest reduction in carbon emission intensity and the shortest time in achieving the goal of going from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in global history.\~ China's responsibility on climate change is demonstrated by the pledges it has made so far, including reiterating that China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. A policy guidance released on October 24 added that the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption would increase to about 25 percent in 2030 and more than 80 percent by 2060, something that is not easy to achieve, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told Global Times on Sunday.\~ The Chinese President highlighted the need for lowering the cost of reducing emission through technologies, and developing countries' need for help from developed countries, as they have to tackle climate change while ensuring livelihoods, Lin noted.\~ Xi also said on Sunday that environmental protection and economic development must be coordinated and climate change must be addressed while people's wellbeing is ensured, adding that major economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard. US President Joe Biden left on Thursday for the G20 leaders meeting in Rome and was expected to head to Glasgow later on Sunday. His departure to Rome was delayed as he had to attend the House Democratic Caucus meeting on Thursday, in what was likely to have been an attempt to secure the backing of progressive lawmakers for his agenda, after the failure to reach an intraparty agreement on the $1.5-2 trillion spending plan aimed at addressing issues including climate change. It means Biden will probably attend COP26 without a final US climate deal, driving doubts over whether the US agenda to cut emissions enough to give Biden credibility at COP26 .\~ Despite the ongoing tensions between China and the US, Lin noted that there's still a lot of room for the two countries to cooperate on this issue, as both are the largest emitters in the world and have to work together to address climate change. Without efforts from both sides, it's impossible to achieve any ambitious goal internationally.\~ COP26 has been described by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson as "the world's moment of truth." World leaders, delegations and experts agreed on the importance of the two weeks of meetings in fighting climate change as it would also be the moment for countries to take concrete steps in reducing emissions since they signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, under which countries agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius. "This year's COP meeting will generate various formal documents, as it is the first meeting that is endowed with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Negotiations during the past years were not bound by law," Wang Mou from the research centre of urban and environment studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who is also a member of Chinese delegation to COP26 , said during a recent online conference.\~ Wang pointed out the difference between formal and informal documents by using the file passed at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference as an example, saying it does not possess legal force, thus it cannot serve as a basis of further negotiation, and can be discarded by any party at any time, he said.\~ "I believe that the fruits of the past two years' negotiations will be passed, or at least recognized during this COP meeting, to give them legal status," Wang said.\~ A key role As a major emitter, China's position and solutions to the climate change fight caught public attention ahead of the COP26 . While some Western leaders and media continued pressuring China "to do more" to tackle climate change, some experts who had taken part in climate negotiations and policy-making said China has done "very well" in delivering on its promises as a developing country in fighting global warming, and played a leading role in energy restructuring.\~ "Under the current energy structure, there's no country in the world that can do as well as China does," Pan Jiahua, director of the institute of eco-civilization studies of the Beijing University of Technology, told the Global Times on Sunday.\~ Given that coal still plays a dominant role in China's energy sector compared to the EU and the US, China has been boosting measures to cut emissions and transition from coal reliance to a clean energy path, Pan said, noting that China's cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy accounts for one-third of the world's total current installed renewable energy capacity.\~ The world may, to some extent, be inspired by China's ambitious goal of hitting peak emissions before 2030 and reaching for carbon neutrality by 2060. It is hard to imagine even a few years ago or when the Paris Agreement was signed, that more than 100 countries have put forward their goals for carbon neutrality whether by year 2050 or 2060, according to experts. "I believe the cohort effect is largely related to China setting up such ambitious goals," Wang noted.\~ He also pointed out that Japan and South Korea are the ones that have been most directly influenced by China. Although we dare not say China has played a "leading role", at the very least it has been a "very important contributor," Wang said. Major obstacles\~ However, climate change negotiations face obstacles not only on differentiated targets but also on how much every country contributes to cutting emissions, according to experts. "Also, there's a money problem. Developing countries need more financial support in fighting climate change and in transforming their economies to low-carbon emissions. China has been providing coordinated help and has been much more generous than developed countries like the US and Europe," Pan said.\~ Wealthy countries confirmed last week that they failed to meet a 2009 promise to deliver $100 billion annually by 2020 in climate finance to help poorer nations cut their own emissions and build resilient systems to weather worsening storms, floods and other climate impacts, Reuters reported on Sunday.\~ It has also led to mistrust among developing countries and undermined rich nations' requests that the developing world cut emissions faster, and the COP26 will need to produce a plan to turn financial support into a reality, according to the media report.\~ Leaders of the G20 called for "meaningful and effective" action to limit global warming at 1.5C, Reuters reported, citing a communique. However, the communique contained few concrete actions and made no reference to a specific 2050 date to achieve net zero carbon emissions that scientists say is vital to stave off disastrous climate change, the media report said. While some analysis pointed out that the success of the COP26 would be judged on whether all the delegates can agree on a 1.5C goal, the underlying question is how to make progress, according to experts. Meanwhile, some Western media pointed out that unlike some developed countries, China has not offered clear support for the 1.5C target. "We do not actively promote the revision of this target, nor do we oppose it," Wang said, noting that from China's stage of development as well as its future development demands, it is unnecessary for us to actively promote the 1.5C process.\~\~ "China's target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 was more ambitious than the two-degree target," he said. \</doc>

TV presenter and naturalist Chris Packham (center right) and school students and parents pose as they gather in order to hand over a 100,000-signature petition urging the Royal Family to rewild their land, outside Buckingham Palace in central London, the UK on Saturday, ahead of the COP26 climate talks. Photo: AFP World leaders attending the COP26 UN climate summit should focus not only on abandoning fossil fuels but also on setting ambitious goals to end deforestation - and expand funding and rules to drive forest protection, environmentalists are urging. More than 100 world leaders have confirmed they will attend November's COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, the UK in person. One key aim for the conference is moving finance out of polluting fossil fuels - especially coal - which are responsible for the lion's share of climate-heating emissions. But green groups say the importance of carbon-storing forests in curbing global warming is being overlooked by many nations - especially in their climate funding - with limited progress in transforming economies to become deforestation-free. In 2015, about 195 countries agreed to limit the rise in global average temperatures this century to "well below" 2 C and ideally to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels. " COP26 provides a great opportunity to establish forests at their rightful place, high on the climate agenda," said Frances Seymour, a distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a US-based think tank. "We need to start thinking about tropical deforestation the way we think about coal: We have to phase it out as quickly as possible, otherwise the goals of the Paris Agreement will remain out of reach," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Cutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of carbon emissions produced worldwide, which they release if they rot or are burned. Forests also provide food and livelihoods, help clean up air and water, support human health, are an essential habitat for wildlife, aid tropical rainfall and offer flood protection. But in 2020, tropical forest losses around the world equaled the size of the Netherlands, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch. Of the world's original rainforest, about a third has already been completely destroyed, while another third is in a degraded condition, said Toerris Jaeger, secretary general of the Oslo-based Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN). Lack of attention Forests sequester over 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually - 1.5 times more than that pumped out by the US, the world's second-largest emitter, said Danny Marks, assistant professor of environmental politics and policy at Dublin City University. But emissions from forests have been increasing recently. "If we want to address climate change, we need to stop deforestation," said Marks. "Unfortunately, compared to reducing fossil fuel emissions, forests are not getting the attention they deserve ahead of COP26 ." That must change, he added, pointing to the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. He also noted that the potential for forests to mitigate carbon emissions is higher than other solutions because preserving them avoids their carbon stocks being released, while as restored forests grow, they also capture carbon from the air. Stopping deforestation, alongside other efforts to protect natural systems like mangroves and wetlands, could get the world more than a third of the way to limiting warming to 2 C, he said. It is also cost-effective as it does not require expensive or unproven technology like carbon capture and storage for reducing emissions from industrial processes, he added. In Indonesia, home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, conservationists are using cheap audio sensors to listen out for chainsaws to tackle illegal logging, while ex-loggers are being trained to fight forest fires, for example. Marks said less than 3 percent of funding for measures aimed at reducing emissions is devoted to forest protection. Money to communities In the run-up to COP26 , governments and businesses have shown growing interest in providing financial support to protect nature and forests - and green groups expect that to continue. Private donors in September pledged a record $5 billion to help safeguard the planet's plants, animals and ecosystems. But without placing the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities at the core of the response to tropical deforestation and allocating direct funding to their efforts, the forests will not be saved, said RFN's Jaeger. In 2020, for example, one indigenous community in Brazil helped protect the Amazon by negotiating with illegal gold miners to stop operations and remove their equipment. Globally, about 35 percent of protected natural areas are traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by indigenous and local communities, yet they are rarely considered in the design of conservation and climate programs, researchers say. The people of Guyana's South Rupununi region are already experiencing worsening climate-change impacts - such as flooding and heat waves - said Immaculata Casimero, co-founder of the Wapichan Wiizi Women's Movement, a local advocacy group. Governments should issue legal titles to indigenous people for their lands and territories, given their positive role in curbing global warming, she said. Deforestation Drivers Conservationists blame the production of commodities like palm oil and minerals for much of the destruction of forests, as they are cleared for plantations, ranches, farms and mines. Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and green groups has pushed major brands that grow, trade or buy commodities to pledge to end deforestation. Many have promised to only buy supplies certified as sustainable, and have teamed up with green groups to root out deforestation from supply chains, including by investing in technologies to track what is happening on the ground. Environmentalists urged countries at the COP26 climate summit to consider removing subsidies that are harmful to forests, and to introduce trading rules that exclude companies or investors linked to forest destruction.

By ZHAO HUANXIN in Washington | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-09-13 07:14 Chinese and US flags flutter outside a company building in Shanghai, on April 14, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Top-level engagement between Washington and Beijing is essential for the world's two largest economies to resolve the impasse over bilateral relations, analysts said after United States President Joe Biden held a phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, only their second since Biden took office. During the conversation, Xi told Biden that "for some time, due to the US policy on China, the China-US relationship has run into serious difficulty", and that the relationship "is not a multiple-answer question of whether we should have good relations, but a compulsory question of how", according to a Chinese readout of the conversation. The White House said in a statement that during the 90-minute call made at the request of the US side, the two leaders "discussed the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict". Barry said more regular calls leading to face-to-face discussions are needed on possible topics, such as what happens with the Phase One trade agreement expiring at the end of the year; what's required of both countries to lift or reduce punitive tariffs; and what the plan is for cooperating on existential threats such as global warming and pandemics. "The status quo will remain or deteriorate further unless the two presidents become more engaged and with a greater sense of urgency," he said. The latest presidential phone call, following one in early February, was a culmination of interaction between China and the US since Biden took office in late January, after bilateral ties had plunged to the lowest point in four decades. A senior Biden administration official said Biden initiated the call with Xi "to really have a broad and strategic discussion about how to manage the competition between the United States and China", according to US media reports. "It's quite likely that engagement at the leader level is really what's needed to move the ball forward," National Public Radio quoted the unidentified official as saying on Friday. In March, China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken led teams for talks in Anchorage, Alaska, in which Yang rejected Washington assuming a "position of strength" in its approach to China. At their Tianjin meeting in late July, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi marked out China's "three bottom lines" to US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The first bottom line is that the US must not challenge, slander or attempt to subvert the path and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The second is that the US must not attempt to obstruct or interrupt China's development process. The third is that the US must not infringe upon China's sovereignty or damage its territorial integrity. In his talks with Sherman, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Feng said that US policy seems to be demanding cooperation when it wants something from China; decoupling, cutting off supplies, blockading or sanctioning China when it believes it has an advantage; and resorting to conflict and confrontation at all costs. Douglas Paal, distinguished fellow of the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, "I am hoping that someone on the US side realized that recent high-level interactions were going nowhere, or, more likely, downhill, and it was time to get the top leaders engaged." Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the phone call is "the best event" in a long time, which could signal a gradual de-escalation of tension. "Both leaders have committed to reducing carbon emissions. At the November COP (Conference of the Parties), they can restate those commitments and lay out specific policies to reach carbon neutrality," Hufbauer said of the United Nations climate change conference to be held in Glasgow in November. \</doc>

By JONATHAN POWELL | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-29 09:41 An activist takes part in a protest ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain October 28, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Senior UN official urges Glasgow climate summit to put priority on poor countries The United Nation's development chief has said the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow must focus on the needs of developing countries following the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, ahead of the opening of COP26 in the United Kingdom on Sunday, Achim Steiner, the executive director of the UN development program, said: "For developing countries at this juncture, a sense of recognizing their dilemmas is extremely important. They do not need to be told that climate change is important, that everybody has to do more. "They are under severe stress in the midst of this pandemic, of economic regression, of growing poverty rates. It is critical that the UK is able to echo the genuine and legitimate concerns that developing countries articulate." The summit would be deemed a success if the financial concerns of poor countries are prioritized, he added. "COPs have succeeded when no group of countries had a reason to feel they were overlooked, ignored or dismissed. Inclusiveness is critical. There are countries that feel they were promised financial support and it has hardly materialized. Knowing those sensitivities is part of being well prepared," he told the paper. More than 120 world leaders, along with 25,000 delegates, including negotiators and journalists, are expected to take part in the summit, which runs until November 12. It is estimated tens of thousands of campaigners and businesses representatives will also be there to hold events, to network, and to protest, said the BBC. Participating nations will be expected to sign up to a declaration of commitment on plans to reduce emissions at the end of the conference. Developing countries experience some of the worst effects of climate change and need money to help reduce their emissions, says the UN. "Accelerating a climate implementation plan requires additional investment, and that money is simply not easily found," said Steiner. "Recovery (from the COVID-19 crisis) can actually happen faster, (if you) create jobs with green transitions, but you still need capital to invest, whether private, public or concessional." The Guardian noted that in 2009 poor countries were promised $100 billion a year from the private and public sector sources of the richest nations by 2020, but this goal has not been met. However, the target is still achievable by 2023, said a recent report, the Climate Finance Delivery Plan, commissioned by the UK as host of COP26 . The summit would be a disappointment if developing countries were not given the assurances they required, and its success depends on how the UK as host can cultivate constructive discussion among participating nations, he said. He added: "There has to be some palpable sense of shared purpose and unity. Is there a sense of common purpose, or are divisions going to define all the signals and symbolisms of Glasgow?" \</doc>

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks at the launch of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, at the UN headquarters in New York, on March 10, 2020. (Xinhua/Xie E) The years from 2015 to 2021 are on track to be the seven hottest on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Sunday, warning that the planet was heading into "uncharted territory." The preliminary WMO state of the climate report, launched as the UN COP26 climate conference opens, said that global warming from greenhouse gas emissions threatens "far-reaching repercussions for current and future generations." Based on data for the first nine months of 2021, the WMO said 2021 was likely to be between the fifth and seventh warmest year on record - despite the cooling effect of the La Nina phenomenon that lowered temperatures at the beginning of 2021. "From the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated," said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement on the report. He added that the two-week COP26 climate conference "must be a turning point for people and planet." The WMO found that the average temperature for 2021 was around 1.09 C higher than pre-industrial levels. And the average temperature over the last 20 years for the first time exceeded the threshold of 1 C above the mid-19th century, when humans began burning fossil fuels on an industrial scale. This will "focus the minds of delegates at COP26 aspiring to keep global temperature rise to within the limits agreed in Paris six years ago," said Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at Britain's Met Office. The 2015 Paris Agreement saw countries agree to cap global warming at "well below" 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5 C if possible. Since then the world has seen a litany of weather disasters including record-shattering wildfires across Australia and Siberia, a once-in-a-thousand-years heat wave in North America and extreme rainfall that caused massive flooding in Asia, Africa, the US and Europe. "Extreme events are the new norm," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.\~ AFP \</doc>

The wide view of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia on July 17, 2021.(Photo: Xinhua) Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia will aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, its de facto ruler said on Saturday, days before the COP26 global climate summit. The kingdom, one of the world's biggest polluters, said it would also join a global effort to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. The UN says more than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, an objective it says is "imperative" to safeguard a livable climate. "I announce today Saudi Arabia's target to reach net zero emissions by 2060," Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the "Saudi Green Initiative" forum. "I am pleased to launch initiatives in the energy sector that will reduce carbon emissions by 278 million tons annually by 2030, thus voluntarily more than doubling the target announced," Prince Mohammed said in a statement. "We also announce the kingdom's accession to the Global Methane Pledge." A statement said Saudi Arabia would "contribute to cutting global methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030, as part of its commitment to deliver a cleaner, greener future." The 2060 target would "enable us to have a smooth and viable transition, without risking economic or social impacts," Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said. COP26 President Alok Sharma welcomed the announcement. "I hope this landmark announcement... will galvanize ambition from others ahead of # COP26 ," Sharma tweeted, adding he was looking forward to seeing more details on the Saudi plan. Shortly after, energy giant Saudi Aramco said it committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2050. "Saudi Aramco will achieve an ambition of being also a net zero from our operation by 2050," Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said at the forum. "We understand that the road will be complex, the transition will have its challenges, but we are confident we can meet them and accelerate our efforts to a low emission future." Saudi Arabia is estimated to emit about 600 million tons of carbon dioxide per year - more than France. The year 2050 has become a focus for carbon neutrality, defined as achieving a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. AFP \</doc>

JERUSALEM, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Monday vowed at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow that his country will harness its hi-tech innovative capabilities to tackle the climate crisis. "We need to contribute Israel's most valuable source of energy - the energy and brainpower of our people," said Bennett during his speech at the COP26 . "As the country with the most startups per capita in the world, we must channel our efforts to save the world," he added. Israel's carbon footprint may be small, but its impact on climate change can be mighty, the Israeli leader noted. The world is "going to need new inventions and new technologies that have not yet been even imagined, he said, urging Israeli and international entrepreneurs and innovators to pay attention to the climate change. Bennett noted that the Israeli government recently pledged for the first time to phase out greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to gradually stop using coal by 2025. In late October, the Israel cabinet approved a new plan to encourage climate innovation and develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle the climate change. Enditem \</doc>

by Xinhua writer Gu Zhenqiu LONDON, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- As the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change, also known as COP26 , is set to open in 10 days in Glasgow, an accommodation crisis is sweeping the Scottish city, as thousands of people are still looking for a hotel room ahead of the high-profile international event. As the event is expected to gather more than 30,000 people from around the world, it has pushed hotel prices up to above 600 pounds (nearly 828 U.S. dollars) a night in Glasgow at present. The hiking hotel prices highlight the hardship COP26 attendees have to face in securing a bed in the host city amid mounting health risks brought by COVID-19, which is described by The Financial Times as "the most difficult hurdle of all." An eye-popping example reported by the British media is that one room which normally costs 42 pounds (nearly 58 dollars) was advertised at 1,400 pounds (1,931 dollars). What's more surprising is that the price of a standard room for one person at a hotel in Argyle Street has rocketed to 6,540 pounds (9,018 dollars) -- almost five times more than the cost of a 10-day stay on the same dates a month earlier. During COP26 , negotiations and workshops often run through the night. Staying close to the conference center is no doubt a top priority for participants. However, many cannot afford the exorbitant room prices in Glasgow, and are not prepared to confront the thorny problem. A shortage of affordable accommodation even forced some to book rooms more than 200 km away from the conference venue, according to local media. The soaring prices of hotel rooms in the largest Scottish city have also prompted local residents to open their houses and cash in. The hot wave even spread to Edinburgh, about 70 km east of Glasgow, and further. The lack of beds has become so dire that two cruise ships are berthed on the River Clyde to be makeshift dormitories for people working at the UN conference. At the same time, the costs of renting COP26 pavilions and space for hosting workshops, panels discussions and keynote speeches during the conference are considerably higher than they were at COP25 in Madrid, Spain, in December 2019. Already postponed by one year due to COVID-19, the conference designed to seek joint solutions to climate change, an urgent common challenge for all mankind, should not be held up again by hurdles caused by human faults. Fair-priced hotel rooms are crucial for the extensive participation of all parties related, especially developing nations. The widespread bed hunting in Glasgow has also drawn much criticism to the British government for a "shambolic preparation" for the UN conference. The Guardian described the Glasgow conference as "confusing and expansive" and many British people fear the upcoming UN gathering would be "the most exclusionary COP ever." The overly high pricing of everything in Glasgow soon sparked concerns that smaller nations would be priced out of hosting pavilions, as one organization was quoted to have spent nearly 50,000 pounds (6,897 dollars), and another was forced to scale back space for their pavilion. The UN has called on developing countries affected by the high conference costs to speak to the UK government, as it is obliged to ensure equitable and safe participation by all nations. Embassies and businesses have also been contacting the Downing Street for being unable to get hotel rooms, according to local media. Enditem \</doc>

China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said that China will "fight its hardest" to achieve emissions and neutrality targets over the coming decades, and called on developed nations to follow up on climate pledges with real action. Xie said that the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, or COP 26 , provides an opportunity to construct "road maps for actionable policies and measures" and to ensure that countries "honor words with real deeds". "China would like to join hands with the international community in its active response to the challenges of climate change," Xie told a virtual news conference on China's policies on climate change and ecological protection on Tuesday. The event was organized by the country's embassy in London. Xie said that as "a big country, China shoulders big responsibility" in international efforts to meet the Paris Agreement and control global warming. He reiterated that China has committed to peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving net neutrality by 2060. "China will fight its hardest to achieve this double target," said Xie, adding that he is confident the goals could even be met ahead of schedule. Xie said that national climate targets needed to be supported by detailed action plans, such as China's forthcoming "1+N" policy framework for carbon peaking and neutrality, officially announced earlier this month by President Xi Jinping during the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, or COP 15, in Kunming, Yunnan province. Global challenges including climate change, biodiversity loss, and the COVID-19 pandemic "are all intertwined" and international engagement at conferences like COP 26 and COP 15 are essential to their resolution, he said. "Multilateralism is key to resolving these issues," he said. "New chances and opportunities are given by meetings such as COP 26 .And adhering to the principle of multilateralism means taking into account the concerns of all countries in a balanced way." At the news conference, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang said that developed nations must respect the varying situation in different countries, especially those nations still undergoing industrialization and urbanization. "Developed countries should take the lead in reducing emissions. They should not pin all the responsibilities onto China and developing nations," Zheng said. High expectations COP 26 can deliver. "It should send a forceful political signal, to stand up for multilateralism, and respect international rules and principles," Zhao said. " COP 26 should further highlight the work on implementation, encourage targets and goals and transfer them into specific action, so they do not end up as empty slogans." Zhao said that China, for its part, has expressed its real commitment to tackling climate change and biodiversity loss, through its 2030 and 2060 targets, as well as the "1+N" framework and the establishment of the Kunming Biodiversity Fund. China has placed an initial 1.5 billion yuan ($235 million) into the fund for the protection of biodiversity in developing nations.

YAOUNDE, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon lost over 1.5 million hectares of forest from 2000 to 2017, the country's National Observatory on Climate Change said in a report. There are fears that destruction of the environment may have accelerated since then, environmental experts said during the presentation of the report to journalists on Wednesday in the capital, Yaounde. According to the report, most of the deforestation took place in the Congo Basin, home to the world's second-largest rainforest. Cameroon's Minister of the Environment and the Protection of Nature Pierre Hele, who presided over the ceremony, blamed the rising degradation on the effects of climate change. He said Cameroon is upbeat to present a strong case in the battle against climate change during the United Nations climate change conference next month in Glasgow, Britain. "We have to do our best to fight against deforestation. During COP26 next month we have to face the problem of climate change," Hele told reporters after the presentation of the report.

NAIROBI, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- The global fight against climate change is likely to acquire new momentum and vitality thanks to China's commitment to low carbon development pathways, a Kenyan expert has said. Gibson Mwangi, a climate change expert noted that China has demonstrated commitment to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, thereby boosting transition to a green, inclusive and resilient future for humanity. He said that leveraging China's resources, expertise and technological prowess is key to boost climate response in developing countries that have borne the brunt of global warming. "China is way ahead of developing nations in mitigating and reducing carbon emissions," Mwangi said in a virtual interview with Xinhua during the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) slated for Glasgow, Scotland from October 31 to November 12. He noted that technology transfer facilitated by China combined with capacity building and sharing of best practices can be harnessed to help developing countries cope with negative impacts of climate change. China's wealth of experiencing in tackling extreme weather events like droughts and floods could be useful in development of a global climate response strategy, said Mwangi, who is currently in Glasgow for the COP26 meeting. He added that developing countries can also tap into expertise from Chinese scientists in their quest for a climate-resilient future. The former head of Climate Change Unit in Kenya's Ministry of Water and Irrigation said that investments by Chinese companies domiciled in the Belt and Road Initiative have also contributed positively to climate response in the global south. Mwangi said that African countries are keen to join hands with China at the global climate summit to push for a just and fair deal to hasten green transition. He revealed that the group of 77 that include 134 developing countries has resolved to negotiate as one bloc together with China in order to realize positive outcomes at the Glasgow climate summit. Mwangi said that African Group of Negotiators attending COP26 are keen to involve China in deliberations aimed at delivering climate justice to a continent reeling from a series of extreme weather events. He noted that both China and Africa are united in the quest for low carbon development, adding that there is a consensus among the long-standing partners on the need to improve adaptive capacity of local communities. Mwangi said that in the absence of solid commitment from the industrial north to help Africa tackle the climate crisis, China could fill the gap through showcasing its best practices in dealing with severe weather patterns. He said that African countries expect their wealthier counterparts to honor financial pledges, facilitate technology transfer in order boost the continent's response to climate change.

DUBLIN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Dublin Climate Dialogues, a two-day online global conference on climate change, concluded here on Thursday with a declaration calling on world leaders to take faster and more forceful actions at the 26th United Nations (UN) climate change conference, abbreviated as COP26 . The declaration was handed over virtually by Pat Cox, former president of the European Parliament from Ireland, on behalf of the organizers of the conference, to John Murton, the United Kingdom's COP26 Envoy responsible for coordinating the UK diplomacy in relation to COP26 , which will be hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy in Glasgow of Scotland in November. The declaration highlighted the impact of climate change on humanity, stressed the urgency to address the crisis and put forward four-point recommendations in dealing with the problem. "With more greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere and global temperature rising faster than at any time in human history, we are conducting an unprecedented experiment with the only home we have, our planet," said the declaration, adding that while it is welcome to see that many countries are committing to net-zero emissions and advancing plans to decarbonize their economies, the overall pace of change to date has been inadequate to meet the scale of the challenge. "As organizers of the Dublin Climate Dialogues, we have issued this Declaration as a distillation of the collective wisdom which emerged from our deliberations and as an input to the wider debate in the run up to COP26 in November 2021," said Pat Cox, who chaired the dialogues. Jointly organized by University College Dublin and Mainstream Renewable Power, an Irish renewable energy company with a global footprint, and with the support from the Irish government, the dialogues brought together nearly 60 speakers from over a dozen countries. They included senior government officials, business leaders, experts and scholars from the United States, China, Italy, the UK, France, Japan, Chile, Barbados and Ireland as well as senior representatives from international organizations such as the United Nations, the European Union, International Energy Agency, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Topics discussed at the dialogues ranged from the impact and cost of current and future damage of climate change to the benefits of an accelerated global decarbonisation pathway as well as the role of the private sector in effecting the transformation, including financing the transition to sustainability. John Kerry, the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, delivered a pre-recorded speech to the conference. In a speech at the conference, Li Junfeng, Chairman of Academic Committee of China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, briefed the participants about the latest efforts made by China in dealing with the climate change issues. China has committed to the world that it will reach a carbon peak before 2030 and achieve a carbon neutral status before 2060. Enditem \</doc>

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- China has detailed and concrete plans on how to meet its climate commitments, and is pushing those plans forward vigorously, unlike some countries that are "paying lip service" to their climate targets, The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday. "If we only make promises without taking real action then we are just simply paying lip service to make a show rather than taking real action," Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said in an interview with the major British newspaper on the sidelines of the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. China has announced recently on many multilateral occasions the country's specific targets and concrete policies, measures and actions, Xie said. "We have a policy framework to ensure that we can achieve our climate target." The issue of how far countries are following up their pledges of emissions cuts with concrete policies and action has become the key issue at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, The Guardian said. As the world's largest developing country, China is striving to meet a grand goal: to peak its carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This ambitious target means China will complete the world's most dramatic reduction in carbon emission intensity, and realize carbon neutrality from carbon peaking in the shortest time in global history. \</doc>

LONDON, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth II has been advised by doctors to rest for two more weeks, Buckingham Palace said Friday. The palace said following their recent advice that the Queen should rest for a few days, the doctors have advised that she should continue to rest for at least the next two weeks. The doctors have advised that the 95-year-old monarch could continue to undertake light, desk-based duties during this time, including some virtual audiences, "but not to undertake any official visits". It means she will be unable to attend the Festival of Remembrance on Nov. 13, but officials said it is her "firm intention" to attend the National Service of Remembrance on Nov. 14, according to the BBC. It came after the Queen decided on Tuesday that she will not travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference . Instead she will deliver a video message to the delegates. The Queen spent a night in hospital for "some preliminary investigations" last Wednesday, after she cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland.

By MAO SHIYUE | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-03-17 08:36 Over the past decade, China has witnessed remarkable advances in new energy vehicles. An impressive set of metrics makes the case: sales doubled in 2021 compared to 2020, with 3.55 million new NEVs on the road; hundreds of new NEV models available each year; and ranges of 600-plus kilometers virtually eliminating range concerns, to cite just a few. However, heavy-duty vehicles, which are used for freight delivery, lag behind in this NEV revolution. Heavy-duty vehicles account for only about 10 percent of the rolling fleet, but drive a disproportionate share of energy consumption and emissions. Trucks and buses contributed 74 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions, 52 percent of particulate matter emissions, and more than 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in China in 2020, according to the latest tally of mobile emissions by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. China's President Xi Jinping's ambition that its carbon emissions should peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality be achieved before 2060 means that the transportation sector, in particular heavy-duty vehicles, must rapidly transition to zero-emissions technologies. Although not an easy task, decades of technological progress position China to be a global leader in decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles. While the fuel efficiency of diesel engines needs to improve in the short term, full electrification of heavy-duty vehicle fleets is imperative to achieve China's carbon goals. China has fuel economy and pollutant emissions standards in place to reduce tailpipe emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. However, heavy-duty vehicles with internal combustion engines will inexorably fall short of China's decarbonization targets; full electrification is a must and that process needs to start immediately. Life-cycle analyses that consider emissions from extraction, manufacturing, use, maintenance and scrapping show that electric buses reduced GHG emissions by about 20 percent relative to diesel vehicles in 2021, according to a study by Tsinghua University. China has a track record of empowering the industrial scale of zero-emissions vehicles around the world. No tailpipe pollution, higher energy efficiency, better operating costs, less noise\u-243 China is leveraging these advantages to help electric trucks and buses conquer the territory dominated by diesel vehicles. Electric city buses are a prime example. In the past five years, Chinese manufacturers have produced about 95 percent of the world's electric buses, with more than 90 percent being deployed in China. In addition, Chinese companies are knocking on the door of international bus markets, supplying electric buses to Europe, North America and Latin America. While the future is bright, the road has twists and turns. This is true regarding the many challenges that must be overcome to realize a complete transition to electric trucks and buses, including higher purchase costs, limited charging facilities and operational constraints. A typical electric truck is more expensive than a diesel counterpart by 50 to 100 percent mostly due to the high cost of the battery, which hinders the application of electric trucks in real cases. Charging is also critical for daily operation. Fast charging still takes a longer time than fueling, thus electric trucks turn out to be less effective than diesel models. However, trucks and buses typically travel greater distances over their lifetimes than passenger cars, so their operating costs typically outweigh the capital investment. Electric vehicles have the upper hand over their lifetimes because electricity is a cheaper energy source than diesel. Simplicity of the electric powertrain leads to lower maintenance costs as well. A study from the International Council on Clean Transportation examined the cost structure of electric and diesel trucks. It showed that the total cost of ownership of electric trucks can be lower than that of conventional trucks, and that operational savings could be realized much sooner than intuition would suggest. In some ambitious cases, a parity point of total cost of ownership between electric and diesel models can be reached as early as 2025; for most scenarios, a parity point can be witnessed before 2030. Electric heavy-duty vehicles are gradually becoming commercially more attractive than diesel models. To accelerate this process, policymakers have an essential role to play. The policy tool kit includes various measures governing the supply and demand of zero-emissions trucks and their infrastructure that go well beyond the granting of direct financial incentives. Most notably, setting a clear road map for the phase-out of combustion-powered trucks and buses\u-243 as a group of countries did at the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference held last year in Glasgow, Scotland\u-243 can guide the industry's long-term vision and provide the confidence needed to make the right investments. Encouraging closer collaboration through the supply chain will make electric vehicle components, such as batteries and powertrains, more affordable. At the local level, granting electric trucks and buses the privilege to access zero-emission zones, where only electric fleets are allowed to enter, can appreciably motivate operators to transition to zero-emission trucks for freight delivery. Admirably, several proposals in an effort to promote lifecycle carbon footprint analysis and new technologies of NEVs have been presented at this year's two sessions\u-243 the annual meetings of China's top legislative and political advisory bodies, which will undoubtedly enable the NEV industry to step on the gas even more. Electric heavy-duty vehicles can and should be integral to the set of solutions that will achieve carbon neutrality in China. A new era of trucking is coming.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Political mutual trust between the wealthier and low income countries is essential for global cooperation on climate change, former U.S. Vice President and environmentalist Al Gore said Tuesday, urging developed countries to deliver their promises and provide more assistance to low income countries as soon as possible. Speaking to Xinhua during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, Gore said every nation should be doing much more in tackling climate change. He warned that "we are taking unacceptably high risks with the future of humanity" because filling up the atmosphere with green house gas pollution is already causing "incredibly harmful damages to nations all over the world." Gore said every nation, rich or poor, has an important role to play in dealing with climate change, while holding that countries that benefited from early industrialization processes have a responsibility to do more in solving the problems coming along with the heavy reliance on fossil fuels. The 73-year-old former politician, now one of the world's most prominent climate activists, attended the opening event of China Corporate Pavilion at COP26 on Tuesday. Gore said he has been following closely China's proposals and efforts on climate change, environment protection and green transition and saving the world's climate balance can be a way for China and the United States to cooperate once again to benefit the entire world.

By MO JINGXI | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2021-11-02 06:57 Aerial photo taken on Aug 19, 2020 shows wind turbines in Jiucaiping scenic spot in Southwest China's Guizhou province. [Photo/Xinhua] Multilateral consensus and concrete actions urged in statement to COP 26 President Xi Jinping emphasized on Monday the importance of upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions and accelerating the green transition in order to tackle climate change and revive the world economy. He made the remark in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 26 . The two-day summit kicked off on Monday in Glasgow, Scotland. "As we speak, the adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action. How to respond to climate change and revive the world economy are challenges of our times that we must meet," Xi said in the statement. He also said that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international climate cooperation. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP 26 in Glasgow, he said. According to Xi, parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver climate action measures. "Developed countries should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better," he said. Xi also emphasized the importance of harnessing innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resource sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption patterns. The president said that China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. China will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects, he said. Xi said that China will also speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. "I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all," he said. COP 26 is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Delegates are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions on climate change in the next two weeks. \</doc>

Dec. 2 --COFCO issued the following news release: Recently before the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) was held in Britain, UK's Ambassador to Brazil praised COFCO International's sustainability effort in Brazil during an interview with Brazilian media. Globo.com, the online subsidiary of Brazil's largest TV network, posted a report titled "UK's Ambassador: Deforestation is Brazil's biggest challenge at COP26 " on October 25. During the interview, Peter Wilson, UK's ambassador to Brazil, called upon Brazil to work with other countries to tackle the issue of deforestation in regions such as the Amazon to make substantial contribution to the global carbon reduction initiative. Speaking of global economy, Mr. Wilson said, "The whole world is moving toward green economy, be it Europe, the US or China. A case in point is the agricultural product traceability proposed by China's grain trader COFCO. This indicates that besides governments of various countries which are willing to fight global warming, companies and investors have also joined the effort." According to Mr. Wilson, COFCO International, which requires that agricultural products provided by its Brazilian soybean suppliers meet zero deforestation criterion, is building a traceable and sustainable soybean supply chain. The Company has announced that all soybeans directly purchased in Brazil will be made comprehensively traceable by 2023. In recent years, COFCO International's sustainability effort has been recognized by government agencies, major international media and financial institutions on many occasions. In September, 2021, Mr. Yang Wanming, China's ambassador to Brazil, noted in his interview with local media that Chinese enterprises with an active presence in Brazil such as COFCO attach great importance to green development and sustainability, delivering stellar performance in product traceability and conservation of natural resources.

By Michael Spence | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-08-27 09:08 A Los Angeles County emergency medical technician gives a second does of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to Aaron Delgado, 16, at a pop up vaccine clinic in the Arleta neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, Aug 23, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] As recently as three months ago, the global economy seemed to be on track for a relatively robust recovery. The supply of COVID-19 vaccines had expanded in developed countries, raising hopes that it would spill over to developing countries in the second half of this year and into 2022. Many economies were posting impressive growth numbers as pandemic-suppressed sectors reopened. While clogged supply chains had produced a host of shortages and high prices for key inputs, these were seen as merely transitory problems. The world looks very different now. The Delta variant of the virus is spreading rapidly, including in developed countries and among those who were hitherto less vulnerable to the virus. The unvaccinated parts of the world\u-243 mostly lower-middle and lower-income countries\u-243 are now more vulnerable than ever. Moreover, the vaccine supply chain is failing. The principal reason is that developed countries have option contracts to buy many more vaccine doses than they need (even after accounting for an expansion of their programs to vaccinate younger people and administer booster shots).This lengthens the vaccine waiting line, thereby delaying the arrival of vaccines in much of the developing world. The rich world's "excess orders" need to be released and made available for purchase by other countries. A program to fund such purchases would not be very costly in global terms (on the order of $60 billion to $70 billion), and would yield immediate and long-term benefits in controlling the virus and preventing the emergence of dangerous new variants. Another problem is that global supply chains have been more severely disrupted than previously thought. It is now apparent that the resulting shortages\u-243 in labor, semiconductors (which are used in countless industries), construction materials, containers and shipping capacity\u-243 are not going away anytime soon. Surveys indicate that the inflationary effects are widespread across sectors and countries and are likely to act as a persistent headwind to recovery and growth. Adding to the uncertainty, there have been pandemic-induced shifts in domestic and global supply chains that are not yet well understood and will most likely be difficult to reverse. Indeed, the disruptions coming out of the pandemic are broader and appear to be exerting a stronger drag on the economy than did the recent trade war between the United States and China. But the most eye-opening development of the past three months has been the dramatic increase in the frequency, severity and global scope of extreme weather: storms, droughts, heat waves, higher average temperatures, fires and floods. Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered a new report that has been bluntly characterized as announcing "code red for humanity". The collective judgment of the scientific community suggests that this year's brutal experience is not an outlier; it is the new climate normal. We therefore can expect more of the same (and probably much worse) for the next 20 to 30 years. The window for preventing the kinds of events we have seen this summer is closed. The challenge now is to accelerate the pace of reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid even more serious\u-243 and potentially life-threatening\u-243 climate-driven outcomes in the coming decades. Given the economic and climatic headwinds confronting the world, and the expectation that they will blow over a longer time horizon, future growth and development are in peril. In addition to being an obvious drag on growth, today's supply-chain disruptions may contribute to inflationary pressures that will demand a monetary-policy response. Similarly, a constantly morphing virus that becomes a semipermanent feature of life will retard global growth and specialization. International travel will continue to struggle to recover. And while digital platforms can serve as partial substitutes, the impediments to mobility eventually will hit all the global economic and financial ecosystems that support innovation. The United Nations climate-change conference Since extreme climate events will occur more frequently and globally\u-243 striking almost anywhere\u-243 private and social insurance systems will need a major upgrade to become multinational in scope. We may need a new international financial institution to take this on, working closely with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Caroline Wilson, UK ambassador to China. Photo: VCG Editor's Note: At the COP15 in Kunming, Southwest China' Yunnan Province, China demonstrated a strong determination to work with other countries in protecting biodiversity, which is considered a new chapter in biodiversity conservation. The country's efforts of implementing a number of measures to protect and restore biodiversity were also widely hailed by foreign diplomats at the meeting. Global Times reporters Chen Qingqing and Zhang Hui interviewed Caroline Wilson, the British Ambassador to China, recently during the COP15, to talk about China's commitment and solutions to climate change, and potential areas where China and the UK could further strengthen cooperation in the future. As the host of COP26 , the UK is also looking forward to this enhanced tie in delivering on promises on environment protection.\~ GT: How would you evaluate China's new commitments in climate change and their implementation in the past year? What Chinese practices do you think can be adopted by other countries?\~ Wilson: As one of the 12 mega-biodiverse countries in the world, China certainly has huge potential to provide global solutions to biodiversity loss, and has made great progress already. Over the past decade, China has established thousands of nature reserves and parks. I experienced first-hand on my bird-watching trip to Yeyahu Nature Reserve in Beijing - the second most biodiverse city among the G20 capitals where over 500 bird species live.\~\~ However, no country can solve the biodiversity crisis on its own. International collaboration is important. For years, the UK and China have been important partners in protecting biodiversity for all - for example, in December 2019, the UK supported a "human-wildlife coexistence" event in Jilin Province, benefiting the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, by providing UK's expertise in protecting biodiversity.\~\~ Biodiversity is also an increasingly important focus of UK Research and Innovation's joint portfolio with China. A bilateral program has developed sophisticated computer models to assess the potential damage of man-made climate change on biodiversity in regions of Southwest China and Southeast Asia upon which millions of livelihoods depend, with analysis ongoing in how best to mitigate the impact of climate change on species. Since 2014, through the Forest Governance, Market and Climate Programme, we are working with a wide range of stakeholders in China to address the potential negative impacts arising from forest-related commodities such as timber, palm oil and rubber. In Hainan, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has been working with its Chinese counterparts, Bawangling National Nature Reserve of Hainan Province, and Hainan University, since 2013 to collaborate on extensive conservation research.\~ In Shanghai, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has worked in collaboration with National Nature Reserve on Chongming Island on the Spartina and Bird Habitat Optimisation Project to help create and protect wetland habitats. GT: COP26 is going to be held in the UK at the end of the month, and the COP15 is held in Kunming, China's Yunnan Province. What expectations do you have on the agreement to be reached at the COP15? Wilson\u-230 This conference comes at a really crucial time for humankind. Climate change and biodiversity loss are twin crises. Biodiversity is negatively affected by climate change, and biodiversity-rich habitats act as both carbon sinks and barriers against extreme weather. We can't tackle one without the other. We hope to see an ambitious package of outcomes from COP15 that goes beyond agreement of new global biodiversity goals and targets but also puts in place elements needed to reduce and halt species extinction.\~ The UK has a strong presence at COP15 with a delegation led by Lord Goldsmith, Minister for Pacific and the Environment. Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Helen Whateley will also attend, alongside former Governor of Bank of England Mark Carney and Professor Dasgupta from the University of Cambridge.\~ It is an important year for international leadership on the global environment, with the UK hosting COP26 and China hosting COP15. The UK and China have a unique opportunity to work together to protect our planet, our economies, and our livelihoods. We are keen to work closely with China as the COP15 hosts to deliver these goals - we will play an active role in negotiations and use COP26 to deliver solutions that also support biodiversity, such as dealing with global deforestation and land-use change.\~ Children view melting ice sculptures set to highlight the threat posed globally by climate change to healthy water supplies, near Tower Bridge in London on September 15. Photo: IC GT: The UK and China are important partners in climate change and biodiversity. What collaborations do you think the UK and China should work more on?\~ With the UK hosting COP26 and China hosting COP15, the UK and China have a unique opportunity to work together to protect our planet, our economies, and our livelihoods. Actually, the UK and China hold long standing collaborations on biodiversity protection and tackling climate change, as I outlined in the first question. The UK wants to work with China to build on this legacy. For example, we look forward to working with China even more closely on the impacts of forest-related commodities. We also hope to continue constructive collaboration between producer and consumer countries to tackle deforestation and biodiversity loss. Both our countries have a lot of expertise to share on biodiversity protection, technological innovation, and green finance, to name a few. We are open to working closely with China, particularly as you develop the tools and frameworks needed to meet the 2030 and 2060 targets.\~ The Scottish Government has been leading the "Edinburgh Process" of engagement with subnational and local governments to develop the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). I. To date, over 180 subnational and local governments have signed the Edinburgh Declaration, which sets out the commitments for the next 10 years. We hope local governments in China could sign the Declaration to achieve the ambitious GBF goal. China and the UK must continue to stand together as we support partners around the world in meeting their climate commitments, whilst leading by example on decarbonizing our own economies, making our air cleaner, and reducing reliance on coal.\~ Birds living in the wetland of Chongming island, Shanghai Photo: IC GT: Investment and collaboration in energy have been\~ important areas of the UK-China collaboration. Many international organizations have encouraged more investment in clean energy in emerging markets and developing economies. What UK-China collaboration should be strengthened in this area? What role do you think China's solutions could play in the UK's energy structure transition? As we recover from the coronavirus disease pandemic, it is essential that we build back better, and to base our recovery on solid foundations, including a greener and more resilient global economy. Our path to a zero carbon economy must also be fair and inclusive and create the global resilience we need to fight climate change.\~ The next decade will be make or break for our planet and the most powerful way we can make a difference is to end our reliance on coal.\~ There are strong economic arguments for moving now: to avoid burdening our future generations with the costs of early inaction; to help manage risks, such as those from increasing and fluctuating fossil fuel prices; to increase resilience to the impacts of climate change; and to seize the opportunities from new and emerging markets.\~ However, there remain important barriers. Developing countries seeking to increase their use of renewables often face high capital costs and need support to access finance. Coal-intensive economies also need support to overcome the technical and institutional lock-in of existing coal power, including the social challenge of winding down coal mining and transitioning coal-dependent regions. Over the last decade, the UK and China have built a strong bilateral energy relationship - supported by our Clean Energy Partnership and annual Ministerial Energy Dialogue.\~ The UK and China have worked together to drive down the costs of clean energy technologies worldwide and worked together to support our domestic energy transitions.\~ This has covered a range of sectors and supported engagement across all levels of society, bringing together policymakers, regulators, academics, and industry leaders, to help share best practice and support deeper collaboration.\~\~ As agreed during the 7th UK-China Ministerial Energy Dialogue held on 11 October, there is scope for deeper cooperation between the UK and China in priority clean energy technologies. This includes joint cooperation in third markets to support an accelerated global transition to clean energy. The DIT-NDRC MoU on Third-Party Market Cooperation signed in 2019 provides a framework to take forward this collaboration. As hosts of COP26 , the UK has also launched the Energy Transition Council to bring together the political, financial and technical leaders of the global power sector to work together to accelerate the transition from coal to clean power. China is very welcome to join this Council, to share China's expertise and support the delivery of fast-acting technical assistance to developing countries involved in the Council.\~\~ GT: You expressed in Bo£o that UK and China should continue their leadership in climate change and biodiversity. The UK has committed to doubling its International Climate Finance contribution to 11.6 billion pounds, with a focus on nature based solutions. Besides, the UK's Blue Belt Program helps protect the world's marine environment from human threats, including plastics. The UK has launched the new International Biodiversity Fund with an initial investment of 220 million pounds. What UK-China collaborations do we expect in green finance? Edinburgh Zoo's male giant panda, Yang Guang Photo: IC Wilson: Green Finance is one of the fastest growing sub-sectors of global finance and, despite intense competition, the UK is leading the way. We will work to increase funding for low-carbon resilient investments whilst also improving access to finance in developing countries. The UK's international climate finance has already supported over 100 countries and is helping to reduce or avoid a total of 16 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That is equivalent to taking 3.3 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. The UK and China have had a long-standing partnership on green finance since 2015, supported by the Vice-Premier level UK China Economic and Financial Dialogue. On the 10th "Dialogue" the UK and China reiterated their recognition of each other as their primary partner in green finance, for capital raising, product innovation, and thought leadership.\~ In August 2020, the UK committed to doubling international climate finance to help developing countries respond to climate change. As part of this, the British Embassy in Beijing has a flagship green finance program in China - UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (PACT) - which supports UK-China green finance partnership, and the post-COVID-19 green recovery. The program has already funded eight projects in China over the past two years. The UK recently announced mandatory disclosures of climate related risks, in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, for the majority of the economy by 2025; we encourage China to announce a similar goal, to empower its climate transition and ensure carbon neutrality goals are met. The UK will also be issuing green sovereign bonds. GT: Both the UK and China have ambitious climate targets. Climate negotiation is at the core of COP26 . What agreement on the global carbon market do you think countries including the UK and China will reach at COP26 ?\~ Wilson: At COP26 we must finalize the outstanding technical elements of the Paris Agreement, such as finding solutions on carbon markets and transparent reporting. We are accelerating collaboration between governments, business, and civil society to deliver on our climate goals faster.\~ This means bringing businesses and civil society on board, behind our COP26 goals, and building up international collaboration in critical sectors. Working through multilateral platforms and with developing countries to ensure all needs are met. GT: COP26 will discuss the acceleration of the market transition of electric vehicles and the UK government's commitment on zero emission by 2050. China is a major country manufacturing electronic automobiles. What role do you think Chinese companies could play in helping the UK meet the target of zero emissions? Wilson: If we are to meet Paris Agreement goals, we need to double the pace of the global transition to zero emission vehicles.\~ Following consultation, the British Prime Minister announced the ambitious date of 2030 for phasing out all new petrol and diesel cars and vans. Furthermore, from 2035, all new cars and vans sold in the UK will be fully zero emission vehicles. Bringing forward the phase-out date for all new cars and vans will reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster. It also puts the UK at the leading edge of the global transition with electric vehicles.\~ This new ambition is backed by a 2.8 billion pound package of measures to support industry and consumers to make the switch to cleaner vehicles. A detailed delivery plan will be published soon to stimulate both supply and demand for EVs.\~\~ If countries work together, and with business, to align their targets and actions, we multiply our impact numerous times. Making the transition to clean vehicles cheaper, faster, and easier for us all. That is why the UK's COP26 Presidency has been working with countries and businesses around the world, to convene some of the world's largest automotive markets and vehicle manufacturers in our COP26 Zero Emissions Vehicle Transition Council, to accelerate the move to clean vehicles. We welcome China in joining the Council's discussions.\~ Given the role a transition to zero emission vehicles will play in reaching wider climate goals, and UK-China leadership in this sector, our cooperation on zero emission vehicles is vitally important.\~ The UK has been working closely with Chinese organizations to support low carbon transition of the transport sector. We enjoy strong commercial cooperation in this sector as well. Chinese auto companies, including Geely, BYD, and most recently Envision AESC, have chosen the UK to set up their R&D centers, manufacturing facilities, and gigafactory to develop the next generation of products and technology. I expect this cooperation to remain strong in the future, evidenced by the recent MOU signing between China Automotive Technology and Research Centre (CATARC), the UK's Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) and the University of California, to set up a China-US-UK ZEV Policy Lab, which will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on zero emission vehicles between the three countries.\~ GT: COP15 will discuss the post 2020 global biodiversity framework. The Aichi Target was not met by many countries. What do you think the main reasons are? What areas do you think the UK and China could strengthen collaboration to support the world to meet the post 2020 framework targets? Wilson: Many countries lack the capacity and resources to implement the previous biodiversity targets. To achieve success in the next 10 years we need to move beyond a set of goals to a package of measures that supports implementation and requires accountability from countries, as well as measuring results.\~ The funding gap for biodiversity is the equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland and we need increased funding from all sources. But for any of this to work we need to stop investments and subsidies that harm biodiversity. We are pleased to hear Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcement of increasing funding for biodiversity and we look forward to working with China to understand more about how the Kunming Biodiversity Fund will be administered. Our government recently commissioned an independent report on the economics of biodiversity, led by British economist Partha Dasgupta and supported by an expert global panel including Professor Justin Lin from Peking University.\~ This report provides recommendations to ensure decision makers from all sectors can properly account for the value of nature and take steps to ensure a more sustainable relationship. We hope we can continue to work with China on this. \</doc>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I report, "Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis", which was released on Aug 9, is the most authoritative study on climate change, and will help improve global environmental governance and prompt countries to negotiate climate treaties. The IPCC report is expected to be high on the agenda of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, in October-November. Compared with the previous IPCC reports, the latest one emphasizes that many of the impacts of human activities on climate change are irreversible, indicating that the global fight against climate change needs to be strengthened to prevent further damage to the environment. Natural disasters and extreme weather events such as cyclones, unusually heavy downpours, record high temperatures and uncontrollable forest fires have become more frequent in recent years due to climate change. To combat climate change, the European Union, Canada, Chile, Fiji and other economies have enacted climate change policies and set specific carbon emission targets. On Sept 22, 2020, while addressing the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, President Xi Jinping said China will increase its nationally determined contributions (which according to the Paris Agreement embody a country's efforts to reduce national emissions and adapt to climate change), and take measures to ensure its carbon emissions peak before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality before 2060. Compared with other countries, China's intervening period between peak emissions and carbon neutrality is shorter. So China has to make arduous efforts to achieve the two goals. China has included the two goals into national development plans and policy documents, such as the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035; the Guiding Opinions on the Coordination and Strengthening of the Work related to Climate Change and Ecological Environment Protection; and the Notice on Implementing Pilot Environmental Impact Assessment of Carbon Emission of Construction Projects in Key Industries issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Also, some provinces have worked out road maps and action plans for reducing emissions. For example, Zhejiang province has devised a peak carbon neutralization scientific and technological innovation action plan, Hebei province has worked out a plan called "Measures for Coordinating and Strengthening Work Related to Climate Change and Ecological Environment Protection", and Chongqing municipality has made carbon emissions a part of the environmental impact evaluation and included it in the criteria to grant pollution discharge permits. China's national carbon emissions trading system, which officially started operations on July 16, has the potential to play a key role in achieving China's long-term climate goals\u-243 of peaking emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. Under the guidance of the government, Chinese companies are making greater efforts to reduce emissions, with many companies in the energy generating and household appliance manufacturing sectors working out their road maps to achieve their respective targets of carbon neutrality. And many retail companies and other organizations have introduced incentive plans to motivate consumers to buy energy-saving and low-carbon products to boost green consumption and encourage a low-carbon lifestyle. All this in order to help the country achieve its climate targets as soon as possible. To achieve "net-zero emissions", however, China will need to undergo a profound economic and social transformation. And to choose the right path to carbon neutrality, China should reform key industries such as energy, transportation and construction, modify the production and consumption structure, and upgrade the technological standards. As for specific measures, the role of the economy and the rule of law should be given full play by, for instance, improving laws, standard systems and government supervision, strengthening the market mechanisms including the green certificates and carbon emissions trading systems, and increasing publicity and education. To better tackle climate change, we need the joint efforts of governments, NGOs, businesses, and people around the world. However, due to their different interests, political systems and technology development levels, many countries have not taken adequate, effective measures to combat climate change. As Inger Anderson, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said at a news conference on Aug 9, only 110 of the 191 signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions ahead of the Glasgow climate conference. In addition, exchanges and cooperation among countries in terms of funding, technology and human resources related to climate change also need to be strengthened to boost the global fight against climate change.

China's national carbon emissions trading system, which officially started operations on July 16, has the potential to play a key role in achieving China's long-term climate goals\u-243 of peaking emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. Under the guidance of the government, Chinese companies are making greater efforts to reduce emissions, with many companies in the energy generating and household appliance manufacturing sectors working out their road maps to achieve their respective targets of carbon neutrality. And many retail companies and other organizations have introduced incentive plans to motivate consumers to buy energy-saving and low-carbon products to boost green consumption and encourage a low-carbon lifestyle. All this in order to help the country achieve its climate targets as soon as possible. To achieve "net-zero emissions", however, China will need to undergo a profound economic and social transformation. And to choose the right path to carbon neutrality, China should reform key industries such as energy, transportation and construction, modify the production and consumption structure, and upgrade the technological standards. As for specific measures, the role of the economy and the rule of law should be given full play by, for instance, improving laws, standard systems and government supervision, strengthening the market mechanisms including the green certificates and carbon emissions trading systems, and increasing publicity and education. To better tackle climate change, we need the joint efforts of governments, NGOs, businesses, and people around the world. However, due to their different interests, political systems and technology development levels, many countries have not taken adequate, effective measures to combat climate change. As Inger Anderson, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said at a news conference on Aug 9, only 110 of the 191 signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions ahead of the Glasgow climate conference. In addition, exchanges and cooperation among countries in terms of funding, technology and human resources related to climate change also need to be strengthened to boost the global fight against climate change. \</doc>

Representatives celebrating the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, December 12, 2015 Only 158 investment funds with just 0.5 percent of assets under management are currently in line with Paris accord goals of limiting the increase in global temperatures, according to a study released Wednesday. The nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) analyzed over 16,500 investment funds with $27 trillion in assets. But they found that more than 60 percent of assets are aligned with global warming of 2.75 C. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, nations agreed to try to keep the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C, with 1.5 C the preferred target to avoid dangerous changes in climate. The CDP tracks and rates the climate pledges of companies and the measures they have taken.\~ "Despite mounting net-zero commitments from the financial sector, and an apparent [sustainable finance] 'boom,' the truth is that not even 1 percent of fund assets are currently Paris-aligned," said Laurent Babikian, joint global director for capital markets at CDP. "This is like an x-ray on the industry, exposing almost all assets on the planet to be out of step with climate objectives," Babikian added. The report comes just days ahead of the COP26 climate summit, which is scheduled to take place from November 1 to 12, 2021 in Glasgow. Under the presidency of the UK, the Glasgow's COP26 climate meeting is being billed as crucial for the long-term viability of the Paris climate deal, as more studies have shown the world is far away from meeting the 1.5 C goal.

The political package that must be delivered in Glasgow needs to contain at least three key elements: emissions reduction, financing for climate action in developing countries, and climate adaptation, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday that the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, next month must be a turning point for climate action. " COP26 must be a turning point if we are to fulfill the promise of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, protect populations from the impacts of climate change and ensure that all financial flows are consistent with the goals of net-zero emissions and sustainable development," he told the sixth ministerial meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, in a video message. With COP26 fast approaching, he said, he remained genuinely concerned over the lack of progress on these priorities. The political package that must be delivered in Glasgow needs to contain at least three key elements: emissions reduction, financing for climate action in developing countries, and climate adaptation, he said. "First, we must swiftly close the emissions gap. That means national pledges must collectively put us on track to reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. And each country must be ready to update its climate commitments until we collectively get on track to reach the 1.5-degree objective," he said. Second, developed countries must close the finance gap by providing and exceeding the promised 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to developing countries for climate action, he said. "And this is just a starting point. Beyond that goal, all financial flows, public and private, must align with a net-zero emissions and resilient development pathway." Third, Glasgow must deliver a breakthrough on adaptation. Climate disruption is already here, affecting ever more lives and livelihoods every year, especially among the most vulnerable. Building resilience and adapting must be a priority for all, said Guterres. "I ask each of you in your national capacity and as shareholders of national and multilateral development banks to consider allocating half of all public climate finance in support of developing countries for adaptation. And I ask that you reconsider how you calculate gross domestic product. Nature's resources still do not figure in countries' calculations of wealth. We need nature-based solutions for adaptation and mitigation. The current system is weighted toward destruction, not preservation. Governments must reflect nature's true value in all policies, plans and economic systems," he said. As COVID-19 and climate change pose new and unique challenges to low- and middle-income countries, he asked the finance ministers to revise eligibility thresholds for official development assistance to improve access to finance for those countries. \</doc>

IN a call ahead of the UN COP26 climate conference in the U.K., Russia\' s President Vladimir Putin told Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the steps being taken to accelerate Russia\' s advance towards  net zero carbon emissions. Putin  expressed regret that he could not attend the Glasgow conference in person due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in Russia. The prime minister\' s office shared a read-out of the call, and noted that Johnson  hopes Russia will bring their goal of carbon-neutrality forward by a decade to 2050.  He [Johnson] welcomed the steps Russia has taken in recent days to commit [to] net-zero by 2060, the statement said.  The prime minister expressed his hope that Russia will raise that target to achieving net-zero by 2050 as well as making further progress on ending deforestation. A statement from the Kremlin in Moscow said Russia will send a delegation to COP26 in Glasgow, which  will contribute to the successful work of such an important international forum. But earlier on Monday, the U.K. leader admitted a much-needed international climate agreement is in doubt.  I\' m very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need, Johnson told a news conference, where questions were asked by local children, in 10 Downing Street.  It\' s touch and go, he added. However he did end on a positive note.  It\' s very, very difficult, but I think it can be done, he told the children. (SD-Agencies) \</doc>

Like any other part of the world, Africa has witnessed the devastating impact of climate change. The effect has been felt even more in Africa because of the continent\' s relatively poor infrastructure and large agricultural economy. As recent as June this year, floods believed to have been driven by climate change devastated parts of Kenya. They killed people, destroyed crops and threatened food security in the East African nation. This forced the Kenyan Government to move affected people to higher ground after they were submerged in the water. More than 1,619 hectares of land was reportedly swept over in the districts of Busia, Migori and Kisumu.  There is evidence that climate change has negatively affected the continent, which is agriculture-based. The unpredictability of the weather has negatively affected the continent. But that\' s not unique to Africa. The extent to which climate change affects a continent depends on its level of development. We are affected because we don\' t have infrastructure. We are affected because we are not in control of our own technologies. We have been underdeveloped for a long period of time, said Chris Malikane, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Malikane said climate change wreaks more havoc in Africa largely due to poor infrastructure than the forces of nature themselves.  Even the most advanced economy on the continent fails to do the elementary things like cleaning the water pipes in the cities and unblocking them. When climate change happens, we see flooding in the cities, and we say climate change is wreaking havoc in Africa; [but the reality is] that it\' s because of lack of infrastructure. If we had infrastructure, the impact of climate change would not be great. It would be similar to what you find in Europe, he added. A worldwide concern The impact of climate change, and how to reduce emissions, again came under the spotlight at the recently concluded 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, the UK. After intensive and protracted discussions on how best to tackle climate change and who must fund such programs, more than 200 countries reached an agreement which urged  developed countries to at least double their collective climate finance for adaptation in developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025, to ensure a balance between adaptation and mitigation. To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced to net zero by 2050, according to the United Nations. In his closing remarks, UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said,  The outcome of COP26 is a compromise. It reflects the interests, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. It is an important step, but it is not enough. A classic example of the COP26 contradictions Guterres is referring to is the $8.5-billion finance deal South Africa signed with Western powers aimed at speeding up its move away from coal-fired power stations. According to the deal, the U.S., the UK, France and Germany would mobilize the funds over a period of up to five years through a combination of grants and concessional financing. For its part, South Africa would push through its revised goal of reducing domestic carbon emissions to between 350-420 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement goals. South Africa\' s Dilemma However, the deal seems to be skewed in favor of Western powers whose economies are not dependent on coal supply. South Africa is one of the biggest coal producing countries whose economy and industrialization are anchored around fossil fuels. Mining is one of the biggest job creators and contributors to the country\' s gross domestic product. In addition, South Africa has the lowest carbon emission compared to the four Western powers. As Malikane put it,  South Africa is one of the biggest coal producers in the world. You have got towns built around coal. Our power system is coal-based. We are very much dependent on coal. We have just built power stations now - Kusile and Medupi - which are coal-based power stations.  In short, this agreement  has basically compromised the country\' s capacity or ability to use its natural resources for its own development. And it has compromised our ability to industrialize. Malikane maintained that while China and India owned some of the renewable energy technology, the majority of it was controlled by Western powers. This meant that the $8.5-billion deal would end up benefiting Western multinationals. South Africa\' s COP26 deal further appears to disregard the principles of just transitioning from fossil fuels and climate change. It also flies in the face of the country\' s own 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP2019) which includes coal, solar and nuclear, among others. Under the plan signed by South African Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe in October 2019, the country would pursue a  diversified energy mix with coal playing a central role.  Beyond Medupi and Kusile, coal will continue to play a significant role in electricity generation in South Africa in the foreseeable future as it is the largest base of the installed generation capacity and it makes up the largest share of energy generated. Due to the design life of the existing coal fleet and the abundance of coal resources, new investments will need to be made in more efficient coal technologies to comply with climate and environmental requirements, the IRP2019 states. Common but differentiated responsibility Like many other deals struck at COP26 , South Africa\' s agreement with Western powers has raised more questions than answers. Given what its own IRP2019 envisages, what changed between 2019 and now? Why suddenly move to renewable energy after investing billions in Medupi and others? What\' s the agenda of the developed countries that made the pledge? How many people are employed by renewable energy companies compared to coal mines? Who will build and operate solar energy plants? In the spirit of just transition and shared responsibility, the developed countries and the developing countries should have common but differentiated responsibilities. Western powers like the U.S., the UK, Germany and France should fund the emission reduction efforts of less developed countries like South Africa. \</doc>

(Xinhua/Han Yan)"We've been coming to the COP meetings ever so often. What we have seen is the leaders are making such good speeches ... but we cannot see commitment," Charles Nyambura, from Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), told Xinhua. Not far away from where Nyambura stood, the banners of COP26 were flapping wildly in the cutting gusty wind of Scotland.Nyambura, an observer of the conference, said rich countries who built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and accounted most for the climate crisis, have failed to deliver their promise of 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020, among other pledges."It is not about giving us money. It is about paying climate debt. We want to see our people supported to build their resilience to tackle climate change," Nyambura said.LIP SERVICENyambura is not alone in voicing his anger about the rhetoric by rich countries who failed to translate words into actions. Recent reports indicate that this goal of paying 100 billion dollars could slip to 2023.Meanwhile, developing countries, which often lack the resources and resilience to tackle the challenge, are suffering the most from the impacts of climate change.According to PACJA, one of the biggest civil societies in Africa campaigning for climate actions, many parts of Africa are experiencing higher-than-normal rainfall and ensuing flooding.

The 100 billion U.S. dollars a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries must become a 100 billion dollars climate finance reality," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his speech at the World Leaders Summit at COP26 ."This is critical to restoring trust and credibility," Guterres said.It is "pretty disheartening" that the developed countries have failed to deliver their promises under the Paris Agreement, which has damaged trust required for "a real partnership," Federica Bietta, managing director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, told Xinhua."The developing countries are coming forward with their own commitments, and with their own reductions. And so we need also the developed world to stick to their words," Bietta said."SHIFTING BLAME"A narrative among some Western media and politicians is that China is mainly responsible for the climate crisis as a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Observers are quick to point out that this is an approach by some Western countries, especially the United States, to shift blame."Western media and politicians are trying to shift responsibility for the future of the planet onto China ... This is nonsense," Carlos Martinez, a British author and political commentator, tweeted."China's per capita emissions are less than half those of the U.S.," said Martinez. "Unlike the West, China's emissions aren't driven by luxury lifestyles but by industry. Meaning the advanced countries have simply exported their emissions."Meanwhile, "China is making a concerted effort to reduce its reliance on coal," he said.China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics.The country is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranking first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction.Aerial photo taken on July 28, 2021 shows a view of the China-built Turgusun hydropower station on the Turgusun River near the city of Altai, Kazakhstan.

(Xinhua/Liu Xu)"China's target of achieving peak emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060 will be, by far, the fastest journey from carbon peak to carbon neutral in history," said Martinez, the British commentator."The focus needs to be on the developed countries meeting their responsibilities as the biggest contributors to cumulative emissions," he added.MULTILATERALISM MATTERS"When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription," Xi said in his statement.The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added."The essential thing we need to do is to uphold multilateralism. We need to start working together, stop playing blame games. Let's share resources in terms of research, in terms of development. Let's coordinate around how we can support developing countries, especially the least developed countries that don't have the financial and the infrastructure resources to reduce carbon emissions," Martinez told Xinhua.Antony Froggatt, deputy director of Environment and Society Programme Chatham House, a London-based think tank, also urged the world, especially the European Union, China and the United States, to work together for real progress in tackling climate change.The cooperation of the three parties is "essential" to cut costs of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, which enables other countries to access these technologies, he said.Political mutual trust between the wealthier and low income countries is essential for global cooperation on climate change, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore told Xinhua on Tuesday.Photo taken on May 27, 2021 shows the Kaposvar solar power plant in Kaposvar, Hungary. (Photo by Attila Volgyi/Xinhua)Countries that benefited from early industrialization processes have a responsibility to do more in solving the problems coming along with the heavy reliance on fossil fuels, said the prominent environmentalist, urging developed countries to deliver their promises and provide more assistance to low income countries as soon as possible.However, the world may not afford to wait for too long.

A tanker truck pours water into a man-made watering hole in the community of Pozones - one of the most affected by droughts caused by forest fires - near San Matias, Bolivia on October 16. Photo: AFP An overarching goal for the COP26 UN summit of "keeping alive" a 1.5 C limit on global warming is in jeopardy, with deep splits about what would signal its demise. Global average surface temperatures are already up about 1.1 C above pre-industrial times. And climate scientists say they will almost inevitably "overshoot" 1.5 C, the most ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, as planet-heating emissions rebound after a dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some nations, especially island states at risk of being swamped by rising seas, say reaching 1.5 C - in any year - would be the death knell of the iconic goal. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries formally aimed to limit warming to "well below" 2 C while "pursuing efforts" for 1.5 C. At-risk nations want far more action by major emitters to shift away from fossil fuels toward adopting more renewable energy sources. "Beyond 1.5 we cannot imagine a future. It is not a number for negotiation," said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's ambassador to the UN. Many vulnerable countries have campaigned for years with the slogan "1.5 to stay alive." But the world is slipping off track. "Overshoot is very likely unavoidable," said Johan Rockstr\'f6m, director of the Germany-based Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Deep cuts in emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels - twinned with mass plantings of trees that soak up carbon, and novel technologies for extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - could eventually turn down the global thermostat. "We have this delicate dilemma that it's really important for policymakers to aim for 1.5 - but that does not mean that we lose the world's future at 1.6 or 1.7," Rockstrom said. The Earth might be able to tolerate a brief overshoot, he said, before irreversible changes set in, such as the meltdown of Antarctica's ice sheet or mass collapse of coral reefs. "Every tenth of a degree matters," he said, adding that people, especially the young, would have "every reason to be angry" if temperatures rise 1.5 C. On the COP26 conference's website, the main goal listed by Britain is to "secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach." Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted at the start of the summit "Let's keep 1.5 alive # COP26 ." Britain has not defined what it means by "within reach" or "alive." The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in August that the 1.5 C goal is likely to be breached in the period 2021-40, even with steep cuts in emissions. On 'life support' At best, the 1.5 C goal "is on life support - it's in the ICU" (Intensive Care Unit), said Alden Meyer, of the E3G think tank. He said the lack of a clear definition may make it easier for Britain and other nations to claim success at the end of the COP26 summit, due to close on Friday, buoyed by pledges to phase out coal, cut methane emissions and halt deforestation, among others. "The window [for 1.5] is closing, but there is still time for us to act," said Alok Sharma, the British president of the talks, asked to define when the 1.5 C goal might be considered dead. He pointed to big progress in recent years. Before the 2015 Paris climate conference, he noted that one scientific projection showed the world was on track for a catastrophic 6 C of warming. After pledges for emissions cuts in Paris, that fell to about 4 C, he said. And last week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said new commitments in recent days, such as by India to reach net zero emissions by 2070, meant warming could be limited to 1.8 C by 2100. The IEA added a key caveat that the projection would require all national goals to be met "in full and on time," after years of failed promises. On Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker, a scientific research group, estimated the world was on track for a far higher 2.4 C of warming by 2100, based on national pledges for 2030 that are the building blocks of the Paris Agreement. "There is a massive credibility, action and commitment gap" at COP26 , it said. "Targets for 2030 remain totally inadequate." The UN says emissions would have to fall 7.6 percent a year this decade to get on track for the 1.5 C goal. Such a pace is unknown except during wartime, pandemics, recessions, and the smokestack industries. Greenhouse gas emissions tumbled by 5.4 percent in 2020 during lockdowns to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, close to the UN's recommended amount, but are on track to rebound by 4.9 percent in 2021, according to the Global Carbon Project. Technology illusion? Some environmental groups say the idea of overshooting the 1.5 C goal, and then reversing course, is a fantasy. "People who are talking about overshoots and having more time aren't serious about 1.5," said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. "Technologies that don't exist yet are not a way to keep it alive," she said. Emerging technologies include machines to suck carbon from the air, or to capture and bury emissions from power plants. Mohamed Adow, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said the world should keep working for 1.5 C, even if temperatures overshoot. "I can't imagine a time when we say we've given up on 1.5," he said. But all agree the opportunity to keep it in sight is shrinking fast. "Overshoot is not endless - probably 1.6, 1.7 maximum to get back down to 1.5 by the end of the century," said Niklas Hohne, founding partner of the NewClimate Institute. He added that governments were doing too little to curb emissions - putting the crucial target at risk. "For me, 1.5 would be dead if we continue on this trajectory for another five years, maximum," he warned. Reuters \</doc>

by Xinhua writer Guo Yage BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Rarely before have nations around the world needed to tackle so many overlapping and acute crises at the same time, and rarely before have the stakes been so high if humanity fails to join forces and act as one. In this age of untold turmoil and uncertainty, an effective leadership, like a compass for a vessel in a stormy sea, is of unspeakable importance. This is exactly what the global community is expecting from members of the Group of 20 (G20), as their leaders gather offline and online on Saturday and Sunday to discuss some of the most pressing common threats facing mankind, such as COVID-19, global economic recovery and climate change. Ending the pandemic is the top priority. To do that, the world's 20 major economies must come together and come up with concrete actions to address the world's widening vaccination gap. So far, three quarters of all vaccines have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries. While less than one in 10 health workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated, that rate in most high-income countries has reached more than 80 percent. Splashing water onto only a portion of a fire will never extinguish its flames. The same is true for the global fight against the virus and its cunning variants. Therefore, the G20 members should take the chance to speed up the implementation of the results of the Global Health Summit held in May, by jointly promoting vaccine production, increasing vaccine supplies to vulnerable nations, and supporting the vaccine-sharing program co-led by the World Health Organization. Besides, the leading players in the world should jointly reject any attempt to politicize, label or stigmatize the pandemic, which only harms the badly needed global solidarity and disrupts the world's collective drive to beat the disease. Promoting a more balanced and sustainable global economic recovery is another uphill task. Across the globe, supply disruptions and inflation are increasing downward pressure on the world economy, with the price of a basket of oil, coal and gas up by 95 percent since May. Employment in many economies is below pre-pandemic levels. And the gap between countries is still considerable. According to the latest World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund this month, the global economy is projected to grow 5.9 percent in 2021, 0.1 percentage point lower than the July forecast. Against such a gloomy backdrop, the G20 bloc, whose members account for 80 percent of global GDP, 75 percent of global exports, and 60 percent of the world population, must do more. In particular, the major economies should better coordinate with one another to make responsible macroeconomic policies and monetary decisions to avoid knock-on effects in global markets, facilitate the cross-border flow of people and goods, ensure the security and stability of the global economic and financial system as well as the industrial and supply chains, and advance structural reforms to help lift productivity. In so doing, the G20 members should also reject unilateralism and trade protectionism. The G20 mechanism was elevated to be the world's premier platform for international economic cooperation in 2008 and helped the world ride out the worst global financial crisis since the 1929 Great Depression. It can and should invigorate the global economy again. Last but not least, it is crucial for the G20 members to implement joint global governance in addressing imminent dangers threatening the survival of the human race, such as climate change and biodiversity loss. As this year's G20 summit is convened a day before the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, the pressing global climate challenges will surely top the two-day agenda for the G20 leaders. According to the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the amounts of warming gases in the atmosphere rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years, which will drive up temperatures in excess of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Just as Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, stressed that there is "no time to lose," the G20 economies should take the summit as a valuable opportunity to show the world not only their ambition for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and stimulating green development, but also a viable roadmap to achieve those goals. Ahead of the summit, China submitted two documents on its nationally determined contributions and long-term emission control strategies to the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is China's another concrete action in implementing the Paris Agreement and reflects Beijing's determination and efforts to pursue green and low-carbon development. While China is resolute to join the wider world to mitigate global warming, the Western countries, which are responsible for most of the historical emissions of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution, should shoulder their historical responsibilities and honor their international obligations. They should also do more to help developing countries via financial support and technology transfers, instead of playing zero-sum games. Humanity is once again standing at a critical crossroads. The whole world is watching whether the G20 members can stand together and lead the way. The clock is ticking. There is no time to waste. Enditem \</doc>

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Outside the venue of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, a group of African protesters could barely conceal their anger. "We've been coming to the COP meetings ever so often. What we have seen is the leaders are making such good speeches ... but we cannot see commitment," Charles Nyambura, from Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), told Xinhua. Not far away from where Nyambura stood, the banners of COP26 were flapping wildly in the cutting gusty wind of Scotland. Nyambura, an observer of the conference, said rich countries who built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and accounted most for the climate crisis, have failed to deliver their promise of 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020, among other pledges. "It is not about giving us money. It is about paying climate debt. We want to see our people supported to build their resilience to tackle climate change," Nyambura said. LIP SERVICE Nyambura is not alone in voicing his anger about the rhetoric by rich countries who failed to translate words into actions. Recent reports indicate that this goal of paying 100 billion dollars could slip to 2023. Meanwhile, developing countries, which often lack the resources and resilience to tackle the challenge, are suffering the most from the impacts of climate change. According to PACJA, one of the biggest civil societies in Africa campaigning for climate actions, many parts of Africa are experiencing higher-than-normal rainfall and ensuing flooding. In some countries like Madagascar, a prolonged drought and poor harvest, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have triggered a humanitarian crisis. "This COP must be a moment of solidarity. The 100 billion U.S. dollars a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries must become a 100 billion dollars climate finance reality," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his speech at the World Leaders Summit at COP26 . "This is critical to restoring trust and credibility," Guterres said. It is "pretty disheartening" that the developed countries have failed to deliver their promises under the Paris Agreement, which has damaged trust required for "a real partnership," Federica Bietta, managing director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, told Xinhua. "The developing countries are coming forward with their own commitments, and with their own reductions. And so we need also the developed world to stick to their words," Bietta said. "SHIFTING BLAME" A narrative among some Western media and politicians is that China is mainly responsible for the climate crisis as a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Observers are quick to point out that this is an approach by some Western countries, especially the United States, to shift blame. "Western media and politicians are trying to shift responsibility for the future of the planet onto China ... This is nonsense," Carlos Martinez, a British author and political commentator, tweeted. "China's per capita emissions are less than half those of the U.S.," said Martinez. "Unlike the West, China's emissions aren't driven by luxury lifestyles but by industry. Meaning the advanced countries have simply exported their emissions." Meanwhile, "China is making a concerted effort to reduce its reliance on coal," he said. China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics. The country is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranking first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction. Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under former President Donald Trump's administration has caused a complete waste of nearly five years the world could have devoted to a multilateral process to tackle climate change. Due to the disruption caused by the United States, countries across the globe now "must work harder together to catch up," Xie told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of COP26 . CHINA IN ACTION As the world's largest developing country that has yet to finalize industrialization, China has announced that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a written statement to the COP26 . Xi said China will roll out specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement, as well as supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, fiscal and taxation, and financial incentives. "These measures will form a '1+N' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint," Xi said. The country recently released an action plan for carbon dioxide peaking before 2030, as well as a document titled "Working Guidance For Carbon Dioxide Peaking And Carbon Neutrality In Full And Faithful Implementation Of The New Development Philosophy." "China's target of achieving peak emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060 will be, by far, the fastest journey from carbon peak to carbon neutral in history," said Martinez, the British commentator. "The focus needs to be on the developed countries meeting their responsibilities as the biggest contributors to cumulative emissions," he added. MULTILATERALISM MATTERS "When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription," Xi said in his statement. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added. "The essential thing we need to do is to uphold multilateralism. We need to start working together, stop playing blame games. Let's share resources in terms of research, in terms of development. Let's coordinate around how we can support developing countries, especially the least developed countries that don't have the financial and the infrastructure resources to reduce carbon emissions," Martinez told Xinhua. Antony Froggatt, deputy director of Environment and Society Programme Chatham House, a London-based think tank, also urged the world, especially the European Union, China and the United States, to work together for real progress in tackling climate change. The cooperation of the three parties is "essential" to cut costs of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, which enables other countries to access these technologies, he said. Political mutual trust between the wealthier and low income countries is essential for global cooperation on climate change, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore told Xinhua on Tuesday. Countries that benefited from early industrialization processes have a responsibility to do more in solving the problems coming along with the heavy reliance on fossil fuels, said the prominent environmentalist, urging developed countries to deliver their promises and provide more assistance to low income countries as soon as possible. However, the world may not afford to wait for too long. Just as protester Nyambura said, "We don't need more rhetoric. We just need you to act." Enditem \</doc>

On November 1, 2021, President Xi Jinping delivered a written speech at the World Leaders Summit at the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Noting that the adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action, Xi Jinping said, how to respond to climate change and revive the world economy are challenges of our times that we must meet. In this regard, Xi Jinping put forward three proposals. First, we need to uphold multilateral consensus. When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription. The UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow. Second, we need to focus on concrete actions. Visions will come true only when we act on them. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures. Developed countries should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better. Third, we need to accelerate the green transition. It is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade our energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern, promote a greener economy and society, and explore a new pathway forward that coordinates development with conservation. Xi Jinping emphasized, guided by the vision of a community of life for man and Nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects. We will speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. Recently, China released two directives: The Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful Implementation of the New Development Philosophy, and the Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030. Specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement will be rolled out, coupled with supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, finance and taxation, and financial incentives. Taken together, these measures will form a "1+N" policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint. Xi Jinping pointed out, ancient Chinese believe that "successful governance relies on solid action". China hopes all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all. The World Leaders Summit was held on the sidelines of the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow during November 1-2. \</doc>

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) aims to drive the world's green economy and stands ready to support members' investments to achieve climate goals, a senior executive has said. Speaking to Xinhua during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, Sir Danny Alexander, the AIIB's vice president for policy and strategy, said the bank plans to align all its operations with the targets of the Paris Agreement by July 1, 2023. Alexander stressed it's critical that the COP26 summit achieves big steps forward in terms of global commitments to actions on climate change, adding that it is already happening. The AIIB began operations in Beijing in 2016 and has since grown to 104 approved members worldwide. It is capitalized at 100 billion U.S. dollars and rated Triple-A by the major international credit rating agencies. "For AIIB as a multilateral institution, we stand ready to work with all of our member countries to support their investments to help achieve these crucial global goals......and we look forward to making a contribution to this global goal," Alexander said. He also highlighted that green investment is a crucial part of the economic recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Projects now have to "be able to be adapted and resilient to climate change in the future," the executive continued, adding that "climate change adaptation, making sure that people are protected from flooding, storms and so forth, is going to be a major demand for infrastructure in the years to come." By 2025, 50 percent of AIIB's financing will be climate finance, he added, referring to things such as renewable energy, which is "a huge issue for many societies in Asia." Enditem \</doc>

SYDNEY, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Grattan Institute, a policy think tank, published a report on Monday, suggesting that the Australian government would need to look to policy, not just technology, to reach its newly set 2050 zero emissions target. "The task cannot be achieved by governments alone -- it will require industries, markets, policies, and technologies working together," read the report. "Much of the technology and many of the tools needed are available now." The Australian government's emissions plan, released ahead of the COP26 Glasgow climate summit, fell under criticism for being vague, lacking concrete policy decisions, and being overly reliant on technology. The plan revealed that 70 percent of emissions reductions would come from technological developments, 15 percent of which was to be the result of "further technology breakthroughs" or, technology that doesn't yet exist. Tony Wood, Grattan Institute Energy and Climate Change policy director and lead author of the report, said that achieving net-zero could require "the biggest economic transformation Australia has seen outside of wartime." "Getting to net-zero by 2050 will be hard, but there is more to be gained than lost as Australia's economy transforms," said Wood. Wood said in order to minimize the cost and impact of Australia's transition, the government would need to stop propping up companies that are uncompetitive in a net-zero global economy, and rather attract investment to those that are conducive to it. "The federal government has finally set the objective. Our towards net-zero report series identifies the practical, no-regrets policies that can head Australia in the right direction," said Wood. The Institute's report was the final in a series of five reports released leading up to COP26 , with earlier reports outlining how Australia could adapt its transport, industrial, agriculture and electricity sectors for a net-zero world.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that the world is playing with fire and the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal is in danger. With the planet warming by as much as 1.2 degrees and climate disasters forcing 30 million to flee their homes, Guterres warned:  We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe. The goal to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, highlighted in the Paris Agreement on climate change and driven home at last November\' s COP26 gathering in Glasgow, is now on  life support and  in intensive care, the UN chief told the Economist Sustainability Summit. According to the top UN official, while some progress was made at COP26 last year,  the enormous emissions gap underscored the fact that  the main problem was not solved  it was not even properly addressed.  Keeping 1.5 alive requires a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by mid-century, he said. Based on current national commitments, however, global emissions are set to increase by almost 14 percent in the next eight years. Last year alone, global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 6 percent  to their highest levels in history, Guterres said, as coal emissions surged  to record highs.  In our globally connected world, no country and no corporation can insulate itself from these levels of chaos. Noting that developed and emerging G20 economies account for 80 percent of all global emissions, he drew attention to a high dependence on coal but underscored that  our planet can\' t afford a climate blame game. No finger pointing Referring to developed countries, Guterres said they must not put the onus on emerging economies to accelerate their transition nor should emerging economies respond by saying:  You exported carbon-intensive heavy industrial activities to us in return for cheaper goods.  We can\' t point fingers while the planet burns. Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use, Guterres insisted.  This is madness. As fossil-fuel reliance continues to put the global economy and energy security at the mercy of geopolitical shocks and crises, the timeline to cut emissions by 45 percent is extremely tight, he said.  Developed countries, multilateral development banks, private financial institutions and companies with the technical know-how all need to join forces to deliver support at scale and with speed to coal-intensive economies, he added. Although a  major challenge, developed and emerging economies must cooperate with each other for all G20 countries to deliver emission reductions. The secretary-general said that  even the most ambitious action cannot erase the fact that  the situation is already bad and in some places irreversible. \</doc>

China\' s climate envoy yesterday said the world\' s most populous nation would release its updated plans to reduce carbon emissions  in the near future as nations prepare to meet later this year for a pivotal global conference. Climate negotiators from 196 countries and the European Union as well as businesses, experts and world leaders will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, in November for the COP26 summit. The meeting is the crucial next step in getting the world\' s nations to agree to the kind of reduction in carbon emissions needed to stave off catastrophic global climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are meant to have submitted updated 2030 climate targets ahead of COP26 . Yesterday, China\' s top climate negotiator said Beijing\' s updated plans would soon be released, potentially before the Glasgow meet.  In the near future relevant policy papers will be out there. There will be detailed implementation plans, Xie Zhenhua told a webinar organized by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Then we\' re going to talk about that support to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, he added, according to a simultaneous English translation of his speech. The United Nations is pushing for a global coalition committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 which will cover all countries. China has said it will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060. The 2015 Paris Agreement adopted a collective promise to cap the planet\' s rising surface temperature at  well below 2 degrees Celsius and an aspirational limit on 1.5 degrees. Many scientists now say 1.5 degrees must be reached to effectively tackle climate change. \</doc>

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres remotely addresses the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate at UN Headquarters in New York, on Sept. 17, 2021. (Manuel Elias/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua) "Developed nations need to implement their promise to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year for climate action in the developing world from 2021 to 2025," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday urged rich countries to deliver the promised 100 billion U.S. dollars a year for climate action in developing countries. The top UN official told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York following the closing of the Informal Leaders Roundtable on Climate Action that the international community needs to deliver on three fronts including the rich states delivering "the promised 100 billion dollars a year for climate action in developing countries" on the way to the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, which will take place from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow of Britain. "Today, I asked leaders to do what is needed to make sure COP26 is a success and that it marks a true turning point," said the secretary-general. "Developed nations need to implement their promise to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year for climate action in the developing world from 2021 to 2025," Guterres further elaborated. "We failed in 2019 and 2020. OECD (the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) calculations say we are about 20 billion dollars short," he added. "Failure to fulfil this pledge would be a major source of the erosion of trust between developed and developing countries. Developed nations need to bridge this gap," the secretary-general noted. On the current climate change situation, the UN chief said that "to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, we need a 45 percent cut in emissions by 2030 so we can reach carbon neutrality by mid-century." "Instead, the commitments made until now by countries imply an increase of 16 percent in greenhouse gas emissions -- not a decrease of 45 percent -- an increase of 16 percent in greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels," he warned. Guterres said that "the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that the 1.5-degree goal is still in reach. But we need a dramatic improvement in Nationally Determined Contributions from most countries." On energy, the secretary-general said that "governments must shift subsidies away from fossil fuels and progressively phase out coal use." "If all planned coal power plants become operational, we will not only be clearly above 1.5 degrees -- we will be well above 2 degrees. The Paris targets would go up in smoke," said the UN chief. Guterres and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday held the closed-door Informal Climate Leaders Roundtable on Climate Action with a small but representative group of heads of state and government, on the sidelines of the General Assembly. The roundtable follows the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, signaling a "code red for humanity," and comes less than six weeks before the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. The roundtable addresses the gaps that remain on the actions urgently needed from national governments -- especially the G20 -- on mitigation, finance and adaptation. \</doc>

Britain said it planned to triple tree planting rates over the next three years to help reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as part of efforts to fight climate change. The UK wants to push ahead with its environmental plans and encourage other nations to do the same ahead of its hosting of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, known as COP26 , in November. George Eustice, UK environment secretary, is set to announce on Tuesday that woodland creation rates will triple by May 2024, with around 7,000 hectares of woodlands planted per year. "We will make sure that the right trees are planted in the right places and that more green jobs are created in the forestry sector," Eustice is due to say, according to a government statement published on Sunday. The statement gave no other details of the plan and did not say how many trees would be planted or where, and did not say how much the planting scheme would cost or how it would be funded. It also did not give a comparison figure for how many hectares of woodland had been planted previously. \</doc>

Nov. 9 --COFCO issued the following news release: welve of the world's biggest global agricultural trading and processing companies have issued a joint statement committing to a sectoral roadmap by COP27 for enhanced supply chain action consistent with a 1.5C pathway. The companies - COFCO International, ADM, Amaggi, Bunge, Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources, JBS, Louis Dreyfus Company, Olam, Wilmar, Marfig and Viterra - manage large global trade volumes in key agricultural commodities, including more than half of both Brazilian soy exports and global palm oil trade. The statement, announced at the World Leaders' Summit on Forests and Land Use at COP26 , signals a commitment to take urgent collective action to include other key stakeholders in their supply chains. The goal is to identify solutions at scale to further progress on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 23% of global GHG emissions are associated with land use, including11% of global GHG emissions from deforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems. The commitment from these companies builds on the existing initiatives to define a pathway to meet the 1.5C targets, working with other supply chain actors and governments. This collaboration will focus on how to scale up support and incentives for smallholders and farmers, increase traceability to indirect suppliers, and better track scope 3 emissions. The joint statement is supported by the Tropical Forest Alliance hosted by the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Ongoing collaboration continuing to COP27 will be supported by these actors. Alongside the announcement from these ten companies, a joint statement from 28 governments will be announced at COP26 via the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue Roadmap for Action. This joint statement calls for governments to increase sustainable Agri-commodity trade while protecting forests and other critical ecosystems. Recent evidence shows that there is no pathway to the 1.5C targets set out in the Paris Agreement without halting forest loss and improving the livelihoods of producers. The joint statement signals a recognition of the critical role played by businesses working in agricultural commodities. Source: COFCO \</doc>

President Xi Jinping emphasized on Monday the importance of upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions and accelerating the green transition in order to tackle climate change and revive the world economy. He made the remark in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 26 . The two-day summit kicked off on Monday in Glasgow, Scotland. "As we speak, the adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action. How to respond to climate change and revive the world economy are challenges of our times that we must meet," Xi said in the statement. He also said that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international climate cooperation. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP 26 in Glasgow, he said. According to Xi, parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver climate action measures. "Developed countries should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better," he said. Xi also emphasized the importance of harnessing innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resource sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption patterns. The president said that China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. China will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects, he said. Xi said that China will also speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. "I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all," he said. COP 26 is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Delegates are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions on climate change in the next two weeks.

Noting that they have further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis, the two countries said in the declaration that they are committed to tackling the crisis through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s, as well as through cooperation in multilateral processes, including the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process, to avoid catastrophic impacts. GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States on Wednesday released the China-U.S. Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s here at the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Noting that they have further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis, the two countries said in the declaration that they are committed to tackling the crisis through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s, as well as through cooperation in multilateral processes, including the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process, to avoid catastrophic impacts. The two sides also stressed the vital importance of closing the gap between efforts being made around the world and those that need to be taken to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. They declared their intention to work individually, jointly, and with other countries, in accordance with different national circumstances, to strengthen and accelerate climate action and cooperation aimed at closing the gap, including accelerating the green and low-carbon transition and climate technology innovation. In this aspect, their intended cooperation fields include regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the 2020s, maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition, policies to encourage decarbonization and electrification of end-use sectors, as well as key areas related to the circular economy, such as green design and renewable resource utilization. Recognizing specifically the significant role that emissions of methane play in increasing temperatures, both countries considered increased action to control and reduce such emissions to be a matter of necessity in the 2020s. On the other hand, to reduce CO2 emissions, the two countries said they intend to cooperate in such areas as policies that support the effective integration of high shares of low-cost intermittent renewable energy, transmission policies that encourage efficient balancing of electricity supply and demand across broad geographies, distributed generation policies that encourage integration of solar, storage, and other clean power solutions closer to electricity users, as well as energy efficiency policies and standards to reduce electricity waste. With respect to COP26 , both countries expressed support for an ambitious, balanced, and inclusive outcome on mitigation, adaptation, and support.

By Lin Boqiang | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-06 08:18 LI MIN/CHINA DAILY The ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, has been billed as a global effort to adapt to climate change. Global response is the only way to fight climate change, as it requires optimal allocation of global resources. Globalization of trade, too, is an optimal allocation of global resources, but with mainly economic interests. Fighting climate change is mainly about responsibility and contribution, so it needs global dialogue and cooperation. Indeed, the international community has no choice but to take concerted action, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and following a low-carbon development path. Otherwise, climate change could have a more devastating effect on international trade and commerce, which facilitate economic development, benefiting producers and consumers, and improving people's livelihoods worldwide. But the cost of reducing greenhouse gas, including carbon dioxide, emissions remains the biggest challenge for the world. Many countries, especially the developing ones, want to address climate change, but to do so they need funds, technologies and cooperation from other countries. As such, de-globalization and trade wars are the biggest threat to the global fight against climate change, as they undermine communication and cooperation among countries. Since many countries have not fixed a timeline for peaking their carbon emissions or achieving carbon neutrality, or made National Determined Contributions to global climate action under the Paris Agreement according to their actual capacity, many say the Glasgow conference is perhaps the last chance for countries to come together to combat climate change. The UN climate conference's aim is to meet the Paris Agreement goals, including limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 C, compared to the pre-industrial levels. But many analysts and climate activists are pessimistic about the success of the Glasgow conference, because they don't believe an agreement would be reached to achieve those goals. In fact, Alok Sharma, who was appointed president of the UN climate conference by the British government, has said:"This is definitely harder than Paris on lots of levels." And given the differences and varied interests of the 197 countries, it's not easy for them to reach a consensus on climate actions. Yet on this year's agenda are two key issues\u-243 "how do different countries fulfill their different carbon-cutting commitments" and "how can developed countries scale up financial and technical support to developing countries"\u-243 on which the countries couldn't reach a consensus at the last UN climate conference in 2019. For long, the most contentious issue at the climate talks has been the different emission-reduction obligations of developed and developing countries. Developed economies put emphasis on the current and future impacts of global warming, and want all countries to follow a universal emission-reduction policy while promising to cut as much emissions as possible. Developing countries, on their part, emphasize historical responsibility, and call for common but differentiated responsibilities\u-243 as enshrined in UN documents\u-243 because they cannot achieve the same emission-reduction target as developed countries for lack of funds or technologies, or both. That's why the two sides have failed to work out an effective solution. More important, developed countries have not fulfilled their commitment to provide financial and technological support to developing ones. At the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, rich nations pledged to channel $100 billion a year to developing countries by 2020, in order to help them adapt to and mitigate further rise in temperature. But an OECD report in September said the developed countries had contributed only about $80 billion to their developing counterparts by last year. Some developed countries don't think they have the responsibility to help low-income countries adapt to climate change and mitigate potential temperature rise after 2020, which will make climate-vulnerable countries even more vulnerable and helpless. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing global uncertainties have prevented many countries from setting ambitious emission-reduction targets. And until the pandemic is contained worldwide, global economic and scientific cooperation, including taking effective climate action, may not be possible. The pandemic has increased developing countries' financial burden and hindered their efforts to cut emissions. Worse, many low-income economies, which are at a crucial stage of their development, face economic recession due to the pandemic. So they cannot balance development and climate action, because doing so would mean compromising on poverty alleviation, job creation, livelihood improvement, which will make it more difficult for them to contribute to global climate action in the future. Also, developing economies are reluctant to shun coal. More than 35 percent of electricity generation worldwide is from coal, with most of the coal-fired power plants being in developing countries. That's because the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy requires huge funds and advanced technologies, neither of which developing countries have. But despite the developing countries not giving up coal, China has announced it will stop funding coal projects overseas. No country alone can tackle climate change, or is immune to the impacts of global warming. Only global efforts, especially by the developed economies, can mitigate the impacts of climate change. Therefore, the Glasgow climate conference should urge the developed world to honor its commitments and help the developing countries with the required funds and technologies to fight climate change.

As we approach the United Nations Climate Change Conference amid the growing imperatives for sustainable development and climate action, the international community must make the most of the opportunity to ensure ambitious results in Glasgow, the conference venue, and beyond. As a long-time champion of the environmental agenda and an agri-food powerhouse, Brazil stands ready to make positive contributions to the collective efforts aimed at keeping global temperature within the limits agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. Over the last 50 years, Brazil has transformed from a net food importer to the world's third-largest agricultural exporter, while using only a fraction of its territory for agriculture and preserving over two-thirds of its native vegetation. In a world under increasing pressure to meet the growing global demand for food in a sustainable way, this success stands as a uniquely singular achievement. Investments in science and technology, and efforts to promote innovation have been at the heart of Brazil's agricultural revolution. The adaptation of plant and animal varieties to the tropics has diversified production. The development of integrated crop-livestock-forest systems, with the rotation of grains, beef and planted forests, has made it possible to produce two, sometimes three harvests a year on the same land. As a result, grain production since the late 1970s has increased by more than 420 percent, while the cultivated area has grown by just over 40 percent. These advances have brought enormous social, economic and environmental benefits to Brazil. Agriculture is now the most dynamic sector of the Brazilian economy, directly responsible for more than 18 million jobs and about 20 percent of GDP. The cost of food has been halved compared with the 1970s, and economic and social development has reached the rural interiors of the country. And the cities where agricultural activities are concentrated are among those with the highest human development index. In livestock production, results are no less impressive. Over the past 20 years, extraordinary productivity gains have drastically reduced emissions per unit of beef and milk produced, and sustainable intensification techniques now allow for the full offset of remaining emissions, resulting in carbon neutral beef, a product already available in the Brazilian market. This is the successful trajectory Brazil relies on to build the sustainable agriculture of the future and meet its development and climate goals. Building on this progress will require greater emphasis on international diplomacy, collaboration and partnerships. Only enhanced international cooperation can offer an avenue for ambitious collective action. In the coming years, the expansion of low carbon agriculture will continue to usher in additional productivity gains. The restoration of degraded pastures, of which there are almost 100 million hectares in Brazil, will enable further production increases while reducing pressure for conversion of new areas into agriculture. Technological innovations such as gene editing, digital agriculture and bio-inputs will pave the way for Brazil to continue growing the supply of healthy, affordable food to the world, in a competitive and sustainable way. Brazil's track record in agriculture, however, is only a part of the story. As a developing country, Brazil still faces a critical challenge: promoting sustainable development in the Amazon biome, an area larger than the European Union that is home to more than 23 million Brazilian citizens, most of whom live below the poverty line. In recent decades, a historical process of informal territorial occupation coupled with limited economic alternatives has led to the occurrence of illegal mining, land grabbing and deforestation. Brazil recognizes this reality and is taking steps to address the problem. In April 2021, at the Leader's Summit on Climate, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro committed to Brazil achieving climate neutrality by 2050\u-243 10 years sooner than originally intended\u-243 and ending illegal deforestation by 2030. Since then, the government has redoubled efforts to combat environmental crime and positive numbers have begun to emerge. Ensuring the protection of public lands, enforcing environmental legislation and concluding the region's territorial planning are at the core of Brazil's strategy for the Amazon. HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202110/27/61789f4ba31019b094bd911f.png Link to Image Through its environmental regulations, Brazil has imposed considerable restrictions on land use and exploitation of natural resources in the Amazon. At present, a vast majority of the biome is formally protected either in indigenous territories, environmental conservation areas, or on private lands, where Brazil's rigorous Forest Code stipulates that 80 percent of the property area must be preserved with native vegetation. This represents a significant contribution to the world in terms of environmental conservation and climate action. The economic cost of renouncing the use of such resources must be objectively recognized, and sustainable development opportunities must be offered to the region's inhabitants. Completing negotiations on the Paris Agreement Rulebook will be crucial for creating such opportunities. As a large exporter of agricultural products, Brazil has developed a strong awareness of the role agriculture can play in promoting economic growth and social inclusion, and producing positive environmental outcomes. But we are also keenly aware of its particular vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and the risks those pose to global food security. Through open and transparent dialogue, shared goals can be identified and used as the basis for a new development cycle that will realize the socioeconomic promise of sustainable development while safeguarding environmental wealth for future generations. A constructive vision, based on scientific evidence, partnership, and respect for national legislation, is the surest way to build the sustainable future we want. We invite all to embrace this vision. Brazil is ready to do its part. Tereza Cristina is Brazil's minister of agriculture, livestock and food supply, and Joaquim Leite is minister of the environment.

A pall of acrid smoke from suburban forest fires descended on Athens at the start of August as Greece suffered its worst heat wave in decades, prompting its prime minister to declare that climate change had turned his country into a powder keg. It was one of a series of extreme weather events around the world that added weight to the UN's latest climate warning that things will get much worse if governments do not take drastic action. The deadly floods last month struck countries as far apart as Germany and China. Temperatures in Moscow earlier hit a record high, after a winter that saw extreme lows hit North America and topple the power grid in Texas. The extreme weather provided the backdrop to the Aug 9 launch of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the most extensive so far from the United Nations agency. The report said humanity's damaging impact on the global climate was now an established fact, and warned that continuing emissions of greenhouse gases could force sea levels to rise by up to two meters by the end of the century. The authors said that global surface temperatures had risen faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years. They also concluded that some of the changes to planetary climate systems were already irreversible. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the findings as a code red for humanity and showed there was no time for delay to avert a climate catastrophe. The report will put further pressure on delegates to the international COP26 climate talks that the UK government will be hosting in Glasgow in November. Alok Sharma, the UK minister in charge of the event, has warned that the failure of the talks would be catastrophic. "You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world," Sharma said. "Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record." Climate scientists are always cautious about linking any single extreme weather event to global warming and focus on tracking trends. However, this year's series of catastrophic events may reinforce the impact of the latest warnings on the public consciousness and could increase popular pressure on governments to boost active measures. The latest evidence of man-made climate change may also dent the influence of so-called climate skeptics, who continue to deny the link between greenhouse gases and extreme weather events. A recent study from the University of Oregon in the US found that committed climate change deniers were unlikely to change their minds on the basis of the latest evidence. However, moderate skeptics were highly likely to change their beliefs once given more evidence of recorded temperature change. The report's author, Grant McDermott, said one implication of the findings was that "if you're trying to think about who to target with messaging to persuade people that climate change is a real and observable phenomenon, you should just accept that some people you're just not going to convince". A 2019 poll showed that the US, a leading polluter, has by far the largest population of climate change skeptics, with 15 percent of people believing either that the climate is not changing at all, or that it is not changing due to human causes. It was a skepticism reflected by former US president Donald Trump, who abandoned US support for international efforts to fight climate change. Under his successor, Joe Biden, the US plans to take a more active role at COP26 . US delegate John Kerry has urged all countries to step up and do their part. Despite outstanding diplomatic issues between the US and China, the world's top carbon emitters, the climate lobby is hoping to see progress between the two at the Glasgow talks. When President Xi Jinping announced at the UN last year that China planned to cap its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the initiative was described as monumental. Beijing's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said this month that China would soon release updated plans to reduce carbon emissions ahead of the COP26 . Climate negotiators from 196 countries, plus the European Union, will join business leaders, climate experts and world leaders at the Glasgow conference. Their task, after a year of climate extremes, will be to confront a challenge that COP26 's UK host Sharma believes may be the last chance to save the planet.

Concerning to its supply and demand structures, energy mix and financial structure, China has been attaching more importance to carbon emissions. According to statistics, the developed countries peaked carbon dioxide emissions only when their per capita GDP reached $30,000 to $40,000. However, China's per capita GDP only exceeded $10,000 last year. It is estimated that if the economy maintains a growth rate of 5-6 percent, China's carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030, when its per capita GDP is expected to exceed $20,000, far less than that of developed countries. China's carbon neutrality goal is thus confronted with the challenge of its economic transition. Another challenge for China is its energy transition. Developed countries all experienced a transition from coal to oil and gas, and then to new energies such as wind and solar power, while China's own energy structure is rich in coal, poor in oil and low in gas. Last year, China's energy consumption was the largest in the world, with 5 billion metric tons of standard coal consumed. Its carbon emissions, accordingly, were the largest too, amounting to 10 billion tons. China's energy structure also has a very high rate of dependency on foreign oil and natural gas, 73 percent and 43 percent respectively. As the world's largest carbon emitter\u-243 China emitted 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide last year\u-243 taking 30 to 40 years to achieve carbon neutrality is definitely a huge challenge. The world is currently undergoing a third industrial revolution featuring new energy, biotechnology and IT technology. The two previous industrial revolutions shared the similarity that each industrial revolution resulted from the coordinated development of energy innovation, industrial innovation and financial innovation. China's photovoltaic industry has the competitive advantage of an entire industrial chain. In the past three years, China has invested in and constructed 60 percent of the world's new wind, hydro and photovoltaic power facilities. In terms of energy transmission, China's four-vertical and six-horizontal UHV grids form a long-distance, large-capacity, low-loss UHV grid system that can transmit new energy from North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China to the most developed and core areas of China's economy, that is, East China and South China, at a lower cost. Meanwhile, China's new energy vehicles and energy storage industries are developing by leaps and bounds. China's vast market, abundant new energy resources, mature industrial chain and world-class companies are promoting the development of its new energy industries. Moreover, the carbon market and green financial market are also facilitating the third industrial revolution in the country. According to calculations by multiple institutions, China's carbon neutrality requires investment of more than 100 trillion yuan ($15.7 trillion). It, thus, needs to have an incentive mechanism to guide investment, stabilize expectations and realize price finding. The answer is the carbon market. From 2005 to 2012, China's carbon market was mainly focused on the CDM(Clean Development Mechanism) market. From 2013 to the end of 2020, carbon emissions trading pilots were conducted in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong province, Hubei province, Shenzhen in Guangdong province, and later in Fujian province. Since 2021, the power industry nationwide has pioneered a unified carbon market. As of Dec 31, 2021, the cumulative trading volume of Chinese Emission Allowances (CEA) was 179 million tons, the cumulative trading turnover was 7.661 billion yuan, and the average price was 42.79 yuan. In 2020, the European Union's carbon market had a trading volume of 8.1 billion tons, a turnover of 201 billion euros ($227.5 billion), with a transaction price of 24 euros and a turnover rate of 400 percent. Today its highest price has exceeded 80 euros. China's carbon market has yet to be improved in terms of transaction volume, transaction price, liquidity, or investment and financing functions. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow reached an important consensus on establishing a globally unified market mechanism for sustainable development. Once such a system is established, it will attract substantial amounts of capital, technology, investors and practitioners to participate in the global carbon market. However, developed economies such as the EU and the United States are planning to advance the carbon border adjustment mechanism, commonly known as carbon tariffs. The EU plans to levy carbon tariffs from Jan 1, 2025. Once they are officially launched, the EU will lay taxes on the carbon content of imported goods. This move is supported and will probably be echoed by the US. The scale of China's carbon market will then gradually expand from the power industry to seven other industries\u-243 petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, nonferrous metals, papermaking, and aviation\u-243 with the quota possibly expanding from the current 4.5 billion tons to 7-8 billion tons. According to the current carbon price, the total assets of China's carbon market may reach 400-500 billion yuan in the future. The market entities in China's carbon market will become more diversified, because only with market entities with different risk appetites, diverse expectations, and various sources of information, can we discover fair market prices. At the end of 2021, in the international carbon trading market, the transaction settlement price of UK Allowance Futures was 87.71 euros and that of European Union Allowances Futures was 80.11 euros. In the long run, there will be a free international flow of carbon emission rights due to the global externalities of climate change. And the carbon price in China will converge with that in the international carbon market. In the future, the scale, price, liquidity, and investment and financing functions of China's carbon market can all help China to seize the great historic opportunities of the third industrial revolution and the energy revolution, promoting China's long-term economic growth. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202201/06/61d61de9a310826763e10071.png Link to Image LI MIN/CHINA DAILY \~ \~ The author is general manager of Beijing Green Exchange and secretary general of Beijing Green Finance Association. \</doc>

WARSAW, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- China plays a key role in enabling large scale and lower cost production of green technologies that support the energy transition, contributing to the combat against global warming, the head of a leading Polish think tank told Xinhua ahead of COP26 in Britain. According to Piotr Arak, director of the Polish Economic Institute (PIE), China's production capabilities have already contributed to lowering the cost of solar panels to one eighth of what it was in 2008. "If you have technological advantages and can bring down the marginal price of green energy products for the end consumer, it would give us the possibility to adapt to possible spikes of energy use in the future," he said. Arak said that decreasing prices for consumers would help the greening of the general energy mix as well. "For both China and Poland, countries with a similar energy mix, meaning with a limited access to gas and the like, it could solve some of the challenges going forward." More affordable technology would be a great help for Poland, whose energy transition would be one of the most challenging in Europe. Even using transitional sources, attaining the COP26 goals would mean Poland would need to invest 136 billion euros (157 billion U.S. dollars) by 2030, and over one trillion euros (1.16 trillion U.S. dollars) by 2040. "Poland needs to do a more rapid energy transition than any other country in Europe," he said. It is important for Poland to meet its climate goal, which is to eliminate coal as an energy source as quickly as possible. Around 80 percent of the country's power production is sourced from coal, according to figures from the Polish Geological Institute. Coal is also a mainstay fuel to heat Polish houses, especially in suburban and rural areas, Arak said. "It has an enormous influence on the air quality." However, replacing coals with pure renewables is not realistic for Poland, Arak said. "We don't get enough sunlight, wind or hydropower for that. Renewables can therefore only be a part of the energy mix here, at least at the current technology level." \</doc>

MORE than 120 world leaders were meeting in Glasgow in a  last, best hope to tackle the climate crisis and avert a looming global disaster.  It\' s one minute to midnight and we need to act now, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due to tell them, according to extracts from his speech.  If we don\' t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow. Observers had hoped a weekend meeting in Rome of leaders of the G20 nations, which between them emit nearly 80 percent of global carbon emissions, would give a strong impetus to the Glasgow COP26 summit, which was postponed for a year due to the pandemic. The G20 major economies committed on Sunday to the key goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  the most ambitious target of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. They also agreed to end funding for new unabated coal plants abroad  those whose emissions have not gone through any filtering process  by the end of 2021. But this did not convince NGOs, the British prime minister or the United Nations.  While I welcome the G20\' s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled but at least they are not buried, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Twitter.  We\' ve inched forward (at the G20). We\' ve put ourselves in a reasonable position for COP in Glasgow but it\' s going to be very difficult in the next few days, Johnson said before warning:  If Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails. The Glasgow gathering, which runs until November 12, comes as an accelerating onslaught of extreme weather events across the world underscores the devastating impacts of climate change from 150 years of burning fossil fuels. The current commitments of the signatories of the Paris agreement  if they were followed  would still lead to a  catastrophic warming of 2.7 Celsius, according to the UN. COP26 marks the  last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach, summit president Alok Sharma said as he opened the meeting on Sunday.  If we act now and we act together, we can protect our precious planet, he said. \</doc>

By Mei Dewen | China Daily | Updated: 2022-03-06 15:59 China's carbon market will help it seize the opportunities of the third industrial revolution and the energy transition Concerning to its supply and demand structures, energy mix and financial structure, China has been attaching more importance to carbon emissions. According to statistics, the developed countries peaked carbon dioxide emissions only when their per capita GDP reached $30,000 to $40,000. However, China's per capita GDP only exceeded $10,000 last year. It is estimated that if the economy maintains a growth rate of 5-6 percent, China's carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030, when its per capita GDP is expected to exceed $20,000, far less than that of developed countries. China's carbon neutrality goal is thus confronted with the challenge of its economic transition. Another challenge for China is its energy transition. Developed countries all experienced a transition from coal to oil and gas, and then to new energies such as wind and solar power, while China's own energy structure is rich in coal, poor in oil and low in gas.Last year, China's energy consumption was the largest in the world, with 5 billion metric tons of standard coal consumed. Its carbon emissions, accordingly, were the largest too, amounting to 10 billion tons. China's energy structure also has a very high rate of dependency on foreign oil and natural gas, 73 percent and 43 percent respectively. As the world's largest carbon emitter\u-243 China emitted 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide last year\u-243 taking 30 to 40 years to achieve carbon neutrality is definitely a huge challenge. The world is currently undergoing a third industrial revolution featuring new energy, biotechnology and IT technology. The two previous industrial revolutions shared the similarity that each industrial revolution resulted from the coordinated development of energy innovation, industrial innovation and financial innovation. China's photovoltaic industry has the competitive advantage of an entire industrial chain. In the past three years, China has invested in and constructed 60 percent of the world's new wind, hydro and photovoltaic power facilities.In terms of energy transmission, China's four-vertical and six-horizontal UHV grids form a long-distance, large-capacity, low-loss UHV grid system that can transmit new energy from North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China to the most developed and core areas of China's economy, that is, East China and South China, at a lower cost. Meanwhile, China's new energy vehicles and energy storage industries are developing by leaps and bounds. China's vast market, abundant new energy resources, mature industrial chain and world-class companies are promoting the development of its new energy industries. Moreover, the carbon market and green financial market are also facilitating the third industrial revolution in the country. According to calculations by multiple institutions, China's carbon neutrality requires investment of more than 100 trillion yuan ($15.7 trillion). It, thus, needs to have an incentive mechanism to guide investment, stabilize expectations and realize price finding.The answer is the carbon market. From 2005 to 2012, China's carbon market was mainly focused on the CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) market. From 2013 to the end of 2020, carbon emissions trading pilots were conducted in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong province, Hubei province, Shenzhen in Guangdong province, and later in Fujian province. Since 2021, the power industry nationwide has pioneered a unified carbon market. As of Dec 31, 2021, the cumulative trading volume of Chinese Emission Allowances (CEA)was 179 million tons, the cumulative trading turnover was 7.661 billion yuan, and the average price was 42.79 yuan. In 2020, the European Union's carbon market had a trading volume of 8.1 billion tons, a turnover of 201 billion euros ($227.5 billion), with a transaction price of 24 euros and a turnover rate of 400 percent. Today its highest price has exceeded 80 euros.China's carbon market has yet to be improved in terms of transaction volume, transaction price, liquidity, or investment and financing functions. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow reached an important consensus on establishing a globally unified market mechanism for sustainable development. Once such a system is established, it will attract substantial amounts of capital, technology, investors and practitioners to participate in the global carbon market. However, developed economies such as the EU and the United States are planning to advance the carbon border adjustment mechanism, commonly known as carbon tariffs. The EU plans to levy carbon tariffs from Jan 1, 2025. Once they are officially launched, the EU will lay taxes on the carbon content of imported goods. This move is supported and will probably be echoed by the US. The scale of China's carbon market will then gradually expand from the power industry to seven other industries\u-243 petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, nonferrous metals, papermaking, and aviation\u-243 with the quota possibly expanding from the current 4.5 billion tons to 7-8 billion tons. According to the current carbon price, the total assets of China's carbon market may reach 400-500 billion yuan in the future.The market entities in China's carbon market will become more diversified, because only with market entities with different risk appetites, diverse expectations, and various sources of information, can we discover fair market prices. At the end of 2021, in the international carbon trading market, the transaction settlement price of UK Allowance Futures was 87.71 euros and that of European Union Allowances Futures was 80.11 euros. In the long run, there will be a free international flow of carbon emission rights due to the global externalities of climate change.And the carbon price in China will converge with that in the international carbon market. In the future, the scale, price, liquidity, and investment and financing functions of China's carbon market can all help China to seize the great historic opportunities of the third industrial revolution and the energy revolution, promoting China's long-term economic growth.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) have agreed to transform their economies to promote sustainable development, deliver decent green jobs and build resilience, according to a communique released on Friday. The document was released after the G7 ministers responsible for climate and environment met virtually on May 20 to 21. "We will do this by building back better from the pandemic, and we stress our determination to put climate, biodiversity, and the environment at the heart of our COVID-19 recovery strategies and investments. In doing so, we will transform our economies to promote sustainable development," they said in the document. Regarding deforestation and forest degradation, the ministers said, "We commit to urgent action to conserve, protect and restore natural ecosystems including forests and habitat connectivity and promote sustainable forest management. We also commit to implement decarbonization pathways that do not cause further biodiversity loss or deforestation." The G7 has also agreed to increase the quantity of finance for climate action, including for nature, in order to meet the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar per annum target to support developing countries. "As we recover from the pandemic we are focused on building back greener -- creating jobs and prosperity, without harming the planet," said Alok Sharma, the president-designate of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), in a statement. The international community, including both developing and developed countries, already recognized the importance of joining hands in tackling climate change. In 2021, China and Britain will host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) and the COP26 , respectively. Enditem \</doc>

By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-03-23 08:56 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the world is "sleepwalking to climate catastrophe" because of slow action on emissions and a continued reliance on fossil fuels. Guterres said that the Paris Agreement goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius is "on life support", and called out leaders in rich countries for shifting blame onto emerging economies, and vice-versa. "This is madness," Guterres told the Economist Sustainability Summit in London. "Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction." Guterres said that some progress was made at the UN climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow last November, including agreements to end deforestation, reduce methane emissions and mobilize private finance. "But the main problem was not solved," he said. "It was not even properly addressed, and that problem is the enormous emissions gap." Experts estimate that limiting warming at 1.5 degrees will require a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by mid-century. Guterres said that current national commitments for reductions will lead to a 14 percent increase in emissions during the 2020s. "That problem was not solved in Glasgow. In fact, the problem is getting worse," he said. Guterres also addressed a common cause of conflict during negotiations at COP26 , where rich nations pointed to high emissions in emerging economies that are still undergoing industrialization, while developing nations focused on the historical emissions burden of developed regions. "If this goes on, there are no winners in a blame game," Guterres said. "We can't point fingers while the planet burns." Guterres advocated the formation of coalitions to provide major emerging economies with resources and technology to accelerate their transition from coal to renewable energy. He said that such an effort was underway in South Africa, which is among the most coal-dependent nations in the G20 group of economies. In November, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom announced the International Just Energy Transition Partnership, through which partner countries will support decarbonization in South Africa. "And the pieces are coming into place for coalitions in Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere," said Guterres, who also singled out the 2021 commitment by China to cease investment in overseas coal projects as a positive development. Guterres made his comments days after scientists confirmed record-breaking temperatures in parts of the Antarctic. "East Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, is experiencing an incredible heatwave unlike any ever observed," said Renato Colucci, a climatologist at Severe Weather Europe. Temperatures at Concordia Research Station on the southern continent reached minus 12.2 degrees Celsius on Friday, the highest temperature since records began, and about 40 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year. \</doc>

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-06-25 10:13 Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks with an Environment Agency worker during his visit to a storm basin near the River Mersey in Didsbury, Manchester, Britain January 21, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Committee warns time is running out if changes are to come before COP26 The United Kingdom government's independent environmental advice committee has issued stinging criticism of its policy toward reducing carbon emissions, saying it is "hard to discern any comprehensive strategy in the climate plans we have seen in the past 12 months". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and he has regularly spoken about the importance of environmental policy in the country's post-pandemic recovery, but John Gummer, chair of the Climate Change Committee, said "the delivery has just not been there". The timing and content of the annual report on the progress of steps toward decarbonization is particularly embarrassing for the government with the clock ticking down toward its hosting of the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. "This defining year for the UK's climate credentials has been marred by uncertainty and delay to a host of new climate strategies," the report added. "Those that have emerged have too often missed the mark. With every month of inaction, it is harder for the UK to get on track." The committee's report did acknowledge progress had been made in decarbonizing the power industry, but the picture was less positive when it came to buildings and surface transport, the two biggest contributors to carbon emissions. Overall, UK carbon emissions were reduced by around 13 percent last year, but much of this is attributable to how the pandemic reduced the amount of journeys people made, rather than anything more substantial, so that reduction cannot be relied on to continue. The Financial Times quoted committee chief executive Chris Stark as saying targets "are not going to be achieved by magic  we are very concerned about where things stand". In reply, a government spokesperson said relevant policies would be coming soon, with actions to back up words. "Our forthcoming strategies on heat and buildings, hydrogen, transport and comprehensive net zero strategy this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change," they said. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said the report's conclusions demonstrate that contingency plans for climate shocks were "not high enough on the agenda". Jess Ralston, of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told Sky News that a clear plan of action was needed to show Britain was taking the hosting of COP26 seriously, but time was running out. "This year is the government's chance to prove to the world that they are not just talking about this, they are delivering on it as well," she said. "If we don't take action now, we risk falling to the back of the pack on tackling climate change. We also risk missing out on new lifelong jobs in green industries, which are the future of the UK." \</doc>

NAIROBI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- The international community should honor financial pledges to support climate adaptation in Africa alongside debt relief as a means to secure a green and inclusive future for the continent, campaigners said on Tuesday. Speaking on the sidelines of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) underway in Glasgow, Scotland, the campaigners stressed that adequate financing, technologies and debt relief were a prerequisite in order to hasten green recovery in a continent reeling from extreme weather events. Mithika Mwenda, executive director of Nairobi-based Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) said the continent deserved its fair share of climate financing, technology transfer and debt waivers in order to boost low carbon growth. "Our special needs and circumstances as a continent that has borne full brunt of the climate crisis deserves attention," said Mwenda. "More importantly, we need green financing, debt relief and fair-trade practices as we chart a climate resilient future for our communities and ecosystems that sustain their livelihoods," he added. According to Mithika, African Group of Negotiators have been pressing for just and equitable allocation of climate financing at the Glasgow summit to support low carbon development in the continent. He said there was a scientific, economic and political urgency to promote climate adaptation in Africa, cushion local communities from shocks including recurrent droughts, floods, cyclones, forest fires and communicable diseases. Kate Nkatha, commercial director of Fairtrade Africa (FTA) said that robust financing combined with uptake of clean technologies is required to strengthen the resilience of the continent's key sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Nkatha said that greening Africa's supply chains and infrastructure should be a priority given the frequency and severity of climatic shocks in a continent whose contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 4 percent. She called for investments in climate smart agriculture, less carbon intensive manufacturing and retail sectors in order to minimize negative impacts of rising temperatures on livelihoods. Robert Muthami, a Nairobi-based climate policy analyst said COP26 presents an opportunity for African Nations to negotiate for a new funding package earmarked for nature-based interventions that accelerate green growth. Muthami said that some of the climate resilience projects the continent should implement with speed include reforestation, adoption of renewable energy, climate-smart farming and water harvesting.

By Colin Speakman | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-15 15:16 Wind turbines in Rong£n county, Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, are examples of the nation's progress in creating cleaner energy. TAN KAIXING/FOR CHINA DAILY While important progress was made at the recent COP26 , just keeping alive the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, developing countries have expressed disappointment at the lack of commitment on financing for transition and climate damage. Developed economies have grown on the back of fossil fuels for 200 years, and the developing world needs help to reduce emissions while dealing with low living standards and over-stretched government finances. Climate activists had hoped that a strong commitment would be achieved on phasing out fossil fuels, with coal the first target. However, to get a global agreement that could be ratified needed a watering down of action on coal to a phasing down in use, not a phasing out. Aspirations had met harsh realities about the practicalities of both transitioning to clean energy sources and the technologies needed for green transport and heating, two of the major emitters. Electricity is essential to power the world, and sources to generate electricity need to preserve the requirements for stability and security of supply, affordability and portability. The reality is that both coal and oil are readily transportable, whereas the clean energy from nuclear and wind power, solar and tidal are more area-specific. Changes in weather patterns can diminish the output from green sources. Fossil fuel producers still see a need for their contributions in global energy balance for the next few decades. There is a similar reality in the production of petrol-engine cars. While some major automobile manufacturers committed to end combustion engine production by 2040, several major companies, VW, BMW and Toyota, refused to join the declaration. Again the reality was that in markets in some countries, they felt they would be left producing cars that no customers would buy. Without strong infrastructure to supply reliable electric vehicle (EV) charging points around a country or technological breakthroughs, which hugely extend the range an EV can travel, developing countries won't see much demand. Equally, EV prices would need to fall for locals to be able to afford them. In reality, such policies would force drivers to continue to maintain aging petrol-driven vehicles with the associated emissions, whereas a new generation of low-emission petrol-engine cars would be more efficient and more affordable. Again, a realistic balance is needed in transport. Of course, as individuals, we can commit to using public transport, with clean energy buses and trains where available, to cycling and walking more, to working from home if permitted, to recycling waste and, as consumers, favoring environmentally conscious businesses. Yet, we need governments to set the agendas, change the rules, and provide the incentives for climate protection. Climate damage is a truly global issue, and any country's own policies can only do so much. Commentators have said that COP26 to some extent "kicked the can down the road". Equally though, commitments made by leaders now for completion in 2035 to 2050, are not commitments those leaders will be in power to deliver, and there have to be regular checks on progress and mechanisms for fulfillment. One aspect that is predicted from COP26 's "lukewarm" response to the climate challenges is that climate activists will be more energized to campaign for more progress and hope for more decisive actions at COP27 in Egypt next November.

"The release of the joint declaration shows again that cooperation is the only right choice for both China and the United States. By working together, our two countries can accomplish many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole," said Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change. GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Top envoys from China and the United States have underscored the importance of cooperation as the two countries issued a joint declaration on tackling climate change. China and the United States issued the China-U.S. Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s on Wednesday at the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The two countries have agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries. "The release of the joint declaration shows again that cooperation is the only right choice for both China and the United States. By working together, our two countries can accomplish many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole," said Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, at a press conference shortly after the two countries issued the declaration. People participate in the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, the United Kingdom, Nov. 9, 2021. (Xinhua/Han Yan) "When it comes to climate change, there is more common ground between China and the United States than differences, making it an area of huge potential for cooperation," Xie said, calling on both sides to take concrete steps to enhance cooperation on the issue. China and the United States, as two major countries in the world, bear special responsibilities for world peace and development, Xie said, urging the two countries to explore more opportunities for cooperation. Speaking at a separate press conference, U.S. special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry said "cooperation is the only way to get this job done." "We cannot reach our goals unless all of us work together," he said, noting that the United States and China "have to help show the way." \</doc>

HONG KONG SAR -Media OutReach - 5 August 2021 - Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, and Global Footprint Network (GFN), a research organization that tracks how the world manages natural resources, today launched the "100 Days of Possibility" initiative. The initiative seeks to promote solutions that help address climate change and biodiversity loss. The launch of the initiative coincides with Earth Overshoot Day \- the date when humanity exhausts all ecological resources the planet can regenerate during an entire year. The 100 days referenced in the initiative's name mark the time left until the start of the 26th annual UN Climate Conference ( COP26 ), when government officials from around the globe will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, to try to agree on effective actions to combat climate change. The solutions highlighted by the project underpin its key message: Companies, governments and individuals can act now \- there is no need to wait for decisions to be made at COP26 . Opportunities and solutions across all sectors will be revealed each day leading up to COP26 at 100DaysofPossibility.org These will highlight the many ways that everyone can #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day. Examples include proposals for 100% renewable power grids, smart homes and food waste reduction. Schneider Electric, named world's most sustainable corporation by Corporate Knights Global 100 Index showed its support of the initiative by submitting six of its climate solutions to the "100 Days" list. Other partners in the project include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Drawdown Europe. One of the scalable solutions Schneider has contributed is the integration of a microgrid with an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in a Maryland-based smart energy bus depot in the US. It will be the first of its kind and help #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day by reducing carbon emissions by 62% among other benefits. Another example is with Schneider's office building, IntenCity, in Grenoble, France. IntenCity demonstrates how public and private sectors have joined forces to build cleaner and healthier communities. The building is designed to consume 7 kilowatt-hours per square meter each year  nearly 10 times less energy than the average European building consumes. Rooftop solar panels, two onsite wind turbines, the use of groundwater, and smart technology solutions enable the complex to consume and produce equal amounts of electricity over one year. A unique microgrid partnership facilitates energy sharing and coordination with the surrounding community. Another contribution is Schneider's recent agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, the country's national utility provider. It will be the Middle East's first ever country-wide smart grid and help Egypt meet future energy demands while advancing its sustainability strategy. All three solutions will be highlighted during the launch of the "100 days" initiative and Schneider's remaining three contributions will be featured throughout the project.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks at a press conference on COVID-19 in Wellington, New Zealand, April 20, 2020. Photo:Xinhua Pacific Rim trade and foreign ministers agreed to push for a freeze on fossil fuel subsidies at a virtual summit Wednesday but host Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand said more "bold" action on climate change was needed. Ministers from the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group met online to discuss their COVID-19 response ahead of a meeting of national leaders on Saturday including US President Joe Biden. New Zealand Trade Minister Damien O'Connor said highlights included a plan to voluntarily freeze fossil fuel subsidies and commitments to liberalize tariffs on vaccines and other pandemic medical supplies. Ardern hailed the move on fossil fuel subsidies, saying it had the potential to divert billions of dollars from a heavily polluting sector into green technology. But as APEC leaders face pressure for meaningful action on climate change amid COP26 talks in Glasgow, Ardern said it did not go far enough. "Do we need to be more ambitious than this? Absolutely," she said. "We would of course like to see a world where there are no fossil fuel subsidies in our economies, that's long been a position of New Zealand, which we will continue to advocate," Ardern said. The issue was highlighted at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, where the heads of 91 major global companies called for the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies. O'Connor said there was overarching agreement on the need to avoid erecting trade barriers in response to the challenges thrown up by the pandemic. "It is free, fair and open trade that will help economies move forward out of this pandemic... we need openness to drive global growth, indeed it is trade that presents the solution to our challenges," he said in a statement. "Some 81 million jobs have been lost across the region due to COVID-19 and the impact on supply chains has been significant, but APEC members have rejected protectionism during this crisis." APEC's 21 member economies collectively account for almost 40 percent of the world's population and around 60 percent of the global economy. The summit was originally due to be held in Auckland but is being held online for a second time due to COVID-19 after Malaysia hosted virtually in 2020. AFP \</doc>

The IPEC 2021 & Commodity Investment and Trade Promotion Month in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, served as a platform for exchange and cooperation in the global oil industry, senior officials said. It has become an important carrier for global companies to discuss oil and gas, share opportunities, and seek common development in the new era. Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said the country's total oil and gas consumption and imports have continued to grow in recent years. "China has entered a new stage of development. We have always strived to maintain the stability of the market, expand the opening-up of the energy sector, and carry out comprehensive international cooperation based on the concepts of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation." Energy cooperation is an important part of global economic cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative and is also an area of great concern to the international community. China has established inter-governmental energy cooperation mechanisms with more than 90 countries and regions as well as cooperative relations with more than 30 energy-related international organizations and multilateral mechanisms. The country has signed more than 100 energy cooperation agreements. As one of the provinces with the highest per capita income in China, Zhejiang has always been among the top in the country for consumption capacity and level of oil and gas. Zhu Congjiu, vice-governor of Zhejiang, said since the establishment of the China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone, the development of the province's oil and gas industry has accelerated. The entire oil and gas industry chain has "one center, three bases, and one demonstration zone". As China's first pilot free trade zone consisting of land and marine anchorages, the Zhejiang free trade zone has continued to promote the liberalization and facilitation of investment and trade across the oil and gas industry chain in recent years. New developments have been achieved in terms of oil refining capacity, liquified natural gas receiving scale and oil storage capacity. Lu Pengqi, vice-chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said: "In the future, we will continue to play the role in connecting governments and enterprises, matching supply and demand, and providing professional and international public services for trade and investment cooperation between Chinese and foreign enterprises. We will also continue to support the innovative development of the Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone." "In a green, low-carbon and sustainable development environment, it has become necessary to build a clean, safe and efficient energy system and accelerate the realization of the safe transformation and upgrading of the oil and gas industry chain," he said. Long Guoqiang, member of the Party Group and deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said at the conference that building a dual-cycle core hub for oil and gas commodities is not only related to national energy and resource security issues, but is of great significance to maintaining the safe and stable operation of the regional industrial chain and promoting low-carbon transformation. Oil and gas are important energy sources as well as vital sources of petrochemical materials. In response to climate change, major countries have proposed a timetable for carbon neutrality. China will strive to achieve carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. "In the long run, the role of oil and gas as energy sources will continue to decline, and their role as sources of petrochemical materials will exist for a long time," Long said, adding that replacing traditional energy with renewable energy is a gradual process over a long period of time and must be discussed in a long-term and orderly manner. In 2021, global oil and gas prices will rise, and some countries will experience energy shortages. This has sounded the alarm for smoothly advancing the energy low-carbon transition. In his view, it is necessary to build China's oil and gas bulk commodity dual-cycle core hub from the perspective of the entire industry chain. He took Zhoushan as an example. Zhoushan is located on the main international waterway of the Western Pacific Ocean. It has the advantage of being a deep-water port and its location adjacent to the economic center of the Yangtze River Delta. Regarding the establishment and improvement of oil and gas trading centers, Long suggested increasing the influence of oil and gas bulk commodity pricing and developing delivery and storage services for related commodities. During the first three quarters of this year, Zhoushan achieved 3.83 million metric tons of international ship bunkering and 8.21 million tons of bonded fuel oil settlement, making it the sixth-largest bunkering port in the world. It makes Zhoushan the world's fastest-growing and efficient bunker supply center. "We must firmly grasp the historic opportunities brought by the information technology revolution empowered with digital technology, promote digitalization, intelligence, and networking, and create a future-oriented intelligent dual-cycle core hub," Long said. Jiang Yan, chairman of the Shanghai Futures Exchange, said the financial and trade needs of enterprises in the entire industry chain can better serve the oil and gas industry to smoothly survive this extensive and profound systemic change. "The global oil and gas industry pattern is undergoing profound changes." Mike Muller, director of the global board of directors of Vitol Group and head of Vitol Asia, said in a video speech on energy outlook that many goals of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties cannot be achieved without investing in new fuels. "This is where carbon trading can play a role. China's carbon emissions trading system may become one of the main places for such price discovery. More importantly, it can help eliminate carbon dioxide." \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202111/16/6192f77da31019b094bdbdd1.png Link to Image The IPEC 2021 & Commodity Investment and Trade Promotion Month in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, serves as a platform for exchange and cooperation in the global oil industry.

BRUSSELS, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Global powers must be ready to present "concrete plans" at the Glasgow's COP26 to fight global warming, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday. Delivering her second State of the Union speech before the European Parliament, von der Leyen underlined the importance of translating climate goals into legislation. She said that "Major economies - from the U.S. to Japan - have set ambitions for climate neutrality in 2050 or shortly after. These need now to be backed up by concrete plans in time for Glasgow. Because current commitments for 2030 will not keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. Every country has a responsibility!". The 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, dubbed COP26 , will be hosted by Glasgow in Britain between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12, 2021. The European Union (EU) has taken leadership with its Green Deal, an ambitious plan aiming to make the EU climate neutral by 2050, von der Leyen added. Last year, von der Leyen had announced a short-term goal of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent compared to the 1990 level, by 2030. The "Fit for 55" package, a European Commission legislation proposal with detailed policies to reach the goal, was presented to EU lawmakers this summer. "We are the first major economy to present comprehensive legislation in order to get it done," said von der Leyen. The European Commission president also called on other global powers to help the least developed and vulnerable countries. The EU will double its external funding for biodiversity. Von der Leyen also pledged an additional four billion euros (around 4.7 billion U.S. dollars) for climate finance until 2027. "Closing the climate finance gap together - the United States and the EU - would be a strong signal for global climate leadership," said von der Leyen. The two global powers are working together on deepening their link, developing their "new agenda for global change." Areas of cooperation include the establishment of the new Trade and Technology Council, as well as health security and sustainability, according to von der Leyen. The green transition wanted by von der Leyen is also aimed at gearing society towards digitalization. Enditem \</doc>

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Tuesday called upon developed countries to fulfill their climate change commitment of mobilizing 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2020 through 2025 to support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions of developing countries, including ASEAN member states. The 10 ASEAN countries recognized "the potential contribution by developing countries in the form of emissions avoidance, reductions, and carbon stock enhancement, dependent on the support provided by developed countries as guaranteed by the Convention and the Paris Agreement," according to the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change to the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP26 ), issued at the 38th ASEAN Summit. ASEAN leaders urged developed countries to "undertake a clear and comprehensive evaluation and stocktake of the pre-2020 commitments on mitigation and adaptation and finance to understand the progress made and to build mutual trust for post-2020 climate action." They also called upon developed countries to continue and further scale up the mobilization of climate finance ahead of initiating deliberations on the setting up of a new collective quantified goal from a floor of 100 billion U.S. dollars per year, which takes into account the needs and priorities of developing countries including ASEAN member states. The developed countries were also asked to take the lead by enhancing mitigation ambition, including setting net-zero emission targets with concrete policy and implementation, recognizing that enhanced support for developing countries will allow for higher ambition in their actions. ASEAN countries urged developed country parties to enhance international cooperation and assistance, on the provision of timely, effective, adequate and predictable support to ASEAN member states and other developing countries for financing, the development and transfer of environmentally sound technology, scientific research, and capacity building, for mitigation and adaptation measures, as stipulated under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The UNFCCC COP26 will be held from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. Scheduled from Tuesday to Thursday, the 38th and 39th ASEAN summits and related summits will also be joined by ASEAN's dialogue partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, India, the United States, Australia and Russia, among others. Established in 1967, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Brunei is the ASEAN chair for 2021. Enditem \</doc>

By Tereza Cristina/Joaquim Leite | China Daily | Updated: 2021-10-27 07:36 A tree is seen in a forest of wood extraction in the Amazon rainforest, inside Jamari National Forest Park in the County of Itapua do Oeste, Rondonia state, Brazil, Sept 28, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] As we approach the United Nations Climate Change Conference amid the growing imperatives for sustainable development and climate action, the international community must make the most of the opportunity to ensure ambitious results in Glasgow, the conference venue, and beyond. Over the last 50 years, Brazil has transformed from a net food importer to the world's third-largest agricultural exporter, while using only a fraction of its territory for agriculture and preserving over two-thirds of its native vegetation. In a world under increasing pressure to meet the growing global demand for food in a sustainable way, this success stands as a uniquely singular achievement. Investments in science and technology, and efforts to promote innovation have been at the heart of Brazil's agricultural revolution. The adaptation of plant and animal varieties to the tropics has diversified production. The development of integrated crop-livestock-forest systems, with the rotation of grains, beef and planted forests, has made it possible to produce two, sometimes three harvests a year on the same land. As a result, grain production since the late 1970s has increased by more than 420 percent, while the cultivated area has grown by just over 40 percent. These advances have brought enormous social, economic and environmental benefits to Brazil. Agriculture is now the most dynamic sector of the Brazilian economy, directly responsible for more than 18 million jobs and about 20 percent of GDP. The cost of food has been halved compared with the 1970s, and economic and social development has reached the rural interiors of the country. And the cities where agricultural activities are concentrated are among those with the highest human development index. In livestock production, results are no less impressive. Over the past 20 years, extraordinary productivity gains have drastically reduced emissions per unit of beef and milk produced, and sustainable intensification techniques now allow for the full offset of remaining emissions, resulting in carbon neutral beef, a product already available in the Brazilian market. This is the successful trajectory Brazil relies on to build the sustainable agriculture of the future and meet its development and climate goals. Building on this progress will require greater emphasis on international diplomacy, collaboration and partnerships. Only enhanced international cooperation can offer an avenue for ambitious collective action. In the coming years, the expansion of low carbon agriculture will continue to usher in additional productivity gains. The restoration of degraded pastures, of which there are almost 100 million hectares in Brazil, will enable further production increases while reducing pressure for conversion of new areas into agriculture. Technological innovations such as gene editing, digital agriculture and bio-inputs will pave the way for Brazil to continue growing the supply of healthy, affordable food to the world, in a competitive and sustainable way. Brazil's track record in agriculture, however, is only a part of the story. As a developing country, Brazil still faces a critical challenge: promoting sustainable development in the Amazon biome, an area larger than the European Union that is home to more than 23 million Brazilian citizens, most of whom live below the poverty line. In recent decades, a historical process of informal territorial occupation coupled with limited economic alternatives has led to the occurrence of illegal mining, land grabbing and deforestation. Brazil recognizes this reality and is taking steps to address the problem. In April 2021, at the Leader's Summit on Climate, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro committed to Brazil achieving climate neutrality by 2050\u-243 10 years sooner than originally intended\u-243 and ending illegal deforestation by 2030. Since then, the government has redoubled efforts to combat environmental crime and positive numbers have begun to emerge. Ensuring the protection of public lands, enforcing environmental legislation and concluding the region's territorial planning are at the core of Brazil's strategy for the Amazon. Through its environmental regulations, Brazil has imposed considerable restrictions on land use and exploitation of natural resources in the Amazon. At present, a vast majority of the biome is formally protected either in indigenous territories, environmental conservation areas, or on private lands, where Brazil's rigorous Forest Code stipulates that 80 percent of the property area must be preserved with native vegetation. This represents a significant contribution to the world in terms of environmental conservation and climate action. The economic cost of renouncing the use of such resources must be objectively recognized, and sustainable development opportunities must be offered to the region's inhabitants. Completing negotiations on the Paris Agreement Rulebook will be crucial for creating such opportunities. As a large exporter of agricultural products, Brazil has developed a strong awareness of the role agriculture can play in promoting economic growth and social inclusion, and producing positive environmental outcomes. But we are also keenly aware of its particular vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and the risks those pose to global food security. Through open and transparent dialogue, shared goals can be identified and used as the basis for a new development cycle that will realize the socioeconomic promise of sustainable development while safeguarding environmental wealth for future generations. A constructive vision, based on scientific evidence, partnership, and respect for national legislation, is the surest way to build the sustainable future we want. We invite all to embrace this vision. Brazil is ready to do its part. Tereza Cristina is Brazil's minister of agriculture, livestock and food supply, and Joaquim Leite is minister of the environment.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world is "sleepwalking to climate catastrophe" because of slow action on emissions and continued reliance on fossil fuels. Guterres said the Paris Agreement goal of capping global warming at 1.5 C is "on life support", and called out leaders in rich countries for shifting blame onto emerging economies, and vice versa. The UN chief also said the response to the Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the climate crisis, as major economies pursue strategies to replace Russian fossil fuels, resulting in "short-term measures" creating "long-term fossil fuel dependence". "This is madness," Guterres told The Economist Sustainability Summit in London. "Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction." Guterres said some progress was made at the UN climate change conference COP 26 in November, including agreements to end deforestation, reduce methane emissions and mobilize private finance. "But the main problem was not solved," he said. "It was not even properly addressed, and that problem is the enormous emissions gap." Experts estimate that limiting warming at 1.5 C will require a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by midcentury. Guterres said current national commitments for reductions will lead to a 14 percent increase in emissions during the 2020s. "That problem was not solved in Glasgow. In fact, the problem is getting worse," he said. Blame game Guterres also addressed a common cause of conflict during negotiations at COP 26 , where rich nations pointed to high emissions in emerging economies that are still undergoing industrialization, while developing nations focused on the historical emissions burden of developed regions. "If this goes on, there are no winners in a blame game," Guterres said. "We can't point fingers while the planet burns." Guterres advocated the formation of coalitions to provide major emerging economies with resources and technology to accelerate their transition from coal to renewable energy. He said such an effort was underway in South Africa, which is among the most coal-dependent nations in the G20 group of economies. In November, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom announced the International Just Energy Transition Partnership, through which partner countries will support decarbonization in South Africa. "And the pieces are coming into place for coalitions in Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere," said Guterres, who also singled out the commitment by China last year to cease investment in overseas coal projects as a positive development.

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China was committed to "walking the talk" in the global fight against climate change and protecting biodiversity ahead of the crucial COP15 and COP26 meetings, said World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende. Chinese President Xi Jinping's statement delivered via video at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly was very important, where Xi "so strongly, again, committed China to deliver on climate change but also on nature-based solutions," Brende told Xinhua on the sidelines of the WEF's fifth Sustainable Development Impact Summit on Sept. 20-23. "The message that China is not supporting any new coal-fired power plants outside China was a very strong and important message now in the run up to COP26 ," he said. WALKING THE TALK As the first part of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP15) will take place in the Chinese city of Kunming, Yunnan Province, in October, followed by the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, Brende said "it is crucial that all these meetings are successful and that there are real outcomes." "We are not anymore focusing on why we have to act on climate change, why we have to stop the extinction of species, but on how," said Brende, a former minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, stressing the question of "how to make sure that we as humankind can stop the burning of our planet, (and) how we can save nature for future generations." The United States and China are "the two most important countries in the world when it comes to sending strong messages and walking the talk," Brende said, referring to fields including "not only climate and ... nature and biodiversity, but also when it comes to trade and global value chains." "What I do hope is that the Sino-U.S. relationship will improve," he said, adding that "when it comes to practical solutions on climate, I think we can learn also by China's contribution the last decade." RACE TO ACHIEVE 17 SDGs United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday convened a high-level event to galvanize global action toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), calling for more efforts to bring them back on track. Brende meanwhile highlighted the WEF's role as the international organization for public-private cooperation, which will be crucial to rebuilding trust and shaping a more sustainable future. "We only have nine years to go until we have to reach all the 17 SDGs," he urged. "We also have to be successful in mitigating CO2, making sure that our oceans are not filled with more plastic than fish. We also need to get growth back, growth that creates decent jobs and growth that also addresses the inequalities that we see on our planet. There is a big challenge ahead," he said. WEF DAVOS MEETING 2022 The WEF announced last week that it plans to convene its annual meeting in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, on Jan. 17-21, 2022 under the theme "Working Together, Restoring Trust." The global event bringing together the world's top business, government and civil society leaders in the Swiss mountain resort each year had been cancelled for 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be the first global leadership event offline to set the agenda for a sustainable recovery, the WEF said in a press release. The meeting will focus on accelerating stakeholder capitalism, harnessing the technologies of the fourth industrial evolution and ensuring a more inclusive future of work, it said. Brende emphasized the WEF's hope to further collaborate with China, saying "we have so many partnerships and so much cooperation with China now that this is a true inspiration." He said he looks forward to reinitiating "this very important meeting because a lot of our CEOs would like to see what the Chinese strategy is for reviving a sustainable growth in the years to come," he said.

Scotland and China are at the center of two of the most important global summits this century. As we prepare to welcome world leaders, international policy makers and scientists to Glasgow for the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), similar preparations are being made in Kunming for the second part of the U.N. Biodiversity Conference (COP15) next year. The impact of both summits will be far reaching and will demand cooperation on an historic scale. The twin crises of climate change and nature loss are intertwined and must be tackled together. We need nature to mitigate climate change and nature needs us to manage climate change to avoid its collapse. There must be no doubt, we are at a pivotal moment and collective international action is needed. COP15 needs to ensure that actions taken by all levels of government contribute towards national and global targets for nature over the coming decade. And COP26 must mobilize the ambition, finance, resources and joint working needed to deliver on the Paris Agreement goals. During the Covid-19 pandemic, actions which previously seemed impossible became achievable. People changed their behavior to protect themselves and each other. We now need to summon the same urgency we have shown in the face of a pandemic to safeguard our planet. Countries and provinces of all sizes must play their part, and in Scotland we are determined to lead by example. We have more than halved our emissions from 1990 levels, and over the decade to 2030 we aim to half them again. By 2045, we are committed to achieving net zero. Across Scottish business, communities and public organizations there is a significant amount of work underway to become more sustainable and respond to the global climate emergency. Partners in China and Scotland are working together. The China-U.K. Low Carbon College, a joint initiative of the University of Edinburgh, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Lingang City, is focused on green development strategy. We have established the TUS-ORE Catapult Technology Research Centre, a leading renewable energy technology research and development hub with links to both Scotland and China. And in January, Scottish Development International signed an agreement with the Jiangsu Renewable Energy Industry Association to help facilitate partnerships between green supply chain companies. If we are to end our contribution to climate change within a generation, this progress must continue. All of us must challenge ourselves to do more and the Scottish Government will support citizens in Scotland and globally to make these changes. The Scottish Government is European co-chair of the Under2 Coalition, a global community of state and regional governments committed to climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. We are using this position to help deliver ambitious outcomes at COP26 , and demonstrate that global climate action requires action by governments at all levels. We are also leading a global push to ensure action is taken to halt biodiversity loss and restore nature. Alongside international partners, the Scottish Government has organized the Edinburgh Process for engagement with subnational and local governments to help develop an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Central to this, the Edinburgh Declaration is a call to recognize the role of sub-state authorities in delivering positive actions for biodiversity, to include their views in the new global biodiversity strategy to be agreed at COP15 and to ensure the effective implementation of the framework at all levels of government. To date, more than 180 national, subnational and local governments and other organizations support the Edinburgh Declaration, and this number continues to grow. It is important that we grasp these opportunities to deliver transformational action on climate change and biodiversity. In years to come, I hope we will speak of Glasgow and Kunming as places where the world made decisive steps towards protecting our planet.

BEIJING, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's three-pronged proposal, including upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions and accelerating the green transition, is vitally important for the world community to address climate challenge, foreign experts and scholars have said. Xi made the proposal in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland. British author and political commentator Carlos Martinez said he "essentially agrees" with Xi's proposals during the COP26 conference. "The essential thing we need to do is to uphold multilateralism. We need to start working together, stop playing blame games," Martinez said. He called on all parties to stick to the Paris Agreement and the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities to deal with climate issues. "Let's coordinate around how we can support developing countries, especially the least developed countries that don't have the financial and infrastructure resources to reduce carbon emissions," he added. Antony Froggatt, deputy director of Environment and Society Programme Chatham House, a London-based think tank and also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said global cooperation and technical innovation are crucial for tackling global challenges like climate change. He gave an example of cooperation among the European Union, China and the United States, saying that there are great potentials for the three sides to work together in renewable energy industry such as solar energy and wind energy. "It is these three blocs that not only deliver the world's biggest deployment of technologies, but by doing so, can enable falling costs, which enables other countries also to deploy these technologies," he said. Vice President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Danny Alexander said he believes that the green transition will be accelerated when addressing climate change. "Green investment can be a crucial part of the economic recovery over the next several years after the COVID-19 pandemic," as there is a huge need for clean energy and urban projects such as subways, light rails, water and sanitation projects, he noted. "Every project now has to also be able to be adapted and resilient to climate change in the future," he added. Pui Jeng Leong, a media veteran in Brunei, said President Xi's proposal of focusing on concrete actions is highly necessary. Actions speak louder than words in terms of efforts to cope with global climate change, he said, adding that China has been making all-out efforts to honor its carbon reduction commitments and push forward a comprehensive green transformation in development.

UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- All countries should commit to zero carbon emissions by 2050 if the world is to avoid a disastrous temperature rise of 2.4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday. In his keynote speech at a high-level climate gathering in Petersberg, Germany - six months before world leaders convene in Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP26 (the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change) Climate Summit - the UN chief also offered a message of hope, insisting that it is still possible to avert the worst impacts of emissions-fueled environmental shocks. "I see encouraging signs from some major economies," he said, referring to countries that represent 73 percent of emissions having committed to net zero emissions by mid-century. All countries - especially in the G20 - need to close the mitigation gap further by COP26 , he insisted, highlighting the threat already faced by developing countries, where "people are dying, farms are failing (and) millions face displacement." "The bottom line is that, by 2030, we must cut global emissions by 45 percent compared to 2010 levels to get to net zero emissions by 2050. That is how we will keep the hope of 1.5 degrees alive," he said. The world's top priority should be to dispense with polluting coal-fired power stations altogether and replace them with renewable energy, the top UN official noted. "I reiterate my call to donors and multilateral development banks to ensure that at least 50 percent of climate finance is for adaption and resilience," Guterres said, noting that "adaptation finance" to developing countries represents only 21 percent of climate finance today. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue is an annual event that has been convened by Germany since 2010. It brings together ministers from over 30 countries, top executives, civil society and subnational leaders in preparation for the annual climate COP, which will be held in Glasgow from Nov. 1 to 12.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States on Wednesday released the China-U.S. Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s here at the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Noting that they have further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis, the two countries said in the declaration that they are committed to tackling the crisis through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s, as well as through cooperation in multilateral processes, including the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process, to avoid catastrophic impacts. The two sides also stressed the vital importance of closing the gap between efforts being made around the world and those that need to be taken to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. They declared their intention to work individually, jointly, and with other countries, in accordance with different national circumstances, to strengthen and accelerate climate action and cooperation aimed at closing the gap, including accelerating the green and low-carbon transition and climate technology innovation. In this aspect, their intended cooperation fields include regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the 2020s, maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition, policies to encourage decarbonization and electrification of end-use sectors, as well as key areas related to the circular economy, such as green design and renewable resource utilization. Recognizing specifically the significant role that emissions of methane play in increasing temperatures, both countries considered increased action to control and reduce such emissions to be a matter of necessity in the 2020s. On the other hand, to reduce CO2 emissions, the two countries said they intend to cooperate in such areas as policies that support the effective integration of high shares of low-cost intermittent renewable energy, transmission policies that encourage efficient balancing of electricity supply and demand across broad geographies, distributed generation policies that encourage integration of solar, storage, and other clean power solutions closer to electricity users, as well as energy efficiency policies and standards to reduce electricity waste. With respect to COP26 , both countries expressed support for an ambitious, balanced, and inclusive outcome on mitigation, adaptation, and support. Both countries recognized the importance of the commitment made by developed countries to the goal of mobilizing jointly 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2020 and annually through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, and stressed the importance of meeting that goal as soon as possible. The two sides also agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade.

China, US Illustration: Chen Xia/GT Editor's Note: The 26th UN Climate Change Conference, known as the COP26 , started on Sunday in Glasgow, UK. This meeting has been widely portrayed as the most important global climate talks since the 2015 Paris climate accord. Ahead of the summit, there were many discussions on how China-US tensions will impact the negotiations at the COP26 as well as the global fight against climate change. Can climate change become a breakthrough to improve China-US relations? How to promote cooperation between the two countries on climate change? Sourabh Gupta (Gupta), a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, shared his insight over these issues with Global Times (GT) reporters Yu Jincui and Lu Yuanzhi. GT: What do you expect for the COP26 ? What goals do you think should be achieved? Gupta: I expect a modest but positive outcome at the COP26 , with a broad consensus arrived at with regard to 2050/60 net zero targets, the formalization of moves toward the elimination of coal from the energy mix, and an increasing ambition on near-term nationally determined contributions to reduce greenhouse gases. The conference will certainly not be a failure. All the major emitters, with the exception perhaps of a few, such as India, are pulling in the same direction. Of course, the resounding success that one had hoped for a couple of months ago, going into the COP26 , will not be achieved. And the global community will still remain quite some distance away from the pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\~ GT: China's aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 have been described as "an arduous task." But many Western countries and media outlets are attempting to pressure China to achieve more "ambitious" emission goals. What's your take in this regard? Do you think China's aims are consistent with the pace of its development? Gupta: China's carbon dioxide emissions-related aims are not just consistent with its pace of development; they exceed its pace of development. China deserves commendation, not criticism, for the difficult pledges that it has taken on and their concerted translation into action. The stock of global cumulative emissions from the Industrial Revolution onward emitted by the US and Europe is almost four times that of China's. It is high time that these advanced countries learn to take greater responsibility for this negative externality unleashed on the planet and in particular, aim to achieve carbon neutrality at an early date not just on the production side of their economies but also the consumption side of their economies. At minimum, the common global effort to arrest the pace of climate change must not be allowed to become a "second colonialism" inflicted on the developing world, with the burden of adjustment borne primarily on the back of the developing world's development-related aspirations.\~ GT: In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, you said China's aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 have "helped inject energy and vitality back to global climate change talks, with other countries - mostly in East Asia - also following in China's wake and laying out ambitious climate change targets." How do you evaluate China's efforts for global climate change? What have other countries demonstrated? Gupta: President Xi's pledge at the UN General Assembly session in September 2020 on a peaking date (2030) and a carbon neutrality date (2060) was hugely instrumental in breathing life back into major country climate change politics and pledges - just as the US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change and Clean Energy Cooperation of November 2014 had set the wheels in motion on the important Paris Conference outcomes. Japan's Yoshihide Suga and South Korea's Moon Jae-in followed soon thereafter with ambitious pledges too.\~ It is important to note that China has continued in its reformist, climate-conscious vein in 2021, pledging to peak coal emissions during the 2026-30 period, inaugurating its nationwide emissions trading scheme, and recently releasing its detailed Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030 across a range of industries and sectors. More to the point, China has laid out an all-of-government-and-society-wide emphasis on combating climate change as well as framed the challenge through the lens of commercial opportunity in areas ranging from new-energy vehicles to smart cities. China should continue on this positive track, treating its neutrality and peaking date targets, especially its "peak coal" date, as a floor rather than a ceiling and attempt to pull them forward as best possible. And just as importantly, if other major global emitters can also summon the same level of ambition as China has displayed, the planet could be in a much better place in terms of hitting its 1.5 C global warming target. GT: How do you see the US' prospect to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050? Republicans have often resisted cutting emissions. Former US president Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement. If Trump or the Republicans get elected again, how will it affect the US' commitment in reducing emissions and the joint efforts by other countries to tackle climate change? Gupta: I would not count on the US' prospect of achieving climate neutrality before 2050, despite the habitual nay-saying of the present-day Republican Party. The Biden administration unveiled an ambitious set of near-term targets to decarbonize its transport and electricity grids in April this year. At the state and local levels, where the effects of global warming are most felt, governors and mayors have shown an admirable commitment to fighting climate change. The state of California in particular has been a trailblazer, literally stripping out carbon-intensive fuels as a feedstock for electricity generation. Countries and states/provinces around the world would do well to study the California example.\~ You are correct on the point though that if half the political spectrum in this country (the US) is unwilling to admit - let alone shoulder - our collective responsibility to address climate change, we will all be poorer off. It is doubly unfortunate that a small sliver of Democrats too are unwilling to do the needful on climate change, as a result of which President Biden has had to strip out a significant amount of congressional funding to "green" the US electricity sectors. And this therefore begs the question: Shouldn't there be enforceable penalties on countries that fail to hit their nationally determined greenhouse gas reduction targets? During the Trump-era bilateral trade and investment negotiations in early-2019, the US side had insisted that China commit to memorializing its liberalization commitments in national legislation, rather than merely in the State Council directives and regulations. Perhaps, it is time for the shoe to be on the other foot and have Washington memorialize its COP26 greenhouse gas reduction commitments in Congressional legislation too. GT: Some analysts say that geopolitical tensions between China and the US will affect the cooperation in climate change. It has been reported that the Biden administration is divided over its China policy. US special envoy for climate John Kerry told Biden that he wouldn't achieve his goal of tackling climate change, a key administration priority, unless the US-China relationship improved. But national security advisor Jake Sullivan said, "We are not in the business of trading cooperation with China on climate change as a favor that Beijing is doing for the United States." Can climate change become a breakthrough to improve China-US relations? How to promote cooperation between the two countries on climate change? Gupta: It is an unfortunate fact of life that geopolitical tensions between China and the US have seeped into climate change collaboration. There is a sub-optimal, path dependency that has crept into their respective relationship-related equations. Washington seeks selective cooperation with Beijing on an a la carte basis (including on climate change) that is framed within a broader structural context ranging from coexistence to outright adversarial relations with China. For its part, Beijing prefers a more structured relationship, where bilateral cooperation (including on climate change) is preceded by the restoration of guardrails to the overall China-US strategic relationship. Between these two approaches, it is unfortunately cooperation on climate change that has seemingly fallen through the cracks. At this time, the best that can be hoped is that both countries individually reflect on the gravity of the climate challenge ahead and find avenues for concerted cooperation - at the sub-national level initially, and hopefully as relations stabilize, at the presidential level. GT: In terms of climate change, you said in April that, "both the United States and China can rise above their differences and cooperate together in the better interests of all." Are you still optimistic about the prospect of the cooperation between China and the US on climate change? Gupta: Well, I am not as optimistic about the prospect of cooperation at this time. The momentum going into Paris 2015 was furnished by the historic US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change and Clean Energy Cooperation in November 2014, followed by the US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change in September 2015. By contrast, going into Glasgow 2021, bilateral relations are simply not where they were going into Paris, or for-the-matter should be. That said, their differences should not hold China or the US back from pulling in the same direction individually on this potentially existential challenge to our global community.\~ Separately, China should also aim to coordinate its climate change actions, going forward, with the European Union rather than wait interminably for a change of heart at the US' end. This is already the case in the trade and investment arena where China and the European Union have completed the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment negotiations. With its national emissions trading scheme already off-the-ground, Beijing should now gradually seek out complementarities with Europe's own emissions trading scheme across carbon-intensive sectors and industries, such that these two major economic areas can blaze a common pathway forward on trans-continental emissions trading, carbon pricing and greenhouse gas reduction. \</doc>

By LIU YINMENG in Los Angeles | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-08 10:10 People take part in a protest rally on Saturday during a global day of action on climate change in Glasgow, Scotland, during the COP 26 climate summit. DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE During the Conference of Parties in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, wealthy countries, which are responsible for emitting the bulk of the greenhouse gases that are heating up the planet, pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle the problem. Twelve years later that commitment is yet to be met. The issue has been a simmering point of contention in United Nations climate talks for some years now, and has received renewed attention in the climate talks of the COP 26 climate summit, now on in Glasgow, Scotland. "The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should guide all collaboration on environmental and climate matters," said Jorge Chediek, the UN secretary-general's former envoy on South-South cooperation. "The leadership of China, as the largest developing country and as a member of the G77+China, is essential for this dialogue to succeed, and also to get the developed countries to finally contribute their fair share." The failure of developed countries to fulfill their financial commitment sparked anger from developing countries as the COP 26 began in Glasgow a week ago. Leaders of developing countries argued that rich countries, which built their economies through industrialization, are to blame for global warming. "Africa is suffering the worst consequences from this phenomenon, economically, socially and politically," Bloomberg quoted Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi as saying. Other countries, including Gabon, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Libya and the Maldives, made similar appeals last week. Some said the failure to honor promises eroded trust between developed and developing countries. The Alliance of Small Island States said in a statement that "the impact this has had on trust cannot be underestimated". 'Not enough' "Developed countries are not doing enough to support developing nations in their transition to clean energy or their struggles to adapt to climate change," said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program in the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. "The extreme weather exacerbated by climate change is increasingly the result of historic and present fossil fuel emissions, which has been overwhelmingly caused by just a few industrialized countries. It's unjust that developing nations now have to bear the brunt of the resulting flooding, droughts, sea level rise and more intense storms, among other climate impacts, when they have the fewest resources to protect themselves and their residents." Developing countries need money for things such as building sea walls and moving residents to safe areas in extreme weather, as well as technologies to deal with droughts, he said. Other possible investment included "a modernized, clean electricity grid" that would help them reduce carbon emissions. The biggest challenge for developed countries in meeting these financial commitments is "really political", Elkind said. "The key is to find a sweet spot where foreign aid can also bolster each countries' ties to each other, in ways to further promote their national security or economic development through trade." \</doc>

MIDDLE EAST US toughens line on Israeli settlements The United States on Tuesday voiced concern about Israel's decision to build settlements in the West Bank, saying it will "strongly oppose" such expansion on occupied Palestinian land. The criticism by the administration of US President Joe Biden was some of the strongest in years on Israel after Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, gave his blessing to settlements and annexations. "We strongly oppose the expansion of settlements, which is completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm, and it damages the prospects for a two-state solution," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. SUDAN PM returns home under tight security Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has returned home with his wife under tight security, the prime minister's office said on Tuesday. Since early Monday, Hamdok and some of his ministers were arrested along with civilian members of the nation's Sovereign Council. Earlier on Tuesday, General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah al-Burhan denied Hamdok had been arrested, saying the prime minister was staying at Burhan's house at the Guest Palace. Since a coup attempt on Sept 21 in Sudan, tensions between the military and civilian partners in the transitional government have escalated. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Hamdok on Tuesday, the US State Department said. UNITED KINGDOM Queen Elizabeth skips COP 26 talks to rest Britain's 95-year-old Queen Elizabeth II will not attend the COP 26 UN climate conference in Glasgow, after "advice to rest" from doctors following an overnight hospital stay, her Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday. "Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow" for a Nov 1 reception, the palace said in a statement. The queen worked a busy schedule in early October but canceled a visit to Northern Ireland last week on medical advice. On Thursday, she spent the night at the private Edward VII hospital in London for "preliminary investigations". The hospital stay\u-243 her first since 2013\u-243 and the palace's delay in revealing it have raised fears over her health, given her age. Agencies - Xinhua \</doc>

BEIJING, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday called on all parties to take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge. Xi made the remarks in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow from Monday to Tuesday. "I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all," he said. The adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action, he said. The Chinese president made a three-pronged proposal to address climate challenge, including upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions, and accelerating the green transition. "When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription," he said. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. The Chinese president stressed the responsibility of developed countries in tackling climate change, saying that they should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better. In terms of green transition, Xi said it is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern. Guided by the vision of a community of life for man and nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development, he said. "We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects," he said. He added that China will speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. China has recently released an action plan for carbon dioxide peaking before 2030, as well as a document titled "Working Guidance For Carbon Dioxide Peaking And Carbon Neutrality In Full And Faithful Implementation Of The New Development Philosophy." Xi said the country will roll out specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement, as well as supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, fiscal and taxation, and financial incentives. "These measures will form a '1+N' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint," he added.

When the second week of the Glasgow Climate Conference ( COP26 ) started a week ago, I stayed up until 3 a.m. Beijing time to watch a side event live. This was "Reimagining Climate Governance," and I'm a big fan of the panel speaker Kim Stanley Robinson who writes best-selling climate fiction. But in the end, it was the questions from the floor, not the panel discussion, that stayed with me. One was more of a statement on climate justice, with the speaker saying he thought the negotiating venue was disconnected from the reality of millions of frontline communities in developing countries that are suffering from climate disaster. The other asked, "Can you imagine a new social contract on climate governance, and what do you imagine would be the process leading to that?" The comments - from veteran negotiator and science fiction writer alike - sounded like prayers to an oracle, a touch of desperation blended with hope. Now that COP26 has ended with the "Glasgow Climate Pact", I wonder what delegates are going home with, and what they might pray for. Larger countries need to bring home good news of overall achievement. They need to tell domestic audiences that this UN multilateral process is still functioning and moving forward, and that they have made positive contribution to the progress. Positively, after six years of negotiation, the Paris Agreement rulebook has been given the go-ahead. The Glasgow Climate Pact also reinstated the 1.5 degree goal set in Paris, and confirmed that coal and other fossil fuel usage needs to be cut down. In the shadow of pandemic and economic downturn, this in itself is reassuring. The China-US climate cooperation statement announced in the middle of COP26 played a critical role in stabilizing and building foundations for the final multilateral outcomes. Countries with a vibrant carbon market or plans to set one up can take home the deal on a global carbon market. Capitalists around the world will be gearing up. Environment activists however have concerns about new loopholes and cheap credit for corporations that evade their emission cutting responsibilities. However, the larger emitter countries won't be able to relax yet. In theory everyone agrees with the 1.5 degree goal. However, the collective emission cut pledges still don't add up - with the current pledges the world is on the path to overshooting this goal, and even exceeding HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/press/Glasgows-one-degree-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ 2.4 degree's warming To me, this is actually the point of the UN climate process. Marching ahead towards stronger global action in the past two decades has made nations somewhat uncomfortable and stressed. With this in mind, pressing countries to come back again with better homework next year, however painful this is for countries already making a big effort on climate, is the right thing to do. Guess who's going home empty-handed? The poorest and most vulnerable countries. That climate justice question in the side event was raised at high pitch for good reason. Many developing countries with small greenhouse emissions and limited capacity to cope with climate challenge come to UN COPs expecting to get the financial support they need to follow a greener pathway, and to get legitimate compensation for their losses due to climate disaster. Glasgow made some progress, but the overall financial commitment level still fell short. And this has been a chronic problem of the UN climate process. The process flows fast wherever hints of a decent return of investment emerge, like expanding carbon market, but is stagnant in areas urgently needing resources and action but with unclear or limited investment value, like food, shelter and disaster alleviation. In our world today, this seems natural and self-explanatory. Maybe that's also what the senior expert had in mind when he asked about an alternative social contract in global climate governance. I'm ending my observation of this climate conference with mixed feelings. It's reassuring that despite all the difficulties in global politics, countries are still talking to one another and agreeing on the direction of travel, especially the big players. As a result of that good faith, the wheels of global climate collaboration are still spinning. Rules are being set, roads built, millions more people are paying attention, and money, in its billions, is still shaking and churning. Nevertheless, the process is painfully slow. All the pragmatists agree, time is not on our side. And if global climate governance keeps failing the small and vulnerable nations, the rules of the game might needs changing too.

NEW DELHI, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- India's federal power minister R K Singh said Friday the country will replace diesel with renewable energy to achieve zero diesel use in the agricultural sector by 2024. Singh chaired a virtual meeting with state government officials to discuss the energy transition goals of the country. The minister laid emphasis on the need for a state-specific agency dedicated to energy conservation and efficiency. According to officials, the objective of the meeting was to ensure the participation of states in fulfilling India's climate commitments and that each state is assigned to set energy saving targets. "Singh stressed the need for collaborative efforts between the central (federal) and state governments toward the large-scale deployment of energy efficiency measures in potential sectors of the economy," said a statement issued by the ministry. "We are working for a new and modern India, which can not happen without modern power systems, and we look forward to working with all states to achieve it," the statement said. The ministry said the meeting was organized in line with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment at the COP26 climate change conference to reducing carbon emission intensity of the country.

An environmental activist disguised as a dinosaur protests in front of BTG Pactual Bank headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil on November 5, denouncing Latin America's largest investment bank that supports the fossil fuel industry. Photo: AFP Governments which enact climate legislation risk being sued for trillions of dollars by fossil fuel companies seeking compensation for lost revenue and stranded assets, according to data that campaigners warn threaten pledges made at COP26 . Energy experts predict that more ambitious climate action from world leaders will significantly increase companies' use of a tribunal mechanism that has already awarded billions to the heavy industry. Trade agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty and NAFTA contain investor arbitration clauses, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), that allow foreign companies to sue governments over actions they say hit profits or investments. Campaigners say that energy companies are increasingly turning to this type of arbitration to recoup investments as governments accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels. Jean Blaylock, trade campaigner at Global Justice Now, tells AFP these corporate courts - "the global trade system's dirty little secret" - could "make a mockery" of commitments generated at the COP26 summit. "We're seeing the fossil fuel sector use investor-state dispute settlement to hold climate action to ransom," she says. "These companies have made unfathomable profits from fueling the climate crisis, we cannot let them demand even bigger pay-outs." AFP has obtained excerpts from a presentation given at a September trade event by consultancy firm Berkeley Research Group (BRG), which predicted that climate legislation would lead to a rise in private lawsuits. "Increased climate policy ambition [eg CAT Ratings] will drive the policies behind climate-related disputes," said an excerpt.\~ CAT refers to Climate Action Tracker, which ranks national emissions plans on their compatibility with the Paris climate deal. The presentation suggested that the "scale of energy transition policy" could "unleash a wave of international investment and/or commercial arbitration to adjudicate claims." Responding to a request to comment, Christopher Goncalves, chair of BRG's Energy and Climate practice, told AFP that dispute resolution was "likely to remain a critical component of the energy transition process." "It is not possible to make any generic conclusion as to whether such legal disputes accelerate or impede the energy transition," he added. History of awards The BRG presentation said if governments legislate to limit heating to 2 C by 2050, $3.3-6.5 trillion in upstream fossil fuel assets would be at risk, as well as $650-700 billion in coal power assets and $900 billion in oil reserve write-offs in a 1.5 C scenario. Blaylock said $9 trillion in upstream fossil fuel and oil reserve write-offs are at risk of litigation - a little over a tenth of the global economy. Energy and mining firms have a long history in winning large settlements. In 2006, Occidental Energy sued the government of Ecuador for terminating an oil contract. It was awarded $1.77 billion, which was later reduced to $1 billion. In 2012 Tethyan Copper sued the government of Pakistan over a gold mine, and in 2019 was awarded $5.9 billion - roughly 2 percent of the country's GDP. ISDS decisions are internationally binding and courts have in the past ordered the seizure of state assets when countries have refused to pay. Five current cases, brought by energy firms identified by Global Justice Now, are seeking $18 billion from governments. These include a dispute involving the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline in North America, where the complainant, TC Energy, is seeking a reported $15 billion in lost revenue.\~ A TC Energy spokeswoman told AFP that it would "not comment on speculative claims."\~ German energy firm Uniper is one of two companies reportedly seeking more than $1 billion from the Netherlands after it decided to phase out coal. A Uniper spokesperson did not comment on the amount in question but said government policy had cut 15 years off the lifespan of its MPP3 power plant near Rotterdam, "however understandable that change in itself may be." 'Ordinary people will pay' British company Rockhopper is suing Italy for a reported $324 million over a ban on offshore oil drilling close to the country's coast. Italy signed the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) but then withdrew in 2016. Companies can resort to ISDS for 20 years after a country leaves the ECT. A spokeswoman for Rockhopper rejected the idea that the suit was linked to climate change.\~ "The Italian government issued licenses and encouraged significant investment in oil and gas exploration, based on this platform. Clearly it is not equitable to change the rules halfway through," she told AFP. Most of the governments wrapping up COP26 plan to slash their emissions to net-zero by 2050. That will cost the global economy as much as $100 trillion, according to International Energy Agency estimates. Nations are also pledging billions to help countries adapt to climate-driven extreme weather and crop failures. Campaigners say that litigation represents a looming, hidden cost of climate action.\~ "The science is clear. The vast majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic global heating," Leah Sullivan, trade campaigner at the War on Want pressure group, told AFP. Since ISDS awards are taken from public money, "It's ordinary people who will have to pay for this," she said. AFP \</doc>

Though they have the world's highest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions and transfer polluting companies to less developed regions, in terms of confronting climate change, developed countries continue to shift the blame to developing countries, and have failed to fulfill their obligations. The familiar scene could have resurfaced and caused tensions at the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland. Xie Zhenhua, China Special Envoy for Climate Change, noted on Tuesday in Glasgow that "rich nations made a significant pledge to channel $100 billion a year to less wealthy nations by 2020 twelve years ago, and this hasn't been fulfilled." He underlined the significance of putting the Paris agreement into practice, saying it is important to translate the political will of countries into action, CGTN reported. As the COP26 summit continued, Western media reported that Chinese and Russian leaders were absent from the meeting, which they said "raised questions" on the countries' commitment to lower emissions. Chinese President Xi Jinping participated in the summitthrough a written statement on Monday, reaffirming China's goals and measures, and called on stronger global actions on climate change. Last year, the country announced its goals to achieve a carbon peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. Instead of reflecting on what they have done to the global climate, some Western politicians and activists have been pressuring developing countries. US President Joe Biden expressed his disappointment by claiming China and Russia "basically didn't show up" on the issue during the G20 summit in Rome. "Why should the UK be making changes when China is still polluting?" climate activist Greta Thunberg told BBC on Sunday. Observers noted that Western politicians are always busy peddling this narrative in an attempt to shift the responsibility of climate change, turning a blind eye to the fact that developed countries, even today, are the main culprits of CO2 emissions. Developed countries have been "polluting, managing, then transferring [the pollution to other regions]." But developing countries such as China and India, will not follow them in damaging the environment of the planet, a Chinese top environmental researcher told the Global Times. "The practice of politicizing the climate issue is not conducive to global climate cooperation," he said. Too many to record Accusing China and other developing countries in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is a common trick for some Westerners, who, after enjoying the benefits at the cost of polluting the environment for decades, now start to blame other countries for "emitting too much greenhouse gases." World Bank data released by the World Bank in March show the per-capita carbon emissions of China was 6.4 metric tons per citizen, 15th in the world, much fewer than major developed countries including the US (17.6), Canada (15.7), Australia (14.9) and South Korea (13.3). In 2018, the average CO2 emissions of high-income countries and regions was 10.3 metric tons per capita, while for China was 7.4. A previous study of two Stanford University scientists found that the US, Japan and many Western European nations managed to "'outsource' more than half of their CO2 emissions and evade responsibility for their share of the climate-altering pollution," by exporting their production needs to developing countries. Looking back at the last half century, developed countries led by the US contributed the overwhelming majority of emissions in their industrialization. World Bank statistics show that the US' CO2 emissions stayed more than 18 metric tons per capita between 1966 and 2008, with a high of 22.5 in 1973. Aside from domestic emissions, the US-led Western world started setting up factories in developing countries, including China and India, under pressure from environmentalists. Pollution-intensive companies accounted for 29.12 percent of all companies built in China by foreign investors in 1991, and 39 percent of foreign-invested companies in China were "highly polluting," Chinese media reported. The US outsourced about 11 percent of total consumption-based emissions, primarily to the developing world, according to the study, "Consumption-Based Accounting of CO2 Emissions," published in 2010. Of the CO2 emissions linked to goods and services consumed in many European countries, more than a third "actually occurred elsewhere," the report said. On the other hand, as the "world's factory," 29 percent of China's emissions were attributed to products shipped to developed countries, an article released on the Chinese carbon emissions website tanpaifang.com in 2014 said. For decades, the US' overseas factories have polluted developing nations, some of which even led to deadly incidents. On December 3, 1984, residents in Bhopal, India were poisoned by 40 tons of toxic gas from a factory owned by Union Carbide. The poison gas leak killed 15,000 more in the succeeding weeks, and "hundreds of thousands still suffer from the effects of exposure and contamination of land and water," the Guardian reported in an article in memory of the disaster's 25th anniversary. Developed countries first enjoyed rapid development, and then transferred pollution after the ecosystem was destroyed and the environment was polluted, while developing countries only take over polluting industries to defeat poverty, Li Haisheng, president of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, told the Global Times. But the world has a shared future for life on earth. He quoted Friedrich Engels as saying, "Let us not, however, flatter ourselves much on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us." Broken promise During the United Nations climate summit in 2009 in Copenhagen, developed countries promised to channel $100 billion a year to developing countries by 2020 to help them confront climate change, but the promise was not fulfilled, making it another example of how developing countries failing to act. Funding has become a focus in Glasgow, which, according to a Nature report in late October, has increased tensions between different parties before COP26 . The report quoted Saleemul Huq, director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development, as saying that "By the time we get to Glasgow, if they haven't given us another $100 billion [for 2021], then they are completely unable to meet their obligations." Developed countries claimed that they contributed $80 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2019, and $78 billion in 2018. Developed and developing countries also differ on what finance means. "To developing countries, the financing are public funds used for aid, but for the developed countries, they talk about the money to 'mobilize,'" Wang Mou from the research center of urban and environment studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who is also a member of the Chinese delegation to COP26 , said during a recent online conference. Even the funds developed countries claim to have given are inflated. For instance, they even count the travel fees of some experts. The Nature report also pointed out that road construction projects were counted as climate aid. "Funding is not a donation or aid, but an obligation of developed countries," noted an officer from the Chinese delegation on Monday. \</doc>

By Julian Shea in London | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-11 00:00 A demonstrator holds a banner during a protest, as the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) takes place, in London, on Nov 6, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Changing attitudes in China offer reason for optimism says designer The fact that the COP26 summit in Glasgow is a common topic of conversation all around the world can be viewed in two ways. One is that it demonstrates how desperate the climate change situation is, that it has become a globally inescapable subject. Another, more optimistic view, is that it demonstrates how so many people who until recently would not have shown any interest or awareness of the topic now understand and appreciate its importance. That second, more positive interpretation, is one supported by Chinese sustainable development expert, Chen Xiaohong, who over the course of the last 15 years has worked on developments across the country, from the Shanghai Disney neighborhood to the Shenzhen Zero Carbon Botanic Garden, completed a PhD thesis on encouraging low-carbon building projects in China, and thrown herself into the task of convincing the country of the importance of prioritizing low carbon and sustainability. After studying industrial and civil engineering at Harbin Engineering University, she worked as a structural engineer before embracing the One Planet Living philosophy of British sustainable development organization Bioregional, which began working on a development known as Jinshan or The Hill at Guangzhou in 2005. With her eyes opened to the potential of sustainable development, she has made it her mission to spread the word in China ever since, and as she told China Daily, it is a campaign that has led her to feel optimistic about the place of sustainability in the China of tomorrow. "The outlook is sunny," she said. "Since I started, I've seen such massive changes of attitude, and having seen those changes allows me to see the changes we can make in the future too, because now China is making this a priority. "The first five years were very hard  I would talk to people about the importance of carbon emissions, and people would say that I was wrong, and I was talking nonsense. They used to argue and wouldn't accept that climate change is a fact, but now opinions have changed. We had a hard time getting where we are, but now we're here, we can do better." One Planet Living's 10-point sustainable living program underpinned the development of Jinshan, a project built in partnership with property company China Merchants, which saw Chen on site for five years, convincing everyone of the feasibility of a project that seemed hard for many people to understand. "We were trying to build a zero fossil fuels community but China didn't have the capability for it at the time, so I had to communicate that they needed to make the effort to achieve it, then I set targets and we had to negotiate," she said. "They had to make a commitment to what they would achieve, and although not all of the targets were achieved, what we did manage was to get a lot of experience, and China Merchants taking the ideas away and applying them to other developments." Another thing that has made pushing the sustainability message a lot easier is a change of attitude at the top. "When I first tried to tell people about the principle of being zero carbon, it was difficult to promote because not many people appreciated the concept, so it felt like everything we were doing was from the bottom-up, trying to find partners who would agree with it, then selling that idea to stakeholders. Now, however, the government is setting targets and it's a top-down policy. That's exactly what China needs." Although she was committed to the Hill project for five years, Chen was also spreading the word of sustainability to anyone who would listen, and 15 years later, her investment of effort is being rewarded. "I was being invited to give training to industry professionals and gradually they've started to build these things into their thinking  it's not something that happens overnight, but from 2006 to now we've contributed a lot to the industry. Developers have taken the values of the Hill and they're already putting some of the ideas into practice, and thinking how they can fit them to the Chinese situation. It's gradual, but it's coming." Her professional experience in China and the United Kingdom enables her to incorporate the best aspects of both countries' approach to work. "Their backgrounds and systems are so different; I'm borrowing ideas from both," she explained. "China's good at making things cheaper, and the UK is good for frameworks for thinking about long-term targets, so taking the best of both can really help on the journey toward affordable zero-carbon developments." She is currently involved in getting the UK housing construction industry toward zero-carbon by 2030, whereas her work in China is more about developments such as urban communities, but whether the project is big or small, Chen's commitment to the cause is always absolute. "Once I discovered sustainability, I had such a strong passion for it, I wanted to show it to people in China, so they could see it too," she said. "The thing I learnt is that you have to believe it to achieve it  and I do believe it. For years, I've given so many talks and attended so many conferences, spreading the word, and now I know of so many small projects in China, other people who really believe it and try to put it into practice. I'm probably not the first person in China to talk about zero-carbon, but I'm one of the first. For 16 years, I've never stopped." \</doc>

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily | Updated: 2021-08-10 09:44 Waves lap ashore near condo buildings on the day the United Nations released a report with a dire warning for humanity in Sunny Isles, Florida on Aug 9, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] A long-awaited report by the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that it is a "statement of fact" that humanity is having a damaging effect on the climate, and it is "unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land". The report, issued ahead of the COP26 climate change conference to take place in Glasgow later this year, was described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as a "code red" warning for humanity about the damage it had done, and the urgent steps it needed to take to avoid making the situation even worse. "If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe," Guterres added. "But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success." Since 1970, the report said, global surface temperatures have risen faster than over any 50-year period in the past 2,000 years, with the results being seen in examples of extreme climate conditions, such as the bushfires raging across Greece and Turkey, and severe flooding seen in parts of Europe and China's Henan province. The report references more than 14,000 scientific papers, with 234 authors around the world contributing, and 195 governments involved, and it uses far more direct language than the last such document, published in 2013, which said human impact on the climate system was "clear". This time, UN Environment Program chief Inger Ansersen said: "Nobody's safe and it's getting worse faster. We must treat climate change as an immediate threat." Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, likened the visible impact of humanity's actions on the natural world to doping in sport. No grounds for optimism Moves toward net zero carbon emissions by 2050 could help stabilize rising temperatures, but report author Tamsin Edwards told Sky News that even this could not really be seen as grounds for optimism just yet. "We're not there, and we are on higher emissions pathways at the moment that would lead to much greater climate change," she said. Doug Parr, a climate scientist, said the recent wave of climate-related disasters was the result of previous years of inaction, and showed that this generation of world leaders was the "last that can afford to ignore" the severity of the situation. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "We know what must be done ... consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline." \</doc>

China and India have missed a U.N. deadline to submit fresh plans for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in time for the global body to include their pledges in a report for governments at this year's global climate summit, officials said Saturday. The world's two most populous countries are among dozens that failed to provide an update on their targets for curbing the release of planet-warming gases to the U.N. climate change agency by July 31. China is the country with the world's highest emissions, while India is third. The United States, which submitted its new target in April, is the second-biggest global emitter. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa welcomed that 110 signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had met the cut-off date, which was extended from the end of 2020 due to the pandemic. But she said it was "far from satisfactory" that only 58% had submitted their new targets in time. Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria and 82 other nations also failed to update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in time to include them in a report Espinosa's office is preparing for the U.N. climate change conference in November. Espinosa noted that a previous report found countries were doing too little to meet the goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times, let alone the more ambitious target of capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. "Recent extreme heat waves, droughts and floods acrossthe globe are a dire warning that much more needs to be done, and much more quickly, to change our current pathway," said Espinosa. "This can only be achieved through more ambitious NDCs." Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries set their own emissions reduction goals but are required to be transparent about them and jointly raise their targets over time to ensure that global warming remains at agreed acceptable levels. China did announce last year that it aims for its emissions of carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas - to peak before 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The target has yet to be formally included in its submission to the U.N., however, meaning it can't yet be counted toward the global effort. Earlier this month, the chair of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Alok Sharma of Britain, met with environment ministers from more than 50 countries, including the U.S. and China. Speaking to reporters after the meeting - the first physical meeting of its kind since the start of the pandemic - Sharma said participants had agreed the 1.5 degrees C goal must stay "within reach." "Between now and COP26 we must, and I promise you we will, make every single day count," he said.

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-21 09:38 A handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons, in central London on Oct 20, 2021. [Photo/Agencies] Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on the world's investors to back his nation's green ambitions. Speaking at the United Kingdom government's Global Investment Summit on Tuesday, Johnson said his country is focused on attracting overseas investment into green UK projects. He said both markets and governments must work collaboratively on tackling climate change. Johnson also took the opportunity to unveil a new partnership between his government and entrepreneur Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Catalyst that will see the billionaire direct 200 million pounds ($276 million) of investment into the UK economy, to fund green power initiatives. The UK government will match his investment. The Times newspaper said Gates' investment will help the UK move closer to its net-zero commitment by 2050. The Evening Standard newspaper quoted Johnson as saying: "I want to say to each and every one of those dollars, you are very welcome to the UK and you have come to the right place at the right time." He said in his speech to members of the business elite that both consumers and investors are clamoring for more green initiatives, which he said amounts to a "green industrial revolution". The prime minister's office said the UK hopes to attract 9.7 billion pounds of new overseas investment into green projects, which will create 30,000 additional jobs. The Financial Times said the event at the Science Museum in London was followed by meetings between government officials and executives from major companies about potential investments into green infrastructure and technology. But the UK's call for green investment was overshadowed by reaction from environmental groups to the government's net-zero strategy for cutting emissions, which was published on the same day. The BBC said environmental campaigners also expressed disappointment about the government confirming it will oppose a host of proposed amendments to its Environment Bill suggested by members of the House of Lords. The changes would have better protected ancient woodland and meant there will be less sewage in rivers. The Greener UK coalition told the broadcaster the government's decision was "hugely disappointing", especially coming just before the COP26 climate summit. The bill, which was introduced in 2019, sets out to improve the quality of air and water, reduce plastic pollution, reduce global warming, and restore habitat. Also, days ahead of COP26 , the United Nations has criticized the UK. It said in a report that London's intention of continuing to extract fossil fuels until the year 2030 is incompatible with ensuring global temperatures remain at safe levels. Ploy Achakulwisut, from the Stockholm Environment Institute, was a lead author of the report. The BBC quoted her as saying: "The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C." \</doc>

Climate change is set to devastate Kenya\' s tea production as the world\' s largest exporter faces rising temperatures, erratic rainfall and insect infestations, according to analysis released earlier this week. Tea is the world\' s most consumed drink after water and disruption in supply from the east African nation is predicted to have a global impact. A report from the charity Christian Aid outlined the various threats Kenya faces to its key black tea crop, as well as the dangers that other countries are likely to encounter as the planet continues to warm. Citing a peer-reviewed study, the report said that the quadruple threat of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, droughts and new insect infestations are forecast to destroy 26.2 percent of the country\' s optimal tea growing areas by 2050. And climate change is expected to reduce the areas with medium-quality growing conditions by nearly 40 percent in the same time frame.  For generations we have carefully cultivated our tea farms and we are proud that the tea that we grow here is the best in the world, said Richard Koskei, a tea farmer from Kenya\' s western highlands.  But climate change poses a real threat to us. We cannot predict seasons anymore, temperatures are rising, and rainfall is more erratic. Karimi Kinoti, head of Christian Aid\' s Africa division, said tea was just another example of how people living in countries least responsible for the climate crisis are bearing the heaviest burden.  Africans make up 17 percent of the world\' s population but we generate just 4 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the climate crisis, she said.  And yet it is we who are suffering the brunt of the impacts of climate change. \' World will be watching\' Britain, the biggest per capita tea consumer, is set to host crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow in November. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa climate and energy think tank, said the COP26 negotiations presented a vital opportunity for richer nations to provide proper support for poorer ones already having to adapt to climate change.  As a major historical polluter and the creator of the industrial revolution the UK has played a big part in the climate emergency which we Kenyans are suffering from, he said.  This year, as hosts of the G7 and COP26 , the UK has a big role to play in tackling it.  The whole world will be watching, especially Kenyan tea farmers and other people on the front lines of the climate crisis, added Adow. \</doc>

On October 22, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with new British Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Elizabeth Truss at the latter's request. Wang Yi said that China and Britain are both permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, and the development of China-Britain relations goes beyond the bilateral scope and has crucial impacts on regional and international situations. The two countries should maintain strategic communication, deepen mutual understanding, jointly manage differences, and push forward sound and stable development of bilateral ties, which not only serves the fundamental interests of the two countries, but also meets the common expectation of the international community. With differences in history, culture and development paths, it is normal for China and Britain to differ on some issues. The two sides need to carry out dialogue based on mutual respect and tolerance, seek common ground while reserving differences, strive to create positive momentum in bilateral relations, and provide a consistent outlook for the wider world. Wang Yi said that China and Britain enjoy distinct economic complementarity and huge potential for cooperation. The bilateral trade is expected to exceed 100 billion U.S. dollars this year. Chinese and British businesses are willing to engage in mutual investment, and there are broad prospects for bilateral cooperation in such fields as modern financial services, clean energy and digital economy. If sustained, such bilateral cooperation will surely provide strong support for the respective national development strategies of China and Britain. China supports Britain in hosting the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and hopes that the conference will achieve positive results. Wang Yi said that China expresses grave concerns over the establishment of the trilateral security partnership among the United States, Britain and Australia (AUKUS), and over their nuclear-powered submarine cooperation. This would be the first time that a nuclear-weapon state transfer nuclear-powered submarine to a non-nuclear-weapon state and offer it highly enriched uranium without being subject to international supervision and verification, which is bound to constitute a grave nuclear proliferation risk. Wang Yi stressed that the creation of a new military bloc in the region will trigger an arms race, provoke confrontation between major countries, and undermine regional peace and stability. China opposes the AUKUS, and urges the British side to handle the issue prudently and think twice before any further action, with the aim of maintaining the nuclear non-proliferation system. Truss said that for Britain and China, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, it is important to maintain regular communication. The two countries should strengthen high-level exchanges and strategic communication, deepen mutual understanding and practical cooperation in various fields, and push forward the development of their bilateral relations. Climate change is a key area of cooperation between the two sides. Britain is willing to strengthen cooperation with China to ensure the COP26 a success. Truss also explained and elaborated on the AUKUS. \</doc>

ANKARA, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey ratified the Paris Agreement just weeks ahead of the 26th UN climate change conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, making it the last G20 country to do so. However, Turkey still refused its classification as a "developed country." Turkish parliament on Wednesday said in a statement that Turkey would ratify the agreement as a "developing country," and would implement it based on "equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and assigned capabilities." Turkey has been a signatory to the Paris Agreement since April 2016, while it refused to ratify the deal by saying that it was unfair to place Turkey among the developed countries. Speaking at the UN General Assembly in September, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had not ratify the agreement "due to the injustices related to state obligations and burden-sharing." But following "progress made within the framework of the agreement recently," Turkey would ratify the deal "in conformity with the positive steps which will be taken," Erdogan added. Listed in Annex I by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, Ankara was obliged to provide financial help to developing countries. But Ankara defended that it had few responsibilities for greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, Turkey applied to the UNFCCC secretariat to have its name removed from the Annex I list and be included in the list of "developing countries," which can benefit from climate change funds. Its proposal will be discussed at the COP26 on Oct. 31, which will be held in Glasgow, Scotland to help illustrate the urgency of the problem of climate change, where nearly 200 nations will address precautions for eradicating carbon gas emissions. As Turkey becomes a party to the agreement, it will be able to benefit from the UN's Green Climate Fund, access other funds that provide climate finance and will benefit from the opportunity to trade in the newly formed international emission markets. After Turkey stepped up to be part of the accord, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved the "Green Economy Financing Programme" project on Sept. 28, which will provide Ankara with more than 500 million Euros. Another motivation that lies behind Turkey's move to ratify the deal is the possible trade difficulties it would face in the lack of the climate pledge. On June 8, experts and representatives of the business chambers of Turkey briefed the Turkish lawmakers on the issue of climate change and warned that Turkey would face serious trade barriers if it did not ratify the Paris Agreement. Ahmet Saygin Baban from the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) told the lawmakers that ratification of the deal may mitigate some adverse impacts of the European Union's planned carbon border tax. He recalled that Turkey makes 60 percent of its exports to the G7 countries and Turkish businesses would face a very serious loss with the carbon tax at the border, increased financing costs, along with loss of competitiveness. Moreover, the country would not be able to sign free trade agreements if the accord was not signed. If the EU collects a carbon tax between 30-50 euros per ton from Turkey it would cost one or two million euros annually, Baban noted. Enditem \</doc>

Pan Jiahua, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in his keynote speech that the international community has reached a political consensus on carbon neutrality, and more than 100 countries have proposed emission reduction targets. How to implement this target is an issue that all nations need to seriously consider. He pointed out emission reduction should not be seen as a burden, but as an opportunity for each country to change the development paradigm and think about how to achieve better development with less energy consumption. COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in November 2021, 197 participating countries agreed on the Glasgow Climate Pact to accelerate climate actions and reached a consensus on the implementation rules of the Paris Agreement.

NAIROBI, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The greater Horn of African countries should negotiate for climate financing as a bloc at the upcoming global climate summit slated for Glasgow, Scotland in November, experts said Thursday. The experts said at a virtual forum in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, convened by Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) that taking a common position at the summit will ensure that Horn of African states secure adequate funding and technology required to boost climate resilience. George Wamukoya, head of African Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES), said that a collective approach to negotiating for additional funding is key to hastening transition to green development pathways in the region. "The Horn of Africa region is highly vulnerable to climate change and should take a common stand during negotiations for funds required to implement adaptation and resilience programs at the Glasgow summit," said Wamukoya. He said that countries in the East and Horn of the African region have already identified key priorities at the 26th meeting of Conference of Parties ( COP 26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that include fair and sufficient allocation of adaptation financing. And other major items on the agenda of the negotiators from the region at COP 26 include support for nature-based interventions that enhance climate resilience. Fekadu Aleka, an Ethiopian environmentalist, said the Horn of African region should lobby for equitable share of multilateral funds aimed at strengthening their adaptive capacity in the face of climatic shocks. Sustained financing toward resilience programs including reforestation, adoption of cleaner energy sources and climate smart agriculture should be a priority for the region at the Glasgow summit, suggested Aleka, adding the region stood to gain from market based mechanisms to lower carbon emissions and accelerate a climate resilient future which is expected to be discussed at the upcoming global climate summit. Hana Hamadalla, a climate change expert from Sudan, said the Horn of Africa region should strengthen its negotiating capacity for climate financing through training, policy harmonization and multi-stakeholder engagement. Hamadalla suggested the region should adopt a common position to lobby for sufficient funding, technology and expertise required to address negative impacts of climate change like food insecurity and biodiversity loss. Payai John, a climate change specialist at South Sudan's Ministry of Environment, said the Horn of Africa region should leverage unity at the Glasgow summit to lobby for funds and innovations required to realize a green transition.

By Prime Sarmiento | China Daily | Updated: 2021-11-24 07:05 [Photo/IC] Climate change may be an abstract issue for many, but environmental anthropologist Serina Abdul Rahman points out that this is far from the case with a fishing community in the southern Malaysian state of Johor. Serina said the fisherfolk of the area are typical of the communities across the world now affected by erratic weather patterns that threaten their livelihoods. Serina, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, works with fishermen in Johor and has seen firsthand how stronger typhoons and rising sea levels have brought home the crisis for people dependent on the ocean for their survival. Declining fish catches are now their immediate concern. "In the past, some of these changes could be assumed to be the result of coastal development," she said. "But in 2021, this does not apply as everything had ground to a halt due to COVID-19. Yet we see a drastic reduction in fish catch." Serina said this is why it is "incredibly important" to promote a green recovery from the pandemic for economies to ensure sustainability and protect livelihoods. As Asian nations slowly recover from the pandemic, conducting mass vaccinations and reopening their economies, it is important for policymakers to include climate adaptation and mitigation measures in their policy planning, analysts said. Decarbonization of the economy was a key theme at recent high-level talks in the region. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting hosted by New Zealand, the leaders' summit ended on Nov 12 with a declaration acknowledging the need for "urgent and concrete action to transition to a climate-resilient future global economy". Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Nov 11 at the APEC CEO Summit that China will "advance green transition" and contribute to ecological conservation in the Asia-Pacific region. The country plans to hit peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The COVID-19 pandemic has "highlighted the need to urgently reorganize society toward one that is both ecologically sustainable and socially just," said Cesar Carlito Baclagon, regional finance campaigner at 350.org, an international environmental group. Billions affected The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2021 that over the past 50 years, natural hazards in the region have affected 6.9 billion people and killed more than 2 million. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, a think tank in Bangladesh, said a climate-resilient economic rebound is important because Asia is one of the regions that are most vulnerable to climate change, and it is also among the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. He said Bangladesh is "taking adaptation and building resilience as a major pathway". Saleemul cited a decision by Bangladesh's energy ministry to cancel plans to build 10 coal-fired power plants and the nation's plans to develop wind power plants. Other Asian countries are likewise shifting to renewables and gradually reducing their use of fossil fuel to reduce emissions and fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his nation will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 and that renewable energy sources will account for about half the country's power generation by 2030. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the country will end coal-fired power generation by 2050. South Korea also joined the Global Methane Pledge at the COP 26 climate summit, a global pact to cut methane emissions by more than 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels. Indonesia will stop building coal-fired power plants after 2023 and is set to impose a carbon tax in 2022. President Joko Widodo said Indonesia is rehabilitating 600,000 hectares of mangrove forests until 2024. "The recently concluded COP 26 has resulted in agreements that show only incremental steps forward rather than the monumental leaps needed to ensure a livable planet for all," he said. "This is where intergovernmental forums like the APEC could help bridge the gaps for insubstantial outcomes that were achieved during COP 26 ." \</doc>

Sunrise over River Clyde in Glasgow, the UK Photos: AFP A greenkeeper prepares Cowglen Golf Course in Glasgow, the UK in May 2021. Photo: VCG When her first electricity bill arrived, Hollie Osborne's dream of a "forever home" for herself and her two-year-old son began to fade. Her flat in a new social housing development, built in a handsome red-brick former school in Glasgow, represented a chance for the single mother to rebuild her life, after struggling with serious mental health issues. But as the harsh Scottish winter set in, the heating needed to be on constantly to stay warm - and the 150-pound ($200) monthly bills that began arriving represented half her income. "I was having to bring my boy in bed beside me, just because I couldn't afford to put the heating on," Osborne said. A spokesperson for the Home Group Scotland housing association that owns and manages the property said it was working to resolve issues with heating in some flats and offering support to tenants who had received high bills. Several miles up the road, Tizo Seleman and his partner Saada Mwalimu, both care workers who live with their baby daughter in a high-rise block in Glasgow's Springburn district, expect their once-onerous heating bills to shrink. In July, their inefficient old heaters were replaced with a low-carbon air-source heat pump system - part of a bid by their social housing landlord to make heat cheaper for tenants and slash climate-changing emissions. "I think it will make a real difference," predicted Seleman. Glasgow, a former industrial hub that will host the key COP26 UN climate negotiations in November, is one of those trying to drive the shift as part of the C40 Cities network, a group of nearly 100 major cities worldwide working for faster action on climate change. In Glasgow, which has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, which includes pulling water-source heat from the city's river, improving public transport, and planting more urban trees. It also is working to find ways to make homes climate-smart, comfortable, and cheaper to heat while ensuring those least able to afford the green shift are not left out. That is not an easy job in a port city noted for its winter cold, where around a quarter of residents pay more than 10 percent of their income for heat and restrictions on how historic homes can be modified make retrofits challenging. About 15 percent of Scotland's emissions come from heating homes, which makes finding low-carbon ways to keep families warm a priority as Britain aims to slash its emissions by 78 percent by 2035. Heat versus heritage\~ While Glasgow looks to the future, its streets are largely shaped by its past. The city is known for its sweeping terraces of red and blonde sandstone tenements - properties built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that contains multiple flats and make up about a fifth of Glasgow's homes, according to the council. The tenements - beloved for their high ceilings, original fireplaces, and other features - are also considered chilly and sometimes damp, while their stonework and historic features make efficiency upgrades more challenging. But one inner-city project aims to produce a blueprint for revamping them to modern energy efficiency standards without losing their character. The retrofit aims to reduce energy bills for homeowners by up to 90 percent. How the building functions will be monitored by researchers, with data used to inform future tenement upgrades. River power\~ As Glasgow looks for new green energy sources, it is turning in part to the wide Clyde River that winds through its city center. In much the same way as air-source heat devices work, large water-source heat pumps could draw residual heat from the Clyde, which is then piped to homes and businesses, providing a lower-carbon alternative to traditional heating systems. The river is already fueling one district heat network serving homes and businesses just outside Glasgow, and another planned system will power a high-tech "innovation district" in the center. One catch is that although renewable systems can compete on price with heat produced from fossil-fuel electricity, the gas boilers that still warm most homes remain even cheaper. Who pays? As leaders prepare to gather at the COP26 talks in Glasgow to hammer out rules designed to ramp up emissions cuts, one crucial question will be how to finance it all. Glasgow City Council leader Aitken said reaching the city's aim of net-zero emissions by 2030 is likely to require about 30 billion pounds ($41 billion) of investment, including 5 billion pounds just to retrofit homes to higher efficiency standards. "Governments alone can't deliver this. We need to have private investment come in," she said. The city will launch an investment prospectus around the time of the COP26 conference, laying out 10 major projects. Glasgow will work to make the voices of city leaders heard at the summit, she said, calling cities crucial players in the race to reach net-zero goals. "Cities are where most of the emissions are generated because it's where most of the people are - but it's also where you get the biggest gains in decarburization most quickly," she added.

By NICHOLAS STERN and ZOU JI | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-10-13 08:10 JIN DING/CHINA DAILY The world has reached a critical moment in history. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have an opportunity to create a safer and more prosperous world by pursuing a new model of sustainable, inclusive and resilient economic development and growth. This new form of growth offers the chance to make the global economy cleaner and more efficient based on strong investments and innovation. It will allow us to effectively tackle the global threats of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. We will be able to create new jobs and new markets for products and services as we develop and deploy the technologies of the future. Critically we will be able to transform our energy systems away from wasteful and polluting forms of generation and consumption that are based on fossil fuels. Instead we can power our economies with alternatives that do not damage lives and livelihoods through climate change and air pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 7 million people die each year worldwide from local air pollution, mostly due to the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. Many rapidly growing cities of developing and emerging market countries are suffering severe social and economic harm because workers and their families become sick or die from breathing dirty air. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its latest assessment of the science of climate change, and concluded that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are now affecting every part of the world, particularly by making many extreme weather events more frequent and intense. This summer we have witnessed heatwaves, flooding and wildfires across the world that have been made more severe by a rise in global temperature of just 1 C. The lives and livelihoods of millions of people are being damaged and destroyed. No country is too rich to be affected, but we also know that the poorest people are least able to protect themselves from these impacts. In November, countries will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, at the COP 26 United Nations climate change summit to try to accelerate efforts to tackle climate change. The United Kingdom has set the goal of keeping within reach the goal of limiting the rise in temperature by the end of this century to no more than 1.5 C. As the IPCC has pointed out, beyond this level of warming there are dangerously rising risks of potentially catastrophic impacts, such as destabilization of the polar ice sheets and profound disruption of both river flows from the Himalayas and of the monsoon season. To have a reasonable chance of limiting warming to a rise of 1.5 C, global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, will need to be eliminated by the middle of this century. Many countries have now committed to a target of net zero emissions where the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere each year is reduced to the same level as the amount removed annually through planting more trees and vegetation or technologies such as direct air capture. The success of COP 26 is not guaranteed. The developed countries have not yet honored their commitment to mobilize $100 billion annually from public and private sources to support climate action by the developing countries. The developed countries must demonstrate that they have kept their promise ahead of COP 26 and should lay out plans to increase financial support in subsequent years. They could, for instance, commit to providing $60 billion from bilateral sources and $90 billion from multilateral sources each year by 2025. But the new pledges for emissions cuts by 2030 that have been submitted ahead of COP 26 are collectively too weak and only consistent with a pathway to a potentially catastrophic warming of 2.7 C by the end of the century, according to the United Nations. China is already showing global leadership on climate change. President Xi Jinping made a truly historic announcement in September 2020 at the UN that China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Similarly, it was extremely significant that President Xi declared at the UN General Assembly recently that China will end all financial support for new coal power plants overseas. China can also show other countries how a large economy can be transformed by moving away from fossil fuels. Although it remains heavily dependent on coal for its energy, it is rapidly developing alternative sources of energy, such as renewables, and investing strongly in forms of transport such as electric vehicles that rely on clean power. As it makes that transformation, China will also benefit in the medium term from a diversification of energy sources, which will make market crises less likely. President Xi has also indicated that China will control the development of its domestic coal power, and will strictly regulate projects that result in both high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. The new set of instructions for dual controls on energy intensity and total energy consumption, which were announced last month, will encourage the deployment of more renewables. As the costs of new technologies fall and the leading group on carbon peaking and carbon neutrality increases coordinated action across government, the transition to sustainable growth should accelerate. If China is able to bring forward the peaking of its carbon dioxide emissions from 2030 by accelerating the transition to a strong, sustainable and resilient economy during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), it will help to make the whole world a more prosperous and peaceful place.

by Guo Shuang and Martina Fuchs LONDON/GENEVA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's idea of an ecological civilization could promote global biodiversity and climate change talks in the future, Nigel Topping, the United Kingdom's High Level Climate Action Champion for UN climate talks, has said. Topping made the remarks during an exclusive interview with Xinhua after attending the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). At the general debate of the UNGA, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. China's pledge regarding coal-fired power projects is indeed a big news item from the UN meeting, said Topping. "One of the ideas which come from China, which is the most exciting, is this idea of ecological civilization which, for me in two words, sums up what we're trying to build together," Topping said. "Ever since I heard the term 'ecological civilization', I was like 'yes', that's what we're all trying to build, that's what we have to build," he stressed. "Because if we don't build an ecological civilization, actually we continue to undermine the ecological foundations of our civilization." The British government appointed Topping in January 2020 as host of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. His tasks include driving actions from businesses, investors, organizations, cities, and regions on climate change and coordinating this work with governments and parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). "I think we have a very strong sense of the need to recognize that the economy is embedded in the ecology. It's not the other way around," he said, noting that the economy must be in service of ecology and society, not vice versa, and that is the "right relationship." Topping, with nearly two decades of experience working in the private sector, said "there's a lot of great work being done in greening the financial system in China." "The countries in the world which have the resources to invest overseas have a real responsibility to come together and make sure that that's really driving towards ecological civilization," he added. "Building on that, no coal finance, how do we really accelerate green finance everywhere in the world. There are a few areas I think for really strong collaboration." The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) will be convened in two parts this year and next year in Kunming, Yunnan Province, while the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) will take place in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. The two important events were like "brother and sister," Topping said. "My expectation is that these two COPs prove to be a turning point towards a decade of action." "We don't need to debate the problem anymore. We actually don't need to debate the goal. The goal is an ecological civilization, a regenerative civilization. Heal ecosystems, restore our lakes and rivers, restore the climate," he said. Enditem \</doc>

They could, for instance, commit to providing $60 billion from bilateral sources and $90 billion from multilateral sources each year by 2025. But the new pledges for emissions cuts by 2030 that have been submitted ahead of COP 26 are collectively too weak and only consistent with a pathway to a potentially catastrophic warming of 2.7 C by the end of the century, according to the United Nations. China is already showing global leadership on climate change. President Xi Jinping made a truly historic announcement in September 2020 at the UN that China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Similarly, it was extremely significant that President Xi declared at the UN General Assembly recently that China will end all financial support for new coal power plants overseas. China can also show other countries how a large economy can be transformed by moving away from fossil fuels. Although it remains heavily dependent on coal for its energy, it is rapidly developing alternative sources of energy, such as renewables, and investing strongly in forms of transport such as electric vehicles that rely on clean power. As it makes that transformation, China will also benefit in the medium term from a diversification of energy sources, which will make market crises less likely. President Xi has also indicated that China will control the development of its domestic coal power, and will strictly regulate projects that result in both high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. The new set of instructions for dual controls on energy intensity and total energy consumption, which were announced last month, will encourage the deployment of more renewables. As the costs of new technologies fall and the leading group on carbon peaking and carbon neutrality increases coordinated action across government, the transition to sustainable growth should accelerate. If China is able to bring forward the peaking of its carbon dioxide emissions from 2030 by accelerating the transition to a strong, sustainable and resilient economy during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), it will help to make the whole world a more prosperous and peaceful place.

TASHKENT, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has tasked his government to achieve a target of 8,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy by 2026. During a meeting on developing renewable energy, the government announced plans to build five solar power plants with a total capacity of 900 MW in the Khorezm, Bukhara, Kashkadarya, Namangan and Fergana regions next year, according to the president's press service Tuesday. Between 2022 and 2024, Uzbekistan is expected to attract 3 billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct investment to build 10 solar and wind power plants with a total capacity of about 3,000 MW. Over the next five years, the country will purchase equipment, components and materials worth 6 billion dollars to realize these clean energy projects, and measures will be taken to localize production of some components and materials needed, the report said. The Central Asian nation will set up two training centers by year's end to train 200 qualified specialists annually. At the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, Uzbekistan announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 35 percent by 2030.

The Glasgow Climate Pact that was adopted at COP 26 on Saturday will hopefully prove to be a milestone for the global response to climate change, as it acknowledges that the emissions commitments made by countries so far are nowhere near what are needed to avert this existential threat to humans and other life on Earth. In reaching a consensus on the need to come up with increased targets and actions to prevent planetary warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, although it has not yet averted the impending climate cataclysm, has hopefully set us on the path to doing so. Especially as the pact for the first time calls on countries to reduce their reliance on coal and stop subsidizing fossil fuels. And a promise has been made to end deforestation by 2030. What has added to this encouraging news is the joint declaration in the final days of COP 26 by China and the United States on enhancing responses to climate change in the 2020s. With a ray of hope in sight that the temperature rise can be kept to the 1.5 C target, it is important for all countries to take real actions. China has already made specific plans to ensure that its CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and it achieves carbon neutrality before 2060. However, whether developed countries will deliver on their commitment to supporting developing countries in their adaptation to and responding to climate change is the key to averting catastrophe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on this pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. It is essential for developed countries to realize that the financial and technological support they give to their developing counterparts is not charity. The emissions they discharged during their industrial development were much more than what the developing countries do today and they should be held responsible for most of the impacts from climate change. To a certain extent, this financial and technological support is the cost developed countries have to pay for the accumulated emissions they discharged in the course of their development. That explains why the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be maintained when dealing with climate change. Developed countries need to realize that their support in terms of both funds and technologies will make it possible for developing countries to do a better job in reducing their emissions and do their bit in the global fight against climate change. From this perspective, their support is crucial for more effective global climate change action. \~ \</doc>

BRASILIA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Actions to combat illegal logging in the Amazon and fight forest fires are the priorities of the Environmental Protection Action Plan established for 2022 by the state-run Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), according to the Friday edition of the Government Gazette. To combat fires in the area, the institute said it will hire 1,700 firefighters exclusively for the nine states of the Amazon basin, including Rondonia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Para, Amapa, Tocantins, Mato Grosso and Maranhao. Monthly environmental inspection reports will be expected, along with weekly reports from the Deforestation Combat Group in the Amazon, "to measure the fulfillment of the institutional goals," the article said. Preserving the Amazon is a requirement of several of Brazil's important trade partners, which is why fighting deforestation is among the government's priorities, it added. Ibama will invest some 50 million reais (about 9.7 million U.S. dollars) on the priority actions, with the bulk of the funds earmarked for hiring and training firefighters, buying personal protection equipment, and acquiring vehicles and helicopters for the Federal Brigades Program. At the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in early November 2021 in Glasgow, in the United Kingdom, Brazil committed to eradicating illegal logging by 2028, and cutting its emission of greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2030.

LONDON, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- Environmental activists from Extinction Rebellion have blocked entrances to a private airport on Saturday in Hampshire, England, according to the campaign group. The campaign members have blocked all major entrances to Farnborough Airport, "calling on the world's super-rich elite and governments to ditch private flights", according to the group's statement on Twitter. "Farnborough airport has 30,000 private flights a year, each with an average of 2.3 passengers, each passenger responsible for emitting 20x more carbon than passengers on an economy flight to Spain," said the statement. It added that Farnborough airport has permission to expand to 50,000 private flights a year. An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: "As world leaders gather for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this month, protesters are calling on the world's super-rich elite of celebrities, oligarchs and business leaders to ditch private flights." Protesters have accused the airport of "greenwashing" after it announced a switch to sustainable aviation fuel which is created using non-recyclable household waste. An airport spokeswoman said authorities were monitoring the situation and the airport was still fully operational. Enditem \</doc>

Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global Times As tackling climate change becomes an increasingly mainstream topic across the world, some Western media outlets have not missed the chance to show their imaginary moral superiority by pointing fingers at developing nations, with their artillery appears converging on India recently. In a Washington Post report on Monday, India's considered lockdown due to air pollution and China's recently increased coal production were interpreted as reflecting "the difficulty of combating global warming just after the end of a landmark UN conference."\~ As usual, Western media outlets choose to "observe" developing countries through magnifying lens, while turning a blind eye over the long-lasting nonfeasance of richer countries, especially the US, which is eagerly attempting to claim the leadership on the topic. Before the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), India had faced mounting pressure from the West, being urged to offer an exact goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions. A BBC report on September 20 claimed that "the world awaits India's net zero emission deadline." Though Indian officials expressed reluctance and discontent, the country still made a pledge at COP26 , promising to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. It won't be easy for India or any other country in the world. Behind the climate change crisis, the responsibility of the developed countries is clear for all to see. Following decades of industrialization, emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere and may continue to impact Earth's climate pattern for thousands of years to come.\~ Although it takes all parties to solve the climate problem, contradictions between development and emission reduction is an unavoidable issue for developing countries. For instance, according to the recently released Global Hunger Index 2021, India was ranked 101 out of 116 countries and regions. Pressing India to reduce emission, while ignoring its demand to speed up development, is both unfair and unreasonable. Ironically, the contradictions between development and emission reduction has appeared to be a whole other story among rich countries, such as the US. The Bush administration once withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol signed by the Clinton administration, citing that it could hurt the growth of the world's largest economy. Later in 2019, the Trump administration announced its exit from the Paris Agreement signed by the Obama administration. The Biden administration has managed to reverse the withdrawal, but it seems unable to guarantee the world that the US government can maintain its participation over the long-term. Besides the in-and-out game being played by the US, the country is still the world's largest exporter of solid waste and the largest consumer of plastic per capita. And as the world's largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gases, the US emits 3.3 times more carbon per capita than the global average.\~ There are 69 countries with a carbon price ranging from $1 to $139 per metric ton, and the US is not one of them, according to a CNBC report. Though Biden has set a new target for the US to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030, there are yet to be any tangible measures being rolled out.\~ The US has a long record of being irresponsible on climate change issues, and we genuinely hope the country could quit trifling with the climate crisis facing humanity. As for the Western media, they should look at the whole picture instead of distorting facts and deflate responsibility, if they really want to help address the actual problem.

QUITO, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador will expand the protected marine area at the Galapagos Islands by 60,000 square km, creating one of the largest nature reserves in the world, Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso announced on Monday. The islands will cover an area of 193,000 square km after the expansion, Lasso said at the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ) held in Glasgow of Britain from Monday to Tuesday, according to the president's Twitter account. "For us, Galapagos is a national treasure that must be protected. With the new reserve, we are making a decisive move towards an ecological transition," Lasso tweeted. Expanding the Galapagos reserve is possible thanks to the fishing sector's commitment to sustainability, said the ministry of production, foreign trade, investment and fisheries in a statement. In June, the government unveiled a new environmental public policy to incorporate the concept of "ecological transition," which is aimed at a more environmentally-friendly circular economy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Located 970 km from the continental coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands are home to numerous endemic species with a unique environment. The islands were declared a natural heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1978. Enditem \</doc>

JERUSALEM, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel has approved a plan to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the country's energy and environmental protection ministries said in a joint statement on Monday. The plan, with a budget of 725 million shekels (226 million U.S. dollars), was approved ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) which will be held from Oct. 31 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. Of the total amount, 450 million shekels will be allocated to grants for energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including conversion from fuels to electricity and energy storage in industry, the statement said. Steps will be taken to increase energy efficiency, including replacing old and inefficient technologies with new and cost-effective ones such as lighting systems, air conditioning and heat pumps, it said. About 150 million shekels will be allocated to plans for preparing for climate change and promoting sustainable energy in cities and towns, it said. At the same time, 60 million shekels will be allocated for the building infrastructure for electric transportation throughout the country, the statement said. The rest of the fund will be allocated to the generation of solar energy on rooftops, community energy, independent energy buildings, training and education in the field, it added. Enditem \</doc>

Chinese President Xi Jinping has been absent from the Group of 20 summit in Rome and this week's global climate talks in Scotland, drawing criticism from U.S. President Joe Biden and questions about China's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. China is the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and has pledged to begin reducing that output by 2030 and obtaining carbon neutrality by 2060. The U.S. and others have urged Beijing to make bigger commitments, but Xi's administration has strongly implied those will only come in exchange for political concessions. China has enforced tight travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic and Xi hasn't left the country since making a January 2020 trip to neighboring Myanmar. That was just weeks before the outbreak, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spread worldwide. China has come under heavy pressure to reveal more information about the origin of the pandemic and has been accused of mismanaging the outbreak and then seeking to cover up its mistakes. Like all Chinese leaders, Xi is extremely image conscious and his public appearances are carefully choreographed to avoid potentially embarrassing confrontations. His formerly heavy travel schedule took him across continents, with first lady Peng Liyuan, an accomplished musician, on hand to add a bit of glamor and a human touch. Those travels included trips to several African nations and a meeting with the former Japanese emperor in Tokyo. Xi rode in a gilded carriage with Britain's Queen Elizabeth and paid a visit to North Korea's capital that included a ride through city streets lined by tens of thousands of cheering citizens of the hard-line communist state. Such travels have underscored China's more assertive foreign policy, as the world's second-largest economy seeks to exert its influence beyond East Asia with Xi's signature "Belt and Road" overseas infrastructure investment program. The president's decision not to attend the meetings in Rome and Glasgow seems at odds with that policy, although Xi isn't alone in staying away. Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has aligned with China in opposing U.S. influence in world affairs, also remained at home. "I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China, with respect to China not showing up," Biden said Monday at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Responding to Biden's remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin yesterday said China's response to climate change "is concrete" and pointed to recent achievements in reforestation and renewable energy. Friction in bilateral relations is complicating cooperation on climate change between the two countries, said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Beijing's Renmin University. Biden has taken COP26 as "an important occasion for China and the U.S. to compete for global influence, ideology and image," said Shi, who attributed Xi's absence from the meetings to China's "zero tolerance" approach to dealing with the pandemic, which has been largely controlled within the country. Despite not leaving China, Xi has remained in contact with foreign heads of state through virtual meetings, said Zhao Kejin, who teaches international relations at Beijing's Tsinghua University. The U.S. wants Chinese cooperation in responding to climate change, but Beijing is also looking for changes in U.S. policy, including its support for the self-governing island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, Zhao said. "This result was produced by the U.S. failing to integrate ties with China into its overall multilateral relationships," Zhao said.

[Photo/Agencies] Nation's plan called £mbitious' but criticized for private-sector reliance The United Kingdom government's newly-published strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 has received mixed reviews from climate experts, with several saying it relies too heavily on the promise of private-sector investment. The Net Zero Strategy, released in tandem with the Heat and Buildings Strategy on Tuesday, sets out how the UK plans to deliver on its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The wide-ranging strategy includes plans to decrease fossil fuel imports, proliferate renewable energy infrastructure, take more combustion engines off the road, and improve energy efficiency in homes and buildings. As part of the strategy, the government announced around 6 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in fresh funding, taking the total pledged investment into sustainable projects to 26 billion since November last year, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. But the figure is dwarfed by the 90 billion pounds in private-sector funds the government said must be leveraged by 2030 in order to keep its net-zero objective on course. Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London, said the government's strategy is ambitious, but "the sums of investments on offer are modest". "If additional investments are not forthcoming, what is government's plan B? Or is this all that can ever be on offer from the government?" Siegert said. "The government has certainly set its stall out clearly, and obviously can be judged on delivering on the strategy. If it doesn't work out, our pathway to net zero will be ever more difficult to reach by 2050." Experts also pointed out that the government could have done more to exercise its regulatory powers in order to promote sustainable practices. Gavin Killip, a senior researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said the heat and buildings strategy, which was designed to decarbonize homes and buildings, came as a "big disappointment". "The level of financial support is too small, and too many important elements have been ignored: no tighter regulations for building energy efficiency; no long-term support for the industry expected to do the installation and maintenance work," Killip said. "The whole strategy is based on urging the private sector to invest and innovate but without enough of a regulatory framework from the government." Released just ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, or COP26 , the Net Zero Strategy was commended by some for its ambition and detail. Emily Shuckburgh, director of Cambridge Zero at the University of Cambridge, said it "lays out a blueprint to transform all aspects of our society over the coming decade". "In the run-up to COP26 , it is exciting to see the UK leading the way in developing a strategy that will determine all our futures," Shuckburgh said. Tim Chapman, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said he was "delighted" to see the government take steps to end "our addiction to fossil fuels". "Headline-grabbing policies of subsidies for heat pumps are balanced by well-thought-through remedies, such as future low-carbon electricity being made much more competitive with gas prices," Chapman said. \</doc>

By Zheng Xin | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-10-21 16:10 A worker checks natural gas pipelines at a gas compressor station in Tangshan, Hebei province. [Photo/Xinhua] Experts called for urgent action on reliable alternative energy solutions to avoid losses in energy transition during a webinar organized jointly by the International Finance Forum, the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and the Paulson Institute. "Considering the global context of climate change, we probably need to think about our direction of fast actions on climate change," said Zhu Xian, vice-president and general-sectary of IFF. "At the same time we also need to jointly raise the concern and review the fragility of some renewable energies and the affordability of future energy supply, which is very important for global economies." The three organizations jointly held a series of seminar to pave the way for a debate on forming a global carbon pricing mechanism during the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow this November. The first webinar was held in July. Over 40 high ranking officials, policy makers and scholars from China, the European Union and the United States and representatives of the International Monetary Fund and International Energy Agency participated in the recent webinar on the fight against climate change ahead of the upcoming Glasgow COP26 . The gap between the increasing demand for energy and the urgent goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are challenges for all international leaders, he said. "To fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement, there is only one narrow path for organizations, a significant and much more rapid shift in the energy mix between fossil fuel s and carbon free sources of energy such as renewables and nuclear," said Alphandery. The webinar had three sessions with the first one stressing the urgency to curb the growth in the global stocks of carbon. The use of renewable energy has increased rapidly in most countries around the world in recent years. However, according to the analysis of International Energy Agency, the investment in low-carbon energy sector should be doubled or increased further in the coming decade on the current base, which is about $2 trillion a year globally, to achieve the net zero goal. The investment growth in emerging markets should increase more rapidly, than that in developed countries, which is a clear challenge during the energy transition process, it said. As a consensus, carbon pricing has been widely regarded as an ideal incentive for promoting low-carbon energy sector and reversing the trend of carbon emissions, according to IMF research. The IMF is working on an international carbon price floor proposal that sets different minimum carbon prices for countries at different developing levels to get emission on track for the 2 centigrade goal against global warming, while addressing competitiveness concerns. "For global leadership, it is the critical moment for governments to shift from what to do to how to do it effectively and timely," said Zhu Xian. "We need to see time-bond action road-maps sector by sector as that will leave an important footprint in our decarbonization efforts." He also encouraged governments to demonstrate leadership via efficient implementation of the policies and funding low-carbon sectors for emerging markets, facilitating the commercialization and affordability of decarbonization innovations and technologies and supporting related technology transformations. \</doc>

CANBERRA, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has lost ground as the nation's preferred leader, a poll has found. The latest Newspoll, which was published on Sunday night, revealed that the leader of the opposition Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, has closed the gap to Morrison. It found that 46 percent of respondents identified Morrison as their preferred PM compared to 38 percent for Albanese. It is the tightest gap between the two since March 2020 and marks a major turnaround from February when Morrison led 61-26. The poll of 1,524 voters was taken in the wake of Morrison's appearance at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow where he committed to a 2050 net zero emissions target. Albanese has been a fierce critic of Morrison's signature climate policy, describing it as a "scam" that lacks detail. The Labor leader promised that he would release his own climate policy before the end of 2021. According to Newspoll, Labor leads Morrison's coalition 53-47 on a two-party preferred basis, a slight swing in the government's favor from 54-46 at the start of October. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they intend to vote Labor as their first preference at the next general election, which is due to be held by May 2022, compared to 37 percent for the coalition.

ABUJA, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday arrived in Abuja and met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and some officials, discussing the U.S. administration's interest in the West African country. A statement issued by the Nigerian presidency said Buhari and Blinken held talks in Abuja over issues including regional security and climate change. It quoted Blinken as saying the United States and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hope for better partnerships. The U.S. top diplomat, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian leader earlier in the year, hailed the contributions of Buhari to the protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference held in Glasgow of Scotland. At a joint press conference with Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama in Abuja on Thursday, Blinken highlighted a number of areas that the United States is willing to further cooperate with Nigeria, including security, climate change, education, health, and work with the West African country in important critical infrastructure under the USAID framework. Nigeria is the second leg of Blinken's three-country tour in Africa starting in Kenya on Wednesday, which will be rounded off in Senegal later this week. Enditem \</doc>

For many people in developing nations, actions taken by the world community against climate change now and in the future mean the difference between livelihood and sacrifice, and possibly between survival and perishing. The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26 , being held in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct 31 to Nov 12, has heard that developing countries, which have set ambitious goals at the gathering, are prepared to make sacrifices, but they cannot succeed without help from rich nations. Experts said the leaders of many countries have pointed out that the developing world urgently needs from advanced economies the funding and technology for alternative lifestyles, clean and renewable energy, pollution-free transportation, and industrial development, among other assistance. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that commitment to $100 billion in climate finance support annually for developing nations needs to become a reality. "Those suffering the most\u-243 Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States\u-243 need urgent funding, more public climate finance, more overseas development aid, more grants and easier access to funding," he said. Developed countries pledged at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009 to collectively mobilize $100 billion annually to provide financial support to help developing nations tackle climate change. However, they failed to meet that promise, and will only reach the target in 2023\u-243 three years late\u-243 according to a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business' Bharti Institute of Public Policy, said, "The $100 billion pledge that has long been seen as a minimum for climate finance must increase over time." COP 26 on Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi not only urged developed nations to fulfill their promises, but also said, "India expects developed countries to provide climate financing of $1 trillion at the earliest." Prakash said, "India's demand is now based on the historical failure in delivering the $100 billion in 2020." In a summit statement issued on Oct 26, the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged advanced economies to "fulfill their commitment of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 through 2025 to support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions of developing countries". Similar appeals were voiced by a number of state leaders. Modi said the transfer of climate financing and low-cost climate technologies has become more important. "It is necessary that as we track the progress made in climate mitigation, we should also track climate finance," he said. A total of 78 out of 213 countries and regions have per capita carbon emissions above the world average, of which 56 are advanced economies, according to a report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Referring in particular to the United States, Modi called for pressure to be placed on those countries that have fulfilled only a small part of the pledge, but failed in the main to deliver on their promise to provide climate financing. Game changer Prakash said India has called for technology transfer and adaptation financing for those countries that have not contributed historically to climate change, but are bearing the brunt of it. Speaking at COP 26 , Indonesian President Joko Widodo noted that climate financing from developed countries is "a game changer" in developing economies' mitigation and adaptation efforts. He urged developed economies to contribute more funding and to share technology to help his nation's efforts to reduce emissions. Widodo said Indonesia, which is Southeast Asia's biggest economy, "will be able to contribute faster to the world's net-zero emissions goal", but the key questions are the amount that developed countries contribute and the type of technology transfers they can provide. He said countries such as his, which have large green areas and re-greening potential, and nations that can contribute to carbon sequestration, need support and contributions from developed countries. Speaking at the COP 26 World Leaders Summit in Glasgow on Monday, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said the international community must fully deliver on its financial commitments while setting more ambitious goals after 2025. Although Vietnam is a developing country that has experienced industrialization over the past three decades, he said the nation would capitalize on its advantages in renewable energy and take stronger measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said implementation of developing countries' commitments to address climate change depends on the amount of support they receive. Developed nations must fulfill their pledges, he said. Government leaders from Libya, Jamaica and Palestine made similar appeals. Kate Nkatha, commercial director of nonprofit organization Fairtrade Africa, said robust financing combined with the uptake of clean technologies is required to strengthen the resilience of Africa's key sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. To limit global warming to 1.5 C, a goal indicated in the Paris Agreement of 2015, total climate financing needs to rise by an average of $436 billion annually from last year to 2030, according to a report by five green groups. Surabi Menon, vice-president of ClimateWorks Foundation, one of the groups that worked on the report, said: "Many of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are also the least responsible for the historic emissions that are driving today's crisis. It is important to support these countries with the financial and technological resources they need in order to equitably address climate change on a global scale." In a report released in August titled "Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis", IPCC discovered that unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5 C or even 2 C will be beyond reach. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, president of the Maldives, told COP 26 on Tuesday that a global average temperature rise beyond 1.5 C constitutes a "death sentence" for small island nations such as his. Similar sentiments were voiced by leaders of other low-lying island states. More than 80 percent of the land area of the Maldives is less than 1 meter above sea level. "Our islands are slowly being eaten by the sea, one by one. If we do not reverse this trend, the Maldives will cease to exist by the end of the century," Solih said. Ecosystems hit According to a UN Environment Programme report released on Oct 26, individual countries' current pledges will only cut emissions by 7.5 percent by 2030, but a 55 percent reduction is required to meet the Paris goal of maintaining global temperatures below 1.5 C. Judging by the latest pledges, the world could be heading to a temperature rise of 2.7 C this century. Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director, said the climate crisis has taken a toll on ecosystems and livelihoods, and strong measures are needed to reduce carbon emissions and accelerate a green transition. Despite having limited resources compared with developed countries, many developing nations have announced or reaffirmed ambitious climate goals at COP 26 . Indonesia has committed to reduce emissions by 29 percent under a business-as-usual scenario, and by 41 percent with international support, by 2030. The country is also rehabilitating 600,000 hectares of mangrove forests by 2024 and developing its tropical forests into a carbon sink by 2030. A carbon sink is a land or ocean mass that can take in carbon, most notably carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, noting that his country was among the first to submit a revised NDC, said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero emissions by 2065. Gidon Bromberg, director at Ecopeace Middle East, an environmental organization, said that with the climate crisis hitting that region harder than most parts of the world, the response of individual countries is insufficient to meet the challenge. "The Middle East is forecast to receive or to suffer from increased temperatures of between 4 and 7 degrees, and many areas of the region are already extremely hot for the long summer periods. ...Areas outdoors in the Middle East will become increasingly unlivable for extended periods of time," said Bromberg, who is attending the Glasgow conference. According to Modi, India will target net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, although this is two decades behind the COP 26 goal. Prakash said, "India needs to develop and decarbonize, but we will do it at our own pace, as there is a developmental need that India has to fulfill." He added that India has been an active member of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, which has met twice to strategize the voice of the Global South. "India feels that there should be climate justice, and so industrialized nations that have contributed to much of climate change as we see it today must move to net-zero by 2030," said Prakash, the coordinating lead author of IPCC's 2019 Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Prakash said the Global North has looked for cheaper options, such as market-based mechanisms for carbon credits, to show progress on net-zero, but refrains from sharing technology. "Most of the money which has been pledged in the name of adaptation finance is via loans, not granted in aid," he added. Main problem John Ross, a senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, posted on MRonline that the Global South\u-243 which refers to less economically developed countries\u-243 is being fundamentally discriminated against by advanced countries, in particular the US. These countries are the chief climate change problem due to their far higher per capita carbon emissions than developing nations, Ross said. Furthermore, the policy positions advanced by Washington are a demand that advanced countries, in particular the US, should be given a privileged position in terms of the right to emit far more carbon per person than developing countries. "This is unacceptable from the point of view of justice, democracy, the equality of nations, and even racially," said Ross, a former director of economic and business policy for the mayor of London. Former US vice-president Al Gore, who is an environmentalist, told Xinhua News Agency in Glasgow on Tuesday that political mutual trust between the wealthier and low-income countries is essential for global cooperation on climate change. Gore said every nation, rich or poor, has an important role to play in dealing with climate change, adding that countries that benefited from early industrialization processes have a responsibility to do more in solving the problems resulting from a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Bolivian President Luis Arce said: "The solution to the climate crisis will not be achieved with more green capitalism or more global carbon markets. The solution is civilizational change\u-243 to move toward an alternative model to capitalism." Chandran Nair, founder and CEO of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, a think tank based in Hong Kong, said it is unsurprising that climate financing goals have not been met by rich countries, and it is important for emerging nations to adopt a different development model that suits their "capacity and situation". In addition to climate goals, poor developing countries have other tasks to focus on, including economic development and poverty alleviation, Nair said, adding that per capita emissions in many poor countries are extremely low compared with those in rich countries. Xinhua quoted Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as saying there are three main priorities for efforts to tackle climate change. He said the first is for the international community to acknowledge that people living in armed conflicts and in situations affected by climate change are the most vulnerable and need to be given priority. The second is for a collective effort to be made by the international community to focus on genuine and meaningful mitigation measures to reduce carbon emissions and avert the climate crisis. "The third one is really linked to the most vulnerable (populations). They should be top of the list in terms of support, but the fact of the matter today is that they are totally neglected," Mardini said. Whether in Mali, Niger or Afghanistan, countries where the ICRC has a presence, people are struggling with the consequences of climate change, with more frequent floods, drought, desertification, diminishing water tables and hardship, he said. "I think we are reaching a point where collective action needs to be taken by all states today," he added. Jan Yumul in Hong Kong and Xinhua contributed to this report.

China\' s cabinet has revealed a new action plan to peak the nation\' s carbon emissions by 2030, listing objectives that need to be met in phases to achieve the reduction in carbon intensity, reports Caixin. The State Council plan highlights 10 fields where actions need to be taken, including green and low-carbon energy transition and the industry sector, while reiterating the targets of an 18% cut in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP\- also known as  CO2 emissions intensity \- by 2025 from the 2020 level, and a 65% cut in such intensity by 2030 compared with the 2005 level. The document was issued just two days after the Communist Party\' s Central Committee and the State Council jointly released  working guidance for reaching carbon neutrality over the coming decades, laying out general plans for different segments of the country\' s economy and a transition away from fossil fuels. The documents also come days before the UN Climate Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ). Earlier this month, Premier Li Keqiang noted at a meeting of the national energy committee that the country should set a phased timetable and a roadmap to bring its carbon emissions to a peak. In September last year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced China would peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. \</doc>

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- The British capital welcomes Chinese investment, including in the city's infrastructure, Mayor of London Sadiq Kahn has said. Asked about the concerns by some British politicians over Chinese investment, Kahn said Thursday that Chinese investment has been contributing to the growth of the city. London has "invested hugely" in the expansion of its transportation system and "Chinese companies helped us with the electric buses, electric taxis. It is a working partnership", he told reporters in Glasgow, Scotland. The London mayor made the remarks after a meeting of C40, a network of mayors of nearly 100 world-leading cities collaborating to deliver the urgent action needed to confront the climate crisis, in Glasgow. The mayors' meeting came as the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are being held in the largest Scottish city. At least 500 electric buses are running in the British capital under the partnership between Chinese clean energy car maker BYD and Britain's largest bus and coach manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL). "You've got to invest in the infrastructure. If you don't invest in infrastructure, the city will be in a bad position. Cities can't grow. Our city is growing. You've got to plan for the growth," Kahn said. Enditem \</doc>

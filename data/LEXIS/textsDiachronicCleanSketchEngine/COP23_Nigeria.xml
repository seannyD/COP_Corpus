The 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has ended in Bonn, Germany without resolving the issues on the agenda. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the United States team had been stationed in Bonn during the conference to follow the negotiations. It ensured that the conference's results were neither 'further', nor 'faster', and certainly not 'together'. An analysis of the results by CSE, says: 'The US' strong and obstructionist attitude in the COP process ensured that progress was extremely slow and hampered on several occasions and the old divide between developed and developing nations remained.'' Ahead of the COP, the US had signalled that it would engage in the negotiations process to secure its interests and had talked of a possible re-negotiation of the Paris Agreement to enable it to rejoin the Agreement. 'Instead of working together and standing united against the US intransigence, the old bickering between developed and developing nations continued at Bonn,' Chandra Bhushan, deputy director-general, CSE, said. \</doc>

In a few days, delegates from all over the world will gather at the World Conference Centre in the historic city of Bonn, two years after the epoch-making conference at which the Paris Agreement was signed. These delegates will gather for the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Only two years ago, the Paris agreement made the record as the second most supported treaty in the history of the United Nations, after the Montreal Protocol with 195 countries signing, 175 of that number signing in a single day, and 169 of that number having ratified as of October 2017. To say that Paris was historic, would be an understatement. Two years after, we return to Bonn, to determine how far we have come in implementation in the past two years and to negotiate on important issues like financing, nationally determined contributions of states, transparency, adaptation, policy, technology and energy governance. What bothers me though, is whether Nigeria is truly ready for the COP 23 . It was exhilarating to see President Muhammadu Buhari sign the Paris Agreement on the sidelines of the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), and ratify it shortly thereafter, and even more for the country to come up with its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) almost immediately. Yet, it is sad to see that we have not lived up to the expectations of this ambitious INDCs (now Nationally Determined Contributions) which include a commitment to reduce our carbon emission by 20 per cent unconditionally. And if given international assistance, to rise to 45 per cent with key activities including working towards ending gas flaring by 2030, working towards off-grid solar PV of 13GW (13,000MW), efficient gas generators, two per cent per year energy efficiency (30 per cent by 2030), transport shift from car to mass transit, improved electricity grid and climate smart agriculture and reforestation, and all of these while growing the economy at 5 per cent annually. For a country with a teeming population of which, according to a 2016 report by the National Bureau of Statistics has about 67.1 per cent of its demography living in poverty, increasing the likelihood of health risks and vulnerability to climate change effects, the country has done very little to show its commitment to its Nationally determined Contributions (NDC's), but again, perhaps Nigeria is renowned for its ratification of international treaties without any real follow-through plan of action, a reflection of the nationally rash manner of drafting laws and policies without any implementation structure. Nigeria has the ninth largest gas reserves in the world, and for a country that has committed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 per cent unconditionally, there should have been positive and intentional actions towards utilising this opportunity and transitioning quickly from a crude-dependent world to, at the very least, a gas regime. Yet, we rank as one of the top five gas flaring countries in the world as at 2016, eight years after the late President YarÂ£dua put together the National Gas Master Plan that included putting an end to gas flaring. It has been mooted that considering the state of Nigeria's economy, we cannot immediately transition from a heavily carbon dependent economy to a no-carbon economy. No doubt, therefore the workable solution would be to tap into our gas resources and transition first to low carbon, and eventually no carbon. Yet, nothing has been done to utilise the nation's vast gas reserves. Beyond gas, Nigeria has done very little to utilise its solar, wind, and most especially waste to power potential. For a country that generates 24 million tonnes of waste annually, it would not be too much to look into a waste to power plant that will in one breath clean up the country and still provide electricity for the 75 million people who do not have access to electricity. That a country blessed with so much resource for green and sustainable development is bent on oil for which we have seen no tangible development, and still has a pride of place as the country with the second highest electricity access deficit in the world is a reason to question our readiness for COP 23 . The issue of the Sovereign Green Bond is another matter, as it has been expected since February this year when it was announced, and is still a proposed Bond as the country goes to the COP 23 , seeking cap-in-hand to access the Green Climate Fund (GCF) with no concrete evidence of what it has done with renewable energy investments like the Greenwish $280 million. Since the signing of the National budget also in June, there is yet to be activity on the Renewable Energy Micro Utility programme (REMU) and the Federal Ministry of Environment's afforestation programme, both of which are included in the budget. Nicaragua, a country who has not signed to the Paris Agreement, has been declared by the World Bank as a 'clean energy haven'. More than half of the nation's energy comes from geothermic, wind, solar and wave energy. So when Nigeria is conceitedly calling the Nicaraguan nation to the Paris Agreement table at the COP 23 , what exactly will we be saying? Caleb Adebayo is a climate writer with Climate Tracker, an environmentalist and a lawyer. \</doc>

From: Laide Raheem, Abeokuta The 11th National Council on Environment (NCE) meeting will begin, on Monday, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The NCE meeting, with the theme: 'Unlocking the Investment Opportunities in the Environment Sector Towards Nigeria's Economic Recovery, Diversification, Growth and Sustainable Development', will be held between October 16 and October 18, 2017. According to the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, Dr. Mahmood Usman Ahmed, while briefing journalists on Sunday in Abeokuta, the three day council meeting will kick off with a technical session by stakeholders in environment sector. Ahmed, who disclosed that delegates from the 36 states of the federation, including the FCT, are expected to attend the NCE, said climate change, drought, renewable energy, waste management and environmental health among other issues, will top the discussions at the meeting. He also said the Council will review various decisions taken at the last year's meeting, to establish their success or otherwise. Meanwhile, the Permanent Secretary, however, said Nigeria will be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held from November 6 to 17 in Bonn, Germany, to attract funds to develop Nigeria's renewable energy programme as well as getting investors to invest in its environmental potentials. \</doc>

After two weeks of deliberations, negotiations and meetings dragging late into the night, the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties (COP) has come to a close in Bonn, Germany. Questions linger however; questions on what took place in Bonn, questions as to the landmark decisions that were made, questions as to implementation plans over the next one year. These questions, I will attempt to answer in this memo from Bonn. I could have been writing this from a packed press briefing room somewhere in the Bonn Zone, but I am writing this from Nigeria, where the Paris Agreement cries to be implemented. This is why the memo from Bonn means a lot to me, and I am writing first to you as fellow countrymen, not as the government or office holders, but as everyday people, and I am trying to let you know that what happened in Bonn is your business too. This year's Conference of Parties gives us reason to re-assess our priorities, ad rethink our game plan as a country. This year was the first year the COP was chaired by a small island state- Fiji -and the push, drive and commitment of fellow small island states to see their goals achieved in the negotiations was palpable. And their goals are goals that concern developing nations, chief among which was the clamor for financing from developed countries through the loss and damage (L and D) dedicated financing mechanisms. Expectedly, developed countries antagonized the move, as accepting the concept of loss and damage would mean their acceptance of the fact that developed countries have caused major irreparable loss to the rest of the world. Germany had earlier opened the Conference on the first day with an announcement of an additional 100 million Euros to support climate change adaptation in developing countries, it is ironical then why it was difficult for a bloc of countries to which they belong to commit to financing for loss and damage? This very easily shows the rest of the world how developed countries will not accept responsibility quickly. In fact, the European Union and Australia suddenly began to raise claims of there being no scientific proof linking climate change to extreme weather conditions. What this portends for us in this part of the world, is a need to start thinking ahead; developing financing methods to cushion budget shortfalls in addressing issues of climate change, potential loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation. I have suggested elsewhere that the African Development Bank should fly Green Bonds which are increasingly becoming attractive in the international stock market. Also, de-risking financial instruments, and generally pooling capital market investments for Green development is a great way of financing climate in the Nigeria. There should also be the consideration of a regional capital market for Africa to float such bonds in order to attract private sector funding on a continental level. In order to do this, there is a dire need for knowledge dissemination on green investments to provide a repository for financial analysts, investors and private actors to properly understand the climate investment market. There is also the need to use local expertise to pool investments with a view to benefiting local communities, who are most affected by the effects of climate change. The Abidjan Declaration of ECOWAS concluded in June this year speaks to this. Some other very interesting occurrences at the COP this year was Syria's signing of the Paris Agreement, something many have praised, but a few have maligned as being not well thought out for a war-torn country. Despite the criticisms, the move remains a commendable one, and one that typifies the United States as the child in the circle being taunted by other children for peeing her pants. Another development which puts Trump's government on edge is the 'We are Still In' movement which was showcased at the COP by Governor Jerry Brown of California, a movement that brings thousands of US citizens together as they continue implementing the Paris Agreement, regardless of Trump's stance. The lesson to take away from this is that we, the citizens, are powerful, and that if we should one by one commit to taking action to combat climate change and its effects, we can do a lot of good, even more for our country that has signed the Paris Agreement. At the COP, the Gender Action Plan was also launched for the first time, a plan of action to ensure more inclusiveness for the female gender in climate activities; negotiations, high-level decisions, policy making, adaptation and mitigation programmes, loss and damage activities, financing etc. It is laudable because the Paris Agreement and its eventual success had women at the forefront and still does. There is no doubt that much can be achieved with more women involvement in decision making. \</doc>

Bonn, 5 May 2017- In a next round of UN climate change negotiations, nations are meeting from 8 - 18 May 2017 to further develop the guidelines needed to fully implement the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement now and over the decades to come. Issues under discussion range from ensuring transparency on the reporting of climate action by nations to the provision of climate finance. Next to the negotiations on the operational rules of the Agreement, which are scheduled to be completed in 2018, governments will also prepare the budget of the Bonn-based UNFCCC secretariat. The budget is designed to support governments implement the Paris Agreement and provide a range of assistance to developing countries to help them meet their climate action plans or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 'The May meeting provides governments with the opportunity to clearly advance on the implementation guidelines for making the Paris Agreement fully operational while advancing preparations for the assessment, to take place next year, on progress since Paris,' said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UNFCCC. 'The May meeting will also prepare the next budget for the secretariat that governments will need to take forward the implementation of their Paris Agreement, 'she added. The May meeting is a staging-post for the annual climate change conference - COP23 - which will be held in November 2017 and the preparation of its key outcomes. The final budget is also set to be agreed at COP23 . Specifically, they will focus on efforts to mobilize diverse groups of stakeholders, including the private sector, for urban services and agriculture, forestry and other land use activities with high emission reduction potential and sustainable development benefits. The Climate Action Fair is taking place against the backdrop of continuing global momentum including a growing wealth of policy-making that promises to embed the transition to a low carbon, resilient and sustainable world. At the May meeting, the Grantham Institute which is part of the London School of Economics, will unveil findings spotlighting the world-wide growth in climate or climate-related laws pre-and post-Paris 2015. 'I look forward to these findings,' said Espinosa. 'In many ways, they are the proverbial 'proof in the pudding' as the implementation of both the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals hinges on solid national policies that set a clear direction for action,' she added. Espinosa said the secretariat was also looking forward to welcoming members of the Fijian Government including the Prime Minister at the May sessions. Fiji will be the COP23 president at the November conference. The May meeting will also see the first meeting of the newly established Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB). Established by the Paris Agreement, this new and critically important institution will boost capacity building for climate action in developing countries. \</doc>

The UN Climate Change Secretariat on Friday inaugurated a new portal to support theTalanoa Diaologue.The new portal is aimed at encouraging international conversation for countries to check progress and seek increase global ambition to meet the Paris Climate Change Agreement. A statement signed by UNFCC Spokesperson, Mr Nick Nuttall, said through the portal, all countries and other stakeholders, including business, investors, cities, regions and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), would be able to make submissions into the Talanoa Dialogue.The Dialogue was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference COP23 in Bonn in Nov. 2017, and will run throughout 2018.The Paris Agreement's central goal is to keep the global average temperature rise to below 2C degrees and as close as possible to 1.5C. Nuttall said the dialogue also centered around three central questions of "Where are we, Where do we want to go, and How do we get there''.He added that countries and non-Party stakeholders would be contributing ideas, recommendations and information that could assist the world in taking climate action to the next level. This according to him is to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement and support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."Present global ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare societies to resist increasing climate change is not enough to achieve this under the present national climate action plans known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). "The portal is the gateway for the Talanoa Dialogue. It represents the central point for everyone to make their views heard around enhanced ambition. Additionally, it will make available other key resources for the dialogue."I very much welcome the portal because it provides transparency and broadens participation in the dialogue. "I look forward to many governments and other actors making their submissions via the portal as part of world-wide efforts required for the next level of climate action and ambition,'' Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change said.READ:World Bank to assess Zimbabwe economic situationThe Pacific island concept of 'Talanoa' was introduced by Fiji, which held the Presidency of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference. It aims at an inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue.It would be recalled that the Minister of State for Environment, Ibrahim Jibril, had said Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDC) ambition under Climate Change Accord will cost estimated 142 billion dollarsto meet the 2030 target. The minister said: "the delivery of our NDC will require a fundamental re-orientation of financial flows within the economy."It is estimated that Nigeria will require around 142 billion dollars, translating to about 10 billion dollars per annum to meet her NDC target by 2030," he said. He said Nigeria had recognised that climate change presented one of the greatest challenges of the world today.Jibril said Nigeria was partnering with the Lake Chad basin countries to address the challenges of drying up of the lake which would have adverse consequences on the people and the ecosystem. \</doc>

Issues of climate financing and investing in a low-carbon and climate-resilient future will be discussed for the first time at this year's Social Media Week in Lagos. Climate Change has not always been a front-burner issue at previous editions of the Social Media Week. However, that is set to change as an environment NGO, Climate Wednesday registered as International Climate Change Development Initiatives (ICCDI), has organised a discussion forum titled 'Making Climate Finance Work for Women and Non State Actors' as part of the events at the Lagos Social Media Week. Registration is currently open for the March 2, 2018 event holding at the Landmark Centre, Oniru, Lagos. Jennifer Uchendu, founder of Susty Vibes, an online platform for sustainability issues is the guest speaker. According to the organisers, ''Making Climate Finance Work For Women and Non State Actors' is a talk inspired by the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ) recommendations for the development and inclusion of gender. We will provide an overview of how the Nigerian government is contributing towards climate financing. Speakers will explore the recent green bond launched by the Federal Ministry of Environment and how integrating gender equality into NDC implementation can affect climate change. 'Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. In many developing contexts, women's livelihoods are dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as subsistence agriculture, forestry and water. Women and girls also typically have less capacity and resources than men and boys to prepare for and adapt to climate change. For example, restrictions on women's land ownership mean that many women do not have access to productive land to farm, while a lack of financial capital and access to technologies means they cannot easily diversify their livelihoods. 'At the same time, women and girls who experience the consequences of climate change are often leaders in developing effective coping strategies and building resilience. Women have important insights to contribute to designing and implementing effective climate responses and should be fully included in decision-making relating to climate change at all levels.' \</doc>

Pushes for roll over of oil cut deal <figure><figcaption>Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister, Khalid Al-Falih.</figcaption></figure> OpeOluwani Akintayo 01 December 2017, Sweetcrude, Lagos \- The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, has urged world leaders to consistently occupy themselves with environmental issues, describing focus on climate change as "critically imperative". Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources and President of OPEC, Khalid Al-Falih, made the call in his opening address to the 173rd meeting of the OPEC conference held in Vienna, Austria on Thursday. According to him, the issue needs to be given due attention. "As we did earlier this month at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Bonn, or COP23 , we need to continually engage on environmental issues," he said. The OPEC president emphasised on the importance of reducing the carbon footprint of oil, the need for a combination of conventional and emerging energy sources, and the importance of developing a realistic global energy pathway to the future. On the ongoing oil cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC, Al-Falih pressed that the deal is just half-way gone, urging that further cuts was required to achieve the total goal. "Let me emphasise that we have come a long way in terms of market rebalancing and returning the market to health and stability." "While it is evident that a lot more still needs to be done to meet our goals in a sustainable manner, I am confident that through collaborations, adaptability and determination, we will successfully respond to what lies ahead. I look forward to continuing to work with each of you to extend our success in strengthening short-term market conditions, so that our nations and the global economy as a whole can enjoy the benefits of stable and sustainable petroleum markets in the long term", he said. OPEC and non-OPEC members are meeting on Thursday to deliberate particularly on the cut deal started in January through March next year. The group and its oil-producing-countries allies had in December 2016, pledged to cut 1.8 million barrels per day of output to boost oil prices.

Senate President, Bukola Saraki has urged state governments and private sector to collaborate for the actualization of adequate and affordable energy mix which will serve as a complimentary means to achieve energy security in the country. Saraki said that such collaboration will help liberalize the energy situation in Nigeria in such a way that the rural woman can cook with a clean cook-stove and fuel, while the school pupil can wake up at night and have light to do his/her home work, the farmer can power coolers to preserve his/her milk and prevent post-harvest losses, the barber and hair-dresser can make more money with regular access to energy, the industrialist will no longer want to close shop and move to Ghana. Speaking at workshop on "The State of Energy Security in Nigeria on the Way to COP23 " organized by Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS) Climate Policy and Energy Security Programme for Sub-Saharan Africa, Saraki pointed out that if a small village in Germany can develop a renewable energy that serves their purpose and support national grid, such model should be replicated in Nigeria. "In march this year, I visited the 100 percent renewable energy village of Feldheim near Berlin and was impressed by the fact that a small village of less than 1000 people was able to form an energy cooperative that generates energy from renewable sources such that surpluses are sold to the national grid. Why can't one state in Nigeria do it in partnership with the private sector?", Saraki asked. He explained that the 8th National Assembly is working hard to pass the necessary laws to achieve energy security. "We acknowledge that in order to fundamentally create a robust and secure energy base, strategic and deliberate government policy both short and long terms that will guarantee the present and future energy needs is necessary. "There is need to reform the administration of our current major source of revenue, improving other revenue generating sectors and instituting an economic diversification framework that could initiate a stepwise transition to a green economic development pathway", Senate president stated. On his part, Director Climate Policy and Energy Security Programme for Sub-Saharan Africa, Prof. Oliver Ruppel said that climate policy and energy security are issues that need not be neglected not only in Africa but other parts of the world. "In many developing countries, including Nigeria, one of the challenges to sustain economic development is access to sustainable energy options. Economic and social development are dependent on improving access to energy and the supply of modern energy option. \</doc>

<figure><figcaption>African Development Bank.</figcaption></figure>  Commits to 100% climate screening for all Bank-financed projects 28 December 2017, Sweetcrude, Abidjan, C\'f4te d'Ivoire \-  The African Development Bank achieved a 100% investment in renewable energy in 2017, a major landmark in its commitment to clean energy and efficiency. Power generation projects with a cumulative 1,400 megawatts exclusively from renewables were approved during the year, with plans to increase support for renewable energy projects in 2018 under the New Deal on Energy for Africa. According to Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, ''We are clearly leading on renewable energy. We will help Africa unlock its full energy potential while developing a balanced energy mix to support industrialization. Our commitment is to ensure 100% climate screening for all Bank-financed projects.'' The share of renewable energy projects as a portion of the Bank's portfolio of power generation investments increased from 14% in 2007-2011 to 64% in 2012-2016. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) whose goal is to deliver 300 Gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy in 2030 and 10 GW by 2020, is now based within the Bank, as requested by African Heads of State and Government. The G7 has promised to commit US$10 billion to support the initiative, which came out of COP21 and subsequently approved by the African Union. On November 8, 2017, the African Bank Group approved its Second Climate Change Action Plan, 2016-2020 (CCAP2) as a clear message of its commitment to helping African countries mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of Regional Member Countries, in ways that will not hinder development. The approval of the action plan echoes discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C. The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 As part of its wider mandate under the New Deal on Energy for Africa, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank on December 15, 2017, approved an investment of US $20 million in the Evolution II Fund  a Pan-African clean and sustainable energy private equity fund. The Bank's investment in Evolution II Fund reflects the High 5 development priorities of the Bank, the agenda to light up and Power Africa, and the Bank's commitment to promoting renewable energy and efficiency in Africa. The Evolution II Fund is expected to contribute to green and sustainable growth by creating 2,750 jobs and building on the track record of the Evolution One Fund (which created 1,495 jobs, of which 20% were for women, and generated 838 MW of wind energy and 87MW Solar PV energy). It is estimated that the Evolution One Fund achieved 1,190,469 of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission savings annually In line with its commitment to renewable energy and ongoing institutional reforms, in the first quarter of 2017, the Bank appointed Ousseynou Nakoulima as the Director for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. He brings global experience in developing and managing programs and partnerships for driving renewable energy, from his work at the Green Climate Fund.

Water connects sectors, as they all need water to operate sustainably. The inextricable linkages between water, energy and food require a holistic approach if water and food security, sustainable agriculture and sustainable energy production are to be ensured. Inter-linkages are compelling governments, the private sector, communities, academia and other stakeholders to explore integrated solutions. This approach eases pressures and helps explore development avenues based on a sustainable and efficient use of limited resources. This interlinking approach requires continued dialogue between the different communities, highlighting the significance of forums like the CoP23 and the upcoming World Water Forum in March 2018 in Brazil, in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Optimal water management and investment in water infrastructure requires a top-down and bottom-up integrated strategy. Therefore, local solutions for local problems are often most suited to meet water challenges, as highlighted by Aziza Akhmouch, acting division head at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 'Cities that are resilient are actually cities that fix upstream their water problems.' The profound knowledge and mindful resource management for seamless adaptation already exists. It simply requires being shared across sectors as a means to best confront the adverse effects of climate change. It is increasingly evident, for example, that efficient water usage in agriculture is possible. Up to 70 percent of water is consumed by agriculture, compared to 20 percent by industry and 10 percent for domestic needs. The agricultural sector, through shared information, could follow best practices pioneered in unrelated areas by applying shared experiences. 'We would be wise to apply lessons from across the world, even traditional rural populations in Africa or Asia, which have the potential to inform innovative, sagacious and responsible resource management, to adapt our planet to climate variation's onslaught. The knowledge is there, we just have to listen and tap into it,' explains Maggie White, Manager International Policies, Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), Co-Chair, Alliance for Global Water Adaption (AGWA) and Steering Committee Member of the ClimateIsWater Initiative. Lo\'efc Fauchon, honorary president of the World Water Council (WWC) which coordinates the ClimateIsWater initiative, moderated the outcomes discussion from the Water Action Day. He indicated that, 'Innovative technical solutions are key to have better and cheaper solutions that drive global water security.' He further underscores, 'The political obligation of cooperation on all levels-from local to basin-wide, to city level, national and international level in governance, financing and knowledge sharing-this should translate to enhanced efficiency in optimized integrated water management and should be complemented by horizontal collaboration between all sectors including the 5 main ones: water, energy, food, health and education.' He continues by saying that, 'In order to ensure water security, government agreements are needed: A global pact under the UN umbrella to provide a further framework for implementation of the climate change goals and commitments and for financial engagements from development banks and funds, but also local pacts and agreements, per water basin and per metropolis.' Creative solutions for sustainable agriculture under a changing climate necessarily carry water at their core: drought resistant crops, improved salt tolerance of different crop varieties, enriched seed varieties, developed cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, improvements in soil organic carbon, organic practices. By sharing specialised experience and wisdom across the agricultural, hydro and energy arenas, climate-smart solutions have the potential to be three times as effective. And the most recurring factor in this equation is water dependency and vulnerability. 'Some of the smartest applications of sustainable farming come from countries and regions such as the south of Morocco or Pakistan, to name just a few, which are naturally poor in access to water from rainfall and riverbeds', comments James Dalton, Coordinator, Global Water Initiatives, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 'Climate change impacts freshwater availability, but the greatest impact is made evident in how we manage precious resources. Water scarcity is not the only issue; mismanagement is. To this end, we need to tackle how water is distributed globally. Despite Brazil, to mention an example, being home to nearly one fifth of the world's fresh water, Sao Paulo, recently lived through one of the biggest crises in its history when it experienced an unparalleled drought. Furthermore, at this very moment, droughts are also being experienced across the world in places like the northern U.S., Australia and even China. In Puerto Rico, the opposite is true. Despite a horrific flood following a mega storm, less than half of the island's population had access to drinking water,' highlights World Water Council President, Benedito Braga. \</doc>

Securing a smooth transition to low-carbon and climate-smart development will require effective global partnerships that mobilize funding and track its impact around the world. That is where the world's multilateral development institutions come in. BONN - Climate action is not just about controlling global temperatures. It can also be a driver of development and poverty reduction all over the world. At the COP 23 Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany, in November, multilateral development institutions showed themselves to be more committed than ever to the urgent and central issue of supporting and financing these critical goals. Today's political climate is uncertain. But climate change is not. Partnership around the world must be maintained in the global effort to achieve a smooth transition to low carbon and climate-smart development. Multilateral development institutions have never been more relevant. Climate-smart development also makes good economic and business sense, particularly when it comes to sustainable infrastructure. We have already witnessed tremendous growth in renewable energy, creating with it new business opportunities and jobs. Many climate-smart investments can also reduce air pollution and congestion. Building resilience now saves money later. We are committed to supporting a climate-smart future. As multilateral development institutions, we reconfirm our commitment to the Paris climate agreement. Our role is to facilitate the public and private finance that is a vital part of the climate solution. That is why, two years after the Paris accord was successfully negotiated, we are increasingly aligning actions and resources in support of developing countries' goals. In July, the G20 Sustainability Action Plan embedded the Paris agreement in G20 policies and noted that more effective use of financing from multilateral development institutions is key to innovation and private investment in climate action. In 2016 alone, multilateral development institutions committed over $27 billion in climate finance, and we continue to step up our work, determined to broaden the private and public finance mobilized for climate action at COP 23 . We commit to: Deliver on the promises that we made in 2015 to increase our support for climate investments in developing countries by 2020, both from our direct financing and from our mobilization efforts; Increase mobilization of private-sector investment by supporting policy and regulatory reforms. This includes aligning price signals, making innovative use of policy and finance instruments and, as applicable, leveraging concessional (below-market-rate) finance to help scale up public and private investment in climate projects. Strengthen international efforts by working together and with other development finance institutions, to increase transparency and consistency in tracking climate finance tracking and reporting greenhouse-gas emissions; Support countries, cities, and territories with their own climate action plans and build the conditions for an ambitious next generation of such contributions; and Work with our clients to support initiatives that protect the most climate-vulnerable areas, including small island developing states, while mobilizing more finance for developing countries to build resilience and to adapt their infrastructure, communities, ecosystems, and businesses to the consequences of climate change. Each of these measures supports our strong commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. By pursuing them, climate action will become a key part of the international community's work to place infrastructure and the rollout of new technologies and policies for energy, water, and mobility at the core of sustainable development. This is a serious response to a serious challenge. Climate change poses a grave threat to the natural environment, to economic growth, and to the lives of all people around the world, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. It is fitting that this threat to national economies and to every person on earth, and the opportunity to counter it, should be tackled with the backing of multilateral development institutions. We call on others to join us in placing climate action at the centre of their business, stepping up climate finance, and tracking its impact around the world. \</doc>

Since the coming together of countries to chart a path for global climate in 2015, the topic of climate change has gained much relevance and the spotlight in national discussions. Nigeria, who happens to be a signatory to this contract did not pay the due attention to implementing the resolutions met at the conference until climate change came knocking at the borders of the country. The incidents of recurrent flooding, typhoons and evident temperature increase are fast becoming a norm in the country. This has pushed the government and policy makers to pay the necessary attention to climate action in the past months. This saw Nigeria been represented by a train of delegates headed by the Honourable minister of state for the environment , Ibrahim Usman Jibril in COP23 that was held in Bonn, Germany last year November. The president alongside key players in the country politics were also participants in the One planet summit hosted in Paris, France a month after. These activities of the government has put 'climate stories' in the league of main stream issues in the country but the implementation of the Paris agreement of 2015 still remains an uncompleted task leaving the citizens at the mercy of climate change. A perfect case study of this theme is Benin City. Benin City, the capital of Edo state is an ancient town globally known for its dexterity in bronze casting and home to the most revered royalty in Africa- Oba of Benin. It is the fourth largest city in Nigeria with its population equaling that of Luxembourg, Cape Verde and Seychelles put together. The prevalence of flooding in this elephantine city can be easily attributed to its high greenhouse gas emission and carbon usage. Benin City plays host to the International center for bronze casting that attracts millions of tourists across the world. This monument unfortunately contributes a large quota to the high carbon emission in the Niger Delta region. Artisans make use of coal at high temperature to mold and cast sculptures. Speaking with Chris, a sculptor in Igun, He clearly spelt out the tedious process involved in bronze sculpturing. He explained that coal is used to generate heat for melting the wax used in carving the bronze to desirable shapes and structures. He even joked that there is no fair person in Igun because the heat generated does a lot of damage to the skin of the artisans. He further stated that the Governor of the state promised to provide ultra-modern facilities that would aid cheap, clean and timely bronze artefact production but they insisted on sticking to the archaic method claiming it was passed to them by their forefathers and must be transmitted to their children without adulteration from the westerners. This high level of carbon emission has left Benin City stranded with endless flooding when it rains which has led to an inevitable loss of lives and properties, devastating health effects, traffic congestion, relocation of industries and manpower, cut-off in power supply and a low internally generated revenue (IGR). In recent times, Benin residents have had unforgettable experiences that would not be quick to erase from their memory such as the massive flooding that occurred on Saturday 7th October, 2017, sacking thousands from their homes and causing millions of naira in damages to properties. Amongst the worst affected places was the Edo State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Benin City. A section of the building's perimeter fencing collapsed after two hours of heavy downpour, pushing in muddy waters inundated vehicles, files, computers and card reading machines. Another incident was when the landlords of Anigboro Street and its environs in Egor Local Government Area of Benin city sent a Save Our Soul (SOS) to the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, in August 2017 appealing to him to come to their aid before their houses and property were swept away by flood in the area. The residents of Uhunmwode community in Benin City are another set of people with a first-hand experience of climate variability especially with regard to food crop production which is a common sight in the area. Farmers are beginning to notice the impacts of climate variability on their food crop production. They found out that climate variability/change has caused poor crop yields, reduced soil fertility, increased flood, poverty and food shortage. Food crop agriculture in Uhunmwode does not only provide food for the inhabitants of the area, but also for nearby local government areas and cities. However, the recent changes in patterns of climate/weather elements are a huge challenge to food crop production in the area. For the crop farmers in the community, climate has greatly varied over recent years with rainfall decreasing and air temperature increasing. This combination is not in any way healthy for crop production, especially for farmers who are dependent on rain for their farming, as in the Uhunmwode community. Also, onset of rain in the area, according to the farmers has shifted. This also in no small measure will adversely affect food crop production, as adjustment may be difficult, especially where what will happen the next farming season is not known. These incidents have seen the birth of organisations that are geared towards sustainable development and climate justice in the mega city. A vivid example is the Borokinni Joshua Initiative, a non-profit that centers on climate action. They flagged a campaign in Benin City tagged #SafeClimate4Africa in collaboration with the Nigeria society of Victoria (NSV). The campaign featured awareness-raising, school tours and round table discussions. The team of five visited Patricia Private School (Ikpoba hill) and Torch Bearers Academy (Ikhueniro), in November 2017 to sensitise and intimate the staffs and students of these institutions on climate change which spread across various topics such as; Carbon pricing, Mitigation and Adaptation of cities, Greenhouse gases, deforestation among others. They aired their views on radio stations and online websites, stressing the role of Benin residents in ensuring a safe climate for all. Their focus lies strongly on improving education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. \</doc>

The United States has submitted to the United Nations a formal notice of withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement.The notification was made Friday, with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealing to the U. President Donald Trump had announced on June 1, 2017, that the U.S. would leave the agreement.The Spokesman for the Secretary-General, Mr Stephane Dujarric, confirmed that Guterres received, "in his capacity as Depositary of the Paris Agreement, a communication from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America". The Secretary General, however, welcomed any effort to re-engage in the Paris Agreement by the United States.Dujarric said the communication expressed "the intention of the United States to exercise its right to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as soon as it is eligible to do so under the Agreement unless it identifies suitable terms for re-engagement". Guterres stressed his statement on June 1, 2017, that the decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security."It is crucial that the United States remains a leader in climate and sustainable development. Climate change is impacting now."He looks forward to engaging with the American government and all other actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future for our children and future generations," Guterres said. Under article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a Party may withdraw at any time after three years from the date on which the Agreement has entered into force for that Party, and such withdrawal takes effect upon expiry of one year from the date of receipt by the Depositary of the notification of withdrawal.The United States accepted the Paris Agreement on Sept. 3, 2016, and the Agreement entered into force for the United States on Nov. 4, 2016.The Secretary-General would circulate the text of this communication as a depositary notification, in English and French, early next week. The U.S. Department of State, in a statement, confirmed "the United States submitted a communication to the United Nations, in its capacity as depositary for the Paris Agreement, regarding the U.S. intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so, consistent with the terms of the Agreement"."As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favourable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers. "The United States supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security."We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions. "The United States will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP-23 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect U.S. interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration."Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris Agreement," the department said. \</doc>

Climate change is a medical emergency (The Lancet) whose impact on health is alarming, and for decades now, the African continent has been disturbed by its impacts, one in which Nigeria as a nation has had her share. The issue of health challenges in Africa, and more importantly Nigeria, has been made worse by climate change on a personal level than it used to be and critical stakeholders have not realised this. Nigeria, as both the most populous country and a major exporter of oil in Africa, faces the challenges of balancing global energy demands and its domestic economic stability, with the need to address climate change impacts and other environmental considerations. However, we must understand and admit that a healthy climate will definitely produce healthy people. Climate Change and Health Expert of the World Health Organisation (WHO), D.H. Campbell-Lendrum, affirms in the Climate Tracker Climate Change and Health YouTube Webinar, that 'the health of people are the lives of people.' Evidences from recent climate-sensitive health issues in our nation, such as the recent flooding in Imo and Benue states, the food insecurity issue in the north, the disturbances in the environment brought about by climate change on the fast spread of Lassa fever into many Nigerian states, as the vector, a rodent (multimammate rat) thrives on contaminated water, food and are highly adaptable (501 cases and 104 deaths as of 9th of June, according to WHO), proves the statement above to be true. Climate change impacts, such as extreme weather, floods, and droughts, invariably have a direct impact on our health; but its indirect impacts such as food insecurity, population migration and air pollution are equally consequential considerations. Drivers of climate change and effects on health Air pollution exists in its various forms such as outdoor air pollution (OAP), short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) and the household air pollution (HAP). In Nigeria, it is saddening that HAP accounts for about 258,000 deaths, as well as 57% of an estimated 130,900 child deaths. This is due to acute lower respiratory infection. Death from generator smoke inhalation in Nigeria between 2008 and 2014 amounted to no fewer than 10,000, with four Nigerian cities now on the list of the most polluted cities in the world. 94% of Nigerian citizens are now exposed to air pollution levels that exceed WHO guidelines. Actions must be taken to reduce the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. The consequence of absent response is dire. The ozone layer will totally become depleted, thus making humans vulnerable to cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The result of the high emissions is that heat-related death will increase and our friends will begin to die, hence the need for action. Flooding is a major climate change-related event that has ravaged Nigeria in recent times. The flooding in Makurdi on August 27th, 2017, as well as the September 21st, 2017 flooding in Imo State, has displaced about 110,000 and 3,200 people, respectively, from their homes. Unfortunately, floods create conducive conditions for numerous diseases to breed than we expect. An increase in extreme flooding events is set to cause a further rise of vector-borne diseases like malaria, as Nigeria stands as the country with the highest number of casualties worldwide. Flooding will also have an indirect health effect on our food production, access to quality water provision, leading to deadly disease like the recent cholera outbreak in Borno State, and a potential population migration for regions affected by flooding, thus creating a burden on the newly populated region. Food insecurity is also one of the major health issues caused by climate change (C.Oxfam). Climate change through higher temperature, land and water scarcity, and changing weather patterns negatively impacts agricultural production and causes breakdown in food systems. This correspondingly affects those most vulnerable to hunger and can lead to food insecurity. Subsequently and sadly enough for Nigeria, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) puts 11 million Nigerian children, under age 5, as stunted, the highest in sub-Saharan African, therefore considerable efforts must be made to improve climate resilience in Nigeria, else, we could be at risk of hunger and malnutrition. Weather parameters that influence transmission rates of infectious diseases include temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 report revealed further that climate change could contribute to the expanding risk areas for infectious diseases, and as well increase burden of diarrhoea, thus putting more lives at risk. According to Rocklov. J et al (2015), more than 400 million people will be at risk of malaria by 2070, under both low and high emissions. It is evidently clear, how our health and climate change are related, whether directly or indirectly. It is clear that because of climate change, the basic needs of people will be disrupted; hunger and famine will increase as a direct result of drought. Air pollution will also increase, leading to more ischaemic and respiratory problems. It is so saddening the havoc climate change has caused in Nigeria, especially to our health. Actions must be taken both at the local and national levels to address it. Fighting climate change provides us the opportunity to protect human health, especially the poorest, who are the most vulnerable to the harshest impacts of climate change effect. Nigeria, as one of the most vulnerable, suffers serious health consequences from its effects because of our large poor population, poor health planning and weak policies to address climate-sensitive health issues; hence, the need for everyone to take action. Industries should limit their burning of fossil fuels and use less polluting energy sources, such as renewable energy; individuals should embrace active, efficient transport systems such as cycling and walking, thus reducing the level of GHGs emissions in the atmosphere and making our health better for it. Amro Aglan's valid suggestion that 'health care providers should create awareness among citizens about climate change and we all should live by examples,' should become a collective badge of interest. Quality health services and functional water should be provided for women and children in rural parts of the nation, who are the most vulnerable to climate change health risks. Now, Nigeria has massive opportunities to promote policies that protect the climate at the local level and even globally, thus ensuring global annual CO2 emission level drops from 5.2 to 1.6 tons per capita, so we all can stay below the 2oC upper global temperature limit. We must stop deceiving ourselves that we can continue to burn fossil fuels, degrade our lands, fall trees indiscriminately, without paying the price on our health and environment in the form of worsening health, deaths and property loss. Climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year due to malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress between 2030 and 2050 [WHO]. Do we desire more deaths or a well-meaning life for ourselves? Statistics from several health agencies worldwide put us straight. Therefore, we need more serious actions to combat climate change. Nigeria's response to climate change has not been too bad, as the record of the nation's commitment to several global agreements shows, but the Nigerian government, policy makers, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), health practitioners and the citizens, need to do more in making strong climate change health-related policies, providing quality flood control efforts, as well as a swift response in the monitoring of disease outbreak and taking responsibilities for our own actions on our climate. The Nigerian government should also provide all necessary support for research and development to help understand the health risk of climate change. Government should show strong leadership and political will to address climate change in Nigeria. Better policies and measures to address greenhouse gas emissions should be enacted, as well as the full implementation of the National Policy on Environment and National Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action on Climate Change for Nigeria (NASPA-CCN). The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA), an agency responsible for the protection and development of the environment, biodiversity conservation and sustainable development of Nigeria's natural resources, should be fully empowered to fulfill her mandate, which will benefit us all. The Conference of Parties23 ( COP23 ) in November, to be held in Bonn, Germany, is a time for nations, Nigeria inclusive, to negotiate better climate change agreements that cut across board, especially those that address health issues as a consequence of climate change, because we know that the health of people are the lives of people. \</doc>

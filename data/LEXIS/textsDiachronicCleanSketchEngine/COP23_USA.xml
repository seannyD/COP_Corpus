The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "It is our moral and ethical responsibility to take collective and immediate actions to address climate change and to safeguard life on our planet", reads the interfaith statement to be delivered by the World Council of Churches (WCC) to the plenary of COP23 on 16 November. Entitled "To Bonn and Beyond: Act Now with Justice and Peace", the statement will be read by Frances Namoumou, representing the WCC and the Pacific Conference of Churches, to the plenary of the High Level Ministerial Segment of the 23rd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany, where the United Nations Climate Change Conference is taking place under the presidency of Fiji. The text emphasizes the urgent situation of the people in the Pacific, stating that it is "a matter of justice that wealthy nations responsible for the bulk of global emissions provide financial and other forms of support to income-poor, vulnerable countries, enabling the latter to adapt and build resilience to a warming climate as well as compensating for loss and damage". "Loss and damage must be minimised if not prevented in the first place. This means that we have to keep global temperature increase to not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels", reads the statement. COP 23 to "increase nationally determined contributions to meet the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels; ensure the transfer of financial and other resources to small island states and other poor, vulnerable countries as funding for adaptation and resilience-building and as compensation for loss and damage; and deliver concrete action on loss and damage by further developing the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage".

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, led a strong and productive delegation at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. This global gathering advanced the work of the Paris Agreement so that climate action can be guaranteed for generations to come. COP23 brought together people from all parts of society to highlight both the challenges and solutions related to climate change, including opportunities to invest in clean growth, and the transition to a clean energy economy. Canada's diverse delegation to COP 23 included: Indigenous leaders; representatives from the provinces, territories and municipalities; youth; business leaders; civil society, opposition members; and Government of Canada negotiators and experts. Canada played a leadership role in helping advance the guidelines for the Paris Agreement. Canada is pleased that countries came together to launch the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples' Platform; providing a space to share knowledge and amplify their voice. In addition, the adoption of a gender action plan that will help build capacity and support gender representation in future international climate change negotiations and decision-making was a significant achievement for Canadian negotiators. An important highlight from COP 23 was the launch of the new "Powering Past Coal" Alliance by Minister McKenna and her UK counterpart, Claire Perry. This initiative generated broad interest and support from over 20 countries, cities and states and Minister McKenna is looking forward to continuing this momentum given the numerous health and climate benefits of reducing coal-fired electricity. Canada also announced the formation of a North American Climate Leadership Dialogue with Mexico and the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 15 U.S. governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Minister McKenna praised Fiji for its role in presiding over COP23 . She reiterated Canada's commitment to protect our oceans and advance global climate action by building the resilience of coastal communities, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Quotes "I was honoured to lead an inclusive delegation from Canada to COP 23 which demonstrated Canada's steadfast commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and take global climate action. Canada is pleased to have worked with the UK in launching the 'Powering Past Coal" Alliance. The world has moved on; coal fired electricity isn't coming back. We are also pleased to have moved ahead in helping give a greater voice to Indigenous People in our international engagement and advancing a gender action plan." Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick Facts COP23 is the informal name for the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, which marked the beginning of the international community's first concerted effort to confront the problem of climate change. Canada's negotiators were pleased with progress at COP both on the launch the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples' Platform which gives a voice to Indigenous People, and advancing a gender action plan. The "Powering Past Coal" partners include a diverse range of governments, businesses and organizations unified in taking action to accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the rapid phase-out of traditional coal power. Canada has pledged $2.65 billion to help developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. Canada provided $10 million to help get Jamaica's first private wind farm built. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Canada will continue driving global momentum on climate action at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) presided over by Fiji, in Bonn, Germany. Our delegation will include all levels of government, Indigenous leaders, businesses, and environmental groups, working together to seize the opportunities of the transition to a clean-growth economy. At COP23 , Canada will continue to work with other countries to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In Bonn, all international partners will need to commit to further invest in solutions that build climate resilience and lower emissions. And parties will continue to advance key aspects of the Paris Agreement, related to mitigation, adaptation, transparency, and carbon markets. Working with partners at COP23 , Canada will push for global efforts to phase out coal-fired electricity. This action not only reduces emissions and smog, which choke many cities, but also reduces the number of premature deaths, cases of asthma, and emergency-room visits. We will also continue to support the engagement of Indigenous Peoples in climate policy and encourage the development of a gender-action plan. Earlier this week, Canada became one of the first countries to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which will phase down powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Each year, HFC sources emit the carbon-dioxide equivalent that is released by 300 coal-fired power plantsand by reducing these emissions, we make significant progress toward the Paris Agreement and help limit the future impacts of climate change. This year's conference is the first ever to be led by one of the small island developing statesa group of countries particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and other impacts of climate change. Canada strongly supports Fiji's leadership as COP23 president, and it has provided $1.4 million to help the country carry out this important role. Quotes "Canada will work with global partners at this year's United Nations climate negotiations toward the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a global challenge that demands a global response. But it's also an opportunity. Today, Canadian governments and businesses are well positioned to seize the economic opportunities of a clean-growth economy. In doing so, we will support a healthier planet for our children and grandchildren." Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick Facts The Paris Agreement helped open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets, between now and 2030. Canada has committed $2.65 billion by 2020 to help developing countries transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies. \</doc>

Nations from across the world congregated in Bronn, Germany to discuss climate agreements and how they could battle climate change for the United Nations Climate Change Conference 23rd Conference of the Parties. Among the delegates, organizations and other attendees were members from the Climate and Development Lab at Brown. The conference stretched from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17, with six of the 12 undergraduate students in the CDL going the first week and the other six going the second, said Julianna Bradley '17.5, one of the students in the CDL. Preparation for the conference took place largely in the class ENVS 1575: "Engaged Climate Policy at the UN Climate Change Talks," which was taught by J. Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and co-founder and co-director of the CDL, said Emma Bouton '20, another student in the CDL. Students had a set of core readings, which included topics such as the history of the climate talks, climate vulnerability and financing, gender and loss and damage, said Stacy-Ann Robinson, postdoctoral research associate and member of the CDL. Students also worked on individual and group projects, she said. The students spent their time at COP23 working on "embedded" projects with organizations assigned to them before COP23 . For Bradley, this meant working with Oxfam America, an organization that aims to reduce poverty. Oxfam sent delegates from their climate subsection to COP23 , and Bradley attended negotiations for them, taking notes so she could report back. For Bouton, this meant working with the Global Island Partnership, for which she would attend events and work with social media. Other students worked with groups such as the United Nations Development Programme, Climate Home, the chair of the Least Developed Countries and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development. The students also worked on independent projects while at COP23 . Each student focused on a specific issue, deciding which negotiations and events to attend and which people to contact. Bradley's project involved working with a group called Climate Home and looking at cities' participation in meeting U.S. climate agreements. Bradley said approaching and interacting with people involved in climate action was one of the best parts of COP23 . Though there was a hierarchy with pink-badged "delegates" holding higher positions than yellow-badged "observers," it was not rigid. "Anyone would talk to anyone," she said. Bradley recalled standing in line at a coffee shop and recognizing the man behind her as the mayor of Carmel, Indiana, the only Republican at the conference. She introduced herself, and they conversed for 45 minutes about climate change. Bouton said that the conference was overwhelming, but she was disheartened by the slow pace of progress. The United Nations structures negotiations in a flawed way that allows them to continually push back decision-making, she said. Guy Edwards, co-founder and co-director of the CDL, agreed that decision-making regarding climate change was occurring too slowly; however, he said that the shift to a low-carbon economy is now undeniable. "Far more needs to happen, but this process is an important step forward," he said. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \</doc>

BRUSSELS, Belgium, Sept. 7 -- The European Parliament issued the following press release: The logo captures the vulnerability of small island developing states to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and increasing storm intensity. A Parliament delegation will attend the COP 23 conference in Bonn (c) 2014 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  EU needs a 2050 zero-emissions strategy  More financing of emissions-reducing investments  MEPs will be at the UN conference on climate change next November The EU has to put forward a mid-century zero emissions strategy by 2018, Environment MEPs said on Thursday. The Environment Committee agreed on a series of recommendations to EU institutions and countries ahead of the COP23 meeting next November in Bonn. They call on EU leaders to implement the agreement with EU legislation and ratchet up the EU's goals and policy instruments. As all UNFCCC parties have to communicate their long-term targets by 2020, MEPs also call on the Commission to prepare by 2018 a mid-century zero emissions strategy for the EU, with the aim of keeping the temperature rise well below 2 C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1,5 C. The process should begin as soon as possible, they say. US DECISION "A STEP BACKWARDS" BUT MEPS HAIL STRONG WORLDWIDE RESPONSE MEPs express their disappointment at US President Trump's announcement of his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. "This decision represents a step backwards", they noted, but they welcome the strong responses from governments around the world in favour of the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. CLIMATE FINANCE MEPs are calling for concrete EU and international commitments to deliver additional financing sources. Lending and investment practices should be in line with the well below 2 C target, including divesting from fossil fuels and phasing out export credits (i. e. financial incentives) for fossil fuel investments, they say. GLOBAL CARBON MARKETS MEPs welcome the development of emissions trading systems globally, as 18 of them are in operation across four continents. They encourage the Commission to promote links between the EU ETS and other carbon markets, so as to increase climate ambition and at the same time help to reduce the risk of carbon leakage. Target of the COP23 The goal of the Bonn Conference is to achieve "clarity on the design of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue", which will aim to take stock of governments' efforts towards the long-term goal, MEPs say. A Parliament delegation will attend the conference. NEXT STEPS The draft resolution was adopted with 54 votes in favour, none against and 6 abstentions. It will be put to a vote by the full House during the 2-5 October plenary session in Strasbourg. QUICK FACTS The European Parliament is currently working on three pieces of legislation implementing the Paris Agreement: the post-2020 carbon market (EU ETS) reform (rapporteur Julie Girling), the 2030 targets effort-sharing regulation (rapporteur Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy) and the regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land-use, land-use change and forestry (rapporteur Norbert Lins).

(Photo by Spielvogel/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International) Latin American countries, regions and cities demonstrated clear ambition and leadership at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held in Bonn, Germany over the past two weeks. Their progress appeared in the form of national commitments, participation in global coalitions, subnational action plans, and international awards. With every year, Latin America increasingly appears as a regional leader in efforts to halt and adapt to the warming planet. Several specific countries are playing leading roles and standing out for their work among other developing nations around the world. Here are just a few highlights from this year's COP:1.\~Latin America's cities and countries participated in global alliances.Mexico\~and\~Costa Rica\~joined 23 other countries in signing on to\~a new global coalition[1] committed to phasing out coal\~and supporting clean power policies and investments, while restricting financing for coal plants[2].\~Launched by Canada and the UK, the Powering Past Coal[3]\~alliance hopes to expand its membership from 25 to 50 countries by next year's COP. The coalition's members will share experiences, lessons learned and best practices on diverse strategies to phase out coal. Buenos Aires,\~Caracas,\~Mexico City,\~Quito,\~Rio de Janeiro, and\~Santiago de Chile\~were\~among 25 global cities that committed to develop and implement more ambitious climate action plans before 2020[4]. These cities -members of the C40 aim to use these plans to meet their emissions reductions goals and build more climate resilient cities. The results of these actions are expected to\~bring social, economic and environmental benefits to the nearly 150 million citizens[5]\~who live in the 25 participating cities.2.\~Latin American efforts awarded for being innovative and forward-thinking.Young scientists from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in\~Colombia won the Momentum for Change award at COP23 [6], for their innovative use of information technology and communications to create new ideas. The scientists analyzed meteorological data to understand how climate variation was affecting rice agriculture in the country. Realizing that a drought was imminent, they recommended that 170 local rice producers change their sowing season, thereby helping them avoid US$3.6 million dollars in economic losses. One\~Ecuadorian\~initiative,\~Sustainable Agriculture with Inclusion and Participation of Gender[7] received the Impulse for Change award, granted by the UN to exemplary solutions for climate change in the world. The project supports families in the Metropolitan Area of Quito to give them access to 2,500 new urban gardens, creating 110 agricultural microenterprises, educating about climate change and prioritizing the presence of women as leaders (85.7 percent out of the 56,000 participants).3.\~Countries highlighted the importance of addressing gender in climate action.Following on a similar note as the previous summary,\~Costa Rica\~celebrated the\~approval of a Gender Action Plan[8], which the Foreign Ministry hailed as £ triumph for all women and girls on the planet.' As the coordinator and spokesperson on behalf of the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), Costa Rica sought to empower women and girls to achieve gender parity in representation within the Convention's negotiation process, as well as providing an adequate means of implementing mandates of the more than 60 resolutions that address the issue of gender. Indigenous women[9]\~were recognized at COP23 on Gender Day for their demands to stop illegal land titling that exacerbates the risks and disasters resulting from climate change. Sonia Guajajara of\~Brazil\~criticized Amazonian governments' extractivist economic model that prioritizes soy monocrops and mining, which become greenwashed as sustainable despite the major threat of deforestation. Ruth Flores, an Aymara leader from Puno,\~Perustated, 'We women are the ones who collect the seeds. We are the guardians of the hills and the water. And now we are the ones that face climate change.'4.\~National governments stand by -and increase- their climate commitments.Argentina\~proposed an\~increased unconditional goal of reducing emissions 18 percent by 2030[10], with a potential of reducing an additional 19 percent conditional upon international funding and technical assistance. The country plans to focus on improving energy efficiency and renewable energy generation, the conservation and restoration of forests, and transportation solutions to reach those goals. The\~Dominican Republic\~submitted its Third National Communication on Climate Change to the United Nations[11]. Officials from the National Council for Climate Change and Clean Development Mechanism and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources delivered the document to Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change, and underscored some of the actions that the Caribbean country is already taking to combat and adapt to climate change.5.\~Sub-national governments in the region took the spotlight.The Argentine province of\~Santa Fe\~presented its climate change priorities at an event for sub-national COP participants[12]. In his remarks, the Provincial Undersecretary for Renewable Energy, Maximiliano Neri, highlighted the connections between climate-inducing pollution and human health. Santa Fe's representatives also proposed bringing the rest of Argentina's provinces into the\~Under2 Coalition[13], a forum of 205 states, regions and provinces representing almost 40 percent of the world's economy who are working together on climate. Another member of the Under2 Coalition, the Mexican state of\~Yucat\'e1n,\~shared its experiences working to fight climate change at the subnational event in Bonn[14]. In particular, the state has focused on coastal recovery, encouraging biodigesters in the swine industry, reducing carbon emissions in the public sector, and restoring wetlands to improve 'blue carbon' reserves. It is no surprise that the region is taking a leadership role in global climate conversations, as Latin American countries are among some of the most vulnerable to climate impacts and most are already feeling the pains of the warming planet. Catastrophic droughts, floods and storms hit many countries hard, in 2017 costing untold dollars and, tragically, human lives.

New York: Cornell Chronicle University has issued the following news release: On the world stage, Etinosa Obanor \' 18 minced no words. Representing global youth constituencies at the high-level segment at the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 6-17, the student delivered a strong statement to the convention delegates as they negotiated and wrestled with climate change.  In the past, you\' ve never stopped promising action, Obanor said.  But there is no need to keep talking endlessly in closed rooms, if you don\' t face up to reality and act accordingly. Distinguished delegates, it is your choice if you want future generations to remember you as heroes of the century. For the past 12 years, youth and college students have participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference at the COP negotiations. Obanor interned last summer at the Business Environment Council, an environmental nongovernmental organization based in Hong Kong, where she participated in high-stakes meetings on energy efficiency and finance with United Nations and international banking officials. In Bonn, she reiterated to the delegates:  You must commit to pre-2020 action. At this very moment, people are suffering and dying from the impacts of climate change. The only option we have is to act now. The climate crisis is a new frontier for human rights. Take your responsibility seriously. In a call to end fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, Obanor said:  People around the world are demanding a just transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy. We urge the parties to make their future investments in clean sectors. Any new development, jobs and investment done in the fossil fuel industry will be wasted anyway \- when we start taking the Paris Agreement seriously. Among the events that Mitchell Lee \' 19 attended was a youth empowerment program, where he spoke to the Chinese and Mexican delegations.  My conversations were a great way to gain an international perspective on climate change. It was sobering and fascinating, Lee said. Jake Pero \' 18 described the COP23  wild ride as exhilarating but sleep depriving. By happenstance, Pero attended a climate smart solutions panel where he listened to Jared Snyder \' 81, deputy commissioner of air resources, climate change and energy for New York\' s Department of Environmental Conservation. Pero interned with the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions (CICCS) over the summer, where he worked to build local awareness of DEC\' s Climate Smart Communities program that incentivizes cities and towns to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and build resiliency.  After the panel, I told Mr. Snyder that I was working on a climate change program with CICCS and shared that I was a Cornell undergraduate, to which he replied, \' I was once one of those too,\'  Pero said. Cornell faculty and staff attending the COP23 conference were Glen Dowell, associate professor, Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management; Robert Howarth, the David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology; Ellen Leventry, marketing and communications director, Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Natalie Mahowald, the Irving Porter Church Professor of Engineering in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Erika Styger, associate director of International Programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; and Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor and David Croll Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Support was provided by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future and CICSS, while the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs, and an Engaged Cornell grant helped cover the students\' travel funding.

The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: During a panel discussion on "The Land and Water Advantage: Is sustainable land and water management compatible with small-scale farming under climate change?" at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, participants from different organizations met to discuss how to transform agricultural development in the face of climate change. Moderated by Dhanush Dinesh, Global Policy Engagement Manager at Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CGIAR), the discussion aimed to determine which conditions favour sustainable land and water management and to highlight innovations and policies creating favourable conditions for smallholder farmers. As stated by one of the panellist Theo de Jorge: "there is no agriculture without land rights and water access rights." Climate change adaptation in agriculture will be driven by growing pressure on water and land, and the food production will have to keep up with increasing demand. "We need to produce 60% more food by 2025" said Alan Nicol, Strategic Program Leader, Promoting Sustainable Growth, International Water Management Institute (IWMI). "Managing agricultural water availability access and use is key to success" he added. He presented innovations in water management and highlighted challenges in their deployment. "Climate change will increase food prices and increasing food prices worsens extreme poverty" Jan Low, 2016 World Food Prize co-laureate and Co-leader of the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative, International Potato Center (CIP) said. She made a presentation on whether non-GMO climate-smart crops can sustain small-scale farming, drawing from her experience in Africa with the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative at the International Potato Center. "To adapt to climate change we need to produce more adapted crops faster at times under tougher environments and we need to produce more with less water." she continued. James Kinyangi, African Development Bank' s Chief Climate Change and Policy Advisor remarked that agriculture remains a major source of income in Africa. However, its untapped potential has resulted in widespread chronic poverty and food insecurity. "In Africa 61% of the total employment is in agriculture." Kinyangi emphasized that a supporting enabling environment in Africa includes risk management, asset protection and the inclusion of women and youth, through greater access to agricultural finance. He affirmed that the Bank is giving much attention to the development of agribusiness as a significant proportion of 70 million new jobs by 2020 will be created in the agricultural sector in Africa. He identified conditions that have to be set to enable the supporting environment for smallholder farmers in Africa. The session was part of initiative: Agriculture Advantage: The case for climate action in agriculture. \</doc>

The following information was released by International Strategy for Disaster Reduction: Vulnerable communities in Africa, the Pacific and Caribbean are now benefiting from improved early warning systems against extreme weather as part of an international drive to boost resilience and climate change adaptation. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) over 80 percent of the world's 48 Least Developed Countries and many small island developing States have only a basic early warning system. Weather observation networks are inadequate in many African countries. A ministerial event at the United Nations climate change conference , COP23 CREWS aims to mobilize US$100 million by 2020 and is designed to achieve a key target of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the global plan for reducing disaster losses, namely to "substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030." "In the Paris Agreement era, it is unacceptable that populations are not forewarned of an impending weather disaster. Let us now reinforce support for CREWS, launched in Paris at COP21, to enable the most vulnerable to benefit from effective early warning systems," said Mr. Nicolas Hulot, the French Minister for Ecology. CREWS action in Niger, Burkina Faso and the Pacific Region in support of operational hydro-meteorological forecasts and early warning services was highlighted with a special focus on early warnings for agriculture and civil protection. "In 2012 Niger suffered the worst floods for 40 years, and this year over 100 people have died due to flooding. In the past, information and warnings was not accessible to the people living in exposed neighbourhoods. We have received funding from CREWS in order to improve early warnings so we can inform people of the risks. We are really happy about this support," said Laouan Magagi, Minister for Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management in Niger. In the Pacific, CREWS is strengthening hydro-meteorological and early warning services for islands including Fiji, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue and Tuvalu, Samoa, Tonga, Palau, Nauru, Marshall Islands and Tokelau. The CREWS Steering Committee last week approved a new project, "Weather and Climate Early Warning System for Papua New Guinea." It aims to improve control and maintenance of the existing drought and flood monitoring network and provide tailored early warnings for the agriculture sector and disaster managers, with an investment totaling US$1,650,000. The Steering Committee also approved a project for the Caribbean to review the effectiveness of the early warning systems for the recent hurricanes Irma and Maria. It will also address immediate forecasting requirements of affected countries through WMO global and regional centres. The CREWS is a coalition of Australia, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Canada is aligning resources. It is being implemented by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the World Bank, and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) with support of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR).

The United Nations Regional Information Center for Western Europe issued the following information: Preparations for the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn are in full swing. Following the beginning of the construction phase on 14 August, the organisers have roughly two months left to build an impressive array of temporary buildings in order to welcome more than 25,000 delegates and visitors. Built on an area of 35,000 square meters, the flooring will cover a surface of 50,000 square metres. Two zones will be available during the conference: the "Bonn-zone" at the Rheinaue park, where events, exhibitions and presentation of the countries and UN organisations will take place, and the so-called "Bula-zone" around the World Conference Centre Bonn (WCCB). The "Bula-Zone" is the location where the main negotiations will be conducted (see picture above). Up to 2,000 construction workers will ensure that both zones will be ready on time. "In fact, the construction is progressing as planned and we expect to finish on time, by the end of October", explains Franz Emde, Spokesperson for the German Environment Ministry. The Bonn-based UN Volunteers are still recruiting conference support staff.

The following information was released by the office of the Governor of California: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today rallied city, state and regional leaders at the largest gathering on global subnational climate action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. We come to this Conference of the Parties to strengthen our resolve, to meet our counterparts all over the world and join together to build a powerful constituency, said COP23 Special Advisor for States and Regions Governor Brown during opening remarks at the ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders, attended by hundreds. We cant just wait for our national leaders we need to take action together. Today's summit was co-hosted by the City of Bonn and the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, with support from the German Federal Government. Later, the Governor joined fellow Pacific Coast Collaborative members, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, to discuss West Coast climate action on a panel moderated by European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana and organized by The Climate Group. Additionally, Governor Brown gave keynote remarks at a forum focused on clean energy hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an intergovernmental organization that promotes renewable resources and technologies as the key to a sustainable future. Capping off the days events, Governor Brown and Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), on behalf of the State of California, accepted the United Nations Environment Programmes Climate and Clean Air Coalition award for outstanding policy, which recognizes air quality improvement and short-lived climate pollutant reduction policies that are bold and transformative. Last year, Governor Brown signed SB 1383 by Senator Lara, which established the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants, including black carbon, fluorinated gases and methane. The Governor also met with Minister-President of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet as well as with Germanys Secretary for Economic Affairs and Energy Rainer Baake to discuss how California and Germany can continue to expand collaboration and their commitment to climate action. Tomorrow in Bonn, Governor Brown will: deliver opening remarks at a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) event highlighting climate action from businesses, civil society and states and regions; join U.S. Climate Alliance members in the UNFCCC Bonn Zone for a moderated discussion on U.S. state-driven climate leadership; speak on a panel hosted by Sustainable Energy for All, the Global Covenant of Mayors and the Partnership on Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport on how cities and states can debcarbonize energy and transport; preview next Septembers 2018 Global Climate Action Summit in California; and participate in a panel discussion with climate leaders representing British Columbia, Ontario and Mexicos national government organized by the Climate Action Reserve. Yesterday in Bonn, Governor Brown joined Michael R. Bloomberg, the United Nations Secretary-Generals Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, to reaffirm the commitment of America's states, cities and businesses to the Paris Agreement and later welcomed Virginia to the Under2 Coalition at a signing ceremony with Governor Terry McAuliffe. Last week, in Oslo, Governor Brown met with Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and convened a first-of-its-kind meeting with representatives of the world's leading independent national academies of science to review climate impacts and discuss how scientists and policymakers can more effectively translate research findings into meaningful action. In Brussels, Governor Brown delivered opening remarks at a high-level conference on clean energy organized by the European Parliament and European Commission, met with the president of the European Parliament and the European Union's top representatives at COP23 , joined members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for an extensive discussion on opportunities for further collaboration on climate action, and highlighted California's local and global efforts to fight climate change at an event organized by the German Marshall Fund. In Stuttgart, the Governor also met with Under2 Coalition co-founder Baden- Wrttemberg's Minister-President and delivered remarks before the state parliament. Last weekend, Governor Brown delivered keynote remarks at a symposium on climate change hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican. More information on the Governor's itinerary can be found here. Photo captions: 1.) Governor Brown meets with Secretary Baake. 2.) Governor Brown delivers remarks at ICLEI climate summit. 3.)

Nov 08, 2017( The Development Policy Centre Blog: HYPERLINK http://devpolicy.org http://devpolicy.org COP23 ) will take place in the winter lands of Bonn, Germany - but with a warm Bula of inclusiveness, friendliness and solidarity[1]. Dubbed the Islands COP or Fiji/Pacific COP, Fiji in partnership with Germany, will chair the climate talks from Nov 6-14. Fiji Prime Minister and President of COP23 , Voreqe Bainimara, has set the vision of the meeting[2] in forging £ grand coalition[3] to accelerate climate action before 2020 and beyond between civil society, the scientific community, the private sector and all levels of government, including cities and regions.' What to expect at the Island COP? At the conclusion of the October pre-COP meeting in Suva[4], Fiji identified four outcomes it hopes to achieve: advancing the Paris Agreement Work Programme (Paris Rulebook) negotiations; focus on finance to deliver the $100 billion per year by 2020; managing climate risk and building resilience; and raising the ambition of countries' voluntary Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to lower greenhouse gas emissions. With over 20,000 participants, COP23 is expected to be technical in nature[5], focusing on issues related to operationalising the Paris Agreement 2015. Of priority will be negotiations and work related to the Paris Rulebook via the Ad Hoc Working Group on Paris Agreement[6] with the hope of a negotiating text to be drafted. Other technical issues[7] parties will discuss are: the mitigation section of decision 1/CP.21 (the Paris outcome[8]); adaptation communications; transparency framework for action and support; global stocktake; and mechanisms to facilitate implementation and promote compliance of the Facilitative Dialogue. The Island COP is vital in setting the process and pace for the implementation of the Paris Agreement in 2020. The COP Presidency is expected to continue to consult on the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue[9]. The global consensus achieved in Paris 2015 was in part because of the ambiguous agreement text on implementation, in which the COP21 decisions mandated that certain elements[10] be agreed upon in a Facilitative Dialogue. Poland will host COP 24[11], where the Dialogue will be a precursor to the 5 yearly NDC's Global Stocktakes, which will take place starting in 2023. Fiji and Morocco (COP22 President) will detail in full the process over the next two weeks; an informal note[12] was circulated to indicate a preparatory timeline in 2018, called the 'Talanoa Dialogue[13]' process. Fiji's innovative partnerships As the first small island state to chair the auspicious political decision-making body on global climate change action, Fiji has employed innovative partnerships in its diplomatic endeavour. Hosting a COP is expensive[14]: Copenhagen 2009 endured a price tag of \€ 182 million, and Paris 2015 with \€ 172 million. Escaping this hefty expense, it has partnered with Bonn, Germany, a city not unfamiliar to hosting such events, having hosted two previous COPs. Some have found irony[15] in the choice of co-hosts: an island nation at the frontline of climate change, and a city which hosts Germany's biggest coal mine. Fiji has stated from the beginning that its presidency will be a platform to showcase the ambitions of small island states, especially those of the Pacific[16]. It will tell a story of resilience through adaptation and mitigation leadership[17], but at the same time highlight vulnerability to climatic disasters such as recent Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria. A key factor which makes or breaks multilateral conferences is the capacity and diplomatic finesse of the chair. The Danish chair at Copenhagen COP15 was accused of holding secret negotiations[18] behind closed doors with selective states. In an attempt to restore legitimacy to the climate negotiation process, Durban's indaba process[19] (meeting open to all ministers level) at COP17, and the egalitarian model of Comit\'e9 de Paris[20] (open to all countries but limited to four representatives per country) at COP21 were hallmark legacies of the respective South African and French chairs. Fiji is introducing the Talanoa process as the mechanism for Facilitative Dialogue: Talanoa[21] is a traditional word used in Fiji and the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogueThe process of Talanoa involves the sharing of ideas, skills and experience through storytelling. During the process, Parties build trust and advance knowledge through empathy and understanding. Blaming others and making critical observations are inconsistent with the building of mutual trust and respect, and therefore inconsistent with the concept of Talanoa. Talanoa fosters stability and inclusiveness in relation to dialogue, by creating a safe space which embraces mutual respect for a platform for decision making for a greater good. Negotiators and observers at Bonn are paying close attention to whether this Fiji/Pacific style of negotiations can facilitate consensus. Whether or not it delivers, the Talanoa process will be Fiji's legacy in the climate negotiations. As a facilitator of climate leadership, through its shuttle diplomacy, Fiji has had to build inroads and break the climate coalition 'firewall'[22] between Annex I[23] parties (developed north) and the global south coalitions. Similar to the path that Marshall Islands took in building the High Ambition Coalition[24] in 2015, the island state has reached out and engaged in dialogue with powerful polluters like China, India, Brazil, EU, Australia, and New Zealand while calling on the reluctant United States to raise its ambitions on climate action. This is a different tune to what Bainimarama once called the same group as the 'coalition of the selfish'[25] back in 2015. Certainly the Chair role has opened up the doors for Fiji to dialogue and be taken seriously. This has also meant that it has had to transform its narrative of negotiator activist, to a chair 'friends to all, enemy to none'[26],\~at least in the case[27] of its climate change diplomacy in 2017. Civil society[28] and the private sector[29] have also taken a more active role in the consultations under Fiji's presidency. At the UN General Assembly in September, the presidency met with broad range of stakeholders[30] to garner both views and support leading up to COP23 . Some of these groups of NGOs from the Pacific joined allies over the weekend in Bonn for the Peoples Climate March[31] 2017 calling out fossil fuel/coal industries and pushing for agreement on implementing the Paris Agreement. Fiji has also recently become only the third country to issue green sovereign bonds[32] of USD$50 million, proceeds of which will used to fund climate resilience infrastructure and renewable energy in the country. Global multilateral diplomatic leader COP23 caps a phenomenal five year journey of Fiji's diplomatic rise[33] in the global/regional multilateral leadership space. It started with its shake up of the regional architecture[34] and promises of the Pacific Islands Development Forum[35], and chairing the global south coalition G-77 and China[36] in 2013. This was in part a product of the thinking behind a revitalised 2015 Fiji foreign policy[37]. Fiji's sights were set on global stewardship, with its UN top diplomat Peter Thomson elected President of the UN General Assembly[38] in 2016. That enabled a pathway to partner with Sweden to co-host the UN Oceans Conference[39] in July this year. In his official speech[40] as incoming COP President at the opening ceremony, Bainimarama stated '(t)his is our moment of truth when all of us in this room will be tested. We must not be found wanting.' While directed at climate negotiators, it also encompasses the challenges Fiji faces as it starts it role officially for the next 12 months. It has been a smooth ride in the conference preparations to date, but the next two weeks will certainly test the President's eclectic top diplomatic team[41] in meeting the expectations of all states, in one venue. But the story and lessons of diplomacy from this island nation will not end here. As it guides the multilateral Talanoa Process throughout 2018 in various forums and capitals, Fiji will also gain access to more direct opportunities for its domestic base, and bilateral attention on future diplomatic aspirations.Download pdf[42] The post The Island COP: changing the negotiation climate with a 'Bula Spirit'[43] appeared first on Devpolicy Blog from the Development Policy Centre[44].

18 Brown students were delegates at the COP23 . What are you doing with your life? The United Nations Climate Change Conference 23rd Conference of the Parties was held from Nov. 6 to Nov. 12 and among the delegates, organizations and other attendees were members from the Climate and Development Lab at Brown. The Brown Daily Herald reports, "Nations from across the world congregated in Bronn, Germany to discuss climate agreements and how they could battle climate change for the United Nations Climate Change Conference 23rd Conference of the Parties." Twelve undergraduate students attended the first week and six more went the second week. The students worked on "embedded" projects with organizations assigned to them before COP23 like Oxfam America, an organization that aims to reduce poverty. Harvard, please report to the the Justice Department's office\~ Harvard is being actively investigated by the Justice Department over the university's use of race in its admissions policies and declared the school is "out of compliance" with federal law. CNN reports, "The Justice Department's battle with Harvard potentially sets the stage for the first major legal test of affirmative action policies under the Trump administration. Last year, the US Supreme Court ruled that\~race can be one among many factors\~universities use in making admission decisions." Two letters from the Justice Department indicate that Harvard is challenging the investigation and states that if the school fails to provide certain documents, a lawsuit will be filed against them.

The following information was released by the United Nations: Youth groups working in Africa's Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany, said it is time their voices were heard. Youth groups working in Africa's Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, said it that is time their voices were heard. "Young people in the Congo Basin have been doing things on the ground that often go ignored," explained Marie Tamoifo, President of the Cameroon Green Youth Association (Association de la Jeunesse verte du Cameroun AJVC) and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Network for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa (Reseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des ecosyst mes forestiers d'Afrique centrale - REJEFAC) in an interview with UN News. REJEFAC brings together youth organizations from 10 Congo Basin countries Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad). Its aim is to promote the effective participation of young environmental actors in decision-making in the Congo Basin and "to contribute to the emergence in the region of a new type of leadership, more sensitive and open to the requirements of sustainable development." "[As for] actions on the ground, there are reforestation, awareness and education programmes for young people. It's about strengthening the work that is done by governments," said Ms. Tamoifo. Marie Tamoifo, President of l'Association Jeunesse verte du Cameroun (AJVC) and Coordinator of the Reseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des ecosyst mes forestiers d'Afrique centrale (REJEFAC). Photo: UN News/Jerome Bernard A solar panel programme in isolated communities "In these 15 communities, we trained 85 young people in solar installation techniques but also in psycho-socio-organizational methodology," explained Ms Tamoifo. "When we arrive in a community, we first hold a discussion with that community. We try to see with [them] what the glaring problems are." The youth participating in this programme are from the community. They are trained and they provide maintenance for the solar panels that have already been installed. "For now, they are not really paid. They receive a small allowance," added Ms.Tamoifo. The association needs more financial support to maintain and expand this programme. "We have received more than 100 requests from villages and we cannot answer them given [our] modest means. And young people who are trained today also need to make a living to be able to continue this work," she said. A 'climate caravan' in Cameroon Among other actions carried out by young people in the Congo Basin region, the REJEFAC Coordinator mentioned a tree planting initiative by volunteers in the Republic of Congo, and a programme focusing on handicrafts and conservation of natural resources in Rwanda. Before coming to COP 23 , the network organized a 'climate caravan' in Cameroon with the participation of young people from the ten countries of the Congo Basin to show what youth organizations are doing in terms of sustainable development and protection of the planet. "We organized this caravan which was named 'the COP at home,'" said the Coordinator of REJEFAC. Young people have been designated as climate ambassadors. The 'climate caravan' travelled in the Douala region, coastal areas and went to Equatorial Guinea. "It showed how we could talk about the theoretical aspect and go on the ground to experience the realities of conservation parks and conflicts between humans and elephants," concluded Ms. Tamoifo. \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: After a week of negotiations at the UN climate summit taking place in Bonn, Germany, the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), and ACT Alliance - together representing more than half a billion Christians worldwide - expressed their concerns at the slow progress governments have made so far. "Climate justice cannot wait. The most vulnerable must be in the midst of the world focus to overcome the climate challenge," said WCC general secretary Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit. "We have already taken many steps together, and it is clear that we strongly believe in efforts to stop climate change. And what is more, we believe strongly in the work for climate justice, and in shared responsibility in addressing these issues. Now is the time to take action." The ecumenical family stands together in recognizing that this week has made little progress towards securing the key demands of some of the world's most vulnerable peoples and communities. So far, no significant steps have been made in financing and strengthening the loss and damage mechanism or clarifying the provision of climate finances. With just one more week of negotiations remaining it is of paramount importance that COP23 and its Fijian presidency prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable countries for whom climate change is a harsh reality already today. "We do not want COP23 to be a lost opportunity," said Rudelmar Bueno de Faria, ACT Alliance general secretary. "The hopes and aspirations of millions of people who are facing the harshest impacts of climate change depend on urgent actions to mitigate climate change and its impacts." Bueno de Faria continued: "While this is a 'technical' COP, negotiators must not forget what climate negotiations are really about - people and communities all across the world, whose lives are in serious jeopardy as a result of climate change." "Climate Justice is also a matter of intergenerational justice and about churches acting now," said LWF general secretary Rev. Dr Martin Junge. "I have been encouraged to hear about churches' climate action and advocacy, which the young LWF delegates at COP 23 have shared: energy transition, responsible consumption, theological education and local advocacy on climate justice is already on the agenda of several churches. This is good news." Referring to the urgency to address climate change, Junge added: "Climate change is not fake news. It is bad news for the human family, particularly for the most vulnerable. The Paris agreement needs to be implemented. Now!" The COP 23 This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 13, 2017 Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6073323 MSTRUCK \</doc>

The following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF): By: Tom Murray After the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21) in 2015, where the historic climate accord was established, it was near impossible to imagine a future COP where the US federal government wouldn't play a central role. Yet now, at COP 23 in Bonn, Germany, the US government doesn't have an official presence at the event for the first time ever. To fill the void of federal policy action, companies and organizations from across the US are voicing their support for the Paris agreement at the U.S. Climate Action Center, a pavilion sponsored exclusively by non-federal US stakeholders. The Climate Action Center is an initiative of the We Are Still In coalition of cities, states, tribes, universities, and businesses that are committed to the Paris Agreement. Thus far over 1,700 businesses including Apple, Amazon, Campbell Soup, Nike, NRG Energy and Target have signed the We Are Still In declaration evidence that public climate commitments are quickly becoming the norm. Businesses at the heart of climate action in Bonn #WeAreStillIn signatories show their support for a low carbon economy and help fill the gap in US leadership # COP23 Click To Tweet Powered By CoSchedule Jeff Moe from Ingersoll Rand, a Fortune 500 industrial manufacturing company that has pledged to reduce the carbon footprint of their products 50 percent by 2020, noted at the opening of the Climate Action Center, "We're not changing our strategy because there's a different administration. It's the right thing to do as a business." Sustainability leaders from Citi, Johnson Controls, PGandE Corporation, Coca-Cola and others are also publicly sharing insights on innovation, investment and action geared toward transitioning to a cleaner future. Tom Murray, VP EDF+Business COP 23 sparks new commitments On the first day of the climate summit, HSBC pledged to provide $100 billion in sustainable financing and investment by 2025, and to source 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 all part of HSBC's broader goal to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this week, Microsoft pledged to reduce their operational carbon emissions 75 percent by 2030. In 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to institute an internal price on carbon, which enabled them to "operate 100 percent carbon neutral." America's Pledge co-chairs Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown released a new report, "America's Pledge Phase 1: States, Cities, and Businesses in the United States Are Stepping Up on Climate Action," which highlights the scope and scale of non-federal climate action across the U.S. Lastly, the US Business Showcase event in Bonn represents the first major international gathering of American business climate leaders since the federal government's announcement in June to withdraw from the Paris Accord. Hosted by World Wildlife Fund US and Ceres, the event brings together a diverse array of companies to share how they're increasing resiliency and setting emissions-reduction targets. A year of climate action in review Other We Are Still In businesses made headlines throughout 2017 for setting ambitious climate goals and making clean energy investments despite the lack of federal action on climate change: Mars Inc. pledged to invest $1 billion towards its Sustainable in a Generation Plan. This includes a goal to slash GHG emissions by 67 percent across its value chain by 2050. Walmart set a new goal to reduce emissions in their supply chain by 1 gigaton (1 billion metric tons) by 2030. Hewlett Packard Enterprise launched the first-ever supply chain program based on climate science, requiring 80 percent of manufacturing suppliers to set "science-based emissions reduction targets in their operations by 2025, seeking to avoid 100 million tons of emissions." Amazon announced their biggest wind farm yet. The company now has 18 wind and solar projects across the US, with plans to build 35 more this is part of Amazon's goal to use 100% renewable energy. There are many more companies I can add to the list. Business made progress on climate action in 2017, but more needs to be done to keep us on track towards a low carbon future. For example, preliminary findings from Bloomberg's annual Climatescope report show that clean energy investments in emerging markets are falling, despite the Paris Agreement commitment for wealthier nations to provide $100 billion annually through 2020 to emerging nations to combat and mitigate the effects of climate change. Sustainability leadership in 2018 Register for EDF and Ceres' upcoming webinar on November 28th:The Business Case for Climate Leadership and the Clean Power Plan: Why Company Voices Matter Now. There are countless opportunities for businesses to weigh in on smart climate policy, for example by supporting the Clean Power Plan here at home. If you're not taking a long-term, systematic approach to building a healthy business for a healthy environment, EDF's three-part framework to sustainability leadership can empower and equip your company to meet the challenges ahead. With a leadership vacuum in Washington, DC, now's the time for business to continue to lead on climate.

DHL International, a postal and logistics company, issued the following news release: Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading mail and logistics company, is an official partner of the incoming Fijian Presidency for the 2017 UN climate change conference COP23 in Bonn. In addition, the Group is also the official partner for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), completed by its existing partnership with the City of Bonn in the course of COP23 . Fiji will be presiding over COP23 as President while UN Climate Change will be hosting the conference at its headquarters in Bonn, with the support of the German Government and the City of Bonn. The event is taking place from November 6 to 17 at the UN Campus and Rheinaue-Park Bonn, on either side of Deutsche Post DHL Group's headquarters. Approximately 20,000 guests from around the globe are expected to join the summit. "The drua is the symbol on Fiji's COP23 Presidency. It is a reminder to the entire world that we are all in the same canoe when it comes to climate change. We must fill the sail of this canoe with a collective determination to move the climate action agenda forward," said Peniana Lalabalavu, Chief Coordinator for the COP23 Presidency. "We would like to express our gratitude for the amazing support provided by Deutsche Post DHL Group, which has used its international network and specialist experience to transfer the drua and other artifacts to Bonn". Deutsche Post DHL Group is not only supporting its partners by providing climate neutral shipping services and logistics support but also helping to facilitate the conference by offering spaces and meeting areas. Additionally, the Group is also organizing an extensive program ranging from exhibitions of its e-fleet to activities promoting sustainability such as tree planting initiatives involving employees as well as Bonn citizens. "We are proud to join forces with Fiji and the UN Climate Change, united in our common goal of protecting the environment. Green logistics can play a key role in combating climate change. This is why we have introduced our GoGreen Mission 2050 that aims to reduce our own logistics-related emissions to net zero by 2050, leading the way into a new era of sustainable logistics." says Christof Ehrhart, Executive Vice President Corporate Communications and Corporate Responsibility at Deutsche Post DHL Group. Nick Nuttall, Spokesperson and Director of the Communication and Outreach Program (CO), UN Climate Change adds: "UN Climate Change is honored to be hosting COP 23 and is determined to support strong and positive outcomes that will advance climate action across the globe. Deutsche Post DHL Group is a strong supporter of our joint endeavor working towards a sustainable future and as well an ideal partner for realizing our ambitions to make the event of the COP 23 environmentally-friendly". Sustainability and responsibility are integral components of Deutsche Post DHL Group's corporate strategy, In 2008 the Group became the first global player in the logistics industry to establish a climate protection target. This goal - to improve its carbon efficiency by 30% over the 2007 baseline by the year 2020 - was achieved in 2016, four years ahead of schedule. In 2017 the company set its sights on another ambitious goal: by 2050 the Group wants to reduce all transport-related emissions to net zero and thus contribute to the 'well below' 2 degrees Celsius global warming goal established at the 2015 UN Paris Climate Conference (COP 21). Already back in 2013, Deutsche Post DHL Group made Bonn a model city for carbon-free delivery vehicles, and today operates more than 100 of the Group's own StreetScooters in the Bonn region. DHL Trade Fairs & Events delivers Fijian exhibits to Bonn As an official partner, DHL Trade Fairs & Events (TFE), a business unit of DHL Freight, is responsible for special logistics and has supported the construction of the conference site. As a symbol of this partnership and the conference itself, the business unit transported a Fijian double-hull sailing canoe, a drua from the National Maritime Museum (NMM) in Greenwich, London, to Bonn to be exhibited in the World Conference Center, the heart of the so-called "Bula Zone" where the COP23 negotiations will take place. NMM is the owner of the drua and has loaned it to the Fijian Presidency for the duration of the COP23 . The transport was realized by an aerodynamic DHL Teardrop Trailer. The truck has a curved roof which reduces air resistance, hence cutting fuel consumption by up to ten percent compared to regular heavy-load trucks.

Caribbean Development Bank, a financial institution, issued the following news release: The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has joined a coalition of developing and developed countries and international institutions, which have committed to combatting climate change and adapting to its effects. On November 14, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), the Bank was announced as one of the newest members of the NDC Partnership. Admission to the Partnership comes as CDB intensifies its effort to scale up climate action in its Borrowing Member Countries. Speaking at the event, "Champions for Climate Action: The NDC Partnership", President of the Bank, Dr. Wm. Warren Smith, said that CDB's decision to join was a "no-brainer". "The principles that underpin this Partnership coincide very nicely with the approach of the Caribbean Development Bank. We, as a small institution, have learnt over the years that there is very little that we can do on our own. We have to work with several different countries and institutions in order for us to mobilise the resources that we need for our borrowing member countries. And we also need to gather the information and the experiences of our larger partners, in particular, for us to be able to get it right," said Smith. The NDC Partnership is a platform for the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - the targets countries around the world are working to achieve, to stop global temperatures from rising 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Partnership promotes long-term climate action; advancing adaptation and mitigation; and aligning development and climate change. Partners work together to identify the capacity needs of developing countries and determine the appropriate means to address those needs. The NDC Partnership was launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Marrakesh, Morocco last year. Since then, it has grown to almost 80 members that are engaging jointly to help 15 developing countries and emerging economies reach their NDC targets under the Paris Agreement and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Brazil; Canada; Colombia; Germany; Haiti; Italy; Mexico; Saint Lucia; and the United Kingdom are CDB member countries that have joined the NDC Partnership.

The following information was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): COP23 : FAO Director-General urges climate change mitigation and adaptation throughout food system The impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa is contributing to an increase in global hunger. Emissions from the agriculture sectors are set to increase in the future, further contributing to climate change, unless the world adopts sustainable, climate-smart ways of producing, transporting, processing and consuming food, FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva warned today at the United Nations Climate Change conference , COP 23 . Noting that we should "not be discouraged by the challenges ahead," the FAO Director-General stressed that achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is still possible. "Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions." "It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas," Graziano da Silva said. Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day. This spike is due mainly to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050. Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices At least one fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted. Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others. "We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists ...can tackle these challenges on their own," and they will need national and international support, he added. "Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time," Graziano da Silva explained. He noted in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, "low carbon livestock is possible," - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30 percent. FAO's work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries monitor their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and that technical and financial support is needed to turn these commitments into reality.

Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., D-Calif., issued the following news release: In forceful remarks before the Baden-Wurttemberg State Parliament and nearly three hours of wide-ranging debate and dialogue with members of the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today forged closer ties with European leaders committed to climate action and blasted the "denialists" who continue to reject the scientific consensus on global warming. "We have to wake up - wake up Europe, wake up America, wake up the whole world to realize we have a common destiny and we are all human beings on this one planet," said Governor Brown in his address to the state parliament of Baden-Wurttemberg, co-founder of the Under2 Coalition. "This is daunting but it's also an opportunity to pull people together." From Stuttgart, Germany, the Governor traveled to Brussels, Belgium, where he joined dozens of members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for more than three hours of debate and discussion on climate change, its impacts, and opportunities for further collaboration. During the final hour of the exchange, the Governor confronted several members that used their remarks to openly question the science of climate change. "The truth is that any kind of catalogue of the scientific community indicates that climate change is real, it's having impacts. Even the Trump administration couldn't, with a straight face, curb a report that underscores the very opposite of what you denialists have expressed here," said Governor Brown during the discussion with the European Parliament Conference of Presidents. "With the denialists getting more attention, the people, instead of growing in their skepticism, are growing in their conviction that climate change and global warming are real matters - and we have to deal with them." Tomorrow, the Governor will conclude his visit to Brussels with a moderated conversation hosted by the German Marshall Fund. Later this week, the Governor will travel to Oslo, Norway, where he will meet with the country's Prime Minister and Environment Minister and convene scientists from the world's top national science academies before arriving in Bonn, Germany, where he will serve as Special Advisor for States and Regions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ).

Over the weekend, the Governor delivered keynote remarks at a symposium on climate change hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican, where he called on global faith leaders to help awaken the world to the threat of toxic carbon pollution. Governor Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions in June by Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama - president of COP23 . The Governor continues to build strong coalitions of partners committed to curbing carbon pollution in both the United States through the U.S. Climate Alliance and around the globe with the Under2 Coalition, which has grown to include 188 jurisdictions collectively representing more than 1.2 billion people and $28.9 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and 39 percent of the global economy. The Governor also joined United Nations Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael Bloomberg to launch America's Pledge on climate change to help compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In September 2018, the State of California will convene the world's climate leaders in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit, where representatives from subnational governments, businesses, investors and civil society will gather with the direct goal of supporting the Paris Agreement. This year, Governor Brown traveled to China to build closer climate ties with President Xi Jinping, Russia to call for deeper trans-pacific collaboration on climate change at the Eastern Economic Forum, Canada to officially link California's carbon market with Quebec and Ontario and New York to discuss subnational climate action with the UN Secretary-General and open Climate Week NYC 2017.

Sacramento: Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., The State of California has issued the following news release: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) by the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama - incoming president of COP 23 - today at a ceremony where Fiji became the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition. Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee - members of the Under2 Coalition and U.S. Climate Alliance - also attended today's ceremony and announced that they too will attend the COP 23 in Bonn, Germany to represent subnational jurisdictions committed to climate action. "California is proud to partner with Fiji, an island nation that is experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate change and this year is the leader of the UN Conference of Parties," said Governor Jerry Brown. "I look forward to taking the next step later this year with Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee when we join Prime Minister Bainimarama in Bonn to show that states and regions will fulfill the Paris commitment." The Under2 Coalition is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius - the level of potentially catastrophic consequences - by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels or holding emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050. With the addition of Fiji, the coalition now includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and over 39 percent of the global economy. "As the incoming President of COP 23 , Fiji looks forward to working with this group of states and regions in the global effort to advance climate action at every level of society. This is true now more than ever following the Trump Administration's announcement that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. This decision has redoubled our commitment to forge a Grand Coalition that includes all levels of government, businesses and civil society, to take climate action forward with the urgency it deserves," said Prime Minister Bainimarama. "We look forward Governor Brown's help in mobilising like-minded leaders from around the world in support of our goal to achieve concrete outcomes at COP 23 ." At today's ceremony, Washington Governor Inslee and Oregon Governor Brown also announced that they will attend the COP 23 as part of a delegation of U.S. governors that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a partnership formed in response to the White House's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. The alliance now includes 13 U.S. states - led by both Democrats and Republicans - committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. The U.S. Climate Alliance complements the goals of the Under2 Coalition, which nine climate alliance members have also joined. "The 'America First' doctrine should put our children first. Future generations will judge us not on the facts of global climate change, but what we've done to tackle it. Strengthening the commitment to combat climate change sends a strong message to our global allies. The Paris Agreement is a blueprint from job creation and prosperity, and despite the decision by the White House to retreat, I will continue to work with leaders on the West Coast, across the country, and around the world in pursuit of greenhouse gas reduction goals and working toward the development of a greener, cleaner energy mix of the future," said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. "The growing momentum for national and subnational collaboration gives me confidence about our ability to defeat climate change. This is an all-comers race against time, and I'm proud that Washington state is racing shoulder-to-shoulder with our West Coast neighbors, and our neighbors around the globe," said U.S. Climate Alliance co-chair Governor Inslee. California's legislative leaders, Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le\'f3n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, share a strong commitment to climate action and also joined today's event. "Here in California we have been leaders in developing the green economy that is proving that a healthy environment and good jobs can go hand in hand. We also recognize in California that climate change affects the quality of life and the public health in all our communities and in all countries around the world, so our climate actions must benefit all communities and all countries. Ignoring or denying climate change is beyond reckless," said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.

The meeting is the final step in the preparations for COP23 , which will take place in Bonn, Germany, on November 6-17. The decision of US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement has increased EU efforts to protect the environment. Ministers will exchange views on countries' political priorities and expectations for COP23 and discuss key issues concerning the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. 'Fiji knows first-hand the effects of climate change and we look forward to its leadership as Presidency of COP23 ,' Ca\'f1ete said. 'At the conference next month, the international community will need to demonstrate its continued commitment to the Paris Agreement and make substantive progress on the work programme for its implementation,' the Commisisoner added. The pre-COP meeting will prepare the ground for negotiations at COP23 on the work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement, which Parties have agreed to adopt by 2018. Ministers will also discuss the Facilitative Dialogue to be held next year to take stock of Parties' collective efforts towards the Agreement's goals.

The U.S. Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe issued the following news release: Welcoming the outcomes of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP23 ), which wrapped up Saturday in Bonn, the Chair of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's economic and environmental committee today called for a more robust commitment by all OSCE countries to make progress on addressing climate change. Chair Nilza Sena (Portugal) said that the pledges made by countries in Bonn - including the launching of the 'Talanoa Dialogue' for strengthening national climate action plans - are an encouraging sign that the international community is continuing to move forward in addressing the threat posed by human-induced climate change. Sena welcomed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's remarks at the conference stressing greater focus on five action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership. Sena noted that the outcomes from Bonn are especially important in showing continued international commitment to climate progress in light of the decision announced by United States President Donald Trump last June to pull the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. "Despite the disappointing decision by President Trump earlier this year to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is reassuring that so many world leaders - and also leaders on the state and local levels in the U.S. - are committed to continuing the pursuit of carbon reduction strategies," Sena said. "I welcome the outcomes of the COP23 and I strongly urge all OSCE participating States to continue moving forward in addressing climate change, which must be seen as not only an environmental challenge but a security threat as well." She applauded the COP23 initiative of more than 20 countries - including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Finland, and Austria - who joined the "Powering Past Coal" alliance, promising to phase out traditional coal power plants and cease all investment in coal domestically or abroad. Two U.S. states - Washington and Oregon - also joined the accord, Sena noted. She also said that it was encouraging to see participation at the COP23 by a coalition of more than 2,500 mayors, governors and others from across the United States who on 11 November released the "America's Pledge" report, outlining the scope of non-federal climate action in the U.S. following the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. "Considering the dire situation we face in terms of rising sea levels, intensified heat waves, droughts, forest fires, and stronger storms, it is clear that we need an all-hands-on-deck approach that utilizes innovation and creative thinking to move towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy," Sena said. At the OSCE PA Annual Session last July, parliamentarians adopted the Minsk Declaration, which "urges all OSCE participating States to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and its related challenges" and calls on all OSCE countries "to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change [and] to fulfill their obligations under the agreement." Nilza Sena was elected Chair of the OSCE PA's Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment at the 2016 Annual Session in Tbilisi and was reelected in Minsk.

Oct 27, 2017( Red, Green, and Blue: HYPERLINK http://redgreenandblue.org http://redgreenandblue.org COP23 summit marks a critical stepping stone for global climate action. By\~Paula Caballero[1],\~David Waskow[2]\~and\~Christina Chan[3] World Resources Institute[4] This year's wave of climate-related natural disasters - hurricanes, floods and wildfires in developing and developing countries alike - drives home the urgency to move full speed ahead at the 23rd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known informally as COP23 . Increasing public and private investment in the transition to clean energy and transport, in restoring forested areas, and in more sustainable cities demonstrate that significant inroads towards tackling climate change are being made at the national and local level. Countries are also reaffirming their commitment to climate action as a priority - both at home and internationally -including support for the Paris Agreement demonstrated at the\~G7[5]\~and\~G20[6]\~summits and at the\~African Ministerial Conference on the Environment\~[7](AMCEN). Steady progress, however, is not enough. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to start coming down quickly, peaking by 2020 and getting to net-zero by 2050, in order to meet the Paris goal of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and optimally1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. That means there is a small window of opportunity left to make the low-carbon transition in ways that are economically and technically manageable given the options we have today. COP23 must continue to strengthen an international climate regime that sends the right market signals, reaffirms support for more ambitious and transformational implementation, raises awareness of the growing impacts of climate change, and mobilizes an ever greater number of players to act now before it is too late to avoid the most severe consequences of a changing climate. Here are four signs to look for at COP23 :1. Tangible and Constructive Progress on Making the Paris Agreement OperationalThe implementation guidelines of the Agreement, sometimes referred to as the\~rulebook[8], will put the accord fully into motion when finalized at next year's climate summit in Poland. At Bonn, negotiators need to identify key decision points and the options for resolving them, along with an effective process for crafting clear rules and procedures on a wide range of issues. These include the transparency framework, which includes reporting and review requirements under the Agreement, as well as the ambition mechanism to assess progress and ramp up action every five years.2. A Strong Foundation for 2018, the First Moment under the Paris Agreement for Countries to Assess Progress and Signal their Readiness to Enhance ActionEnhancing climate action every five years, informed by periodically taking stock of progress and identifying new opportunities for action, is a fundamental premise of the Paris Agreement. COP 23 will set in motion the first of these stocktaking exercises next year during the 2018 facilitative dialogue  now called the\~Talanoa Dialogue[9]. The dialogue will assess global progress towards meeting the Paris long-term goals, highlight opportunities to step up action, and help spur countries to move forward on enhancing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020. In addition, events next year such as the\~Global Climate Action Summit[10]\~in September 2018, a gathering of states, cities, businesses and others, will also recognize the decisive role that these actors play and encourage even greater action. Other upcoming initiatives like the December climate finance summit organized by French President Emmanuel Macron will contribute to launching 2018 as a year of pivotal change, with a new momentum to put us on track to driving the investment and action needed to achieve a climate resilient future.3. Heightened Attention to Climate Impacts and Vulnerability, and Concrete, Practical Steps to Help Vulnerable Countries and CommunitiesAs the first small island nation to preside over a global climate summit, the government of Fiji has made protecting the vulnerable a strong focus. Negotiators must agree on how to recognize efforts by developing countries to adapt to increasing climate impacts, evaluate effectiveness and mobilize greater support. That includes finance, as well as technology and capacity building. An important step at COP23 would be to formally link the Adaptation Fund, which has focused on building community-level resilience, to the Paris Agreement. Negotiators also need to provide guidance on how to increase the\~share of adaptation finance[11]\~as developed countries scale up finance to meet their commitment to\~mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020[12]. Parties must also do more to address loss and damage from climate impacts, even as they recognize the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.4. A Growing Wave of Support from Cities, Businesses and OthersStakeholders outside the negotiations have emerged as critical partners in the fight against climate change. At COP23 , look for businesses, states, cities and others around the world to demonstrate how they are intensifying their efforts, rallying around the Paris Agreement and contributing to national climate goals. The overwhelming support for climate action from within the United States - despite the Trump administration's efforts to the contrary  is a prime example. States, cities and companies that make up more than half the U.S. economy have declared support for the Paris Agreement. Rather than back away, they are stepping up, and together they have the potential to significantly move U.S. climate action forward. At climate negotiations last year in Morocco, we witnessed\~the world's steely determination to advance climate action[13]\~despite any obstacles that may arise. COP23 is a time to carry that spirit forward and make concrete progress on structuring the Paris Agreement. Moreover, it is an opportunity to set the stage for 2018 when countries can step up their response to the climate challenge and bequeath a livable world for future generations.World Resources Institute[14] (WRI) is a global research organization that spans\~more than 50 countries[15]. We envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise management of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where the actions of government, business, and communities combine to eliminate poverty and sustain the natural environment for all people. Our more than 700\~experts and staff[16]\~turn big ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity and human well-being. (This post originally appeared at WRI's blog[17].

Nov 29, 2017( The Law of Nations: HYPERLINK https://lawofnationsblog.com https://lawofnationsblog.com COP-23 '), with delegates meeting to hammer out the details of states' commitments under the Paris Agreement. With the Paris Agreement having entered into force more quickly than many parties had envisaged, the negotiations in Bonn were focused on developing technical guidelines to support implementation of the Paris Agreement. In particular, negotiators were working on measurement and reporting requirements to ensure transparency of parties' greenhouse gas emissions and on the processes for a global stocktake of emissions planned for 2018. A useful summary of the technical outcomes of the negotiations is here[1]. With the majority (164) of states having filed their first mandatory Nationally Determined Contributions ('NDCs') and thereby signaling their national strategies and planned actions to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, negotiators were focusing in Bonn on the details of how to measure states' progress in reduction of GHGs, as well as realisation of climate finance commitments, including the $100 billion per year that developed countries pledged in 2009.negotiators were focusing in Bonn on the details of how to measure states' progress in reduction of GHGs, as well as realisation of climate finance commitmentsSeveral of the major announcements from the Bonn negotiations were HSBC's announcement[2] to provide $100b in sustainable financing and investment by 2025, the UK and Canada's announcement[3] to phase out coal for energy production (alongside 20 other countries), and President Macron's announcement[4] that France would cover the shortfall in funding for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ('IPCC') caused by the planned US withdrawal. As the first COP to be hosted by a Pacific Island nation (Fiji - even though physically the meetings were in Bonn), two important announcements were the organisation of the 2018 'Talanoa Dialogue' (a process to showcase best practices to raise ambition and pre-2020 action) and progress on a platform to promote participation of indigenous peoples and local communities within the negotiations. See the Fiji Presidency's round-up of achievements from the talks here[5]. One of the big talking points among business and government delegates was the £lternative' US pavilion, largely sponsored by Michael Bloomberg, representing the 'We Are Still In' coalition of states, cities and businesses supporting the Paris Agreement despite the planned US withdrawal (an earlier update on the US withdrawal is here[6]). Bloomberg[7] called for formal representation within the negotiations of his coalition, which was claimed to represent over half of the US economy. Delegates also reported that China was increasingly stepping forward to take leadership roles as the (official) US delegation became less visible. Alongside the negotiations, a series of side events were hosted by civil society and business groups. I participated in an official side event[8] on dispute resolution for climate related disputes, hosted jointly by the International Bar Association, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Chaired by Debevoise ...impton LLP partner Wendy Miles QC, speakers considered the options provided in the Paris Agreement for state-state dispute resolution (including conciliation, arbitration and/or referral to the International Court of Justice), as well as relevant factors to ensure legitimacy of investor-state dispute resolution linked to Paris Agreement mitigation and adaptation actions, and the implications for commercial disputes. COP-23 and the Fijian Presidency succeeded in holding together the delicate balance achieved at COP-21 in Paris in 2015One final talking point among legal delegates was the series of side events hosted by NGOs on the growth of climate related litigation being brought against Governments and corporates. It is evident that more cases are being filed against corporates alleging responsibility for climate harms, with a German regional court recently permitting a case brought against RWE for climate related damage to continue, Californian litigation ongoing against energy companies asserting responsibility for sea level rise, and hearings currently underway in Norwegian litigation challenging the Norwegian Government's issuance of licenses in the Barents Sea. A useful summary of current global litigation and legislative climate trends presented during COP-23 is here[9]. Although the outcomes of COP-23 are more muted than previous conferences, COP-23 and the Fijian Presidency succeeded in holding together the delicate balance achieved at COP-21 in Paris in 2015. Much attention will now come onto the Talanoa Dialogue to create a positive platform for the 2018 negotiations in Katowice, Poland and to hold parties to account to their Paris NDCs.

The 350.org issued the following news release: Speaking from Bonn as the first ever UN Climate Talks ( COP 23 ) to be conducted under the presidency of a Pacific Island nation begin, the Pacific Climate Warriors reminded world leaders of the urgency for action: "In the Pacific, the impacts of climate change are not a debate, it is our reality. We no longer have time to talk. Now is the time to act!" COP23 , under the presidency of Fiji, creates a historic moment in the climate justice movement, as voices from the Climate Vulnerable Forum are put front and centre. "We are here to push world leaders to show real climate leadership: end the era of fossil fuels, and build a just, renewable future for all," said George Nacewa, one of the Pacific Climate Warriors, speaking from Bonn as the opening ceremony is underway. " The world is at a turning point, the climate crisis is no longer a future threat: it's a clear and present danger. Climate change is affecting all and will continue to affect you, me and the places that we call home. If we don't stand up in the face of climate change, who will?" The Pacific Climate Warriors, representing 12 Pacific Island nations, are putting forward the Pacific Climate Warriors Declaration on Climate Change, which states: For more than two decades, negotiations have failed to deliver the action required to protect our homes and livelihoods from dangerous climate change. Communities everywhere are stepping up to ensure that their voices are heard, that the leadership vacuum left by world leaders is filled, and they deliver the change we need at the pace we need to avoid catastrophic climate change. We, the Pacific Climate Warriors, on behalf of the communities we are from, call for more ambitious action on climate change from our world leaders. 'We are not drowning, we're fighting!' "People from the Pacific, Germany, and all over the world have come together as an internationally united climate justice movement to demand the end of fossil fuels now," said Brianna Fruean, Climate Warrior from Samoa, as she participated in a traditional ceremony in the deserted village of Manheim. On the eve of COP23 climate talks, Pacific Islanders and thousands of people from across the world took direct action in the Rhineland coalfields; as thousands of people blocked the open-pit lignite mine Hambach, the Pacific Climate Warriors stood in solidarity with people impacted by and resisting the coal industry in Germany. This is a pivotal moment for global efforts to combat climate change. Countries will either succumb to the forces of denial, like the Trump Administration, or move ahead to a clean energy future that works for all.

At the 19th Conference of Parties (COP 19) held in December 2013 in Warsaw, a mechanism called the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) on Loss and Damage was agreed upon. The Loss and Damage Mechanism was commenced to address the implementation of approaches which would tackle loss and damage associated with "the adverse effects of climate change". Initiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main functions of this mechanism are the following three (UNFCCC, 2017): Enhancing knowledge and understanding of comprehensive risk management approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. Strengthening dialogue, coordination, coherence and synergies among relevant stakeholders. Enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity-building, to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. Two years later on December 2015, we saw the formation of the Paris Agreement on COP 21. Article 8 of the Paris agreement focused on loss and damage. It again recognized the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with "the adverse effects of climate change" which included extreme weather events and slow onset events. It also expressed intention to promote the understanding, action and support among parties and emphasized on the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage (COP 21, 2015). But to be honest, these achievements have mostly become throwback meeting minutes for people in high tables. The real solutions still hasn't come from these initiatives which was initially anticipated. Neither the Paris Agreement nor the COP decisions had any specific direction regarding any financial support for loss and damage. It was merely suggested that the parties should increase support for loss and damage. In fact, paragraph 52 of the COP decision is similar to an "exclusion clause" which states that "provisions defined in article 8 of the agreement do not include or are a basis for liability or compensation." (K\'fcnzel, Sch\'e4fer, Minninger, & Baldrich, 2017) This obviously didn't get a warm welcome from the affected parties who expected more from the countries mainly responsible for rapid climate change. The major instrument discussed by the WIM so far to address the issue of loss and damage is climate risk insurance. The idea is that it will serve as a facilitative mechanism for support against the loss of assets, livelihoods and lives caused by climate change. But as the global climate change-induced disasters are on the rise, how this instrument will sustain in the long run remains a topic of contention (Thomas et al., 2017). In just July this year, unusual heavy floods have resulted in the death of more than 1,200 people and it affected the lives of 43 million people in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. Pakistan was also the victim of an ominous monsoon cyclone which killed 16 and affected millions. These extreme weather events in South Asia are predicted to rise as the global temperature continues to hike (GBSNP Varma, 2015). In fact, it has been projected that South Asia will be among the worst affected regions to be devastated by climate change (Eckstein, K\'fcnzel, & Sch\'e4fer, 2017). In a region where a quarter of the world's population lives, how the insurance mechanism will work after a major climate-change induced disaster is not clear. Following COP 19 and the Paris Agreement, this year's COP ( COP 23 in Bonn) was started with the hope of a more definite and practical addressing to "Loss and Damage". Affected parties really wanted something meaningful to happen. But, ultimately, there were no real outcome on this at the end of the conference. Many climate vulnerable countries which includes island nations and developing countries, was hoping to get permanent and secure monetary support for their adaptation programs to mitigate the loss and damages, but the developed countries seemed to have found a way to not reach a consensus on this issue in COP 23 (Saiful Islam, 2017). Instead, the latest conference in Bonn appeared to have gain an altogether different purpose than intended, which is the promotion of the concept of a clearing house. Clearing house for risk transfer is basically a repository of information on insurance and related subjects. Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid International said a harsh truth about the Clearing house to an interview on the third pole. He commented, "All this fanfare about the clearinghouse is actually just about a matchmaking website that can help private companies meet more clients." He also expressed concern about the efforts and money of developed countries in this cause, which, in his opinion are ultimately helping private companies make profit from selling insurance to the poor (The Third Pole, 2017). This is indeed disappointing for the affected countries and regions like South Asia but they have to be determined and resilient as ever. It will be important to note that apart from the clearing houses, some of the best practices identified by the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (ExCom) include ideas like comprehensive risk management capacity with risk pooling and transfer, contingency finance, climate-themed bonds, catastrophe bonds and financing approaches to make development climate more resilient (K\'fcnzel et al., 2017). Affected countries and regions have to think about other innovative means of addressing Loss and Damage. Several actors have indeed come up with some innovative financial means for addressing this pressing issue. Germanwatch compiled a list of innovative solutions suggested from around the world (K\'fcnzel et al., 2017), they are: Financial Transaction Tax (FTT): This proposes a fee on transactions and trades such as bonds, stocks and currencies. Proponents say that it could generate a significant amount of money. But there remains some practical challenges when it comes to the implementation of this idea. International Airline Passenger Levy (IAPAL): This proposes a fee on international airline tickets. It was first proposed to UNFCCC in 2008 and was renewed in 2016. It also suffers the same problem of implementation. Bunker Fuels Levy: This is a highly potential area for development. It proposes Tax on emissions by cargo ships and airplanes. Although it hasn't been implemented yet. Fossil Fuels Major Carbon Levy: The concept of this is developed by the Climate Justice Programme (CJP). It proposes to levy tax targeting the 90 major fossil fuel extracting companies who are alone responsible for 63 % of greenhouse gas emissions (Climate Justice Programme, 2014). Global Carbon Levy: It proposes a global carbon pricing system either by tax or a trading scheme. An additional advantage of this is it that could shift consumption away from fossil fuels. Although it hasn't been implemented on the international level as yet. We have to rethink and reevaluate the way we are handling the issue of climate change. Especially South Asia has to be more vocal & innovative in demanding its rights to compensation for loss and damages. Hopefully, Countries from this region will take COP 23 as a wake-up call and take a more organized approach in COP 24. Bibliography: Climate Justice Programme. (2014). Introducing...

The following information was released by ActionAid: ActionAid's statement on the Agriculture Decision at COP23 Agriculture decision a welcome piece of positive news, says ActionAid TODAY AT COP23 CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS, countries adopted a draft agreement on agriculture that will be presented to ministers for approval. Teresa Anderson, climate and resilience policy officer for ActionAid International says: "Dealing with agriculture has always been a complex challenge in these climate talks. For a long time they have been blocked on how to help both vulnerable farmers and the planet, and on ways to turn talk into action. "The new draft decision essentially means that the scientific and technical talks about agriculture can translate into action, and that the UN system can provide more strategic support to countries that need it. "It's a welcome piece of positive news coming out of the Fiji climate talks when other negotiation streams are still pretty difficult." ActionAid's statement on "Climate Smart Agriculture" at COP23 Climate Smart agriculture sounds good but means little, says ActionAid Following this morning's press conference on Climate Smart Agriculture at COP23 , Teresa Anderson, climate and resilience policy officer at ActionAid International said: "The term 'Climate Smart Agriculture' causes confusion because it sounds good, but it means little. "Corporations like Yara, Syngenta, Monsanto and the industrial livestock industry all claim that their strategies somehow reduce emissions even though they represent a polluting and harmful approach that's bad for the planet and bad for farmers. "Big corporations are flexing their muscles so they can not only continue business-as-usual, but also new markets by posing as climate leaders and expanding into developing countries. We know they are highly influential. They are lobbying, creating new initiatives and talking to governments. Let's not allow that to happen. "We need to shine the spotlight on them and talk about what is dangerous for us and the planet. We need to talk about real resilience strategies, real total emission reductions, and how to protect the rights of small farmers. If we allow them to continue with business as usual we will never have a chance of staying under 1.5C." \</doc>

Washington: Green Building Council has issued the following news release: This week unveils not only Greenbuild Boston, but also the start of the two-week long 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23  ). Nations of the world, along with local government, states, businesses and organizations, are gathering in Bonn, Germany. From the U.S., the federal government will participate despite signaling intent to withdraw, as it remains a party to the underlying convention and cannot withdraw from the Paris Agreement for several years. COP23 marks the second meeting since the conference achieved the first-ever global consensus for climate action through the Paris Agreement, which remains a groundbreaking accomplishment. With Paris, 180 countries acknowledged that humans are a cause of climate change and that collective action should be undertaken to keep the planet\' s warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Taking stock of our progress Cumulatively, all the countries\' pledges do not add up to the below-2-degree scenario, and the Paris Agreement calls for national governments to submit a new round of nationally determined contributions in 2020. Critical to informing these pledges is a large part of the formal COP23 negotiations that aim to develop a Paris Agreement rule book and to agree on details for the  Facilitative Dialogue process that will occur in 2018. The Facilitative Dialogue is the first check on how the parties are progressing against their pledges, and includes a special Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on the pathways to 1.5 degrees. The dialogue will support increased ambition and lead into the "Global Stocktake," to be conducted every five years. In addition to mitigation of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, other issues to be discussed at COP23 will include technology, capacity-building support, adaptation and finance. The submitted nationally determined contribution pledged by the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is at least 26\- 28 percent below 2005 levels, to be achieved by 2025. Estimates show that we are already about halfway to that goal, with 2016 carbon emissions hitting a 25-year low. A federal research report released earlier this year also found that U.S. emission growth rates slowed as the economy became less carbon-intensive, although the slowing is not yet sufficient to meet the long-term, 2-degree goal of the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, the U.S. Climate Alliance reported last month that its member states are on the path to meet their share of the nation\' s Paris Agreement commitment; and the America\' s Pledge initiative is undertaking an analysis of the collective impact of the commitments made by U.S. states, cities and businesses. Building sector intensity declining, total area growing How does the building sector fit in? The latest data indicate that buildings are currently responsible for about one-third of global energy consumption, and about 30 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions and 20 percent of total CO2 emissions. Building energy intensity has been improving, notably from improvements in building envelope, energy efficiency and electrification offsetting more carbon-intensive energy choices. These improvements are more than offset, however, by increases in the total amount of building space driven by both per capita increases and population growth. Global energy demand in buildings could actually increase by 50 percent by 2050 without improvement. To align with the Paris Agreement goals, it is projected that we need to decrease the average energy intensity of the global building stock by 80 percent by 2050 through low- and zero-carbon strategies. Due to the work of many in the green building community, with projects demonstrating new technologies, achieving LEED Platinum and net zero energy status, we know this is technically possible; now, we need to accelerate efforts to bring these practices to scale. From major corporations with large real estate portfolios to small design firms, the private sector plays an essential role in reducing the carbon footprint of buildings. Companies throughout the building and real estate sectors are making a difference investing in efficiency and renewable energy, acting on commitments and expanding products and services to drive improvement in buildings and positively impact communities. USGBC at COP23 USGBC is committed to elevating the role of green buildings and green communities as a critical part of mitigating climate change. As the leading source for green building information, education and certification, USGBC will use its presence at COP23 to highlight LEED as the global leadership standard for green buildings and to connect with attendees on policy approaches for green and net zero buildings. Selected events include: "Mobilizing the Business of Clean and Productive Energy," with co-sponsors BCSE, the Alliance to Save Energy and the Corn Refiners Association, with business participants "Launch of the City Climate Planner Program," with the World Bank, World Resources Institute, and ICLEI "City Actions to Decarbonize Buildings," at the U.S. Climate Action Pavilion "Innovation in Materials and Design: Catalysis for the Transition to a Low-carbon Future," with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \</doc>

The United States stands alone when it comes to combating climate change. Syria plans to join the Paris Climate Agreement, two of its delegates said Tuesday, leaving the United States as the only country not a part of the global environmental pact. The announcement occurred during the United Nations' 23rd climate conference ( COP23 ), which is hosted by the island nation of Fiji and taking place in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 through Nov. 17. It is the first such gathering since President Donald Trump HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-06-01/trump-us-to-withdraw-from-paris-climate-accord-on-global-warming announced in June that he was pulling the United States out of the 2015 accord, which seeks to limit global warming by curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Lawmakers in Damascus in October "approved a draft law on ratifying Syria's accession to the Paris Climate Agreement," according to the HYPERLINK Syrian Arab News Agency The declaration comes just over two weeks after Nicaragua -- which initially declined the agreement as its lawmakers said it didn't go far enough in reducing emissions -- joined the global pact, leaving Syria and the United States as the only countries not included.

The following information was released by the European Union: Financing climate projects locally is the challenge non-state actors face worldwide Ahead of COP23 Marco Dus (IT/PES) has been the CoR representative at the Climate Chance Summit in Agadir (11-13 September 2017), the largest gathering of climate actors before COP23 . The 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn will take place from 6 to 17 November 2017. Marco Dus, member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council presented his upcoming opinion on financing climate action. Dus stressed the urgency to develop innovating financing schemes to facilitate cities and regions access to funding. The rapporteur recalled that 'it is essential to mobilise sufficient financial resources to turn the Paris commitments into practice'. About his upcoming opinion on climate finance, Dus said 'The opinion addresses the key strengths and limitations of the existing financing instruments. It formulates proposals on how to make the financing system more solid and more easily accessible to cities and regions. This opinion will represent the CoR's position on climate finance and will be defended at the upcoming COP23 in Bonn'. The event 'Enhancing the potential of climate action partnerships' has been organised by the International Climate Governance Coalition, a joint venture of the European Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Comite 21 the French Committee for Sustainable Development . Their ultimate objective goal is the development of a new multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Brenda King , member of the EESC and President of the Sustainable Development Observatory joined Dus in Agadir. King said: 'Policy-makers are still unaware of the potential of civil society in climate action. The EESC has the priority to demonstrate the potential of non-state actors to significantly contribute to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as well as to point to the obstacles and conditions for success of effective multi-stakeholder and multi-level governance cooperation'. These objectives are gathered in the EESC opinion ' coalition to deliver the commitments of the Paris Agreement ' adopted in July 2016. Marco Dus also presented the provisional findings of the Coalition's mapping report of multi-level and multi-stakeholders governance of climate change. The following factors proved to be particularly important: political commitment as a key to make public funds available and facilitate access to it; clear legal frameworks that reduce uncertainty and build trust between partners; adaptive and flexible management approaches; and public awareness and community involvement. Dus called the audience in Agadir to provide comments and contributions to the report which final version will be available for COP23 in Bonn. The International Climate Governance Coalition is to deliver practical solutions to boost climate action: a toolbox for climate partnerships, recommendations on climate finance, examples for scaling, replicating and extending adaptation and mitigation projects and support for the creation of new multi-stakeholder platforms dedicated to climate and sustainable development. Note: The Climate Chance Summit brings together a large majority of non-state actors worldwide upstream of the UN Climate Conferences. It provides an opportunity to discuss thematic coalitions, share best practices and concrete actions and measures put in place by these actors to combat climate change ahead of the COP climate talks.

The following information was released by the United Nations: On the heels of one of the worst and most costly Atlantic hurricane seasons on record, a global initiative was launched Wednesday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany, with the aim of providing insurance to hundreds of millions of vulnerable people by 2020 and to increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change. In 2017, extreme weather events are estimated to have caused more than $200 billion worth of damage worldwide, as hurricanes, droughts and rising sea levels devastated vulnerable communities with increased frequency and intensity. In the face of skyrocketing costs, new forms of financial protection have become an increasingly urgent part of the climate change discussion. The InsuResilience Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. It aims at meeting the pledge of providing cover and support to an extra 400 million vulnerable people by 2020. The Global Partnership now brings together G20 countries in partnership with the so called 'V20' nations, a group of 49 of the most vulnerable countries including small islands like Fiji, which holds the Presidency of COP23 . "The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change," said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. This announcement on climate risk insurance was made a day before the high-level segment of COP23 , which Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres, are expected to attend. Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support of 125 million dollar for the new Global Partnership as part of the launch. This follows the 30 million commitment to the initiative made by the British Government in July 2017. "Climate risk insurance is a response to the simple fact that extreme weather events are constantly increasing in number and intensity, and also a response to our experience that the international community and the countries affected by extreme weather events tend to really act after those incidents occurred and they tend to come too late and to intervene not significantly enough," Mr. Silberhorn told a press conference. "So our intention is to act more preemptively, to act in time, and to act decisively in order to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Insurance is one tool to address this challenge," he added. A partnership for climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions The Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts. "This new and higher ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions," said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of 'InsuResilience.' The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than $55 million was paid out to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left an arc of destruction across the region. The money was used in various ways, for example, to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations ESCAP: The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) will bring a regional perspective to the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) in Bonn this week, with a series of side-events on sustainable finance, agriculture and role of the UN regional bodies in scaling up climate action on Thursday, 16 November. Asia and the Pacific is set to play a key role in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement but it is faced with substantial challenges. Home to six out of the 10 top global emitters, it contributes to over half of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions, and is the most vulnerable region in the world to the impacts of climate change. However, these challenges also represent an opportunity for regional co-operation to scale up finance for climate action, support greater take-up of carbon pricing, and use public and private partnerships for low-carbon climate-resilient infrastructure investments. Against this backdrop, ESCAP is bringing together ministers and senior officials, along with representatives from the public and private sectors to discuss the sustainable management of oceans, climate-smart agriculture, enhancing access to capital markets, and progress on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). What: Side events 'Asia-Pacific Climate Action: Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda,' 11:30-13:00 (Bonn Time), 16 November 2017, CHINA PAVILION 'Building Smallholders' Resilience to Climate Change through South-South Cooperation,' 14:00-15:30 (Bonn Time), 16 November 2017, CHINA PAVILION 'Opportunities for scaling up climate change action to implement the NDCs in the five UN regions: National perspectives and how Regional Commissions are responding,' 15:00 16:30 (Bonn Time), Room 10, BONN ZONE Where: World Conference Center Bonn, Germany When: 11:30 16:30 (Bonn Time) Thursday 16 November 2017 Visit the event page for more information: HYPERLINK http://www.unescap.org/events/escap- HYPERLINK cop23 For media enquiries please contact: Ms. Katie Elles, Public Information Officer, Strategic Communications and Advocacy Section, ESCAP, M: (66) 9481 525 36 / E: [email protected] Media Advisory Issued: 13 Nov 2017 News Number: N/22/2017 Location: Bonn Media Enquiries Strategic Communications and Advocacy Section +66 2 288-1865 \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "We have to walk on the land and sail at the sea with care and deep respect for what is given", said Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC), as he signed an interfaith statement to be delivered to UN representatives at COP23 . COP23 Interfaith Statement will be presented on 10 November, in Bonn, Germany, where the 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) of the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change is taking place. "God the creator has given us this world as our common home, together with all that is created and living here. To love God and to love our neighbor means that we also love the creation of God", added Tveit. At COP23 "Faith communities have to inspire and mobilize for changes in personal lifestyles and institutional consumption patterns, as well as changes in systems of investment, production and distribution", said Athena Peralta during an interfaith panel promoted at COP23 on 7 November. Peralta, who serves at the WCC as programme executive for economic and ecological justice, was one of the speakers of the panel entitled "Heart to Heart, Hand in Hand". The panel was part of the efforts to promote the interfaith statement. In its first days, COP23 has been confirming the growing realization among various faith communities that climate change has grave implications for the future of our planet and represents great moral and ethical issues.

Twelve students from the University of Michigan's Climate Blue organization just returned to campus after attending the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference earlier this month in Bonn, Germany. This year marked the 23rd meeting of the\~Conference of Parties, held under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the UNFCCC is an international treaty that was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 to mark the beginning of international cooperation in addressing climate change. This year, the UNFCCC's 197 parties\~came together to discuss the implementation of the Paris agreement. The agreement, which was designed during COP21 in 2015, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb the global temperature rise. However, in June 2017, President Donald Trump announced the United States would\~withdraw\~from the agreement in an effort to preserve jobs. The\~Climate Blue\~student group,\~which discusses climate policy across southeast Michigan, began as a blog created by a delegation of University community members who attended COP15 in 2009. Today it reaches graduate students, professors and business people, among others who focus on different areas of study across the country. The organization continues to send a delegation, comprised of students and faculty, to the conference each year. The conference itself primarily consists of negotiations among parties and side events, which serve as platforms for "observer organizations" - like the Climate Blue delegation\~\~- who don't speak in formal negotiations, according to the UNFCCC\~website. Side event participants can engage with parties and other attendees to network and share ideas. Rackham student Matt Irish, who is studying for master's degrees in Applied Climate Science and Electrical Engineering, attended this year's conference as well as COP21. He explained at COP21 there was a lot of fanfare and excitement as national leaders came together to sign the Paris agreement; however, he said after the signing there was still work to be done. "(During COP21), the leaders came the first week actually to kind of say, 'Hey, we're here signing off on it, now make it happen,'" he said. "There was some real stuff that needed to get done but because they had that sort of front-loaded thing, the idea was that those national leaders put their name on it and they had it done ... since we just really wanted to agree, that was mainly all that happened. There were some really important parts of the text that were extremely vague that were left to be figured out later. This year was when that actually had to happen." This year at COP23 COP23 was an exciting opportunity to substantiate some of the more abstract concepts in the Paris agreement. Pertinent to the conference, Irish explained, was whether the United States would be involved in certain parts at all, given Trump's announcement. "What I was most excited about, personally from this last week, was that it seems to me that ... in the past it was everyone waiting - is the U.S. going to play? Is the U.S. in? The question was, what's going to happen to the world if the U.S. is in or not?" he said. "And now, because the Paris agreement has been signed and we're kind of past it, I feel like ... the questions is more, what's going to happen to the U.S. if the U.S. isn't in?" Rackham student Samantha Basile is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. She is the director of the Climate Blue, and attended this year's conference. Basile explained the official United States delegation was really only present in name. She said the other nations had already agreed to work without them. Basile herself spent a lot of time in negotiations, and said it was interesting to see how all of the nations' voices come together to agree on certain steps that need to be taken. She said such agreements are sometimes taken for granted. "We assume that things aren't moving fast enough and we get very frustrated as students, especially because we see, we just have so much energy and we want things to move forward," she said. "So it was a little frustrating to see things get kicked down the road, but at the same time, they're keeping everyone on board and keeping everyone under a consensus vote system so it's pretty amazing that they get anything done." Environment and Sustainability graduate student Chris Karounos is pursuing his master's degree in Environmental Informatics and Conservation Ecology. He said going into the conference he underestimated the "goodwill" of everyone involved in negotiations. "It seemed like everyone had their hearts in the right place and it really needed to be that way because you're in a room of at least 50 different upper-level delegates that were representing an entire country, and they all had to agree on something," he said. Karounos said it was rewarding to be a "fly on the wall" in the negotiation process. "We're really serving a purpose by being there as students," he said. "(Initially), I thought it was kind of a fluff thing, but the U.N. really wants it to be a transparent process." Environment and Sustainability graduate student Tyler Fitch explained the dynamic among conference attendees operates much like a bureaucratic power structure. He said a lot of the negotiations are closed to non-party entities and he said most delegates tend to keep to themselves. However, he said there are a lot of open discussions fostered by the side events. Some student delegations work directly with countries, taking notes for them and helping them navigate their schedules. The Climate Blue delegation, Basile explained, worked specifically with the United Nations Secretariat, which allowed them to interact with the formal process. Rackham student Cesar Luis Barraza Botet, an international student from Colombia, said he approached the Colombian delegation. Barraza Botet said the groups discussed specific topics or articles in the Paris Agreement in the plenary sessions. One article, he explained, discusses technology mechanisms, which requires the development of mitigation and adaptation technologies as well as the ability to transfer them from developed countries to developing countries.\~ "It was amazing to me how they had to agree on every single word that was going into these rulebook documents," he said. In terms of side events, Rackham student Emily Gargulinski - who is pursuing a master's degree in the Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering department - said they took place in what is called the Bonn Zone. The zone comprised country pavilions - spaces in which each country could exhibit their culture and display their climate change initiatives. The exhibitions comprised of small booths that displayed new technology and initiatives. There were also meeting rooms that held side events on topics such as nuclear power and sustainable cities. One key component of the delegation's COP experience is the Climate Blue blog. Through their blogs, members can reflect on conference highlights. "We tried to set it up as a system where everyone could be involved, but hopefully wouldn't be overwhelmed, because we knew the negotiations would be overwhelming in itself," Basile said. "Everyone participated on the Twitter, on our social media, and then our requirement was either before, during or after COP, you would write one blog kind of reflecting on a certain topic. We didn't want it to just be like a diary entry, we wanted it to have a little more of a perspective behind it." In his\~blog, Fitch discussed the We Are Still In\~movement, which comprises cities, companies and universities that support action to implement the Paris agreement despite Trump's intent to withdraw. According to Fitch, there was a series of events related to this movement at the conference. Additionally, in October, Climate Blue and\~Michigan and The Climate Crisis\~wrote a letter to University President Mark Schlissel\~asking\~him to sign the We Are Still In pledge on behalf of the University, which he did. "I think the conference was sort of a, 'What is the next step for We Are Still In?' And frankly I don't think they know yet, but the idea is that ... the We Are Still In folks are going to keep abreast of these negotiations and continue to make climate action happen in the United States," he said. "(The University of) Michigan is a part of that which means it's all the more relevant for us." Irish explained though the United States government did not have a climate pavilion of its own at the conference this year, there was a We Are Still In pavilion area that became the United States' de facto location and was bigger than past federal pavilions. "The idea is just telling the rest of the world that we have federalism in the United States - the federal government doesn't get to call the shots on everything so in a very real sense the U.S. is 'still in,'" he said. "The good thing is it finally helped all the countries build trust together to actually want to do something and try to make this virtuous cycle, but the bad thing is there is absolutely no guarantee that we're actually going to meet our goals," he said. \</doc>

Fiji Airways, Fiji's National Airline, has unveiled the COP23 logo on its fleet. Four A330s and five B737 aircraft will showcase the COP23 logo, highlighting Fiji's presidency of the 23rd\~Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The decision by Fiji Airways to showcase the COP23 logo across its fleet was announced in April by Fijian Prime Minister and incoming President of COP23 , Frank Bainimarama. Andre Viljoen, Fiji Airways Managing Director and CEO commented, "This is a proud moment for Fiji Airways as we show our support for Fiji's Presidency of COP23 . Climate Change is a critical issue globally, and affects every country. The logo, designed by Fijian designer Ronna Sekiguchi is world-class, and a fine addition to our distinctive\~masi\~livery. It will be seen on our aircraft in the 11 countries we fly directly to, and at some of the world's busiest airports like Los Angeles and San Francisco." In announcing Sekigushi's winning design as the COP23 logo last April, Prime Minister Bainimarama described the imagery and symbolism in the logo design as a stark and effective message to the world that captured the vulnerability to climate change of small island developing states.\~ "We are very pleased that our COP23 logo will be carried on the Fiji Airways fleet. We are gearing up to defend and implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change at the global negotiations later this year, and we are very proud that\~Fiji Airways is\~supporting that critical effort by showcasing the powerful images of our COP23 logo to audiences from all around the world," he said.

The International Energy Agency issued the following news release: For the last two decades, the International Energy Agency has attended the annual UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP) negotiations, underscoring the fact that meeting climate goals entails transforming energy systems. At COP23 COP23 was a transitional meeting, paving the way towards next year's COP24 when countries aim to finalize the rulebook supporting full implementation of the Paris Agreement, including their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). COP23 saw key details emerge of next year's Talanoa Dialogue, which will take stock of collective efforts towards the Paris Agreement's long-term mitigation goal, and inform countries as they set their next round of NDCs. The IEA is actively engaged in tracking various underlying indicators of energy transition, through Tracking Clean Energy Progress, World Energy Investment, Energy Efficiency Indicators and key statistics, and will further enhance tracking efforts to support the Talanoa Dialogue. The IEA hosted 13 events at COP23 , and IEA experts spoke in dozens of other forums. A series of key takeaways emerged from these meetings. Energy remains at the heart of addressing climate change Transforming the way we use and produce energy remains central to determining our collective success in meeting the climate challenge. Whether discussions revolved around renewable energy, technology innovation, energy efficiency, or energy access, it was clear that accelerating energy transition is a priority for countries around the world. The energy-climate challenge is global and centrally focussed on real-world implementation The adoption of the Paris Agreement signalled a global response to the climate challenge, with countries at all levels of economic development committing to take action. Two weeks ago, the IEA launched the Clean Energy Transitions Programme, a multi-year 30 million EUR initiative scaling up engagement with major emerging economies. The IEA also took the opportunity at COP23 to meet with officials, policymakers and key stakeholders from the growing IEA family. The IEA was present in the pavilions of key Member and Association countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Germany, France, Japan, as well as the EU and Nordic pavilions. Climate objectives can and must be aligned with broader goals The IEA showcased an integrated approach to reaching climate, socioeconomic, and environmental objectives in the recently launched World Energy Outlook 2017 with the Sustainable Development Scenario. Critically, the scenario illustrates that reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with Paris Agreement goals doesn't need to undermine the achievement of energy access and reduction of air pollution. Parties at COP23 IEA welcomes the progress of COP23 yet recognizes that where COP ends, much of the actual work begins. The IEA will support our members and partners as they accelerate efforts to implement and achieve NDC actions and targets, and for their longer-term transitions to sustainable energy systems.

Nov 06, 2017( The Third Pole: HYPERLINK http://www.thethirdpole.net http://www.thethirdpole.net COP23 ? Teng Fei, associate professor, Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy, Tsinghua University The main task at this year's COP is to set out the detailed rules on how the Paris Agreement will be implemented - it won't be a big year. But the devil is often in the detail - they may be small things, but they will determine whether or not the Paris Agreement achieves its long term goals. I don't think we'll be able to say whether those rules have been successful or not this year, or for several years to come. The most obvious criteria is whether or not the various parties manage to decide on those rules according to the already-agreed timetable, but I think the quality of the rules is more important than the schedule. Only when the rules are implemented will we be better able to judge whether or not the mechanisms under discussion can realise the Paris goals. As 80% of the outcomes are decided in advance, each country brings its own stance to the negotiations, and once they've taken that stance there's limited room for negotiation. Those positions are determined by domestic politics, and unless domestic politics change the positions won't change, so there's no chance of significant change at one negotiating session. The lesson of the Paris Agreement was the selection of a bottom-up approach to solving problems, and we should look for solutions and responses to climate change which are rooted in the everyday lives of the public, rather than relying on the political elite or on negotiations alone. Yang Fuqiang, senior advisor on climate and energy, National Resource Defence Council We should see a fairly modest outcome from this year's climate talks, as we can't expect everyone to have decided on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement in a single year. This is only the beginning. And some of the details are tricky - for example this year's chair, Fiji, lacks influence and if we don't see a positive approach from major powers, progress is unlikely. This year we also need to look to key European nations such as Germany, the UK and Denmark - will they join with China to put forward new initiatives and actions? If so, that may give rise to a small flurry. The attitude of the US continues to be an issue this year. Trump has said the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but a formal withdrawal won't be possible until 2022, and the US still has the right to intervene on a lot of matters and may present an obstacle to negotiations - for example, on funding and technology. This restriction also provides the United States with the opportunity to interfere with the many issues and to create barriers to negotiations, particularly on issues such as capital, technology, capacity building and ambitions.  Monique Barbut, under-secretary general and executive secretary, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification The Paris Agreement achieved consensus on limiting the rise in temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. For some regions in Africa, this would still lead to a 4-degree temperature rise, on average, causing epic scale disasters and unimaginable human suffering. For COP23 to be successful, adaptation must now be given the same sense of urgency and be put on the same footing as mitigation efforts. Any new mechanisms emerging should ensure that the most vulnerable countries can adapt and avoid the most catastrophic scenarios. The Agreement has four times the potential of the Kyoto Protocol\~to eliminate greenhouse gases. A lot of these new mitigation actions are based on land use and land use change. A successful COP23 needs to develop comprehensive systems that can effectively guide and promote action in this area, for at least three reasons. First, we know a lot more today about assessing soil-based measures than we did two decades ago. Under the Kyoto Protocol, for instance, carbon emissions through land use change and carbon sequestration through forests were taken into account, even if not fully understood. But limiting action under the Paris Agreement to these two areas would amount to failure. Under the desertification process, we have made a lot of progress in developing measures to assess land-based sequestration processes. Governments agreed on how to assess land cover change, land productivity and soil carbon sequestration, regardless of the ecosystem. From these experiences, COP23 can refine ways to assess initiatives under land use and land use change and promote synergies between the Conventions. Second, there is often a discrepancy between what governments intend to achieve and what is actually realised. We need to ensure that every commitment - including in the new areas of land use and land use change identified under the Paris Agreement - are turned into real commitments on the ground. Third, incentives to promote early action are vital. They would be highly effective in the context of land-related measures. On the one hand, it would shield productive land from further degradation in order to curb future emissions. On the other hand, the rehabilitation of degraded land would put carbon back into the soil. Jennifer Morgan, executive director, Greenpeace International As a whole, a successful COP23 , including the events that occur around it, will need to show an acceleration of momentum towards the Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This will require the emergence of strong, shared leadership at all levels from governments, cities, states, corporations and communities around the world towards higher ambition, to meet the worsening climate threat in the small window of opportunity we still have. Specifically, in the US, mayors, governors and others can counterbalance President Trump's announced withdrawal from Paris. In Europe, all eyes will be on Germany as a new government must commit to phasing out coal and the combustion engine to maintain its credibility internationally. In the COP negotiations themselves, the list of unfinished business of the Paris Climate Agreement is long and detailed and it is crucial for significant progress to be made on the Paris Agreement's implementation guidelines. A roadmap must emerge from the COP, clarifying the process to finalise the rulebook by the deadline in 2018. This is important to maintain momentum and to demonstrate the world is still committed to Paris. Lina Barrera, senior director of international policy, Conservation International If we want to keep the world's climate to 1.5 degrees, then we need to act quickly and ensure that there is no delay in setting the rules for the Paris Agreement. Countries must emerge from these negotiations with significant progress on determining the rules around elements that will increase ambition and facilitate reductions in CO2 -\~such as updates to nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and emission trading. In both cases nature needs to be incorporated. Nature-based solutions are critical to achieving the Paris Agreement goals. Nature can provide at least 30% of the mitigation action needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in addition to important adaptation benefits. Nature's climate solutions include conservation and restoration of critical ecosystems, which are among the most immediate and cost-effective solutions available for mitigating the causes of climate change and adapting to its impacts. Wael Hmaidan, executive director, Climate Action Network This 'Pacific COP' is the first climate talks presided over by an island state, the most vulnerable group of countries to climate change, and the champions of the 1.5-degree temperature rise limit. Therefore, it is important for COP23 to make everyone feel the true impacts of climate change and communicate urgency of action. The recent spate of climate-related disasters further brings home how national policies cannot remain tone deaf to the reality of climate impacts that jeopardise lives and jobs.

Nov 07, 2017( Deutsche Welle World: HYPERLINK http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex) As COP23 kicks off in Bonn this week, African participants are working hard to ensure their voices are being heard, amid fears that the so-called 'Trump effect" could make matters worse for developing states.With COP23 well under way in Bonn this week, African states and organizations are making the most of their presence at the high - profile conference by voicing their concerns and ideas - and are using their influence to pressure developed nations to commit to more ambitious reduction targets for the sake of poorer, more vulnerable regions.Africa is the continent which will likely be affected the most by climate change, with almost two-thirds of its population making its living off the land.Yunis Arikan, the Head of Advocacy and Development from ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability (formerly known as the International Council for Local Environmental Issues), believes that African states have become increasingly vocal and proactive at COP conferences since the very first meeting in Berlin in 1995."Among our over 300 leaders, we have a significant delegation from Africa bringing their solutions and priorities," Arikan told DW, "I think in that sense a COP in Germany is fulfilling its mission to give voice to Africa and we are proud that they are coming not only to listen, but to speak and offer their solutions and expectations so that they are part of the process, not just outside the fence. Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in terms of drought, but it also represents many opportunities when it comes to things like solar power generation."Part of this increased involvement comes down to a change in attitudes towards climate change, as well as a larger young generation who are concerned for their futures."For many years sustainability and urbanization was a taboo. It was not considered a big priority for Africa. But there is a huge influx of people going to cities in Africa, as there is a young generation emerging," said Arikan, "There are a lot of ambitious leaders in Africa who would like to be connected to the world and who want to be a part of the global movement."Holding industrialized nations to account US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement earlier this year has unsurprisingly dominated much of the discourse at COP23 - especially after Syria announced its plans to join the agreement, effectively isolating the US as the only country opposed to the pact. But for many countries in Africa, the US's withdrawal represents a dangerous disregard for poorer states who are more likely to be at the receiving end of the worst effects of climate change - a scenario made even more troubling by the fact that the majority of C02 emissions are generated by wealthier, industrialized nations like the US.The Panafrican Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) represents a coalition of civil society organizations from diverse backgrounds across Africa. Secretary General of PACJA, Mithika Mwenda, told DW that part of the organization's mission at COP23 is to push industrialized countries to set more ambitious goals to reduce their carbon emissions so that African states don't have to contend with the adverse effects of climate change. "Our frustration, as a coalition of African countries, is that there is no strong signal of something being done," said Mwenda, "It's like a jamboree where people come, make proclamations, and after two weeks they go back to their normal lives. We are insisting that it is no longer business as usual. We need to acknowledge the expectations of poorer states and ensure that we are taking action."Fighting back against the 'Trump effect' Mwenda also openly questions the presence of an official US delegation, out of fear it may prove to be a bad influence on other states that are already reluctant to take serious action on climate change - something he terms as the "Trump effect.""[The US] withdraws from the Paris Agreement, yet they still want to show that they can negotiate the implementation framework," said Mwenda, "That's why we are calling in delegates here to sign our petition to kick Trump and his government out of these negotiations. We have to make it very clear that we are not kicking [out] the people of America. We are in solidarity with [those who oppose Trump's actions]. Our target is the Trump government."Holding high-polluters to account - including the possibility of financial reparations for small-polluters, including African countries - is likely to be another flashpoint issue at this year's COP, especially with island nation Fiji at the helm. "It is quite symbolic that a small island state is hosting COP23 ,"Mwenda told DW, "[Developed nations] hold a lot of power in terms of determining what is on the agendaThe problem is the apathy of industrialized countries. We want to challenge them on that." \</doc>

The following information was released by the Embassy of France in Washington: The 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the COP23 , will work on drawing up the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. On the invitation of the Convention secretariat, the countries will meet to work on drawing up the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement and discuss increasing the implementation of national climate commitments. Organized in Bonn, the COP23 will be chaired by Fiji, the first small island state to chair a COP. On 27 July the Mexican Executive Secretary of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, underlined in this respect that "the COP23 also raises awareness of the vulnerability of islands and all nations [...] It opens the door to even more collaboration and support for resilient communities and for the transition to growth powered by clean energy". France is committed to promoting and consolidating the implementation of the Paris Agreement Following the adoption and entry into force of the agreement, France remains committed with the countries, local authorities, cities, businesses, NGOs and citizens who wish to make quick progress towards the fulfilment of the Paris Climate Agreement. Main objectives During the COP23 Drawing up rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. The work started since the Bonn intersessional talks in May 2016 and during the COP22 must be continued to prepare the application of the Paris Agreement. The objective: adopt these decisions at the COP24 at the latest. The COP24 will be chaired by Poland in December 2018 in the city of Katowice. These decisions will enable the Paris Agreement to be fully applied by all Parties. Increasing the ambition of States' commitments COP23 created, following consultations with the Parties, the Talanoa Dialogue, based on a participative dialogue to be held in 2018, calling upon goodwill to contribute to collective well-being. The arrangements for this Dialogue will be finalized during the COP23 . COP23 will also be a key moment for the continuation of international mobilization for the climate, particularly for the Action Agenda initiatives. Numerous stakeholders will meet in Bonn to demonstrate the reality of the action underway and contribute to proving that it is possible to reach the Paris Agreement objectives. A complete sequence dedicated to the initiatives of the Action Agenda is planned for the COP23 , with themed days on strategic sectors for climate action: renewable energy, agriculture, transport, forests, water management, finance and innovation, as well as awareness raising on gender issues and the impacts of climate change on health. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Vatican Information Service (VIS): At 11.45 this morning, in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace, the Holy Father Francis received in audience the leaders of the "Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat" from the eleven island states: Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu. The leaders met in Rome in recent days in a high-level summit on the problems faced by countries in the Pacific Ocean area and today will participate in a round table at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, to discuss food security in the region, nutrition, climate change, disaster risk reduction and resilient means of subsistence. The leaders will then proceed to Bonn where they will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 . The following is the Pope's address to those present at the meeting: Address of the Holy Father Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I share your concern for the peoples of the region, especially those exposed to the extreme environmental and climate events that are becoming more frequent and intense. Of concern too is the grave impact of rising sea levels and the disturbing and continuous deterioration of the barrier reef, a marine ecosystem of immense importance. In this regard, I remember the disquieting question posed almost thirty years ago by the Bishops of the Philippines: "Who turned the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft of colour and life?" (cf. Laudato Si', 41). A number of causes have led to this environmental decay and, sadly, many of them are due to short-sighted human activity connected with certain ways of exploiting natural and human resources, the impact of which ultimately reaches the ocean bed itself (cf. ibid.). When we speak of rising sea levels, which "mainly affect impoverished coastal populations who have nowhere else to go" (ibid., 48), our thoughts turn to the problem of global warming widely discussed in various international forums and meetings. In these very days COP-23 , the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention Framework of the United Nations, is meeting in Bonn, under the presidency of one of the countries you represent, the Fiji Islands. It is my hope that the efforts of COP-23 , and those yet to come, will always keep in mind the greater picture of that "earth without borders, with its highly rarified atmosphere", as it was described by one of the astronauts currently orbiting in the International Space Station, with whom I recently had a fascinating conversation. You have come here from countries far distant from Rome, yet that vision of an "earth without borders" dissolves all geographic distances. It reminds us of the need for a global outlook, international cooperation and solidarity, and a shared strategy, which can prevent us from remaining indifferent in the face of grave problems such as the deterioration of the environment and of the health of the oceans, which is itself linked to the human and social deterioration experienced by humanity today. Not only geographic and territorial distances, but also distances in time are dissolved by the realization that everything in the world is intimately connected (cf. ibid., 16). Almost thirty years have passed since the Filipino Bishops' appeal, and yet it cannot be said that the situation of the oceans and marine ecosystem has really improved. We still face any number of problems regarding, for example, the management of fishing resources, activities in shallow and deep waters, the situation of coastal communities and of fishing families, and the pollution caused by the accumulation of plastics and micro-plastics. "What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up? This question not only concerns the environment in isolation... When we ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave behind, we think in the first place of its general direction, its meaning and its values" (ibid., 160). I thank you for your welcome visit and I invoke upon you and your countries God's abundant blessings. Thank you. \</doc>

Nov 14, 2017( VT Digger: http://vtdigger.org http://vtdigger.org HYPERLINK mailto:Hudsonvictoria.hudson@vermont.gov[1] Hudsonvictoria.hudson@vermont.gov[1] HYPERLINK http://www.puc.vermont.gov www.puc.vermont.gov BONN (Germany) Nov. 13, 2017 - Vermont Public Utility Commissioner Sarah Hofmann is attending the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, this week as part of a US Climate Registry delegation of representatives from more than eight states, as well as governors from California, Oregon, Washington and Virginia. COP23 , the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, opened last week and ends Friday. Commissioner Hofmann says her presence there reflects Vermont's commitment to the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. 'It is a privilege being here with people from across America and the world who care deeply about the fate of our planet,' Hofmann said this morning from the conference arena. 'Not only are we learning from each other, we also are solidifying our commitment to doing our part as states to live up to the Paris Agreement, even as the federal government vows to pull out.' Virtually all nations have signed the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which includes binding obligations by country for reducing greenhouse gases. In June, President Trump announced he was pulling the US out of the Agreement, making the United States the only nation not part of the accord. The UNFCC established a framework for actions to stabilize concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. UN parties to the climate accord meet annually to assess progress and determine specific actions and targets for reducing greenhouse gases, mitigating the effects of climate change, and financing mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries. Commissioner Hofmann and other US delegates are conveying Americans' support for the Paris Agreement and advocating for progress on its implementation guidelines toward a global transition to a low-carbon future. Vermont has been a leader in implementing policies and laws to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Vermont has joined, under the leadership of Governor Phil Scott, the UN Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of states committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Nov 13, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 's newest challenge is from\~the growing speculative bubble\~of Bitcoin and the rush to\~additional cryptocurrencies. Distrust in governments, their fiat currencies, corporations and institutions, as well as other people, has led to\~this mad dash for Bitcoin and hundreds of other £ltcoins' and this profligate waste, not only of electricity, but also\~valuable computer power. Paradoxically, the search for ways to reproduce and scale the vital human asset: trust, is breeding self-defeating paranoia! Trust, generated in face-to-face human interactions and communities\~over millennia is proving hard to replace by algorithms, technology and machine learning, as well as in the demise of trust in social media as reported in The Economist cover story ('Social Media's Threat To\~Democracy' (Nov. 4-10, 2017). COP23 needs to\~take the huge waste of energy and its CO2 emissions into account in IPCC models. Not since the Dutch tulip mania\~has human greed, blindness, fear and stupidity\~led to\~such collective insanity. This has produced\~another new pathology: these cryptocurrency miners\~are now hijacking other peoples' personal computers\~in a new kind of cybercrime, reported in FORTUNE (Nov 1, 2017), see 'To Catch a Cryptothief ', where file-sharing websites, such as CBS Showtime and many others including The Pirate Bay, which hosts cryptomining software, are hoping this will be an alternative for revenue to online advertising (now $83 billion annually in the USA). Start-ups offering cryptomining software include\~Coinhive, JSECoin, CryptoLoot\~and others, offer these tools to\~file-sharing websites and their unsuspecting visitors.\~FORTUNE (November 1, 2017) reports that Israeli cybersecurity firm, Check Point's Maya Horowitz warns that cryptomining software can make computers crash and provide an avenue for hackers\~to\~insert their own malicious code. The New Scientist editorial\~"Waste Not Want Not: Bitcoin needs to stop squandering resources"[3] (4 November 2017)\~has sounded the alarm. Surely, it's time\~for such cryptocurrencies waste of electricity, computer power and resulting CO2 emissions to\~be held accountable\~and factored into\~ COP23 and the next negotiations and INDCs.\~ All this waste is\~the very opposite of the vaunted promises of profit-motivated Silicon Valley\~libertarians and their promises to\~save the world. They invested in the thousands of blockchain based startups in the hope that blockchains and other distributed ledgers\~could deliver that priceless human asset: trust, without which human societies and markets cannot function. We pointed this out in 2004 in our Ethical Markets mission statement at HYPERLINK http://www.ethicalmarkets.com/About www.ethicalmarkets.com/About COP23 and included future INDCs.

The World Wind Energy Association issued the following news release: Several leading global, European and national renewables energy associations have teamed up to co-host the Global Renewable Energy Solutions Showcase event (GRESS) in Bonn on 7-8 November 2017, in parallel and in conjunction with the UN Climate Change Conference COP23 . Recently, GRESS has obtained the official endorsement by the COP23 Presidency, the Government of Fiji, to become a " COP23 Endorsed Event". COP23 will take place at the headquarters of the UNFCCC Secretariat, presided over by the Government of Fiji and will follow the groundbreaking COP21 in Paris during which close to 200 governments agreed to achieve a greenhouse gas neutral energy supply by 2050. During the following COP22 in Marrakesh, 48 governments went even further and committed themselves to a 100% renewable energy supply. With the Paris agreement reached at COP21, the UN Climate Change Conferences have changed their character fundamentally and are now focusing on technologies and solutions which are needed to achieve an emission free energy supply. Hence GRESS will focus on solutions in the field of renewable energy which the renewable energy sector can already provide today. Companies from all renewable energy branches are invited to present their actual technologies and services to the COP23 delegates. Correspondingly, all COP23 delegates from 200 countries are invited to join GRESS for free, and get in contact with the practitioners and solution providers. Amongst the co-hosts of the GRESS, there are: Global100% Renewable Energy Platform, REN Alliance, International Geothermal Association IGA, International Hydropower Association IHA, International Solar Energy Society ISES, World Bioenergy Association WBA, World Wind Energy Association WWEA, European Renewable Energy Federation EREF, German Renewable Energy Federation BEE, Energy Watch Group, and several other national renewable energy associations. The venue of GRESS will be at the Federal Art and Exhibition Hall, Bundeskunsthalle, adjacent to the COP23 . IGA Executive Director Marit Bromme: "Cool the Earth - Stay hot with Geothermal. The International Geothermal Association is proud to be co-hosting the GRESS event during COP23 in Bonn. We look forward to contribute to the important dialogue on transforming the global energy portfolio from fossil-fuel based to climate neutral in the coming decades." IHA Executive Director Richard Taylor: "The International Hydropower Association supports the Global Renewable Energy Showcase. IHA and its members share the vision of an interconnected world where water and energy services are delivered to all in a sustainable way. The Global Renewable Energy Solution Showcase is a prime opportunity for participants of COP23 to experience the latest innovations and progress of the global renewable energy community, and to see how renewable energy technologies can work together towards decarbonising the economy, mitigating and limiting the impacts of climate change, and achieving the sustainable development goals." ISES President David Renne: "The International Solar Energy Society looks forward very much to participating in this important event, and encourages all who will be attending the COP23 to attend the GRESS as well. The global membership of ISES is supporting the transformation of our energy system to 100% renewable energy through technical and academic R&D programs that reduce costs and improve reliability of renewable energy systems and the integration of these systems to meet all end use energy requirements in the power, transport, and heating and cooling sectors. ISES disseminates these results through its prestigious Solar Energy Journal, its webinars, its presentations at conferences, and its online newsletters and publications. Attendees to the GRESS will have the opportunity to obtain the latest information on technology breakthroughs, best practices, and case studies of programs leading to a 100% renewable energy supply." WBA Executive Director Bharadwaj Venkata: "Renewable energy technologies working together is the best solution for mitigating global warming and meeting the global energy and climate goals. We are excited to be a part of the GRESS event which will be the ideal place to get updated on the latest renewable energy technology solutions available today." WWEA Secretary General Stefan Gsanger: "We are delighted that we can use the opportunity of having the COP23 next door to our office and invite the world renewable energy community to come to Bonn and share their latest achievements with the key decision makers from 200 countries. No renewable energy technology can stand on its own, and the synergies of sun, water, bioenergy, geothermal and wind will lead the world to a new age of prosperity."

Nov 11, 2017( Deutsche Welle Germany: HYPERLINK http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex) With anti-nuclear banners, polar bear costumes and Carnival-style floats, protesters have taken to the streets in Bonn to urge governments to do more to combat climate change. Thousands were expected to take part.Environmental activists took to the soggy streets of Bonn on Saturday, taking part in two demonstrations aimed at grabbing the attention of the COP23 climate conference attendees gathered in the western German city.One demonstration, led by the group "No Climate Change," marched from Bonn's downtown area toward the site where the climate conference is taking place near the United Nations headquarters in Germany.

The following information was released by the office of the Federal Chancellor of Germany: "Our common message is that we want to protect our planet," declared Chancellor Angela Merkel at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn. With Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and French President Emmanuel Macron she called for resolute action. "We are facing a central challenge, if not the central challenge, for humanity," says Chancellor Photo: Bundesregierung/Kugler "We need appropriate regulations. It is a question of trust and reliability," said Chancellor Angela Merkel at the UN Climate Chance Conference in Bonn. "We in Europe are aware of our responsibility. We are facing a central challenge, if not the central challenge, for humanity." Europe accepts its responsibility "Climate change will determine the fate of our world," the Chancellor continued. The "wellbeing of every one of us" will depend on the climate. Europe accepts its responsibility, said Angela Merkel. "The European target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a minimum of 40 per cent of the 1990 levels by 2030 is legally binding within the European Union," declared the Chancellor. "Every EU member state must do its bit." In this context the Chancellor pointed to last week's decision to remove a number of certificates from the emissions trading system. In this way the price can become an effective signal, thus encouraging emitters to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate action plan lays out Germany's targets Germany's target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent of the 1990 level by 2020 is ambitious, stressed the Chancellor. "Now, at the end of 2017, we can see that we still have a good way to go," she admitted. Coal in particular and lignite must make a significant contribution to achieving these goals, she said. Precisely how this will be done must still be clarified. Climate policy is economic policy "This year, we adopted the G20 action plan on climate and energy for more sustainable economic growth under our G20 Presidency." The OECD too has made it clear what is at stake. "We will only be able to preserve our prosperity in future if we make extensive investments climate-friendly," said the Chancellor. "That is why we are convinced that climate policy is also economic policy for the future. We must preserve the natural resource base on which life depends if we are to continue successfully with business." Renewable energy for growth "If we do it right, the transformation offers great opportunities for growth. Renewable energy, energy efficiency technologies that use fewer resources and save costs, climate-sound innovation in building technology and in the traffic and transport sector all this and more will become increasingly important on markets worldwide." In Germany, renewables are the strongest pillar in the country's energy supply mix. Doubling climate finance by 2020 "That is why Germany and the other industrialised countries stand by their pledge to provide 100 billion US dollars every year from public and private sources as of 2020 to support developing countries," said the Chancellor. "And that is why we in Germany plan to double climate funding by 2020." Private-sector investment is also need here though. "We must all pull together to put in place an enabling environment that will allow us to mobilise private capital for climate finance." Looking ahead to Paris in December The development banks and the World Bank play an important part in this, Angela Merkel continued. "We should all strengthen this part. I can only welcome the fact that President Emmanuel Macron, the UN Secretary-General and the President of the World Bank will be hosting a summit that is to focus on climate finance in Paris on 12 December." Financial support for developing countries In 2016 Germany provided a sum of 1.4 billion euros to support developing countries. To this sum must be added another 100 million euros this year for the Adaptation Fund. A global partnership for climate risk insurance in developing countries has now been founded with the World Bank, as a joint initiative of the G20 and the countries affected by climate change. \</doc>

Nov 08, 2017( Embassy of France News: HYPERLINK / Delivered by Newstex) Published on November 6, 2017During the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the countries will work on drawing up the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. On the invitation of the Convention secretariat, the countries will meet to work on drawing up the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement and discuss increasing the implementation of national climate commitments.A COP organized under Fijian presidencyOrganized in Bonn, the COP23 will be chaired by Fiji, the first small island state to chair a COP. On July 27, the Mexican Executive Secretary of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, underlined in this respect that 'the COP23 also raises awareness of the vulnerability of islands and all nations [] It opens the door to even more collaboration and support - for resilient communities and for the transition to growth powered by clean energy'.France is committed to promoting and consolidating the implementation of the Paris AgreementFollowing the adoption and entry into force of the agreement, France remains committed with the countries, local authorities, cities, businesses, NGOs and citizens who wish to make quick progress towards the fulfilment of the Paris Climate Agreement.Main objectivesDuring the COP23 , the main objective will be to draw up the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement and to set out the procedures for the Facilitative Dialogue on increasing the climate ambition of the agreement.Drawing up rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. The work started since the Bonn intersessional talks in May 2016 and during the COP22 must be continued to prepare the application of the Paris Agreement. The objective: adopt these decisions at the COP24 at the latest. The COP24 will be chaired by Poland in December 2018 in the city of Katowice. These decisions will enable the Paris Agreement to be fully applied by all Parties. Increasing the ambition of States' commitments The efforts announced by the countries in their national contributions ahead of the COP21 are not sufficient to reach the objective of the Paris Agreement of limiting global temperature rise to less than 2\'b0C. In order to situate the efforts of all countries with regard to this objective and strengthen our commitments, the Fijian presidency of the COP23 created, following consultations with the Parties, the Talanoa Dialogue, based on a participative dialogue to be held in 2018, calling upon goodwill to contribute to collective well-being. The arrangements for this Dialogue will be finalized during the COP23 .The COP23 will also be a key moment for the continuation of international mobilization for the climate, particularly for the Action Agenda initiatives. Numerous stakeholders will meet in Bonn to demonstrate the reality of the action underway and contribute to proving that it is possible to reach the Paris Agreement objectives. A complete sequence dedicated to the initiatives of the Action Agenda is planned for the COP23 , with themed days on strategic sectors for climate action: renewable energy, agriculture, transport, forests, water management, finance and innovation, as well as awareness raising on gender issues and the impacts of climate change on health. \</doc>

Nov 20, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 was presided over by Fiji and helped shine a light on important aspects of climate resilience and adaptation that have not been as visible at previous COPs. The mood of the event was noticeably different than Paris or Marrakech, with a clear focus on how countries should be moving from ambition towards action and implementation - and with heightened awareness of the\~gap between current ambitions and the 2 degree target[2]. Participants were serious, and even somber. Over the course of COP23 , WBCSD and our members embodied the Fijian concept of 'Talenoa' - bringing all actors together to discuss solutions to challenges in a meaningful and productive way. For business, the key takeaway from this round of negotiations is that companies are now formally invited to provide input into the climate negotiations through reports, dialogue and analyses. WBCSD member companies look forward to actively engaging in this process through regional, solutions-focused multi-stakeholder meetings over the course of 2018 and through to COP24. This year, WBCSD was present across COP side events through the Marrakech Partnership under the Global Climate Action Agenda. Representatives from climate and energy, circular economy, climate smart agriculture, forests, water and cement were there to represent the voice of business. Through WBCSD, over 70 companies and over 200 participants were able to attend the world-renowned climate meeting. Over the course of the two-week event, WBCSD ran or hosted nearly twenty sessions - and, according to President and CEO Peter Bakker, brought together the 'highest concentration of CEOs in the same room at COP.' Throughout the negotiations and across the side events, our member companies and other business leaders within the We Mean Business Coalition called for strong climate action,\~urging country negotiators to consider[3]:How to ensure a structured policy dialogue between governments and other stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership How to formally introduce and incorporate input from non-state actors in the Talanoa (Facilitative) Dialogue Building partnerships for resilience across global supply chains and in vulnerable communities experiencing climate impacts Supporting carbon markets and enabling cross-border collaboration on mitigation effortsEnacting strong climate policies that\~reward\~sustainability leaders will be key for ensuring the low-carbon transition. 'I love polar bears,' one participant said, 'but I'm really here for my shareholders unchecked climate change could erode trillions from the global economy.' Across the multitude of events happening alongside the official negotiation process, key themes emerged, including: The importance of non-state actors and the Talanoa Dialogue Because of geopolitical uncertainty and the slow pace of government negotiation, momentum is building across cities, states, organizations and businesses for leading on the implementation of the Paris agreement. It was clear during the event that corporate commitments to climate action are the new norm. Since 2015, over 600 companies have made over 1,000 commitments under the We Mean Business Coalition - with companies involved in WBCSD's Low Carbon Technology Partnerships Initiative (LCTPi), targeting 65% of the emissions reductions needed for remining under 2 degrees - and already\~making progress[4]. 'By 2020, it will be normal for all of the world's well-run companies to have a science based target,' said Nigel Topping, CEO of We Mean Business, at the start of COP23 's Global Climate Action Industry Day. Which means, in order to ensure that progress towards Paris is accurately reflected, it will be critical for business to be involved in the Talanoa Dialogue - the consultative process for taking stock of how far we've come and where we need to go in terms of ramping up climate ambition. 'Many governments aren't even aware of the suite of solutions available to help them achieve their Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs),' said Rasmus Valanko, Director of WBCSD's Climate and Energy project. 'It's up to business to show them what's possible, because countries won't commit unless they believe they can succeed.' At the\~Low Emissions Solutions Conference[5], co-hosted by WBCSD, ICLEI and UNSDSN, Minister Seruiratu of Fiji addressed the room full of high-level business and city leaders, 'As we are building up to the Talanoa Dialogue, I see that [this] is where the real world is- this is where the actions take place. This is where you see responsible leadership - this is where you see shakers and movers.' Innovative technology, policy and finance Part of the reason it's so important for business to be involved in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement is because of their unique insight into innovation. Technology and data In line with pushing for innovative technologies and new business models, a number of WBCSD's sessions focused on the importance of the circular economy for industry. 'You wouldn't throw away gold,' said Mr. Hans-Jorn Weddige of Thyssenkrupp, 'you'd reuse it.' This is the kind of thinking we need to make the 'value chain' into a 'value cycle' where nothing is wasted, and emissions are reduced. From Michelin's 3D printed tires, to technological advancement in low-carbon fuels and shared mobility, COP23 made it clear that business is serious about the low-carbon transition and about building on the success of the energy transformation into other sectors - such as transport, agriculture and industry. Advancements in digital technology, and the abundance of new data have also become important weapons in the fight against climate change across each of these. Various sessions covering numerous sectors highlighted that it's in business' best interest to use this data for optimization across the value chain. There was also a clear focus on how data will be important for showing policymakers the evidence and facts they need to convince them to ramp up action. 'To convince the policymakers, we need evidence and facts,' said Minister Seruiratu. 'To convince political leadership, we need to back it up with evidence. Business is already doing a great job, now show the political leaders.' Which is why setting science-based targets and measuring progress will continue to be key. In addition to technological advancements and data optimization, WBCSD events also highlighted the need for innovative policymaking and financing mechanisms. Policies Participants called for new policies that will help reward companies who lead on sustainability. Ideas ranged from partnership with local governments to implementing a meaningful price on carbon. 'Governments have a role to play in helping industry do the right thing,' said Ms. Bobbi Plecas, Deputy Minister of Climate Change, British Columbia. The main message was that business and government need to work\~together\~to deliver a low-carbon world, and both sides are open to that - especially when it comes to carbon pricing. 'A carbon price is\~so\~damn important,' said Jos Delbeke, Director General for Climate Action at the European Commission. '[A carbon price] will help me, it'll help yourself and it'll help society, because the whole transition will go much faster - and that's what we need,' said Feike Sijbesma, CEO DSM. Politically, COP23 marked the next stage of the carbon pricing negotiations. Although there was no consensus this year, negotiators have put forward a list of acceptable carbon pricing mechanisms for further negotiation next year. Finance Finally, COP23 events also illustrated the need for financial innovation at the personal level.\~ Steve Waygood, Chief of Responsible Investment Officer at Aviva Investments stated, 'Incentive structures for institutional investors - that is, the people who are most motivated by money - rewards them for doing what's wrong for the climate.' Mr. Waygood called for a 'revolution in financial literacy' so that individuals, consumers and companies can help hold financial services industries to account. 'If there's no demand for an approach to sustainable financial services - how can you hope the industry will deliver he services we all need,' he asked. We all need to ask where our pension funds are invested. The need for a just transition and resilient society Against the backdrop of the past year's political environment, and in light of the extreme weather events witnessed earlier this fall, there was renewed focus on ensuring a just transition, while building resilient societies and supply chains. Many speakers and side conversations underscored the need for climate-informed development that doesn't leave anyone behind. Maria Mendiluce, Managing Director at WBCSD said that advancements in technology and renewables £re going to bring millions of jobs, but we need a workforce that's adapted to the new technology.' In other words, we need to find a way to build new skills for individuals and communities deeply entrenched in the fossil fuel industries. Companies should be mindful of this, and work to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon society. In addition to appealing to industrial workers in the global North, countless sessions stressed the fact that sustainability leaders in business and government\~must\~be able to appeal to the global South as well. 'There's a growing need to bring representatives from the South into business discussions from a risk and resilience perspective,' said Edward Cameron, senior policy advisor to WBCSD. Businesses will need to work to include elements of justice and resilience in their climate action plans and policies, to help secure license to operate by keeping society healthy. In conclusion, COP23 was an important milestone on the road to implementing the Paris Agreement. Business should look forward to 2018 with an eye for engaging in structured dialogues with policymakers, and should continue to push forward in delivering solutions. As Ashok-Alexander Sridharan, Mayor of Bonn, said in addressing WBCSD companies, 'We are here to make the transformation and to benefit from new technology and innovative business models. We have to build coalitions with\~all\~sectors of society to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement.'\~Tweet me: KEYWORDS: Sustainable Development Goals, Energy, The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Bonn Germany, COP23 [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/World-Business-Council-Sustainable-Development-WBCSD [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/22070/EGR_2017.pdf https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/22070/EGR_2017.pdf [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.wbcsd.org/Clusters/Climate-Energy/News/Policy-recommendations-for-climate-negotiators-at-the-start-of-COP23 http://www.wbcsd.org/Clusters/Climate-Energy/News/Policy-recommendations-for-climate-negotiators-at-the-start-of- HYPERLINK COP23 [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.wbcsd.org/Clusters/Climate-Energy/News/WBCSD-2017-report-on-the-Low-Carbon-Technology-Partnerships-initiative http://www.wbcsd.org/Clusters/Climate-Energy/News/WBCSD-2017-report-on-the-Low-Carbon-Technology-Partnerships-initiative HYPERLINK http://enb.iisd.org/climate/cop23/lesc/?..._source=enb.iisd.org..._medium=feed..._content=2017-11-13..._campaign=RSS2.0 http://enb.iisd.org/climate/ HYPERLINK cop23 /lesc/?..._source=enb.iisd.org..._medium=feed..._content=2017-11-13..._campaign=RSS2.0 \</doc>

Nov 02, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 in Bonn will be the year for business. In today's uncertain geopolitical landscape, businesses have a unique opportunity to step up on climate action, but they need to be informed and they need to be engaged. Next week, thousands of delegates from government, international organizations, trade unions, business and civil society will gather in Bonn, Germany for the latest round of negotiations under the\~United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[2]\~(UNFCCC). This 23rd Conference of the Parties, COP23 as it's known, will give\~Paris Agreement[3]\~signatories the opportunity to assess their\~progress in implementing climate commitments. It will also enable them to create rules to ensure they're adhering to the Agreement, while preparing the groundwork for all countries to increase ambitions under their\~national climate action plans[4]. The meeting couldn't come at a better time, as 2017 has been another critical year for the health of the planet. COP23 coincides with the closing of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, likely to be the costliest on record, with a preliminary total of over\~US$290 billion in damages[5]\~for hurricanes Harvey and Irma alone. Hurricane Irma was the strongest recorded hurricane ever to form in the Atlantic Ocean; and hurricane Ophelia is the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record. With the European Union also reeling from tragic wildfires in Spain and Portugal, and experiencing a\~doubling in the total number of forest fires in 2017[6]\~while deadly wildfires rage across California, delegates should be motivated to infuse the negotiations with the urgency and ambition they deserve. On one side, we have intense weather events - on the other, governments seem to be losing focus. Global politics - especially around climate action - continue to be unclear, and the need for distributed leadership among a diverse array of stakeholders across the UNFCCC process is more poignant than ever. In this context, Bonn could be business's climate moment. As such, here are the top five issues for companies to engage with and watch out for: The Marrakech Partnership, go beyond show-and-tell The\~Marrakech Partnership[7]\~for global climate action provides a platform for showcasing successful approaches to reducing greenhouse gases and enhancing climate resilience. The showcasing element is important, but the Partnership is missing a space for a structured conversation between governments and other stakeholders to address the challenges that undermine climate action. Many companies want to go further and faster towards decarbonization, but don't know how to get there. The first question COP23 negotiators need to answer is, 'How can governments provide companies with a policy enabling environment that catalyzes their ambition?' Improving the Marrakech Partnership is key to this. Business should be heard at COP23 - they should be vocal to negotiators about the policy environment they want and the solutions they can bring to the market to accelerate the transformation to a low-carbon world. The facilitative dialogue, make sure you're being heard The\~Facilitative Dialogue[8]\~is a process intended to take stock of collective progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement by speaking to a wide range of stakeholders. It's also designed to help kick off consideration of the 2020 update to countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Over the course of 2017, the Fijian and Moroccan governments have been leading extensive consultations\~how\~to get input from other stakeholders: how often will people have the opportunity to give input, can they physically sit in the rooms with negotiators, how will their input be integrated? A draft design of what the facilitative dialogue will look like is going to be presented during COP23 . For business, the key questions around this process are, 'Will this Dialogue lead to stronger collective ambition and not just a review of progress? Will the Dialogue result in more comprehensive national climate action plans? And will companies be invited to engage as partners in the design of the Dialogue and of the domestic policies that follow?' Business should be involved and contribute to scale ambition of the NDCs to meet the agreed goals. Climate resilience, prepare for what's inevitable Climate change is a significant and material risk to business. Research in the journal\~Nature[9]\~suggests the impact of climate change on the market value of global financial assets to be $2.5 trillion and could be as high as $24.2 trillion under worst case scenarios. In a\~recent survey[10], 72% of suppliers stated that climate risks could significantly impact their business operations, revenue or expenditure, yet only half of these are currently managing this risk. Governments and the private sector need to find constructive ways to partner in building resilience inside individual companies, across complex global supply chains, and within frontline communities experiencing climate impacts. This year's COP will prioritize climate resilience, a timely and welcome focus for business. Carbon pricing, change the system Almost 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces already use carbon pricing mechanisms or are planning to implement them. The current total value of these pricing systems is\~estimated to be US$52 billion[11]. Businesses are also calling for a meaningful carbon price. It's the most efficient means of driving change as it provides the economic signal for investments, operations and procurement of low-carbon products and services. Governments need to find ways to align carbon pricing mechanisms, ensuring that pricing is credible, predictable and high enough to drive ambition consistent with the Paris Agreement. Governments must also ensure coherent regulations between national and regional carbon market while establishing robust accounting rules to ensure transparency and good governance. They also must consider the social impacts when designing carbon pricing. Will new leaders emerge? The United States' decision to\~withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement[12]\~will inform the dominant political backdrop to the two-week session.\~Cities[13],\~states[14]\~and\~companies[15]\~have illustrated the diversity of American commitment to decarbonization through their own pledges and action. But how will the global community respond to US plans? The first indications suggest a resolute response. Throughout the year, other members of the G7 and the G20 reiterated their determination to implement the Paris Agreement in full. The European Union and China have forged a new bilateral relationship which is emerging as a new engine of climate ambition. Will global commitment to Paris hold and will new centers of leadership emerge to drive ambition forward? What's clear is that business is an implementation partner in reducing emissions and therefore needs to be fully involved in shaping the next round of national climate action plans. This is the moment for corporate leadership The Paris Agreement was a great victory and a testament to the courage, skill and ambition of governments across the globe. As climate action moves from commitments and agreements to implementation and innovation, the role of business becomes more important. The private sector will be\~the\~driver of technological development, the source of the trillions of dollars in low-carbon investments and the force behind emissions reductions across global supply chains. As we build on the success of Paris, businesses have become full partners in shaping an inclusive and prosperous low-carbon economy.

Nov 18, 2017( BioMedReports: HYPERLINK http://biomedreports.com http://biomedreports.com COP 23 ) in Bonn, the minister said that an unprecedented year of weather - including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria; wildfires in the US and Europe; mass flooding in South Asia, and West Africa; and an unyielding drought in East Africa - has given the issue a renewed urgency. "Rich nations - those who have benefitted from vast historical Green House Gas emissions - are indebted to humanity's future. And they must honour that obligation," said Thoriq Ibrahim, Minister for Environment and Energy in the Maldives. "If they do not, nations like mine will suffer through no fault of our own."Climate change has ravaged Small Island Developing States, according to Minister Ibrahim. As COP23 concluded in Bonn, he called for the urgent implementation of plans and more funds to correct the ravages of climate change."As the Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and in my capacity as the Minister of Environment of the Maldives, I call on our developed international partners to own their responsibility." The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement acknowledged that Green House Gas (GHG) reductions should be tied to historical emissions. "Now, in Bonn, we must figure out how exactly each nation implements its Nationally Determined Contributions, as well mechanisms to monitor the level of reductions. The framework and solutions are known," said Minister Ibrahim. "We just need action." The Maldivian Minister said that talking is not enough. "The latest UNEP Gap report states it is not too late to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet it makes for uncomfortable reading. It identifies an urgent need for accelerated short-term action and enhanced longer-term national ambition. "Quibbling over important issues such as financing should be avoided. We are talking about lives, not bottom lines," said Minister Ibrahim. "Climate change is a problem that belongs to all of us, not just political officials." Minister Ibrahim said that developed countries must reduce their outputs. "Collectively, industrialised countries account for close to three-quarters of global emissions. Yet on average, they are set to miss their targets on current trajectories. If they do not start to act in line with their commitments, it will seriously hamper global efforts to save our planet. The rest of the world simply cannot afford such procrastination," the Maldivian Minister warned. "We need more ambition. The world's current pledges for GHG cuts is just a third of that needed to keep world temperatures below a 2 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels. If we stay at current levels, the opportunity to keep temperatures below the optimal 1.5 \'b0C - as stated in the Paris Agreement - will also rapidly close," he said. "When spelt out like this, it sounds a lot. But we are talking about nothing less than the future of the planet. With every day that passes, these issues take on a deeper urgency. This leaves little room for compromise. But with political resolve, I am confident we will make progress on all these areas at COP23 . And when we do, then we will have a joyous occasion for celebration." Small islands contribute a minuscule fraction of global emissions and yet have taken the lead in committing to some of the most ambitious clean energy plans in the world. Last month, The Government of the Maldives, in its capacity as Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and in partnership with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), hosted the inaugural high-level meeting of the Initiative for Renewable Island Energy (IRIE) on October 10-11. The meeting was attended by 17 energy and environment ministers from the AOSIS membership around the world. "Small island developing nations have been frontrunners in the global drive to scale-up renewables," said Adnan Z Amin, Director-General of IRENA. "We are committed to supporting the renewable energy ambitions of our island partners, through the SIDS Lighthouses initiative, as they take their energy transformation to the next level."

Maseru, Jan. 25 -- The National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) quarterly meeting on Thursday featured reporting on the recent Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) attended in Germany by Lesotho's delegation. The meeting attended by several stakeholders from the civil society and ministries also focused on reporting the progress status of the Climate Change Policy (CCP). In his remarks on officiating the meeting, Chairperson of the NCCC, Mr Motsau Khuele said the objective of the new year is for the committee members to have new souls to give them a chance to work hard. He said it was through members efforts that the Chair was able to attend and participate at COP23 hence said the factor helped to give them the chance to realise the relevance and significance of the event. He subsequently thanked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the financial support. Presenting the status of the CCP at the meeting, the Principal Meteorologist at the Lesotho Meteorological Services (LMS) Mr Mokoena France that the document is completed after adoption by Cabinet in December 2017 whilst adding that the implementation strategy is at a draft stage and awaiting validation by stakeholders. by end of February saying the expectation is to have it translated into Sesotho to enable easy understanding by Basotho. He also revealed the need to have the local media educated about the same policy to enable them to effectively and adequately disseminate information regarding the CCP. On the other hand shedding the light on what transpired the COP23 , the Vice Chairperson of the NCCC, Mr Motebang Mokitimi reported that governments were meeting to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement with the focus on the development of guidelines on how the Paris Agreement's provisions will be implemented across a wide range of issues including transparency, adaptation, emission reductions, provision of finance, capacity- building and technology. "The aim is to make progress in all these areas so that the guidelines can be completed by COP24 in Poland in 2018," asserted Mr Mokitimi saying negotiation discussions were centred on several thematic areas of adaptation, mitigation, loss and damage, and capacity building among others and the latter theme which he revealed invited parties and observers to submit their views on potential topics for the seventh meeting of the Durban Forum on capacity building by February 16, 2018. He said they agreed to enhance implementation of training and public awareness, participation and access to information saying the meeting highlighted the importance of guidance to be provided by the Paris Committee on Capacity Building to the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency and urged developed country Parties to provide additional, continuous and adequate support to developing countries for enhancing their capabilities on transparency of action and support. He on the other hand stated that the delegation from Lesotho that comprised 15 members including the Minister, Principal Secretary and the ambassador decided to split into several thematic areas for effective engagement in different components of the COP agenda team yet he lamented that even with this arrangement it was still difficult to cover all aspects of the negotiations as many of the meetings occurred simultaneously, exposing the thinness of the delegation. He thus lamented that a lot of sessions where negotiating groups of which Lesotho is party to, made crucial decisions without involvement of the country. He said most of the Country delegates were not regulars to the negotiations and lacked negotiating skills or experience with some of them not even members of the NCCC and are not privy to business of the committee that includes regular updates and briefings on national and international climate change issues. the negotiations and assume an unofficial observer status,' lamented Mr Mokitimi however citing that despite the shortcomings, the experience gained by the NCCC leadership from participating in the COP23 negotiations has been invaluable since the lessons learnt will advise the NCCC in developing their workplan to include items relevant to proper preparations for annual climate change negotiations and related meetings. Recommendations made thereto meanwhile include that government, with the support from development partners and other interest groups should endeavor to increase representation in these negotiations for effective participation, that the NCCC members be equipped with climate change negotiating skills through short trainings in anticipation of their involvement in the COPs, and as well as that the NCCC should establish thematic negotiation teams among its membership based on expertise in preparation for the COPs and other related meetings. The NCCC was established in 2013 to coordinate Climate Change issues in Lesotho and draws membership from government ministries, civil society and non-governmental organisations to mention but a few.

BusinessEurope issued the following news release: European business expects substantial progress to be made at the climate conference starting on Monday in Bonn ( COP23 ). Under the Fijian Presidency, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference will continue discussing the completion of the Rule Book for the implementation of the Paris climate agreement. This Rule Book includes the rules and processes needed to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, such as how countries should communicate their efforts and how they will be held accountable for their commitments, how collective efforts will be reviewed every five years, and how to facilitate implementation and boost compliance. The conference will also seek to make significant preparations for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue that will review the current state of action and potential areas for future action. BusinessEurope Director General Markus J. Beyrer commented: "It is essential that governments take a major step forward for the completion of the Paris Rule Book. We need a clear signal that all countries are moving ahead in taking ambitious actions to mitigate greenhouse gases, as the European Union does. European business also expects transparency in the reporting requirements of countries. Only transparent action by all the major and emerging economies can combat climate change without distorting growth and competitiveness." Business and other stakeholders can provide significant input to the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue. BusinessEurope will be closely following the development of market-based approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, among other things. "We hope that the open and consultative approach of the Fijian Presidency of COP23 sets a clear example and that we can expect a fully transparent process in Bonn with meetings open to all stakeholders. In particular, meetings discussing the establishment of market-based approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should use the vast market experience of the business and financial community", said Beyrer.

Despite a few victories, the UN's annual climate change conference ended without achieving its goals or injecting a sense of much needed urgency. Over 20,000 people from around the world descended on Bonn, Germany at the beginning of November for the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ). Timoci Naulusala, a 12-year-old from Fiji, made a passionate call for action at the opening of the COP23 , stating: "The sea is swallowing villages, eating away at shorelines, withering crops. Relocation of people...cries over lost loved ones, dying of hunger and thirst...you may think it will only affect small nations...you are wrong." French President Emmanuel Macron echoed similar sentiments, noting that the effects of climate change have multiplied and are becoming increasingly intense. "The point of no return has been crossed," he said. The conference set out to develop a rule book for implementing the landmark Paris Agreement. Though the deadline for its completion is next year's COP in Poland, many noted that not enough was achieved this year. Among the most contentious issues at COP23 was about finance. Of the 100 billion dollars that was promised each year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, developed countries have so far only pledged a little over 10 billion. Clare Shakya from the International Institute for Environment and Development also expressed concern to IPS that climate finance often does not reach the frontline poorest countries and people. "They get a far lower share than is their fair share," she said. Less than 10 percent of an already limited amount of climate finance reaches poor communities. This impacts countries such as Ethiopia where drought is drastically affecting livelihoods. The East African nation, which needs approximately 7.5 billion dollars a year to switch to clean energy and adapt to climate change, is so far receiving between 100 million and 200 million per year. As part of the Paris Agreement, donors must give a future estimate of how much and what kind of climate finance is going to be committed in order for countries to plan and prepare. However, developed countries pushed back on the demands, further delaying discussion and action on the issue. "You didn't see the developed countries coming here prepared to engage seriously on ramping up finance...parties knew there weren't major political decisions that were going to have to be made as they were facing when they went into Paris," Union of Concerned Scientist's Director of Strategy and Policy Alden Meyer told IPS. While over 150 heads of state attended COP21 when the Paris Agreement was negotiated, a little over 25 heads of state attended this year's conference. Both Meyer and Shakya expressed frustration on the lack of urgency over the discussion and implementation of the climate accord. "It was pretty disappointing for vulnerable countries...that want to see more urgency in terms of mobilizing resources to help them in the wake of devastating hurricanes and typhoons that we have seen this year," Meyer told IPS. This can be seen through countries' pledges made under the Paris Agreement which are only one-third of what is required to keep emissions under two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level by 2030. Though countries agreed to examine ways to close that gap next year, the apathy at COP23 does not bode well for the next year of climate discussions. Shakya noted that the negotiations that did happen during the conference also lacked a holistic approach as the words 'gender' were blocked in discussions about technology transfer while 'finance' was neglected in the gender action plan. "There's some really frustrating elements within the negotiations now that are trying to derail the connections that need to be there," she told IPS. No Clear Leadership As the U.S. has stepped back, even hosting a side event on "cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels" which sparked international outrage, many are now looking to both French President Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take on a leadership role on climate action. "They both really have personal commitment to the Paris Agreement and at the moment, we are kind of short on leaders-they are our hope," said Shakya. In August, the U.S. announced that it will withdraw all funding to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body tasked with researching climate change science. Macron called on Europe and promised to fill in the gap. "I hope Europe can replace the US as a climate leader and I can tell you that France is ready for that," he told delegates. In fact, the European Union (EU) will not be able to reach its goal of reducing emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 unless policies are changed and more pledges are made. Though countries made a political commitment to ramp up negotiations, Meyer expressed concern that progress may continue to be slow, especially as Poland is hosting COP in 2018. Poland is a heavily coal-dependent economy, with approximately 80 percent of its electricity generation coming from coal. The Climate Change Performance Index gave the Eastern European country a ranking of 40 and noted that it continues to fight climate legislation. In an effort to move away from coal as an energy source, the United Kingdom and Canada created an international "powering past coal" alliance. Another 25 national and subnational governments joined the alliance including France, Ethiopia, Mexico, and the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. However, the alliance does not commit signatories to a specific phase-out date. Several big coal countries also did not join the alliance including Germany, Poland, Australia, China, and India. Small Steps But Big Wins Despite slow progress, COP23 did not end without small victories. Countries agreed to review progress on reducing emissions in 2018 and 2019, as well as conduct assessments on climate finance in 2018 and 2020. The meeting also expanded its representation, formally including women and indigenous communities for the first time. Shakya noted that the inclusion of women and indigenous groups in the decision-making process will help bring more focus on frontline poorest communities. "It is a really significant first step, but it is a first step only. We need to see this being the building blocks for them to be included in the process of policy development and investment," she told IPS. Shakya called for more transparency in climate finance and proposed that donors form a leadership group outside of formal negotiations in order to identify and collaborate on solutions to improve the quality of finance and reporting. Meyer expressed hope that there will be further progress in meetings to happen between now and the next COP, particularly pointing to the One Planet Summit hosted by France in December which aims to bring together political leaders as well as those working in public and private finance to discuss how they can support and accelerate global efforts to fight climate change. "There is a lot more work to do...if there is political will, there will be a pretty decent outcome. If not, we are not going to see much improvement," he said. \</doc>

Far from causing the global economy to implode, as many fossil fuel advocates suggest, the report claims the transition to renewables would actually create 36 million new jobs worldwide.

Climate activist Bill McKibben, father of the\~Keep It 100[3]\~campaign, attended this year's climate summit. He told German news magazine\~Deutsche Welle[4]\~in an interview before the start of the conference,\~'If we have any hope of preventing absolute civilization challenge and catastrophe, then we need to be bringing down carbon emissions with incredible rapidity, far faster than it can happen just via normal economic transition.' While McKibben agrees the economic theories presented by EWC and LUT are sensible and realistic, he is less than optimistic that world governments have the political will to follow through on the steps necessary to prevent a climate emergency. 'That depends entirely on whether we can build movements large enough to break the power of the fossil fuel industry that holds us where we are,' McKibben said. 'To go further, what we need are many people in the streets demanding action and pushing governments to move much, much faster than they're currently contemplating.' He goes on to tell\~Deutsche Welle, 'We've used up most of what scientists have described as the carbon budget. We are producing carbon at record levels, year after year. It's begun to plateau, but at such a high level that it's not doing us much good.\~I can go on for a long time, but suffice it to say that pretty much everything that we've taken for granted on the surface of the planet is now in major flux. And even those places that seemed idyllic and safe\~are now places of fear and of flux (emphasis added).' McKibben's call for civilian protest is all well and good, but in many countries around the world, the rules that govern civil disobedience are tightening in new and threatening ways. In the United States, many of the protesters at last year's Standing Rock protests were arrested and charged with felonies punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Several states have new laws on the books severely punishing those who dare to impede pipeline construction. Some states are considering laws making it OK for any motorist to mow down pedestrians who block roads and highways, regardless of the consequences. Anti-terrorist legislation has been flipped to make any form a civil protest punishable by grossly disproportionate fines and prison terms. The joke going around is that environmental protesters will soon be shipped off to Guantanamo Bay to be dealt with as enemy combatants. But it's no joke. The level of contempt for ordinary citizens by government officials, beginning with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is higher than perhaps at any time in history. If we are all going to take to the streets, Bill McKibben, a lot of us are going to be fighting the good fight while held\~incommunicado\~behind penitentiary walls. Hopefully, the warden will allow us to continue reading\~CleanTechnica\~while there, but that is far from assured.Tags: Bill McKibben[5], COP 23 [6], Energy Watch Group[7], global weirding[8], Lappeenranta University of Technology[9], Renewable Energy[10], solar power[11], wind power[12] About the Author \~ HYPERLINK https://planetsave.com/author/stevehanley/Stephen https://planetsave.com/author/stevehanley/Stephen Hanley[13] writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Rhode Island.

Albany: Anglican Communion has issued the following news release: Five Anglican archbishops have joined other Christian leaders in calling for governments to implement the promises they made at the Paris Climate Change talks. Political leaders from 197 nations will gather in Bonn, Germany, next month for the next phase of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ); and the Christian leaders are urging them to  keep the promises they made in the Paris Agreement, to restore the natural balance. The letter was signed by five archbishops: Thabo Makgoba of Southern Africa, Winston Halapua of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, Albert Chama of Central Africa, Philip Freier of Australia; and Francisco De Assis Da Silva of Brazil; and two bishops: Dr Jwan Zhumbes of Bukuru in Nigeria, and Dr Robert Innes from the Church of England\' s Diocese in Europe. The letter has been co-ordinated by Renew Our World \- a Christian partnership bringing together the World Evangelical Alliance, Tearfund, Micah Challenge, EU-Cord, Eficor, Paz y Esperanza, and the Jos Green Centre in Australia, Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria, Peru, the UK, US, and Zambia. Renew Our World say that next month\' s Cop23 meeting is  the crucial next step for our world to take urgent action on climate solutions, before it\' s too late. We already won the commitment of almost every country in the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. But now it is time to hold our governments accountable to those commitments, and make sure we turn the Paris Agreement into reality. We must make sure our leaders keep their promises.  This year is critically important, especially since President Trump indicated he wants to withdraw the US from the agreement. Now is the crucial time for our world to band together, focus, and rise to meet our commitments to protect people and planet. The letter has also been signed by more than 580 other Christian leaders, including Bishop Efraim Tendero of the World Evangelical Alliance; the human rights activist Dr Denis Mukwege; Pete Greig from the 24-7 prayer movement; US singer Nichole Nordeman; and Laura Vargas from the Inter-religious Council of Peru. It says:  as Christians across the globe we are calling for action on climate change. The changing climate is causing great damage to people and planet right now, and we are particularly concerned about hunger and poverty hitting the most vulnerable communities, who did least to cause it. They are calling on world leaders to Set targets for the world to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to limit global warming to the safe level of 1.5 degrees. Invest in 100% clean energy, particularly using local grids so it reaches those in poverty beyond the reach of national electricity grids. Support more sustainable, low emission agriculture, to stop communities going hungry, and help them cope better with more floods and droughts caused by climate change. Publish national country plans in 2020 showing how each nation will move to zero emissions.  This is our generation\' s challenge, a significant part of how we love our neighbours, the letter says.  We\' re committing to respond as Christians by living more sustainably, praying, and raising our voices; we\' re asking every member of the church \- the world\' s largest network \- to join in, alongside many others, and every national leader to lead the way.

The following information was released by the Assembly of European Regions (AER): This year again, AER was present at the COP meeting. As a member of the Global Taskforce made up of the key city and region networks joining forces to tackle global challenges, AER was partner to the Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders. On Sunday 12 November, more than 350 political leaders from across the globe gathered in Bonn to show the world the commitment of cities and regions to fight climate change. At a time when the United States federal government wishes to leave the Paris agreement, the presence of many USA mayors and governors pledging to continue their fight against climate change illustrated that even when States do not deliver, subnational governments are there to pick up the fight. AER signed up to the Bonn-Fiji commitment of local and regional leaders to deliver the Paris agreement and to keep the global temperature rise well below two degrees celsius. AER President Magnus Berntsson was invited to speak at various events during the COP to voice the determination, concerns and hopes of European regions. He specifically talked about access to finance for sustainable projects, a key issue for many cities and regions and a long-term fight for AER and the R20. After several breakthrough : the 100 climate solutions projects campaign in the Summer 2016 which showed investors that regions have great projects to be financed ; the development of regional training to maximise access to public money via the SOURCE software ; AER and R20 are going one step further during this COP23 by announcing their progress towards setting up the first Subnational Climate Funds. In presence of the UNFCCC and UNIDO executive secretary and as R20 President, Magnus Berntsson announced the launch of the first subnational climate fund for Africa with a goal of 350 million $ worth of blended finance for African cities and regions' projects. As AER President, Magnus Berntsson announced that the organisation would take the leadership on the creation of a similar fund for European cities and regions, the Subnational climate fund for Europe.

The following information was released by the Episcopal Church: Episcopalians representing Presiding Bishop Michael Curry welcome visitors to their booth in the public zone of the COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany. Photo courtesy of Marc Andrus [Episcopal News Service] Episcopalians have returned home after spending two weeks in Bonn, Germany, representing Presiding Bishop Michael Curry and contributing voices of faith in support of environmental stewardship during the U.N. climate change summit held there. The Nov. 6-17 conference, officially known as the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23 , was an annual intergovernmental meeting to focus on global dialogue and action. The Episcopal Church, granted observer status, sent about a dozen Episcopalians to continue the church's advocacy that began at the previous two conferences. "The Episcopal Church, through the presiding bishop's delegation, is taking a very strong presence in the life of these climate summits," Diocese of California Bishop Marc Andrus told Episcopal News Service after returning from COP23 . "We're making strong networks in the faith communities." Andrus and his wife, Sheila Andrus, spent the full two weeks in Bonn, while two groups of Episcopalians alternated in participating in the first week and then the second week. They led daily worship services, maintained a booth with information on the church's environmental advocacy and, on a more limited basis, were able as observers to enter the U.N. zone where the intergovernmental negotiations were occurring. Diocese of California Bishop Marc Andrus helps lead an opening chant at an interfaith prayer service in Bonn, Germany, before delivering a statement titled Walk Gently on the Earth to the COP23 leadership. Photo courtesy of Marc Andrus "I'm very, very grateful to Presiding Bishop [Michael] Curry for trusting us, this delegation, with this work that I consider so vital, and it's a great honor to serve," Andrus said. "Our church is responding in an important and beautiful way." The Episcopal Church has made environmental justice one of its three priorities, in addition to racial reconciliation and evangelism, and General Convention has passed numerous resolutions on the issue, whether supporting federal climate action or pledging to mitigating the church's own impact on the environment. A 2015 resolution created the Advisory Council on the Stewardship of Creation to support "ecologically responsible stewardship of church-related properties and buildings." Through its Office of Governmental Relations and the Episcopal Public Policy Network, the church has advocated for government policies in line with General Convention stances on climate change, and the House of Bishops made environmental justice one of the themes of its September meeting in Alaska. An Episcopal group was in Paris, France, in December 2015 to make a spiritual case for climate action during COP21. At that conference, member countries, including the United States, reached a landmark agreement to set voluntary goals aimed at keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists think would be necessary to prevent a spiraling catastrophe of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and related weather extremes. The COP23 "We remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people," U.S. diplomat Judith Garber said last week at COP23 . The Trump administration's noncommittal stance loomed over COP23 , where negotiators began drafting the rules for how the member countries will be expected to report their emissions reductions. Final approval of that framework could come when the next U.N. conference is held in Poland. "If the United States does not keep its commitment, that's a very poor predictor of the success of the Paris agreement," Andrus said. He and the rest of the Episcopal delegation were encouraged by the presence in Bonn of what has been called the "We're Still In" movement. While the Trump administration participated in the U.N.'s intergovernmental negotiations, an alternate, unofficial American delegation in Bonn included U.S. lawmakers and leaders of states and cities, as well as business and faith leaders. They vowed to live up to the United States' Paris agreement commitments thus the label "We're Still In" even if the federal government won't. "The end result of this COP23 is being seen as a rather positive and fruitful outcome, all things considered," Lynnaia Main, the Episcopal Church's representative to the U.N., said in an email to ENS after attending part of the conference. "Member states demonstrated unparalleled commitment to the Paris agreement, although there is an urgent need to increase their level of ambition." The plight of various Pacific island nations was a recurring theme at COP23 , because of the direct effect that rising ocean levels will have on their ability to survive. Main said the prime minister of Tuvalu had warned that his country would be submerged by 2030 if nothing is done to limit or reverse climate change. Those low-lying countries' request for an increase in financial assistance, however, was not approved, Andrus said. The result could be dire. "They are losing their lives. Samoa, for instance, has been inhabited for about 3,000 years, and this is their home and it's deeply threatened by rising water levels," he said. "This is not distant future or even near future. This is happening." What could a small group of Episcopalians hope to contribute in a place like Bonn? At COP23 , Andrus said the church and other faith communities were welcomed by participants and visitors who were eager to ground their activism in shared values. People of faith are climate activists, Andrus said. Our spiritual values are the basis from which we act." David Paulsen is an editor and reporter for the Episcopal News Service.

Nov 19, 2017( Biofuels Digest: HYPERLINK http://www.biofuelsdigest.com http://www.biofuelsdigest.com COP23 )[1] wrapped up on Friday in Bonn, with 19 Member countries of the 'Biofuture Platform,' including Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Morocco, Mozambique, announcing a formal agreement on the development of targets for biofuels and to construct an action plan to achieve them. The U.S. is no longer part of the platform since withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. 'Sustainable biofuels can provide solutions to the energy transport nexus. This partnership offers us that chance,' said Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) in the UN press release. Participants also focused on how to maintain momentum two years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in the context of the announcement by the United States of its decision to withdraw from the accord earlier this year. A week before COP23 's opening, the World Meteorological Organization announced that CO2 levels in the atmosphere surged at 'record-breaking speed' to new highs in 2016.

\~Drawing attention to the impact that climate change is having on rural communities in developing countries, British artist Silas Birtwistle unveiled his Biomimic Tree at the United Nations' Climate Summit (UNFCCC COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Sponsored by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN agency that is helping smallholder farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change, the installation uses recycled plastic to depict a tree which only fully comes alive when water runs through it. "At the bottom of the tree there is a pump which takes water through clear pipes to fruit and birds, which all gently move, turn, spin and chatter in response," said Silas Birtwistle. "Every five minutes, the pump will activate and the tree will come to life, water will trickle, the birds will sing and the leaves will flutter." This sculpture highlights the dependence of all living things on a functioning healthy ecosystem. The tree provides food and a home to animals and birds. It also offers shelter from wind and shade from sun, allowing crops to thrive and feed families. "The water running through the tree highlights the increasing importance of this critical resource due to climate change," said IFAD'sEnvironment and Climate DivisionDirector, Margarita Astralaga. "When the water is running the tree comes to life, when the water stops the tree comes to a stop, or dies." She added, "Right now climate change issues such as water scarcity and erratic weather patterns are adversely affecting smallholder farmers in the developing world. But IFAD-led solutions are empowering them to combat and overcome these issues. " "The sculpture highlights IFADs restoration efforts which focuses on planting trees on degraded lands to stop soil erosion," added Birtwistle. In the Sahel region of Africa IFAD has rehabilitated almost 300,000 hectares. Once barren land now has approximately 50 trees per hectare. In total IFAD's agroforestry and related activities have contributed to the removal of over 58,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. IFAD's investments, including theAdaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), help farmers in several ways, from installing weather forecast systems, to introducing new drought resistant crop varieties, as well as setting up farmer field schools where knowledge and new climate smart agriculture techniques can be demonstrated and disseminated.

The Federation of Canadian Municipalities issued the following news release: Federation of Canadian Municipalities President Jenny Gerbasi issued the following statement after leading Canada's municipal delegation at the COP23 climate change conference, hosted by Fiji with meetings held in Bonn, Germany. "At home and on the international stage, Canada's local leaders are strengthening the global movement for climate action. Since COP21, when the Paris Agreement formally recognized local governments' role in addressing climate change, we've seen growing global interest in how local solutions can reduce emissions and adapt communities to new weather extremes. "This weekend at COP23 , more than 1,000 municipal delegates from 60 countries attended the Summit of Local and Regional Leaders hosted by ICLEI Global. FCM's Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program (MCIP) was featured as an exemplary initiative supporting the group's Bonn-Fiji Commitment. Delivered in partnership with the Government of Canada, MCIP raises municipalities' capacity to integrate climate priorities in local infrastructure planning. "All week in Bonn, we've shown how municipalities are modelling some of Canada's most innovative green solutions - from building retrofits to district heating, from better transit to low-GHG waste systems. Some of the richest potential to meet Canada's GHG emission targets lies in scaling up this local innovation. That's our message to the federal government as it continues to negotiate details of its long-term Green Infrastructure Fund with provinces and territories. "FCM's delegation participated in a promising conversation with municipal experts from Barcelona and Paris, along with leading international climate science organizations, about the need for climate science to be co-developed and shared directly with local governments. This dialogue will continue In March 2018, when Canada hosts the first-ever IPCC Cities and Climate Science conference in Edmonton. "After meeting with European and American Mayors on a panel hosted by the Committee of the Regions of the European Union, I'm energized by new opportunities for cities and communities to borrow best practices from each other through initiatives like the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. It's becoming increasingly clear that local governments working together - at home and across borders - are the key to tackling our global climate challenge."

The following information was released by the UK Government: From: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Claire Perry MP Part of: Climate change international action Published: 17 November 2017 Delivered on: 16 November 2017 (Speaker's notes, may differ from delivered version) Claire Perry highlighted the action that has been undertaken by the UK to tackle climate change and work at the conference. Bula vinaka! [boo-lah vee-nah-kah, meaning 'warm hello']. COP 23 , and I want to thank the Fijian Presidency for its excellent leadership... ... and the people of Germany for their great hospitality. As our Prime Minister highlighted in New York in September, the Paris Agreement is a brilliant example of effective global cooperation. Every country in the world has now signed the Agreement, and I am proud that the UK is part of this. It has never been more important to accelerate our momentum. Recent extreme weather events have devastated the lives of many across the world. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected and emphasise that we are taking our commitments under the Paris Agreement very seriously and we are taking action. Firstly, for the UK we launched a Clean Growth Strategy for the UK just last month a critical set of measures to meet our domestic carbon budgets and help our global CO2 reduction process. I was also proud that the UK recently announced plans to phase out unabated coal fired electricity generation by 2025... our intent to end the sale of conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040... and to establish our Green Finance Taskforce Earlier today the UK, Canada, and over twenty five other parties committed to forming the Powering Past Coal Alliance - a new alliance committed to phasing out unabated coal from power generation. We have also kept our promises in supporting poorer nations to accelerate the transition to a more resilient and low carbon future and play our role in meeting our collective goal of mobilising $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020. Last year, we showed international leadership by successfully balancing our climate finance across mitigation and adaptation... and so far we have mobilised 2.2 billion public and 500 million private finance for climate change purposes in developing countries. This has helped over 34 million people deal with the impacts of climate change. ... and I am very proud of the over three hundred million pounds of UK funding announcements at this COP on protecting forests, encouraging private sector investment in sustainable infrastructure, and helping countries finance their existing emissions reduction plans. Plus we have recently committed to double our 2017 funding to IPCC and make multi-year pledges to be sure that this important institution can continue to play a crucial role in providing independent, rigorous and balances scientific information on climate change. The UK also continues to be a global leader in protecting oceans and marine life: We are on track to protect 4 million square kilometres of ocean across Overseas Territories by 2020. We see pre-2020 action as extremely important - on Tuesday we ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol on phasing down HFCs.... ...and I am pleased to say that our Foreign Secretary signed the Doha Amendment yesterday. We are not resting on our laurels. In the New Year we are looking forward to hosting the Commonwealth summit in London which will help to provide a springboard for future collective action... We see it as crucial that over the next few years we achieve: ... Agreement on the rules that underpin the Paris Agreement... ... an increase in ambition as technology and innovation makes the transition a win win for the planet and our economy. ... but of course the action that really matters is in the real world where businesses and organisations are taking the signals from these negotiations to transform our future There is much we can and must achieve together. Thank you to all parties here for working together to make COP23 a huge success.

CARE International issued the following news release: CARE International has endorsed the Joint Statement on the InsuResilience Global Partnership (IGP), but has reservations on the future direction of the Partnership. The IGP emerged from the G7 InsuResilience, an initiative that aims to provide up to 400 million in developing countries with access to insurance coverage by 2020. The IGP aims to strengthen the resilience of developing countries and protect the poor and vulnerable from the impacts of disasters. Sheri Lim, Climate Change Advisor with CARE International UK, says: "The IGP has the potential to increase the protection of people facing the devastating impacts of disasters, but it is critical that its mandate does not only promote climate insurance. The Partnership must provide a strong role in helping countries explore a wider range of climate disaster risk finance instruments and support risk reduction planning for broader resilience." CARE has engaged in consultations leading up to the launch of the initiative. As many details in the IGP still need to be developed, CARE will continue to engage in this discussion on different levels. Sven Harmeling, Global Advocacy Lead on Climate Change with CARE International, says: "We share the Partnership's objectives to help countries better prepare for climate and disaster risk, but the IGP must ensure that the needs of the poor and vulnerable remain the focus. It is essential that the partnership is accountable to people on the ground and that there is transparent consultation on its development. It is also clear that such welcome initiatives cannot substitute a much needed decision at COP23 to start exploring innovative finance solutions which can generate truly additional finance to address loss and damage."

Brussels: Education International Global Union Federation has issued the following news release: The key role of education and training on sustainable development to safeguard the planet was highlighted at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change. The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change ( COP23 ), which is being held in Bonn between 6 and 17 November, began its second and final week in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. This is a strong symbol given that this small country in the Pacific is already being hit hard by the effects of climate change, in particular the devastation caused by cyclones, as recalled Richard Langlois, economist and representative of Education International (EI) at the COP23 . The findings detailed in the discussions at the COP23 are clear and unequivocal: the current trajectory of carbon emissions, should it remain unchanged, would render it impossible to reach the objective of the Paris Agreement which, according to a majority of experts, is a minimum threshold that should not be exceeded at the risk of exposing humanity to grave danger. This situation requires urgent mobilisation of all relevant stakeholders, and government first among them, which must rapidly fulfil their role as leaders. According to the trade union movement, which was strongly represented in Bonn, it is imperative for governments to strengthen international climate governance. This means raising their "ambitions" by 2020, observing their financial commitments and committing to a fair transition for workers and populations. EI: The planet's future depends on generations of educated citizens informed about the climate emergency According to EI, better governance must also include an ambitious programme on climate-related education and training. The education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition towards a low carbon emission global economy. With new business models making a significant impact on workers, EI also emphasised that education and training must prepare young people for civic and professional life. Similarly, technological research and development will be of paramount importance in combating climate change. Consequently, EI calls on the world's governments to strengthen initial training and lifelong professional training programmes for teachers who must have the necessary skills with which to deliver education on sustainable development and climate change. The future of the planet will rest in the hands of generations informed and educated with regard to the climate emergency. \</doc>

International resolve to address climate change infused COP23 with an inclusive spirit that resulted in enough progress to take us through to negotiation crunch-time at COP24. The well-below 2\'baC degree guardrail, our collectively agreed temperature goal, is still however stubbornly out of reach.1 By Lara L\'e1zaro-Touza ackling climate change in earnest requires governing a 'super wicked' collective action problem through non-marginal actions across time horizons that expand regular market timescales. From scientists to policymakers and individuals we all need to be involved. Increasingly ambitious global action is key, as analyses by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released prior to COP23 confirm that greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise while efforts to reduce emissions are insufficient to hold temperature increases to a bearable level in a year in which the world has endured significant extreme weather events. Physical risks from climate change are increasingly clear. The Paris Agreement provided the collective framework to limit temperature increases to well below 2\'baC above preindustrial levels, but international rules that will govern the Paris Agreement are yet to be finalised. National climate laws and policies that are fostered, inter alia, by the Paris Agreement ensure action on the ground. Appropriation of new and existing climate policies is key to ensure their implementation. Citizen concern seems to be mounting, thus favouring increasingly ambitious climate regulation, although further action is needed. The current legal and social contexts highlight both transition risks and market opportunities for stakeholders as a function of their climate action. Recent developments in climate science, legislation, litigation and citizen engagement provide the context in which international climate negotiations took place in Bonn this year. COP23 delivered, as expected, the necessary procedural progress to consider this COP successful. Negotiations advanced on the inclusion of Parties' preferred options for the development of implementation guidelines (previously known as the Paris rulebook) that are to govern the Paris Agreement. Progress was also made on evaluating global progress towards our long-term temperature stabilisation target, as the design of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue (renamed the Talanoa dialogue) was completed. Concrete outcomes were also achieved as regards the Vulnerability Agenda on gender, indigenous peoples, local communities and oceans. Intense negotiations at COP23 helped broker an agreement on agriculture after years of paralysis on this topic. At the request of developing countries, the pre-2020 ambition, an unexpected negotiating issue, was raised to the fore. Developed countries will be subject to evaluation as regards ambition and finance in 2018 and 2019. The Adaptation Fund, which was to expire with the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, will continue serving under the Paris Agreement, an additional win for developing countries. On Fiji's expected grand coalition of actors, and building on the work undertaken at Lima (COP20), Paris (COP21) and Marrakech (COP22), the first formal dialogue between non-state actors (sub-national governments, the business sector and civil society) and Parties (national governments) was held in Bonn. Additionally, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, that seeks to promote pre-2020 ambition, presented its first Yearbook on Global Climate Action. Given the realisation that non-state actors are crucial in the push towards a lower carbon development model, and building too on the increased interest by non-state actors to contribute to the low carbon transition, it is expected that future international climate meetings advance this dialogue. The meeting of the 2050 Pathways Platform to foster the development of long-term decarbonisation pathways also took place in Bonn. Analysis Science: urgent climate action required As COP23 opened in Bonn, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) informed that 2017 was set to be the warmest year ever recorded without an El Ni\'f1o2 event, and one of the three hottest years on record overall. This year the world has experienced record Extreme Weather Events (EWE), including hurricanes in the Caribbean and the southern parts of the US, the highest cyclonic September on record, global ocean heat content also reaching record levels, continued droughts in Somalia and above-average rainfall in some parts of India leading to significant floods.3 Although single events are difficult to attribute to climate change, as changes in climate patterns are studied over several decades (or longer), scientists agree that climate change is expected to bring increased frequency and severity of EWE such as those we have endured in 2017. The eighth edition of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report,4 which analyses the information included in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, as well as more updated studies, provides a further warning signal. Full implementation of countries' Nationally Developed Contributions (NDCs) will only provide one third of the emission reductions needed to meet our 2\'baC goal in the most cost-effective manner. In terms of emissions, this implies having a gap (distance to the well-below 2\'baC target) of 11 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) if conditional pledges are implemented and a 13.5GtCO2e gap if unconditional pledges are implemented. For the 1.5\'baC target, the gap would increase to 16GtCO2e and 19GtCO2e respectively. The gap between our intentions (NDCs) and the 2\'baC target is, according to UNEP £larmingly high'.5 By 2030 the implementation of current commitments will use up 80% of the carbon budget6 to stay within the 2\'baC temperature limit. Furthermore, the carbon budget for limiting temperature increases to 1.5\'baC will be completely exhausted by 2030 if ambition is not ramped up. Therefore, the deadline to close the gap is 2030 if the world is to transition to a low-carbon model in a cost-effective manner. Hence, the 2018 Talanoa dialogue, the first global exam of our collective progress towards the long-term temperature stabilisation target, that will inform the 2020 revision of countries commitments (with a 2030 timeframe for NDCs), is critical in ensuring the world is ratcheting-up climate action. The UNEP report does, however, provide some guidance as regards the sectors that have significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential. Over two-thirds of the potential comes from the energy, industrial and transport sectors. The uptake of low carbon energies including renewable energies, the use of carbon capture and storage,7 the recovery and re-use of methane in gas production or the pre-mining degasification in coal mining are some of the key actions that can be taken by the energy sector. Increasing energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy to produce heat, using carbon capture and storage and reducing hydroflourocarbons are actions the industrial sector can take to reduce its GHG emissions according to UNEP. Fuel efficiency measures, transport modal shifts and increasing the use of electric vehicles are the key GHG reduction initiatives suggested for the transport sector. Climate governance and legislation: the push from above Since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 climate laws and policies have increased twentyfold. This surge in climate legislation indicates greater concern and action to provide a stable climate as a global public good. Interestingly, and perhaps expectedly, it is developing countries that have put in place greater number of climate laws since 19948 although full integration of climate policy in development policy is yet to occur in developed and developing countries alike. Figure 1 below portrays climate-related laws and policies passed or enacted yearly from pre-1994 to 2016. The key areas in which global climate laws and policies focus include: the energy sector, accounting for 41% of total climate legislation; low carbon transitions accounting for just under 26% of climate laws; general environmental laws (under 12% of the laws); mainstreaming climate change into planning processes (7.7% of the laws) and the forestry sector (under 5% of the laws analysed). The reduction in the amount of laws nearing 2016 that can be seen in Figure 1 above might soon be reversed. This is so as the entry into force of the Paris Agreement legally binds countries to present their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years, which could mean an increase in the number of climate-related laws and policies in the coming years. For instance, given that 90% of NDCs9 include the agricultural sector, that it is an under-legislated area and that there has been a decision at COP23 , more national regulation in the agricultural sector could be seen in the future.10 Similarly, litigation has also increased throughout the 1994-2016 period analysed. At least 825 court cases related to climate change have been recorded, 600 of which are US-based. Although in most of the court cases to date climate change is not the main concern, this may well change in the future. One possible explanation for this increase in future climate litigation is that it is increasingly perceived as a valid strategy to drive climate action. Three recent cases illustrate this increased demand for action. First, in October 2016 a group of young plaintiffs and the climate scientist Dr James Hansen won the right to trial according to US District Court Judge Anne Aiken. The plaintiffs argued that the US government had not upheld its obligation to ensure a stable climate, in line with the public trust doctrine, endangering plaintiffs' fundamental rights to life and liberty. As judge Aiken stated: 'the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society'.11 Secondly, during COP23 , in November 2017 a German regional court deemed a Peruvian farmer's demand for damages admissible. The farmer was demanding Germany's RWE (one of the largest greenhouse-gas emitters) to contribute to the protection of his town in Peru that is at risk of overflows from a melting glacier. Lastly, in the Netherlands a Dutch court determined that, based on established climate science, the government had to increase its climate ambition by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 compared to 1990.12 Although in countries such as Spain a significant number of climate litigation cases in the past have been motivated by disputes between companies that operate under the European Emission Trading System (EU ETS) and the national government regarding allocated emission allowances,13 this need not be the case in the future. The sharp increase in climate legislation and litigation since the 90s, coupled with the expectation that the Paris Agreement will inject climate laws with renewed impetus, will no doubt be understood by stakeholders as what the future holds. The development of increasingly ambitious climate laws exemplifies one of the transition risks laggards will face. Society: increasingly concerned worldwide but actions lagging behind Concern for climate change has waxed and waned for over three decades14 subject to economic development, political support for climate action, increased experience with climate-change related impacts materialising15 and heightened media coverage of climate change, among others (see Figure 2 below). Sources: the author based on Capstick (2015), Pew (2017), Eurobarometer (2017)16 and L\'e1zaro (forthcoming).17 The underlying trend, however, seems to point towards an increase in citizen concern about climate change. This can turn into demand for action from policymakers and businesses as part of a new social contract.18 For instance, in May 2017 a majority of Exxon Mobil shareholders voted19 for greater disclosure from the company as regards the company's exposure to climate risks, a first in the firm's history, with institutional investors strongly pushing for this move.20 As reported in the latest surveys, climate change is Africa's and Latin America's primary concern as a threat to their countries while in Europe and the US climate change is the second concern for citizens after international terrorism, according to the latest research published by Pew (2017).21 According to the 2017 Eurobarometer climate change is the third most serious problem facing the world for Europeans, preceded by poverty, hunger plus lack of drinking water, and international terrorism. For two EU countries, however, Sweden and Denmark, climate change is the most serious problem facing the world. As regards foreign policy priorities, citizens in the US, Germany and France rank fighting climate change as their second priority after fighting international terrorism.22 In Spain climate change has consistently been ranked as a second foreign policy priority from 2011 to 2016.23 So citizen concern about climate change is significant and indicates that, at least in some jurisdictions, foreign policy is expected to engage in earnest with climate action. As regards the willingness to pay for climate policies, analyses show it is, overall, significantly different from zero,24 albeit with stark geographical differences.25 As for individual's self-reported behaviour regarding climate change, the latest Eurobarometer states that 49% of Europeans spontaneously report climate-conscious behaviour such as separating waste and reducing waste, but when prompted with specific examples of these types of behaviour the percentages reaches 90% of Eropeans. Actions to curb GHG emissions at an individual level are, however, yet to follow in earnest according to per capita GHG emission accounts (see Figure 3 below), despite energy-related CO2 emissions having stalled in the past three years (IEA, 2017)26 (see Figure 4 below). Furthermore, citizens cite national governments, the EU and business and industry as the key institutions that should engage in climate action, which highlights the market and reputational transition risks different stakeholders can expect. COP23 in context: enough to keep going but immense work ahead In the aftermath of the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, seasoned negotiators, observers and researcher alike started warning the international community that implementation and increased ambition, subject to adequate means,27 were paramount to take Paris beyond a diplomatic success. COP22 provided the timeframe for finalising the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement, ie, the set of rules, modalities and procedures that will make the Paris Agreement operational. The rulebook deadline, which coincides with the Facilitative Dialogue enshrined in the Paris Agreement (now known as the Talanoa dialogue),28 was set in 2018. COP24 is therefore set to be a decisive milestone in the fight against climate change. Hence, the expectations for COP23 were those corresponding to a technical international climate meeting. And yet, the work during 2017 and 2018, prior to COP24, is of utmost importance in determining the resilience, effectiveness and buy-in of the Paris Agreement. As regards the resilience of the Paris Agreement, 2017 was a premature test for global climate action. Prior to this year's COP, on 1 June 2017, the 45th president of the US announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The arguments for withdrawing from the agreement were based on the misunderstanding or misrepresenting of three key issues:29 The nature of the Paris Agreement. This is an agreement in part crafted to suit US political circumstances (ie, circumvent America's political gridlock on climate change). It is only binding on procedural issues and explicitly excludes the possibility of being exposed to liability claims for losses and damages. The Paris Agreement, like any other international environmental agreement, has not been imposed on any country by any other country as Donald Trump claimed. The Paris Agreement is a voluntary undertaking. Additionally, all Parties to the Agreement have expressed their voluntary commitments through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) according to their national circumstances, ie, they are asymmetric in nature to allow for differentiation in terms of will and xapacity to act. The economics of climate action. Trump misleadingly cited a partial study30 to provide only cost estimates of climate action, forgetting his own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates of the benefits of globally-concerted climate action.31 The scientific consensus on the impacts of climate action. The insufficiency of current NDCs notwithstanding, Trump underestimated the impacts of current mitigation commitment by a large quantity.32 Although every diplomatic effort, both within and outside the White House, was made during 2016 and 2017 to prevent the withdrawal announcement, on 4 August 2017 the Department of State announced the US had submitted a letter to the UN expressing America's intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as possible.33 A withdrawal that, according to article 28 of the Paris Agreement, would not occur before Trumps' term in office ends. In the meantime, the US has sent a technical-profile group of seasoned negotiators to COP23 , and will continue sending an official delegation to the negotiation in order to 'to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration'.34 Even though the official US delegation at COP23 has not had a leading role in the negotiations, it has been argued that it has not disrupted the negotiations either. The political declarations during COP22 regarding the resolve to push ahead with the climate action agenda have fortunately proceeded apace throughout 2017. This should not be mistaken, however, with an innocuous US climate default. America's first climate default (when it failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol) arguably resulted in lowering ambition and expectations as regards climate action, something we cannot afford at present according to climate science. Trump's decisions on cutting international climate finance can hinder cooperation between developed and developing countries, slowing down, to some extent, the low-carbon transition and leapfrogging processes in the latter. Trump's disregard for established climate science, with currents reports of lawyers in the Justice Department questioning climate scientists regarding uncertainties in the science,35 his announced budget cuts to the EPA as well as to international institutions such as the IPCC, and the limitation imposed on EPA's scientists to disclose their findings, can endanger the traditionally world-class climate science that, along with many other institutions worldwide, inform international climate negotiations and actions. Europe's resolve to fill the finance gap, as exemplified by declarations such as those of President Macron during COP23 and the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS),36 the significant contribution by the EU to international climate finance, \€ 20.2 billion in 2016 according to the Council of the EU,37 and the decisive support of climate scientists working, among others, at the Joint Research Center, the Copernicus Programme, Barcelona's Supercomputing Center and H2020 programmes, will in all likelihood become increasingly important to fill the science-finance void left by the US. As regards China, its New Normal economic38 development and its overwhelming investment in renewables39 provide reasons for optimism. However, China's expected leadership role that was envisaged after Xi Jinping's speech at the World Economic Forum in 201740 has arguably not yet materialised in international climate negotiations. China's historical principled resistance to external oversight of emissions has been a stumbling block during COP23 . This is so despite its technical capabilities41 as regards satellite monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions. The leadership role in international climate negotiations seems to be (at least partially) vacant for the time being. COP23 priorities and key results Prior to the celebration of COP23 in Bonn, under the Fiji Presidency, the key priorities were to advance on the rules that will govern the Paris Agreement, to design the first exam of the advances made towards meeting our long-term temperature goal, to advance on the vulnerability agenda and to foster climate finance. All these while avoiding re-opening issues that had been agreed in Paris and in Marrakech such as that on differentiation between developed and developing countries (see Box 1 below). Source: UNFCCC (2017)42 and OECC (2017a).43 Some of the key outcomes of COP23 include: (1) the Paris work programme; (2) finalising the design of the Talanoa dialogue; (3) reaching an agreement on evaluating pre-2020 ambitions and requesting ratification of the Doha Amendment; (4) progress on the Vulnerability Agenda; and (5) the grand coalition, or the increasing (yet still fuzzy) role of non-state actors. (1) The Paris work programme44 The implementation guidelines have made progress. The negotiating texts being developed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement managed to include the preferred options from all Parties. This was essential in ensuring the appropriation by all countries of the rulebook that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The work ahead will entail treamlining the negotiating texts that it is to be hoped will be adopted in COP24. As the amount of work ahead is immense, the topic complex and the issues of mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building are highly interlinked, there will be an additional negotiating session in the period between May 2018 and COP24. Additionally, there was a request to the UNFCCC secretariat to develop an online platform to track the progress made in the Paris work programme. The goal is to avoid having lengthy negotiations such as those prior to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. The key outcomes are presented in Table 1 below. (2) Finalising the design of the Talanoa dialogue The Talanoa dialogue is structured in two phases. The first phase is a technical one that will gather evidence from scientific institutions (eg, the IPCC's special report on climate change scenarios in a 1.5\'baC warmer world), stakeholders and Technical Expert Meetings (TEMs) and will summarise the information for the second phase (the political phase) that will report on the findings of the dialogue and will help in the development of the next generation Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Parties are expected to bring to the Talanoa dialogue their national or regional progress and initiatives to achieve the long-term temperature goal. In this respect, the EU has communicated during COP23 that it will strive to bring to the table the most advanced legislative package possible, which includes the recently reformed EU ETS,48 the Effort Sharing Regulation proposal for 2021-30,49 the land use and forestry proposal for 2021-3050 and the energy Package.51 This, it is hoped, will demonstrate that the EU is a credible and ambitious partner. The EU claims that not only does it have a strong track record in climate action, having disbursed \€ 20.2 billion in climate finance last year and decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, as GDP has grown over 50% since 1990 while emissions have fallen over 20%, it also has a clear vision of how to decarbonise its economy and it has in place (or it is developing) the policies to support the low carbon transition. (3) Reaching an agreement on evaluating pre-2020 ambitions and requesting ratification of the Doha Amendment Pre-2020 ambition was, arguably, an unexpected negotiating topic at COP23 . The African Group wanted to ensure climate actions and finance were disclosed prior to the implementation of the first set of NDCs, to ensure continued post-2020 ambition. The EU's expected overachievement of 2020 goals plus its significant contribution to international climate finance, and its recurrent narrative of Europe's will to keep leading by example voiced by Commissioner Arias Ca\'f1ete, were some of the drivers for the EU agreeing to the decisions taken on pre-2020 ambition. The pre-2020 decisions include, first, sending letters to Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify the Doha Amendment so that the second period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-20) would enter into force. The EU stated it would strive to send its ratification before the end of 2018 and Spain deposited its instrument of ratification on 14 November 2017, joining 15 other EU countries that have also ratified the Doha Amendment.52 The EU ratification has not materialised yet due to the Polish veto to ratify, but Poland has announced it will do so ahead of COP24,53 which will be hosted in Katowice under its Presidency.54 The EU's ratification will not, however, imply crossing the threshold for the Doha Amendment to enter into force. Secondly, the decision was taken to hold a stock-taking meeting in 2018 and 2019 in which mitigation efforts, support and information regarding the actions under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action by non-Party stakeholders will be analysed. (4) Progress on the Vulnerability Agenda The first COP presided by a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), plus a year of extreme weather events, fostered the vulnerability agenda at COP23 . The outcomes within this agenda included: (a) The establishment of a Gender Action Plan55 in order to mainstream gender-responsive climate action. Mainstreaming would in turn result in increasing capacity building through, inter alia, specific training programmes, increasing access of women to the international climate negotiating process and fostering gender-related approaches in national climate action plans. (b) The development of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform56 whose goal is to preserve local and indigenous knowledge through the exchange of information and best practices. It also aims to improve local communities and indigenous peoples' access to the international climate negotiation process and to improve the communication between the platform and other stakeholders. (5) The grand coalition, or the increasing (yet still fuzzy) role of non-state actors The first formal open dialogue between Party (national governments) and non-Party stakeholders (subnational governments, cities, firms and civil society) took place at COP23.57 A dialogue that is expected to continue in future COPs. A permanent dialogue mechanism between Parties and non-Party stakeholders has been recognised as key to deliver effective climate action. Bottom-up actions by non-state actors have surged since Copenhagen (COP15), with cities for example demanding greater involvement in the UNFCCC process.58 Key initiatives in the post Copenhagen era include: (a) The Lima-Paris Action Agenda and the establishment of the Non-state actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA) platform at COP20 in Lima that records commitments by non-Party stakeholders. (b) The development of the roadmap for Global Climate Action59 at COP21 in Paris to enable the formal liaison between Party and on-Party stakeholders, with Laurence Tubiana and Hakima el Haite as High-Level Climate Champions. (c) Also at the behest of the first climate champions, the 2050 Pathways Platform60 was launched at COP22. The key goal of this initiative is to support governments at all levels as well as companies61 to develop long-term decarbonisation strategies to achieve the long-term net-zero GHG goal. During COP23 Spain announced it had joined the 2050 Pathways Platform. (d) The Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action62 that seeks to enhance pre-2020 actions and engagement by Party and non-Party stakeholders, which is complementary to Party negotiations. The Marrakech Partnership also tracks progress by non-party stakeholders using the NAZCA platform and reports actions annually in the Yearbook of Global Climate Action. The first Yearbook on Global Climate Action was published in 2017. Although the yearbook has, understandably, not recorded all on-going initiatives, the following show the widespread engagement by non-Party stakeholders. First, over one billion (109) people have committed to reduce their GHG emissions by 80% by mid-century. Secondly, water adaptation capacity is to be scaled up by megacities with over 300 million inhabitants, with a significant number of initiatives being announced in developing countries. Third, a significant number of companies are committing to using 100% renewable energy. Companies are also increasingly willing to be subject to science-based targets in line with a 2\'baC temperature target in their GHG reduction commitments. This alignment with science-based targets can furthermore help future capital allocation decisions by institutional investors that are increasingly mindful of companies' exposure to climate risks. Science-led climate action and disclosure is potentially a means for attracting investment. One of the most notable initiatives as regards non-Party stakeholders at COP23 was arguably the presentation of America's Pledge, an initiative developed by cities, businesses and civil society in the US that was presented by Michael Bloomberg and Jerry Brown. In contrast with Donald Trump's announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, over half of America's population (amounting to over half of the US GDP, equivalent to the third-largest GHG emitter globally) committed to uphold the goals of the Paris Agreement. This contrasted to the relatively low profile of the US delegation at COP23 that focused its work on, inter alia, a working group on NDC implementation, loss and damage, climate finance and avoiding reopening the issue of country differentiation. The only official American side event at COP23 , titled 'Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation', was disrupted by protesters, a clear sign of the deep divide in the US between the federal government and non-Party stakeholders. The key gaps identified to implement and scale-up climate action in the 2017 Yearbook on Global Climate Action are: integrating approaches, closing the financial gaps, enhancing capacity and addressing technology and information gaps. Moving forward, however, the challenges include: institutionalising the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and ensuring it has the appropriate means to develop its work; and setting up a system to account rigorously for all non-state actor climate actions in a transparent way that can be verified and compared and that ensures non-Party commitments are additional to Party commitments. The design of this accounting mechanism is expected to occur after the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement are finalised. An additional high-profile initiative presented at COP23 was the Powering Past Coal Alliance,63 fostered by the governments of the UK and Canada. Initially signed by 25 governments (national and subnational) the alliance seeks to accelerate traditional coal phase-out (ie, coal-fired power plants without Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS).64 At the One Planet Summit that marked the 2nd anniversary of the Paris Agreement,65 24 businesses and other organisations joined the initial list of national and sub-national signatories of the Powering Past Coal Alliance.66 Based on the work by Climate Analytics,67 the alliance declaration states that given that 40% of current electricity worldwide is supplied by coal and that there are significant health impacts from the use of coal for electricity production, amounting to 800,000 deaths a year, traditional coal should be phased out. This phase-out, it is argued, should occur by 2030 in the OECD and the EU and by 2050 in the rest of the world. As regards Spain, the question was asked during COP23 regarding the potential adherence to the Powering Past Coal Alliance. At present, the reasons given for not doing so include the potential increase in the price of electricity,68 the job losses this would entail and the need to ensure security of supply. There is, however, an on-going dialogue with the energy sector regarding the coal phase-out.69 Other achievements Other achievements include: (1) breaking the gridlock on agriculture; (2) launching the Ocean Pathway at COP23 ; and (3) involving institutional investors in climate change. Breaking the gridlock on agriculture70 After years of unfruitful negotiations, COP23 brought greater understanding and trust among Parties as regards agriculture. In moving forward, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) will jointly address the topic of agriculture and climate change through workshops and expert meetings. The topics to be addressed are yet to be finalised but they are expected to include the enhancement of soil carbon, increasing adaptation and resilience, improving livestock and food security. The issue of how to account for emissions by the agricultural sector was a contentious one once again during COP23 , with methane at the centre of the disputes. Latin American countries including Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay71 (with a large cattle industry) raised, once again, the issue of the disadvantages they faced due to the current Global Warming Potential72 used to calculate the warming impact of methane.73 Launching the Ocean Pathway74 at COP23 This initiative seeks to include the issue of oceans and climate change within the UNFCCC negotiations given the importance of oceans for SIDS and coastal states and the role that oceans play in (and impacts they endure from) climate change.75 It also seeks to include ocean-related climate mitigation and adaptation actions in NDCs. The IPCC is additionally preparing a Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)76 that will be published in 2019 and that will inform the debate moving forward. Involving institutional investors in climate change COP23 as regards climate change include the reiteration that climate change is increasingly being considered a systemic risk. Climate change may reduce the value of assets under management due to both physical and transition risks. Climate action is in turn seen as a potential value-creating-strategy. More is being done, though, on the side of mitigation than on the side of adaptation for the time being. Some of the requests from investors to ramp-up climate finance include: Embedding climate finance considerations both in future rounds of NDCs (starting in 2020) and in the development of national climate policies.78 Fostering blended finance so that investment risks be minimised. Ensuring predictable climate (and related) policies to attract climate finance. Providing ex ante public climate finance information to enable low carbon investment in developing countries, a demand by institutional investors that is aligned with that of developing countries, and which is enshrined in article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement. Project aggregation to ensure institutional investors can finance the low carbon transition. Ensuring independent science-based targets guide national climate policies. The most progressive climate laws and policies have introduced institutions and mechanisms that respond to institutional investors' demands, among other, to help secure future capital for the low carbon transition. Conclusions Reflecting on the results of COP23 On evaluating the results of a largely technical COP it is important to reflect on the goals set for such a meeting, the broader temperature stabilisation goal and contextual factors. As regards the goals set and the expectations on achieving these goals prior to the meeting in Bonn, the outcome could be judged as positive. Despite the temptations to reopen historical discussions on differentiation, and the expected wrangling on ex ante information relative to international climate finance, COP23 managed to advance on the Paris work programme by producing a set of pre-negotiation texts that are acceptable to all Parties. Inclusiveness and trust are known to be key drivers of climate negotiations and thus having all options in the texts that contain the rules (implementation guidelines) that will govern the Paris Agreement was crucial in moving forward. Such all-encompassing negotiating texts have to be narrowed down prior to the celebration of COP24 in December 2018. The workload is such that at COP23 an additional negotiating session prior to COP24 was planned. Some negotiators are somewhat sceptical of the possibility of closing every negotiating item on time, despite this additional session. The second key goal of COP23 was the design of the Talanoa dialogue, which was achieved. It is unclear at this stage whether the inputs from the IPCC and other stakeholders, which will be reviewed prior to the political phase of the dialogue, will be enough to spur the increase in ambition that is needed to ensure we do not overshoot our long-term temperature goal. The first key test of the Talanoa dialogue will come in 2020 when Parties have to submit their updated NDCs, with commitments to be met in 2030. The third key goal of COP23 was the advancement of the vulnerability agenda. Both the Gender Action Plan and the platform for local communities and indigenous peoples have been long-awaited and positive outcomes. Advances on agriculture materialise at COP23 , after years of entrenchment. Finally, the advancement of the Global Climate Action Agenda was arguably the space where the greatest climate action and engagement were seen during COP23 . This multi-stakeholder engagement is a key element of the social appropriation of the new low carbon development model countries have signed up to. Though the negotiation process might be progressing according to COP negotiation timescales, the progress as regards limiting temperature goals is still disappointing. GHG emissions are on the rise and 2017 has brought record extreme weather events. Speeding up the pace of negotiations and actions through the development of national climate laws with the 2050 horizon in mind is expected to be an increasingly pressing topic. As for contextual factors, the US announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement could have taken a bigger short-term toll on international climate negotiations, especially if the Trump Administration had sent a high political profile negotiating team to undermine the work at COP23 . No backsliding or domino effect has occurred so far, but both the international climate finance gap left by the US as well as Trump's disregard for climate science can imperil years of hard-won trust in the international climate negotiations as well as in established climate science, two key issues to watch moving forward.

The usual disclaimer applies. 2 According to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), El Ni\'f1o is a 'warming of the ocean surface, or above-average sea surface temperatures (SST), in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Over Indonesia, rainfall tends to become reduced while rainfall increases over the tropical Pacific Ocean' (see What is the El Ni\'f1o\- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a nutshell?, last accessed 26/XI/2017). 3 Although rainfall in India was 5% less than average, some parts in the north-east and neighbouring countries have had more severe flooding than usual. 4UNEP (2017), 'The Emissions Gap Report 2017', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi, last accessed 26/XI/2017. 5 The emissions gap is the difference between emissions consistent with achieving a given temperature goal, say limiting temperature increases to well below 2\'baC compared to pre-industrial levels, and expected emissions according to a given set of climate commitments, for instance those of current Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs. 6 The carbon budget is the amount of carbon that can be emitted if the goal is to stay within a certain temperature rise limit. In order to limit global mean temperature increases to 2\'baC compared to pre-industrial levels, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (5AR) stated that the carbon budget amounts to 2,900GtCO2, of which 65% (1,900 GtCO2) had been used up by 2011. More updated figures by Carbon Budget estimate significantly lower remaining carbon budget, reducing the amount of years we have left to exceed the 2\'baC and 1.5\'baC temperature targets in the next years or decades (see Analysis: Only five years left before 1.5C carbon budget is blown, last accessed 26/XI/2017). Glen Peters at CICERO reminds that at 40 GtCO2 there are only have 20 years left until the carbon budget is exhausted at current emission levels under the assumption that meeting the IPCC's overall carbon budget will give a 66% chance of limiting temperature increases to 2\'baC. It has to be noted, however, that uncertainties and model assumptions provide a range of carbon budget estimates. For further information see How much carbon dioxide can we emit? (last accessed 26/XI/2017). 7 Note that the International Energy Agency considers CCS as key to meet out climate change commitments. However, at present issues such as safety, costs and acceptance have limited the deployment of CCS. See IEA (2016), '20 years of carbon capture and storage.

The following information was released by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD): By Malina Gont Bank is chairing four events at Bonn climate conference: green fiscal risks, climate resilience, Green Cities Framework and technology transfer The EBRD heads for international climate talks in Bonn next week, determined to demonstrate its commitment to meeting ambitious goals to address the global challenge of climate change. At the COP23 It will also hold a series of technical sessions, outlining practical approaches based on its broad range of projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an increasingly important player in adaptation to climate change. Josu Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, outlined the urgency of achieving the climate action objectives developed by the EBRD and other multilateral development banks in the context of the COP21 Paris meeting. We are taking decisive steps to ensure we meet these objectives, he said. Under its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, the EBRD aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its annual investment to green finance by 2020 and is well on the way to achieving this objective. Mr Tanaka added that in addition to the EBRDs focus on energy efficiency, renewables and green cities, the Bank was now putting an additional focus on climate adaptation. This years talks with be chaired by Fiji, he noted, a country particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The COP23 will bring together over 25,000 environment and climate change specialists, including representatives from governments, observer organisations, multilateral development banks such as the EBRD, and business delegates and media. In Bonn, the EBRD sessions will focus on a number of key climate issues: Achieving the Paris Agreement through a Green Economy Transition: Fiscal risks and opportunities EBRD Green Cities Framework: Accelerating financing for urban action on climate change From early movers to critical mass: How to build a market for climate technologies Measuring climate resilience: Emerging work of financial institutions on metrics for climate resilience and adaptation Bank representatives will also take part in several events focused on driving climate action on finance, research and innovation and legal and institutional developments that support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Nationally Determined Contributions. Since 2006, the EBRD has invested over 24 billion in around 1,400 projects leading to reductions in CO2 emission of 87 million tonnes per year. \</doc>

Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., D-Calif., issued the following news release: With the official American delegation cloistered behind closed doors, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined Canada and Mexico's top climate representatives at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 ) to affirm North America's commitment to climate action and the Paris Agreement. COP23 Special Advisor for States and Regions Governor Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, representing the U.S. Climate Alliance, met with Mexico's Undersecretary of Planning and Environmental Policy in the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources Rodolfo Lacy Tamayo and Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna at the Canadian delegation's office located directly across from the United States' office in COP23 's Bula Zone. Meeting participants discussed ongoing negotiations at COP23 and reaffirmed the commitment of Canada, Mexico and members of the U.S. Climate Alliance to climate action and further collaboration across North America. At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties issued the following joint statement: "Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 15 U.S. Governors, stand together in a strong commitment to combat climate change and support clean growth across North America. We recognize that a global climate challenge demands working together. "We agreed today to strengthen our climate initiatives through a new North American Climate Leadership Dialogue. We will share progress on these goals at the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit to be hosted by California this September. "Leaders decided that the Dialogue will address topics including clean transportation and zero-emission vehicles, vehicle efficiency, clean technology, supporting clean power while reducing reliance on coal-fired electricity, carbon pricing initiatives, and reducing short-lived climate pollutants." Governor Brown reaffirmed this commitment later, on a panel hosted by the Climate Action Reserve with representatives from Canada and Mexico, including Ontario Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Chris Ballard, British Columbia Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy George Heyman and Mexico's Undersecretary of Planning and Environmental Policy in the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources Rodolfo Lacy Tamayo. Earlier this year, Mexico and Canada joined the Under2 Coalition, the global pact of cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. Governor Brown started the day with keynote remarks at the largest United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) gathering of businesses, civil society, states and regions organized to detail climate action and commitments from non-state actors. Governor Brown then joined a panel discussion, including former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and moderated by former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres, focused on efforts to curb carbon pollution by U.S. states. Governor Brown then gave remarks ahead of a panel discussion hosted by Sustainable Energy for All, the Global Covenant of Mayors and the Partnership on Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport on how cities can deploy new technology and innovative policies to decarbonize and reduce emissions in the transportation and energy sectors. The Governor also previewed the Global Climate Action Summit, which California will host in San Francisco in September 2018. This event will showcase the surge of climate action around the world - and make the case that even more must be done. The Summit will also help strengthen the push for greater emissions reduction targets at COP 24 in December 2018. On his final day at COP23 tomorrow, Governor Brown will deliver the keynote address at a cap-and-trade forum organized by the People's Republic of China, speak at the UN Environment Programme's Sustainable Innovation Forum and the Zero-Emission Vehicle Alliance's ZEV Infrastructure Symposium, participate in a panel discussion hosted by the World Wildlife Foundation and join environment officials from the German Federal Government and Under2 Coalition co-founder Baden-Wurttemberg to welcome new Under2 Coalition members at a signing ceremony. Yesterday, in Bonn, Governor Brown rallied city, state and regional leaders at the ICLEI climate summit, the largest gathering on global subnational climate action at COP23 ; joined fellow Pacific Coast Collaborative governors on a panel to discuss West Coast climate action; gave keynote remarks at a clean energy forum hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency; discussed further collaboration on climate action with the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and with Germany's Secretary for Economic Affairs and Energy; and joined Senator Ricardo Lara to accept the UN Environment Programme's Climate and Clean Air Coalition award on behalf of California. Last week, in Bonn, Governor Brown joined fellow America's Pledge co-founder Michael Bloomberg to reaffirm the commitment of America's states, cities and businesses to the Paris Agreement and welcomed Virginia to the Under2 Coalition. In Oslo, Governor Brown met with Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and convened a first-of-its-kind meeting with representatives of the world's leading independent national academies of science to review climate impacts and discuss how scientists and policymakers can more effectively translate research findings into meaningful action. In Brussels, Governor Brown delivered opening remarks at a high-level conference on clean energy organized by the European Parliament and European Commission, met with the president of the European Parliament and the European Union's top representatives at COP23 , joined members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for an extensive discussion on opportunities for further collaboration on climate action, and highlighted California's local and global efforts to fight climate change at an event organized by the German Marshall Fund. In Stuttgart, the Governor met with Under2 Coalition co-founder Baden- Wurttemberg's Minister-President and delivered remarks before the state parliament. Governor Brown also delivered keynote remarks at a symposium on climate change hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican.

Nov 22, 2017( Mongabay News: HYPERLINK http://news.mongabay.com http://news.mongabay.com COP23 Most COPs, like COP23 , produce progress around the edges of climate mitigation and promises to talk again next year. Always next year. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.I remember well the vibrancy that December evening in 2015 when word spread on the last day of the 21st UN climate summit that there would be an agreement  the Paris Agreement. After two decades of staring at a known and worsening global crisis of epic proportions, leaders of 196 nations, pushed mercilessly by UN, French, and US negotiators, finally decided to not allow the earth to burn up[1] by 2100. The Eiffel Tower glowed with triumphant messages against a starry Paris sky. For the first time, nations voluntarily agreed to reduce their carbon emissions and slow the rate of deforestation. That moment in Paris felt historic, hopeful, perhaps the most significant agreement among world leaders for the greater good of this earth since World War II. Just two years later, as I stayed late on the last night of the 23rd UN climate summit in Bonn, Germany, I felt no such vibrancy and certainly no such history-making optimism. There was little. COP23 wasn't designed for major breakthroughs. Everyone conceded that. But why not? COP23 , while held in Bonn, Germany, was hosted for the first time by a Pacific island nation, Fiji. Developing and vulnerable nations wanted the logo to be true. The response they received? Maybe next year. Photo by Justin Catanoso. Bad and getting worseOnce again, 2017 promises to be another of the hottest years in the historical record. After three years of stable global greenhouse gas emissions, 2017 will see a spike in emissions[2] to record highs. How many hurricanes the ferocity of Harvey, Irma, and Maria must be experienced in the US alone to stoke a greater sense of urgency? How many climate refugees need to be pushed from sub-Saharan Africa and Syria because of unrelenting drought? How much more Arctic ice needs to melt? How much sea-level rise can be tolerated in low-lying island nations  and Miami Beach, for goodness sake  before COP participants stop delaying greater ambitions prior to 2020, when a stronger Paris Agreement is to take effect? Despite Trump's climate denial[3], the U.S. military labels the destabilizing impact of global climate change as the most serious national security threat facing the nation. Not immigration. Not terrorism. Not economic calamity. Climate change. So where's the incitement, now, to reduce carbon emissions beyond the modest Paris pledges, an absolute necessity if we are to contain temperature rise to 1.5 degree C by 2100, the Paris goal? Where are the billions in promised funding to help the victims of climate impacts adapt and recover their losses and damages? Nowhere yet in sight. COP23 was not without incremental accomplishments. There were many, most boldly a coalition of US cities, states, and businesses[4] pledging to do for climate mitigation what the Trump administration won't. Would a Hillary Clinton administration have done more? Hard to say. Trump's low-level State Department staffers pressed the common US goal of greater transparency and accountability in reporting climate action. Mostly, they provided cover for other developed nations to block progress on defining pathways to billions in financing adaptation and loss-and-damage funds. Under Obama, the wealthiest nation on earth committed just $3 billion to global climate-related funds and paid only $1 billion before Trump's election. Last month, the U.S. House approved $36.5 billion in recovery funds to Florida and Texas alone, far less than half of what's needed. So it's not likely that Clinton negotiators would have been more forthcoming on finance in Bonn.The world gathers again next December for COP24 in Katowice, Poland. Hard deadlines for the Paris rulebook, increased carbon-reduction pledges and clearer paths to adaptation and loss-and-damage financing are expected. Photo by Justin Catanoso. No one's top priorityIt doesn't help that the de facto leader of the free world, German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, can't form the coalition government she needs to lead her country and the EU. She told delegates at COP23 that Germany  despite its massive investment in wind energy  would not phase out coal by 2030 as promised, nor would it meet its carbon-reduction goals in the Paris agreement. Meanwhile, China is building more solar panels than the rest of the world combined. But it is paying billions in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to level carbon-sequestering rainforests for ranching and natural-resource extraction to help feed its population and manufacture the world's products. Nineteen nations agreed to phase out coal[5] by 2030, including Canada and the UK. But most were already close to doing so, and besides, they represent just three percent of the global coal burned for energy. Meanwhile, 1,600 coal-fired plants are planned or under construction[6] in 62 countries. When I interviewed Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, a Pacific island country threatened by sea-level rise, his comment, 'How can I tell my grandchildren that they may not have a country in 25 years,' nearly brought me to tears. Tong is at the mercy of G-20 leaders. He pleaded with them to act morally and humanely, not just geopolitically. Is that even possible? If I've learned anything from covering four consecutive climate summits, it's that Paris was something of an anomaly. Most COPs, like COP23 , produce progress around the edges of climate mitigation and promises to talk again next year. Always next year. Nearly everyone in Bonn believes that climate change represents an existential threat to human life on earth. But it's clear that, for political reasons both complex and expedient, taking broad, immediate climate action is not a top priority for any of the world's largest polluters  China, the US, India, the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia. Not even close. Until it is, another year passes as nature responds ever-more furiously to the lack of progress. Maybe next year, at COP24 in Poland, things will be different. Expectations are certainly different. The rulebook to govern the Paris Agreement must be completed. Nations must report how much more they will reduce carbon emissions. Billions in finance are expected to materialize or at least be identified. Scientists say the window for climate action to curb global warming is still open. Let's hope so. We are rapidly running out of next years. COP23 flags flying in a stiff breeze on the last day of the 23rd UN Climate Summit in Bon, Germany. Incremental progress was made by the 196 nations in attendance at the two-week conference, which was defined by a decided lack of urgency for bolder action by industrialized countries.

OLYMPIA, Wash., Nov. 13 -- Gov. Jay Inslee issued the following news release: Gov. Jay Inslee and other members of the Pacific Coast Collaborative, joined a panel discussion today in Bonn, Germany, focused on moving toward a clean energy economy. "The West Coast offers a blueprint: this is how you build a thriving, innovative economy that combats climate change and embraces a zero-emission future," Inslee said. "We know it's possible because we're doing it." This event was live-streamed on Twitter via Periscope from the @PCCleads Twitter account, and a link will remain on the PCC Twitter feed for viewing for 24 hours after the broadcast concludes. To follow the Pacific Coast Collaborative at COP23 , use the #PCCleads hashtag. The release from the Pacific Coast Collaborative is below. BONN, German (12. November, 2017)-Today at the COP23 global climate change talks in Bonn, Germany, U.S. West Coast governors from California, Oregon, and Washington joined in a panel discussion focused on their regional objective of phasing out fossil fuels and moving toward a vibrant, growing clean energy economy. The discussion highlighted the ways Pacific Coast states, in partnership with British Columbia, are leading the charge on climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown of California, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington spoke at today's event. These four governments are members of a regional partnership called the Pacific Coast Collaborative (PCC), which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonize the economy and build thriving sustainable communities through the adoption of clean energy policies, sharing of expertise and resources, and collective action. This collaborative represents the biggest, most advanced attempt to create a low-carbon future of any transboundary region in the world. With the Trump administration's retreat from the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan, the governors used the panel, titled "Leadership for 2050: Subnational Action with a Long-Term Vision," to discuss how they are moving forward in building a robust clean energy economy with or without federal leadership. The leaders detailed their collaborative efforts, in coordination with the private sector and other stakeholders, to reduce carbon pollution, integrate the region's power grid, develop an interstate electric vehicle charging network, combat ocean acidification, and encourage innovation and job growth. Since 2005, regional nominal gross domestic product has grown by 20 percent while total regionwide emissions have declined more than six percent. Public and private-sector cooperation is transforming key economic sectors, putting the region on a path toward reducing emissions 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Since passage of California's signature climate change and clean energy law, AB 32, in 2006, per capita emissions in the state dropped by 12 percent while GDP grew by over 20 percent, and the number of workers in the labor force jumped by nearly 9 percent. In 2015, Oregon's GDP was 30 percent higher than in 2005 while total statewide greenhouse gas emissions were down 6 percent. Washington's per capita GHG emissions decreased by 4.5 metric tons from 1990 to 2014. From 2007 to 2014, British Columbia's real GDP grew by over 12 percent while GHG emissions declined. Over 350,000 zero-emission and low-emission vehicles are on the roads in a fast-growing West Coast market. Across the region, sales rose an average of nearly 25 percent per year in the last three years. Through investment and policies like Renewable Portfolio Standards, power supplied by renewable energy, beyond hydroelectric, has increased more than 250 percent from 2005 to 2015, averaging around 14 percent growth every year. Quotes from Pacific Coast Collaborative governors follow: "The science is getting clearer, extreme weather events are getting more frequent and all of that leads to more understanding, more clarity and more action," said Gov. Edmund G. Brown, Jr. of California. "Residents on the Pacific Coast know these impacts firsthand - and we're not waiting to act." "We are pushing the envelope in the U.S. and Canada," said Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon. "Job by job, we are building an economy that safeguards public health and helps everyone prosper." "The West Coast offers a blueprint: this is how you build a thriving, innovative economy that combats climate change and embraces a zero-emission future," said Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state. "We know it's possible because we're doing it." This event was live-streamed on Twitter via Periscope from the @PCCleads Twitter account, and a link will remain on the PCC Twitter feed for viewing for 24 hours after the broadcast concludes. To follow the Pacific Coast Collaborative at COP23 , use the #PCCleads hashtag. The Pacific Coast Collaborative, representing the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia, was formed in 2008 when the leaders of the participating states and province agreed to work together on energy, climate, ocean health and other issues, as a region. The PCC is also collaborating with major cities along the West Coast to reduce carbon emissions and align building efficiency, transportation, renewable energy and organic waste systems. Together, we are building a thriving and innovative economy that fights climate change and benefits all residents by investing in clean energy, energy efficiency, and carbon pollution reduction. The PCC represents the world's fifth largest economy, a region of 55 million people with a combined GDP of $3 trillion. Their progress is detailed in this year's Report Card.

The world's nations got together in Bonn, Germany, for the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties (COP) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where nearly 200 countries and some 23, 000 delegates met to discuss and influence the negotiations over the rulebook of the Paris Agreement. The agreement, reached at the COP21 in Paris, brought 195 countries together to adopt the first-ever legally binding global agreement to deal with climate changes through mitigations and financial policies starting in the year 2020. This is why, COP23 Both nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and industry representatives lobbied at COP but not for the same things - businesses have become ever more involved in the UN climate process and this has led to some uncomfortable interactions between the two groups. A recently published report by Corporate Accountability International (CAI) found that energy industries are, in fact, some of the most powerful lobbyists at climate talks such as COP. "Big Polluters like oil, gas, coal, and agricultural transnational corporations (TNCs) are not only the largest emitters; their climate denial, lobbying, and policy interference make these industries one of the primary obstacles to sound climate policy at the local, national, and international levels," states the CAI report, Polluting Paris. For almost as long as the UNFCCC has existed, the same industries whose profits depend on the burning of oil, coal, and gas have been permitted to bankroll the UN climate talks, it elaborated. This has long been a contentious issue because it allows some of the corporations to write checks to bolster the COP Presidency's budget, provide services such as cars for delegates, or even build the negotiating halls where world leaders gather to address climate change. For instance, during COP17 in Durban, corporations were given a choice by the South African government to fund entertaining jazz concerts, fancy gala dinners, or a lounge. The British-South African mining giant, Anglo American, sponsored a number of keynote events, including the official opening ceremony and also co-hosted a cocktail rception hand in hand with the South African government, during which its chief executive warned that an energy future without coal is not an option. The football-stadium-turned-conference-center where the talks took place during COP19 in Warsaw was covered in corporate logos, including PGE and LOTOS, both majority state-owned coal and oil companies. Not only did the Polish government co-organize the "International Coal and Climate Summit" alongside the industry-funded World Coal Association, they also used their official COP19 website to push for oil drilling in the Arctic (which LOTOS is involved in). Poland will also host COP24 in 2018, when the guidelines and procedures for implementation of the Paris Agreement will be agreed upon. However, after years of pressure from advocates and civil society, a call for a conflict of interest policy that ensures that participants with interests at odds with the objectives of the UNFCCC to not be invited to participate was finally culminated at the climate change conference held ahead of this year's COP in Bonn in May. Yet when, Fiji, the first small-island developing country to preside over these climate talks, understandably so established a trust fund to raise US 26 million to help to finance this COP23 and was actively requesting financial support, numerous fossil fuel based corporations and developed countries wrote cheques. These include Fiji Airways, which then also sported the COP23 logo on one of its planes as well as Australia, Japan, the EU and even the US that has infamously decided to pull out of the Paris agreement and had reneged on its financial contributions to the UNFCCC or the Green Climate Fund, which aims to help countries like Fiji respond to climate change. "The dirtiest polluters have long used their sponsorship of climate talks as part of a PR strategy to pretend they are part of the solution," says Pascoe Sabido, Corporate Europe Observatory. "By sponsoring these talks, a Big Polluter can prop itself up as a legitimate actor, which in turn makes politicians more receptive to its deceptive lobbying" This, he adds, swings the door open even wider for Big Polluters to expand their influence over climate policy. Exxon Mobil, BP, and Chevron, for example, have all previously pledged their support for the Paris accord and even released statements to show their disagreement with Trump's decision to default from the agreement. But the fossil fuel industry has, in fact, known for decades that its products and practices were a danger to the planet - only 25 fossil fuel producers are responsible for over half of global emissions, according to a Carbon Majors Report. But the industry giants have secured a seat at the head of the international climate policymaking table, elaborates the CAI report. Since corporations are able to effectively buy their way into high-level events attended by world climate leaders, sponsorship itself often directly provides them with the lobbying prospects they need to undermine climate policy. At UNFCCC, these fossil fuel TNCs then exploit the climate crisis by hijacking the talks, stifling ambition, pushing false solutions, and blocking the financing (and therefore withholding the availability) of real solutions, according to the report. During COP23 The Ukrainian presenter of the proposal stated that "the Committee for the Future functions in between the global UNFCCC and national [climate plans and] allows direct participation of the corporates. US energy majors and other non-state actors will be brought to the UN table." In the lead-up to COP23 , the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, had struck an $80 million dollar deal to ship 700,000 tons of thermal coal to Ukraine by the end of the year. In fact, the Trump administration in the US is, perhaps, the most relevant example of how this industry -puppet-show plays out. "Who can doubt, for example, that the failure of the United States to secure domestic climate legislation, or ratify the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement, is largely the result of industry interference?" asks the CAI report. And it is not just the US, many of these UNFCCC-accredited organizations publicly declare support for the Paris Agreement and climate policy more broadly but an in-depth look at who constitute their board of directors and where their money goes shows otherwise. For example, the Business Council of Australia (BCA) member base is made up of 127 CEOs from Australia's largest and wealthiest corporations and BusinessEurope's membership and leadership also includes many polluting corporations yet both have aggressively obstructed climate policy initiatives for years. This in no way, undermines the role of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement - according to Corporate Accountability, without UNFCC, these Global North governments are left free to do what they want while the rest of the world, especially Global South countries, low-income communities, people of colour, women, and children continue to pay the price. World governments are again slated to take up the issue of conflicts of interest at the climate talks in May 2018. "Fossil fuels must be left in the ground and Big Polluters must be delinked from the climate talks. To do this, we must end the corporate capture of the UNFCCC," says Nnimmo Bassey, from Health of Mother Earth Foundation. The only way Parties to the UNFCCC, it seems, can develop and implement real solutions to climate change is if those working on behalf of Big Oil, Coal, Gas and other Big Polluters aren't allowed to weaken the guidelines world governments are currently developing for implementation of the Paris Agreement, \</doc>

The following information was released by the Sierra Club: Today, following weeks of momentum signaling the end of the coal era, the COP23 climate negotiations are coming to a close. Over the past few months, the European Beyond Coal Campaign launched, the largest-ever climate march in Germany kicked off the beginning of the climate negotiations, and we delivered more than 1.1 million signatures from Americans declaring that they are #StillIn the Paris Agreement. Perhaps the most visible setbacks for coal have been the U.S. passing the halfway mark of retiring its coal plants back in October, and just yesterday, 27 governments joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to call for an end to coal worldwide. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: "Even in the face of the climate-denying Trump administration, it is the unstoppable power of the people across the United States and the world that has continued to drive progress beyond coal -- from retiring half of the U.S. coal fleet to pushing governments to form the new Powering Past Coal Alliance. Coal and other fossil fuels have no place in our future, and the world will continue to move toward a clean and just energy economy. The Sierra Club is committed to doing our part to drive that progress and ensure this transition to clean energy leaves no one behind until the goal is met. "The Sierra Club applauds the government of Fiji for their leadership during these negotiations, and we challenge all governments to continue to step up to meet the ever-growing challenge of tackling the climate crisis. Following a year of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and storms, it's never been more evident that the world needs to make serious and swift strides to curb carbon emissions for the sake of families, communities, and the planet. Now is the time to act." \</doc>

The Centre for Science and Environment issued the following news release: The twenty-third meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to begin in Bonn from November 6 - under the shadow of the US pullout from the Paris Agreement. New Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says the US withdrawal should be seen as an opportunity for action, and not inaction. "Over the past 25 years, the US has been an obstruction to an ambitious climate deal. Today, we are in a state of climate crises, with the world reeling from a series of climate change-induced extreme weather events. The US withdrawal should be taken as an opportunity and a call for greater and more ambitious action, and not a call for inaction," said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of CSE and the head of its climate change programme. The Bonn meeting would be the first COP after the Trump administration-effected US pullout from the Paris Agreement. Even after the pullout, the US would continue to participate in the climate talks till 2020. "It is crucial to ensure that the US does not continue to keep the world hostage to its inaction. The rest of the world must come together to make sure the US does not obstruct or dilute the Agreement any further," added Bhushan. Bhushan was speaking at a pre- COP23 media briefing organised here today by CSE. At Bonn, Parties would negotiate the rules and guidelines for many provisions under the Paris Agreement, namely transparency framework, New Market Mechanism, facilitative dialogue (FD) and global stocktake (GST). While transparency framework (monitoring and reporting of climate actions and support) and New Market Mechanism (carbon markets) are expected to be built on and/or take the learnings of similar mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, FD and GST are meant to assess the progress of climate actions. Other key agenda actions include loss and damage, adaptation and finance. Finance has always been a bone of contention between developed and developing countries, with the rich countries failing to fulfill their mandate of providing finance and technology to the developing countries to address climate change. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), to support developing countries, needs to fulfill the mandate of US $100 billion by 2020. Parties also need to come up with clearly defined guidelines on how to report on adaptation actions domestically. At the end of the Summit, Parties must come up with a draft rule book to be finalised by 2018, as per the mandate. "It is crucial that the rule book for implementation of Paris Agreement be fair, effective, strong and equitable and under no circumstances should the global community allow the US to dilute the Paris Agreement further," said Vijeta Rattani, climate analyst, CSE. For a detailed update on what's on the agenda in COP23 , please refer to CSE's factsheet on Bonn - HYPERLINK http://www.cseindia.org www.cseindia.org / \~ HYPERLINK http://www.downtoearthindia.org.in www.downtoearthindia.org.in Climate impacts: rising and unprecedented According to recently published research, in 2016, CO2 concentration in the earth's atmosphere was 403 parts per million (ppm), the highest ever. 2016 was also the warmest year on record. The developing world has been the worst hit. In the list of top 10 countries representing the global vulnerability index, nine were from the developing world, indicating their limited capability and capacity to withstand climate fury. This year, India had a below-normal monsoon, with central India facing severe droughts. On an average, climate impacts cause a loss of about 1.5 per cent every year in the GDP in India. The South Asian floods in August this year in India, Nepal and Bangladesh left 1,200 dead. Developed countries have not been immune either -- in the US alone, 15 weather and climate disaster events in 2017 caused losses exceeding US $1 billion each. The UN Emissions Gap Report 2017 ( HYPERLINK http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/448716/the-emissions-gap-report-2017/ http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/448716/the-emissions-gap-report-2017/ ), which was released recently, warns that the emissions gap needs to be closed by 2030. If the world fails to do that, limiting the temperature rise to the 2 degree Celsius target, as endorsed in the Paris Agreement, seems highly unlikely. "Considering that the poor are the biggest sufferers of the impacts of climate change, it is ironical that issues central to developing countries such as adaptation, loss and damage and agriculture are highly marginalised at COP and fails to draw finance from developed countries. India, itself a victim of climate impacts, must shift its negotiating strategy to focus on real issues that affect its own people," said Rattani. Even though climate change requires global efforts, the burden of addressing climate change cannot continue to be on developing countries. "Urgent and ambitious climate action is needed but it needs to be equitable and other developed countries of G-20 must come forward and set a positive tone," said Chandra Bhushan.

BONN, Germany, Nov. 12 -- The United Nations World Health Organization issued the following news release: Today, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), WHO, in collaboration with the UN Climate Change secretariat and in partnership with the Fijian Presidency of the twenty-third Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ), has launched a special initiative to protect people living in Small Island Developing States from the heath impacts of climate change. The vision is that, by 2030, all Small Island Developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change and countries around the world will be reducing their carbon emissions both to protect the most vulnerable from climate risks and deliver large health benefits in carbon-emitting countries. The initiative has 4 main goals. First, to amplify the voices of health leaders in Small Island Developing States, so they have more impact at home and internationally. Second, to gather the evidence to support the business case for investment in climate change and health. Third, to promote policies that improve preparedness and prevention, including "climate proof" health systems. Fourth, to triple the levels of international financial support to climate and health in small island developing states. "People living in Small Island Developing States are on the frontline of extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increased risk of infectious disease," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. "We owe it to these people to do everything we can to help them prepare for the future that is already washing up on their shores." "We in Fiji know all too well that climate change poses a serious threat to the health of our people. I'm delighted that we are launching this initiative - in partnership with the WHO and UNFCCC - to better equip small island states like ours with the knowledge, resources and technology to increase the resilience of their health systems, as part of larger efforts to adapt to climate change," said Fijian Prime Minister and COP23 President Frank Bainimarama. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said: "Climate change will increasingly impact the health and well-being of people everywhere unless nations fully implement the Paris Agreement". "Small islands are in the frontline from extreme weather events that can contaminate drinking water to health-hazardous heatwaves and the spread of infectious diseases. This initiative can strengthen the response of small islands to the rising risks as the world works to ensure that together we keep a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees C and better, no higher than 1.5 degrees," she said. Small Island Developing States have long been recognized as especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Their situation is highlighted in the UNFCCC, by Ministers of Health at the 2008 World Health Assembly, and in the 2015 Paris Agreement. They have also pioneered innovative approaches to improve the resilience of their health systems to climate change. As well as emitting a small proportion of the greenhouse gases that are driving climate change, many are further reducing their already low carbon emissions. "Small Island Developing States are ready to take leadership towards green, resilient and health-promoting national development - but the support of the international community is essential," said Dr Joy St John, recently appointed Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health at WHO. "Less than 1.5% of international finance for climate change adaptation is allocated to projects which ensure that the health of all people is preserved, and only a fraction of this supports small island developing states. The recent severe weather events in the Caribbean demonstrate that targeted interventions are important. We need to do much more and we need to act very quickly." Country ownership is a central principle of this initiative. Ministers of health from some of the most affected countries have already started to provide input through consultation with WHO's Director-General and at WHO Regional Committee meetings, and this process will continue. Since 2015, WHO has been working with the UNFCCC secretariat to develop detailed country profiles to assess risks, and provide tailored advice on how these countries can adapt to, and mitigate, the health effects of climate change. More than 45 country profiles have already been completed and, as part of this initiative, WHO commits to publishing a country profile for all small island developing states by the end of 2018. Many national health actors, development and United Nations agencies are already making important contributions to protect health in small island developing states. WHO's initiative aims to bring together existing and new efforts and scale them up so they achieve maximum impact. "The vision is that, by 2030, all health systems in small island developing states will be able to withstand climate variability and change," adds Dr St John. "And, of course, that countries around the world will have substantially reduced carbon emissions."

Nov. 14--For more than a week, leaders from the around the world have been meeting at the COP23 talks in Bonn, Germany to discuss the progress that has been made on the Paris Climate Agreement. The U.S., which pulled out of the agreement earlier this year, was not invited. For a non-participant, however, Americans have been making a splash. Governors and mayors who support the goals of the climate agreement traveled to Germany to attend the COP23 conference, as did protesters, including some of the organizers of last year's Standing Rock protest camp. On Monday, the various protest actions demonstrated that division continues among the ranks of the environmentalists, showing that while they resist the Trump administration's pro-coal policies, they are far from unified in presenting alternative solutions. Activists were particularly incensed by a White House-sponsored panel that highlighted ways in which fossil fuels and nuclear energy could play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change. To many of the environmentalists, the theme was a thinly-veiled promotion of coal. More than 100 protesters disrupted the event with signs, singing, and chants, first preventing the panel from speaking before walking out of the talk en mass. "This event illustrates that our U.S. government is now run by fossil fuel billionaires who do not represent the values of the American people," said Garrett Blad, executive coordinator of SustainUS, a youth-led advocacy group for sustainable development. "We need to kick out corporate polluters and fossil fuel CEOs from our international institutions and from every single level of government back in the U.S. to ensure young people and those most impacted by climate change not only have seats at the table but are driving the agenda," he continued. The speakers invited by the White House failed to see why the topic was so controversial. "This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system," said White House energy aide George David Banks after the panel. He and the other speakers described how present technology is not sufficient to power the country without the use of fossil fuels. The panel was the only event planned by the White House at COP23 . For many of the environmentalists, the inclusion of any positive mentions of fossil fuels was an attempt to support the coal industry. And any attempt to speak favorably of fossil fuels was anathema. Over the weekend, California Governor Jerry Brown, who had come to speak on state efforts to meet the Paris goals, was interrupted by protesters who shouted "keep it in the ground," a reference to oil development in California. Brown, who has a record of promoting pro-carbon reduction policies, including a state-level cap and trade bill, grew increasingly frustrated with the hecklers, eventually snapping "Let's put you in the ground so we can get on with the show here." On the whole, the protest element was heavily represented at COP23 in Bonn on Monday. As the UN climate talks were underway, the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International was also meeting in the city. The WECAN conference highlighted female indigenous voices in the environmental movement. During the event, women from around the world spoke on the movement towards climate solutions and the need to include women's voices in this process. Among the speakers were Kathy Egland, a member of the NAACP board of directors, Isabella Zizi, a member of the native environmental group the Indigenous Environmental Network, and Nina Gualinga a Kichwa leader from the Pueblo of Sarayaku in Ecuador. They stressed the connection between colonization and environmental segregation, saying that native peoples had to resist any and all development of their lands and calling present American energy policy "environmental racism." "We have a plan for zero development on our land. Indigenous people are protecting forests, biodiversity globally. We're not here to negotiate we're here to protect life! Woman across the globe, now is our time to resist!" said Gualinga. While calls for bolder action came from a wide range of sources, the details of how to accomplish these emissions reductions remained sketchy. The protests showed that, for many environmentalists, half measures such as carbon mitigation or responsible energy development are unacceptable. The steps that countries will take to actually reduce carbon emissions are the subject of the formal discussions also occurring in Bonn. For the largely American group of protesters however, the details may be moot. Without a significant change in American policy, the Paris agreement will not effect the U.S. Follow Erin on Twitter. ___ (c)2017 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Ceres, a non-profit organization that is mobilizing many of the world's largest companies and investors to take stronger action on climate change, water scarcity and other global sustainability challenges, issued the following news release: The US government may have announced plans to pull out of the Paris Agreement but this has not derailed climate progress around the globe as investors, governments and other stakeholders look to ramp up their climate commitments at COP23 . "We are seeing remarkable progress and resolve around the globe by investors and companies on tackling climate change," said Mindy Lubber, CEO and president of the sustainability nonprofit organization Ceres. "Climate risk is a defining corporate challenge of the 21st century. Those that fail to take action will be putting their future at increased risk of failure and those that act will reap the rewards." Disclosure on how companies plan to transition their businesses to a low carbon environment is seen as key for investors to better plan their investment strategies. It has also been a fundamental part of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, announced in June 2017, which are focused on improving clarity and comparability of climate disclosures, across four corporate areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management; and; Metrics and Targets. "We believe the TCFD's robust framework provides an essential foundation for investors and others to better assess and effectively price climate-related risks and opportunities, so disclosure of this kind must become a routine part of annual corporate reporting practice," said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the IIGCC. "The recommendations make a great leap forward in standardizing climate-related financial disclosure and enabling investors to compare impacts across companies and sectors," added Mark Campanale, founder and executive director of Carbon Tracker. To showcase how investors, the finance sector and companies are working with each other and governments to ensure greater disclosure of climate-related financial information, a side event: Actions on Disclosure of Climate Risks and Opportunities, will be held on at COP23 on 15 November. The event will include two panel discussions with experts from the finance and business sectors. The event is being organised by AIGCC, Carbon Tracker, CDP, Ceres, IGCC, IIGCC, PRI, and UNEP FI. "The TCFD recommendations represent an important milestone in the recognition of climate change--which our signatories have identified as their biggest concern--as a systemic financial risk. This is why, beginning in 2018, the PRI will start to align its reporting framework to the recommendations," said managing director, Fiona Reynolds. "The TCFD recommendations are already helping Australasian investors understand how the effects of climate change and the market response will impact portfolios and to identify investment solutions to build resilience and generate low carbon returns", said Emma Herd, Chief Executive Officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change. A hallmark of the TCFD's disclosure framework is the recommendation that organisations provide climate-related financial disclosures in their main annual financial filings, and that companies determine materiality for climate-related issues consistent with how they determine the materiality of other information included in their filings. "As a result of increasing levels of investor support for climate disclosure more than 6,200 companies have disclosed their climate performance through CDP this year. The TCFD recommendations will help further strengthen and scale disclosure and ensure we close the loop on climate risk in capital markets." noted Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP. "Investors in Asia are beginning to realise the material risks of ESG issues, particularly climate change, to their portfolios, so the recommendations provide essential guidance on what they should be asking from the companies in which they invest," said Rebecca Mikula-Wright, Director of the AIGCC. "The TCFD framework - through its emphasis on forward-looking assessments and scenario analysis - has the potential to get corporate and financial organisations to more fully understand - and disclose - the climate-related risks and opportunities they face. At UNEP FI, we will support our members in adopting the recommendations and help accelerate TCFD disclosure practice in the financial industry." explained Eric Usher, Head UNEP FI.

The Commonwealth, an association that aims to promote democracy, rule of law, human rights, good governance and social and economic development, issued the following news release: A new online resource that supports climate change law-making is to be unveiled at COP23 in Bonn this week. The Law and Climate Change Toolkit is aimed at government policy makers responsible for developing laws that help implement the Paris Agreement. Three organisations have collaborated on the project, namely the Commonwealth Secretariat's Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and UN Environment. Steven Malby, who heads up the Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform at the Commonwealth, said it will provide countries with a comprehensive source of knowledge on climate legislation. "It is a much-needed resource for countries to review their national laws and undertake reform in support of their climate policy commitments under the Paris Agreement," Mr Malby said. The Paris Agreement requires all of its 145 parties to put forward their best efforts in climate action through nationally determined contributions (NDCs) based around emissions. NDCs will be deciding factors as to whether the world achieves the goals agreed in Paris: to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degree C, to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degree C, and to achieve net zero emissions in the second half of this century. Momentum for the toolkit started with the 2015 Commonwealth leaders' statement on climate action, which underlined the importance of 'practical and swift action' to reinforce the outcomes of the Paris climate conference. Then at their meeting in October last year, senior officials of Commonwealth law ministries supported the production of a toolkit of national laws and good practice. In December 2016, the Commonwealth Secretariat hosted a workshop with a wide range of international organisations and partners to examine how a toolkit could be developed. This year, the Secretariat has collaborated closely with UNFCCC and UN Environment to develop a pilot version of the toolkit. Four Commonwealth countries, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Jamaica, and Vanuatu, participated in a consultation process. The pilot version will consist of an online database of laws in two areas, namely overarching climate change laws and energy laws. The provisions of these laws are classified and tagged at article level, which means that the toolkit enables the user to search very precisely for specific legal approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The toolkit contains a sequence of review questions that support policy makers in identifying possible gaps in their national laws. Where possible gaps are identified, the toolkit suggests legislative options from other countries that could help. Relevant contextual country information is also contained in the toolkit in order to support tailoring of legislative options to individual country needs. Looking beyond the COP23 launch, additional modules will be added to the toolkit in other thematic legal areas - including transport, planning, water, health, land use and forestry and disaster risk management. The toolkit will be showcased at a side event hosted by UNFCCC, UN Environment and the Commonwealth Secretariat on Wednesday, November 8, and at an expert roundtable at 'Climate Law and Governance Day' on Friday, November 10. On both occasions, staff from the Commonwealth Secretariat will speak or chair. This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 7, 2017.

Nov 14, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com Today, the conference boasts a near-universal membership of 196 countries, carrying forward the mission of addressing leading climate issues facing the world. At COP 21, all of the nations in attendance came together to sign the famous\~Paris Climate Agreement[3]\~to combat climate change. Though the recent major news has been the United States withdrawal of the agreement in 2020,\~the United Nation's chief climate negotiator[4]\~Christina Figueres believes the withdrawal has 'shored up the world's resolve on climate action, and for that we can all be grateful.' The private sector must take a larger stand to work with the world's organizations, both public and private, to commit to addressing the issues of climate change. This is where forums like COP shine. The conference brings together representatives from countries and private industry to find real solutions. Leaders from Ingersoll Rand have participated for 10 years. We engage with delegates to ensure country-level delegates have access to the latest information on next-generation technologies and solutions can help them achieve their GHG reduction targets. In 2014 we made a public\~Climate Commitment[5]\~to increase our energy efficiency and minimize our GHG emissions, and we take that commitment just as seriously now as we did then. We've already\~made great progress on our commitments[6], avoiding approximately 6.7 million metric tons of CO2e, equivalent to the emissions from nearly 700,000 homes' electricity use for one year. Our efforts reflect the wider initiatives of the private sector to make a greater push towards sustainability, and our successes demonstrate the difference individual organizations can make. Ingersoll Rand was the first industrial company to acknowledge climate risk in our 10-K filing, and we've confirmed plans to re-engineer products for a resource constrained world. We've also introduced our\~EcoWise portfolio[7]: our industry-leading product portfolio that meets customer requirements for energy efficiency while reducing climate and environmental impacts at a significantly improved performance level than alternatives - both our competitors' products and our legacy products. However, no matter the size of the company, organizations can take many climate-friendly actions. For example, buildings are responsible for approximately 40 percent of GHG emissions in mature parts of the world, and as much as 80 percent in some developing markets, with heating and cooling accounting for 40 percent of a building's GHG emissions. That means that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) alone is responsible for somewhere between 16-32 percent of all global GHG emissions. So, imagine if we cut that number in half - that's what we did in our Climate Commitment - a 50 percent reduction in our HVAC product portfolio. Now, imagine if other companies, in other industries like automotive or food production, did the same thing -- half a dozen leading companies could change the world by changing the conversation for their industry. As COP 23 gets underway, it is important for the private sector to share insights, learnings and solutions for addressing global environmental issues as well as reflect on how to increase sustainability efforts. The more we magnify this conversation, the sooner we can gain acceptance of climate-friendly actions that will not only have a lasting, positive impact on business, but also change the world.\~Tweet me: KEYWORDS: Energy, Energy Efficiency, Ingersoll Rand [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Ingersoll-Rand http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Ingersoll-Rand [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6383.php http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6383.php [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the-cop23-climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-matters https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the- HYPERLINK cop23 -climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-matters [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://ir.ingersollrand.com/investors/press-releases-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2014/Ingersoll-Rand-to-Cut-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-in-Half-by-2020-Invests-500-Million-in-Energy-Efficiency-to-Address-Climate-Change/default.aspx http://ir.ingersollrand.com/investors/press-releases-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2014/Ingersoll-Rand-to-Cut-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-in-Half-by-2020-Invests-500-Million-in-Energy-Efficiency-to-Address-Climate-Change/default.aspx [ 6]: \~ http://www.ingersollrand.com/sustainabilitysupplement/messages_from_leadership/ http://www.ingersollrand.com/sustainabilitysupplement/messages_from_leadership/ [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK https://company.ingersollrand.com/strengths/sustainability/our-climate-commitment/ecowise.html https://company.ingersollrand.com/strengths/sustainability/our-climate-commitment/ecowise.html \</doc>

Nov 20, 2017( Phil's Stock World: HYPERLINK http://www.philstockworld.com http://www.philstockworld.com COP 23 : three ways cities are leading the fight against climate change Courtesy of\~Barbara Norman[1],\~University of Warwick[2] Mettus / Shutterstock.com[3] The global population is predicted to rise to 10 billion by 2050[4], and the majority of those people will live in cities. Given that cities already account for[5] 75% of the world's energy use and 76% of carbon dioxide emissions, there's a growing focus on how urban planning and design can reduce emissions and help humanity to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Representatives of the world's global powers have gathered in Bonn to attend the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change - more pithily known as COP 23 . Working together to affect large-scale change has been the key message of the conference. There has been a groundswell of urban innovation on show[6], largely driven by the mayors and governors of cities and regions, as well as industry leaders and universities interested in promoting opportunities for greener growth. These bodies have formed alliances and networks to develop ideas and strategies around smart mobility, renewable energy, living infrastructure and sustainable urban design. This has been the good news story of COP 23 . The conference has given nation states a unique opportunity to work more closely with cities, to plan for climate change. So, in my role as an urban and regional planner (in practice and academia) I spent some time in Bonn finding out about the exciting ways that cities are leading the fight against climate change. 1. Low-carbon precincts One aim is for current and future cities to be powered by 100% renewable electricity. This can be achieved with a combination of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar or hydro, with battery storage and microgrids integrating with national grids as needed. Location, location, location. Marcin Wichary/Flickr[7], CC BY[8] Cities will have integrated transport systems with electric-powered light rail and personal vehicles, while promoting active travel such as walking and cycling. Designing for integrated green precincts will bring greater benefits for local communities than one green building at a time. For example, community recycling and solar programs are more feasible on a larger precinct scale. Of course, there are challenges to overcome. Finding appropriate locations for renewable energy farms that are also acceptable to the local people requires careful consideration of design guidelines and community engagement in the decision-making process. The ICLEI 100% Renewable Cities Network[9] is a prime example of the work being done to achieve this, by connecting cities to share knowledge and support each other. The network includes cities such as Canberra, the Australian capital, which is on track to achieve[10] its target of 100% renewable electricity by 2020. 2. Living infrastructure Cities across the world are increasingly incorporating living infrastructure[11], to deliver social, environmental and economic services to urban communities. This is done by integrating trees, shrubs, grass and open spaces (green infrastructure); rainscapes and waterways (blue infrastructure); and soils, surface and man-made structures (grey infrastructure) into the fabric of the city. Nanning, China: a roof with a view. Shuang Li / Shutterstock.com[12] In China's 'sponge cities[13]', rooftop gardens help to capture storm water and regulate the temperature of the building. Copenhagen's cloudburst plan[14] rethinks the way water flows through the city by installing channels above and beneath the surface to prevent flooding. And water sensitive urban design[15] is being put to use in drier cities, to make efficient use of everything from rainwater to waste water. Living infrastructure also offers nature-based solutions[16] for coastal cities under increasing threat from rising sea levels and more extreme coastal storms. For instance, replanting mangroves and coastal vegetation provides softer barriers between land and sea, while restoring natural waterways by removing dams and man-made canal systems can reduce the urban heat island effect[17] and mitigate its negative impacts on human health. 3. Urban networks Urban networks make use of digital connectivity and the internet of things to help cities far and wide work toward global goals: think everything from integrated green transport systems, to big data for improving resource efficiency, to innovative platforms for exchanging knowledge and practices between cities, towns and villages. Organisations such as the C40, ICLEI and the Global Covenant of Mayors are already helping to coordinate action between city leaders - and at COP 23 the Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders adopted the Bonn Fiji Commitment[18] to deliver the Paris Agreement at all levels. Built environment professionals from around the world are also joining the groundswell of urban action, launching the Planners for Climate Action[19] group this week at COP 23 . It's also critical that the people making decisions in cities can connect with researchers who are gathering evidence in this area. Two global examples I am actively involved with are the Urban Climate Change Research Network[20] led by Columbia University, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network[21] led by Professor Jeffrey Sachs. Making it happen Sustainable solutions such as these need green financing mechanisms and support from national governments if they are to deliver real outcomes on the ground. At COP 23 , the World Bank unveiled a new programme[22] designed to provide cities with a vehicle to raise necessary funding and investment, in partnership with private enterprise. In one of the conference's key finance sessions, the former leader of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres, stressed that green finance will be the key to urban change, with a current industry target of $US1 trillion[23], and more in green bonds by 2020[24]. Nation states now have a responsibility to enable this wave of urban innovation to move forward. Despite the growing power[25] of city and regional governments, national urban policies still play a central role[26] in carrying out international agendas such as the New Urban Agenda[27], the Sustainable Development Goals[28] and the Paris Agreement. While a few states may choose to ignore international agreements[29], this groundswell of collaborative action across businesses, governments and communities is sending a strong message that national governments would be wise to heed. Embracing and investing in urban transformation that improves the health of people and the planet is clearly a winning strategy.

BusinessEurope issued the following news release: Negotiators from almost 200 countries managed to make some steps in the right direction during their two-week meeting at the annual climate change conference in Bonn ( COP23 ). BusinessEurope Director General Markus J. Beyrer commented: "This rulebook is crucial for more transparency and it's a positive signal that efforts to give shape to global carbon markets will now be intensified. We however expected more, and during last week's negotiations it seemed that some nations at the table were wilfully trying to slow down the process here. Business is in desperate need for more certainty and stays fully committed to implement the Paris Agreement. At the same time, we are delighted with the continued support that both developed and developing nations show to keep a strong involvement of business and other stakeholders in the process. Many recognise that without this involvement, the Paris Agreement can never be successfully implemented." This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California Gov. Jerry Brown was named Tuesday as a special envoy to states at the next United Nations Climate Change Conference , further elevating his international profile as a leader on the issue as President Donald Trump backs away from a key international agreement. The announcement of Browns role at the November conference in Bonn, Germany, by Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama comes on the heels of the governors meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks to discuss climate change. I will lean on Gov. Brown to continue to bring the great leadership he has demonstrated time and time again, and to mobilize a strong contingent of like-minded leaders from around the world, to show the world that we mean business, Bainimarama said during a news conference at the historic governors mansion in Sacramento. The four-term governor has made reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting green technology a key tenet of his administration. Hes launched non-binding climate change pacts, including the newly formed U.S. Climate Alliance of states committed to upholding the carbon reductions goals in the Paris climate agreement, from which Trump plans to withdraw. Bainimarama on Tuesday joined Fiji in the Under2 Coalition, a pact among cities, states and countries that Brown helped launch in 2015 aimed at keeping the rise of global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius. Bainimarama praised U.S. states commitment to upholding the Paris agreements. He noted Trumps choice to withdraw could bring fireworks to the U.N. conference, known as COP 23 . I think the withdrawal of the White House is going to make COP 23 very exciting, he said. Brown wont be the only governor potentially playing an outsize role at the conference. Fellow West Coast Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington, who also traveled to Sacramento on Tuesday, both plan to attend with other governors in the states Climate Alliance. Were going to play a very important role, Jerry Brown said. The state agreement is a non-binding commitment to uphold the Paris goals, which include reducing the countrys emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels. Many of the 13 states involved already have their own targets in place, and the goal of the coalition is to collaborate and share ideas on using green technology and other means to meet the goal. When the president decided to run up the white flag of surrender to the challenge of climate change, we jumped right into the barricades, Inslee said. \</doc>

Nov 28, 2017( Coyote Gulch: http://coyotegulch.net/Delivered by Newstex) \~ HYPERLINK https://coyotegulch.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/xcop23head-png-pagespeed-ic-egq685xwjc.jpg https://coyotegulch.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/xcop23head-png-pagespeed-ic-egq685xwjc.jpg Click here[1] to read the article. Here's an excerpt: Two US delegations After Trump's decision in June that he wanted to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, all eyes were on the US official delegation to see how they would navigate the negotiations. During the first week of the talks, a civil society group known as the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance called for the US delegation to be barred from attending the negotiations, due to its decision to leave the Paris deal. Meanwhile, a seemingly pointed message was sent on day two of the COP, when Syria announced it would sign the Paris Agreement. This now leaves the US as the only country in the world stating it doesn't intend to honour the landmark deal. However, the delegation itself kept a relatively low profile - bar a now infamous 'cleaner fossil fuels' side event which anti-Trump protesters disrupted for seven minutes, singing: 'We proudly stand up until you keep it in the ground'). The US delegation co-chaired a working group with China on Nationally Determined Contributions (country pledges, often known by the acronym NDCs) with reportedly high success. It's worth noting, though, that many of the US negotiators are the same officials who have been representing the US at COPs for years. They seemingly continued their negotiations with little change in attitude, albeit possibly taking harder stances on issues such as 'loss and damage' and finance. There was a further chaotic appearance in the media centre by Trump adviser George David Banks, who vowed that his priority at COP23 was to fight 'differentiation' (sometimes called 'bifurcation'), namely, the division of countries into industrialised £nnex one' countries and the rest in the UN climate arena. However, beyond this, the behaviour of the US delegation did not differ significantly from previous years. Importantly, though, the official US delegation were not the only group from the US drawing attention at the COP. An alternative 'We Are Still In' delegation set up a large pavilion at their US Climate Action Centre just outside the main venue for the talks. This group included major sub-national actors, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California governor Jerry Brown, keen to prove there are many US voices against Trump's anti-climate policies. Their 'America's Pledge' report outlined how their coalition of cities, states and businesses represented over half the US economy. At the report's packed launch event, Bloomberg even argued the group should should be given a seat at the climate negotiating table.

The World Coal Association issued the following news release: The World coal Association (WCA) has been involved in international climate discussions since their inception more than two decades ago. As the WCA prepares to attend another important meeting - the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) - we look at priorities for the event in Bonn and how the conference plans to engage with the 24 countries that have included low emissions coal technologies in their climate pledges. More than 20,000 people are expected at this year's COP, which starts today. Some people ask why the WCA attends climate talks. WCA believes that for many countries that use coal, especially in emerging Asia, the only realistic pathway is to make sure that they use the most modern coal technologies available today, with enhanced ambition on CCS. Many countries have identified high efficiency low emissions (HELE) technologies as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement. Developing and emerging economies have to meet their energy needs, tackle energy poverty, and reduce emissions. They cannot do all three things without utilising all low emission technologies. China is a remarkable example of the role that affordable coal can play in improving access to energy and supporting economic development. Over the last three decades, according to the World Bank, China has achieved universal access to electricity - 600 million people have been lifted out of poverty and connected to the electricity grid. The link between access to affordable power from coal, economic growth and prosperity is clear. China is also working towards having the world's cleanest coal power system by 2020 by utilising advanced cleaner coal technologies. Another example is India which has made significant deployments of solar power but continues to rely on coal for baseload electricity. The 24 countries that have included HELE in their agreements don't want to sacrifice economic development or their climate obligations. They want to achieve both. Energy security and climate objectives are competing, but integrated priorities. WCA will also be supporting greater action on CCS as well as policy parity with other low emission technologies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made it clear that it is almost impossible, and far more expensive, to reach the below 2 degrees target without significantly scaling up CCS technologies worldwide. WCA would like to see practical solutions to reduce global emissions. Solutions that recognise countries' individual circumstances. Developing economies should be heard at these talks. They are at a point where economic growth is imperative, alongside climate objectives. They need a solution that enables them to achieve both. A solution the WCA believes lies in technology. So at the Bonn talks, WCA will continue to call for policy parity for all low-emissions technologies and also ask for technology neutrality in the Paris Agreement's 'rulebook'. Countries must also be supported in implementing all aspects of their Paris Agreement commitments, including those relating to low emissions coal technologies. This is the only practical approach to reaching our common climate goals.

The following information was released by the Heartland Institute: By Tom Harris, Timothy Ball United Nations Climate Change Conference Throughout the United Nations Climate Change Conference wrapping up in Bonn, Germany this week, the world has been inundated with the usual avalanche of manmade global warming alarmism. The UN expects us to believe that extreme weather, shrinking sea ice, and sea level rise will soon become much worse if we do not quickly phase out our use of fossil fuels that provide over 80% of the world's energy. There is essentially nothing to support these alarms, of course. We simply do not have adequate observational data required to know or understand what has happened over the past century and a half. Meaningful forecasts of future climate conditions are therefore impossible. Nevertheless, this year's session has been especially intense, since the meeting is being chaired by the island nation of Fiji, a government that has taken climate change fears to extremes. COP23 (the 23rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties on climate change) conference president, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, has called for "an absolute dedication to meet the 1.5-degree target." This is the arbitrary and most stringent goal suggested by the Paris Agreement. In support of Bainimarama's position, the COP23 /Fiji Website repeatedly cites frightening forecasts made by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). One prediction stated: "The IPCC recently reported that temperatures will significantly increase in the Sahel and Southern African regions, rainfall will significantly decrease, and tropical storms will become more frequent and intense, with a projected 20 per cent increase in cyclone activity." To make such dire forecasts, the IPCC relies on computerized models built on data and formulas to represent atmospheric conditions, and reflect the hypothesis that carbon dioxide is the principal factor driving planetary warming and climate change. However, we still do not have a comprehensive, workable "theory of climate," and thus do not have valid formulas to properly represent how the atmosphere functions. We also lack data to properly understand what weather was like over most of the planet even in the recent past. Without a good understanding of past weather conditions, we have no way to know the history, or the future, of average weather conditions what we call the climate. An important data set used by the computer models cited by the IPCC is the "HadCRUT4" global average temperature history for the past 167 years. This was produced by the Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, both based in the United Kingdom. Until the 1960s, HadCRUT4 temperature data were collected using mercury thermometers located at weather stations situated mostly in the United States, Japan, the UK, and eastern Australia. Most of the rest of the planet had very few temperature sensing stations, and none of the Earth's oceans (which cover 70% of the planet) had more than occasional stations separated from the next ones by thousands of kilometers of no data. Temperatures over these vast empty areas were simply "guesstimated." Making matters even worse, data collected at weather stations in this sparse grid had, at best, an accuracy of +/-0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees F), and oftentimes no better than +/-1.0 degree C. Averaging such poor data in an attempt to determine past or future global conditions cannot yield anything meaningful and certainly nothing accurate or valid enough to use in making critical energy policy decisions. Modern weather station surface temperature data are now collected using precision thermocouples. But, starting in the 1970s, less and less ground surface temperature data was used for plots such as HadCRUT4. Initially, this was done because governments believed satellite monitoring could take over from most of the ground surface data collection. However, the satellites did not show the warming that climate activists and computer models had forecast. So, bureaucrats closed many of the colder rural surface temperature sensing stations, while many stations in the vast frigid area of Siberia were closed for economic and other reasons. The net result was that cold temperature data disappeared from more recent records thereby creating artificial warming trends, the very warming that alarmists predicted, desired and needed for political purposes. Today, we have virtually no data for approximately 85% of the Earth's surface. Indeed, there are fewer weather stations in operation now than there were in 1960. That means HadCRUT4 and other surface temperature computations after about 1980 are meaningless. Combining this with the sensitivity (accuracy) problems in the early data, and the fact that we have almost no long-term data above Earth's surface, the conclusion is unavoidable: It is not possible to know how or whether Earth's climate has varied over the past century and a half. The data are therefore useless for input to the computer models that form the basis of the IPCC's conclusions. Many people think the planet is adequately covered by satellite observations data that is almost global 24/7 coverage and far more accurate than anything determined at weather stations. But the satellites are unable to collect data from the north and south poles, regions that are touted as critical to understanding global warming. Moreover, space-based temperature data collection did not start until 1979, and 30 years of weather data is required to generate a single data point on a climate graph. The satellite record is far too short to allow us to come to any useful conclusions about climate change. In fact, there is insufficient data of any kind temperature, land and sea ice, glaciers, sea level, extreme weather, ocean pH, et cetera to be able to determine how today's climate differs from the past, much less predict the future. The IPCC's climate forecasts have no connection with the real world. Sherlock Holmes warned that "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts." Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this famous quote for fiction, of course. But it applies perfectly to today's global warming debate, especially where the IPCC's scary conclusions and forecasts are involved. Of course, this will not stop Bainimarama and other conference leaders from citing IPCC "science" in support of their warnings of future climate catastrophe. We should use these facts to spotlight and embarrass them every time. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): Han Chen In the same week Trump Administration officials tried to convince negotiators at the global COP23 climate conference that more coal use was needed, a global alliance of over two dozen countries, provinces, states and cities has formed to declare a phase-out of coal. Talk about a mic drop. This global Powering Past Coal Alliance was launched just three days after a much-ridiculed event hosted by the Trump Administration touting fossil fuels which many observers noted was a mockery of real efforts to deal with climate change. As former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg noted, the Administration's actions were like showing up to a cancer summit to promote tobacco. (Not surprisingly, US and international participants at the Trump Administration's pro-coal session staged a song and walkout in protest of the event on Monday.) And only three days after that event and walkout, the United Kingdom and Canada were joined by dozens of new partners in the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The countries, provinces, states and cities who joined include Alberta, Angola, Austria, Belgium, British Columbia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, Fiji, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niue, Ontario, Oregon, Portugal, Quebec, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Vancouver, and Washington The Alliance noted the negative health effects of air pollution from burning coal, such as respiratory diseases and premature deaths, which have massive costs in both human and economic terms. The Alliance also noted that 800,000 people die each year around the world from the pollution generated by burning coal as important reasons to work towards a global coal phase-out. The signatories committed to phasing out coal power that produces carbon emissions and supporting clean power policies and investments, while restricting financing for coal plants. To achieve these goals, the participants will share real-world examples and best practices on how to phase-out of coal, scale up climate financing, and develop clean energy plans and targets. There are many lessons which can be shared. For instance, the UK has transitioned from getting 40 percent of its electricity from coal in 2012 to getting only 2 percent of its electricity from coal in July 2017. That's a massive decrease in the span of only five years. In fact, in April 2017 the UK had its first full day without coal use in 135 years. So what's next? The Alliance hopes to expand from 25 to 50 partners by the COP24 climate conference next year. The US states of Oregon and Washington have already joined the alliance. With several other states in the U.S. already coal-free, having leaders of other U.S. states join this alliance could be a vital opportunity for us to demonstrate that Americans are "still in" the Paris Agreement, despite President Trump's attempt to dismantle US climate policies. \</doc>

BRUSSELS, Belgium, Nov. 10 -- The European Union's European Investment Bank issued the following press release: At the COP 23 climate summit Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP 23 , today welcomed new support from the European Investment Bank to better protect water infrastructure against extreme weather events in Fiji. The new long-term EIB loan to support investment by the Water Authority of Fiji signed at COP 23 earlier today represents the EIB's largest ever loan in the Pacific and largest ever support for water investment in a small island state by the world's largest water financier. The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, will provide USD 75 million for a new USD 405 million investment programme by the Water Authority of Fiji. The scheme will strengthen resilience of water distribution and wastewater treatment following Cyclone Winston, the world's second strongest storm ever recorded, that hit Fiji in February 2016. In the presence of Prime Minister Bainimarama, and climate leaders from around the world, the 20 year EIB loan was formally signed at the EIB Pavilion at COP23 by the Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Public Enterprises, Civil Service and Communications of the Republic of Fiji and Ambroise Fayolle, Vice President of the European Investment Bank responsible for development and lending operations in the Pacific. "This welcome financing will be used with funding from the Green Climate Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the Fijian Government. A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately USD 400 million, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight. Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people," said Frank Bainimarama Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23 . More than 275,000 people living around the capital city of Suva will benefit from the new EIB-financed water investment that will both help to improve current service levels and reduce leakages and enable quicker resumption of water supply following cyclones. The scheme includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, as well as improving and expanding water networks. Once complete, the scheme is expected to support a number of sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth. The new water investment is also financed by the Government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund. It follows extensive due diligence by the Asian Development Bank and represents the first EIB co-financing with the Green Climate Fund. Ahead of the signing ceremony the EIB hosted a workshop to outline practical experience gained from three water projects around the world to enhance climate resilience. Priyaraj Lakmal Munasinghe, CEO of the Water Authority of Fiji and representatives of the Lilongwe Water Board in Malawi and the EUR 5 billion Emscher River renovation project highlighted key issues to consider and discussed how to overcome practical challenges with climate experts at COP 23 . Small islands are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Discover in this interactive map how the European Investment Bank is helping them adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. Background information: The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, is committed to supporting implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and backing climate-related investment around the world. The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020.

The following information was released by the William J. Clinton Foundation: By Alexis Tubb, Project Manager, Clinton Climate Initiative [Editors Note: This post is part of a recurring series of perspectives on the impact of our work by staff and partners of the Clinton Foundation.] For the past week, Ive been in Bonn, Germany for the United Nations most important climate change conference of the year&#8202;&#8202; COP23 . Todays emphasis at the meeting is on gender inclusion, and as a woman in the clean energy space, Im feeling a sense of empowerment Ive never experienced before. Im also feeling a renewed urgency. Fresh in the minds of COP23 participants are the back-to-back hurricanes that pummeled the Caribbean in a span of two weeks and the fact that global warming leads to more extreme weather events. In the wake of the devastation left behind by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, theres a growing resolve to set the world on a path towards reducing our warming impact on climate vulnerable countries&#8202;&#8202;especially island nations. This critical need has led many at COP23 to ask how can we accelerate renewable energy development. While several ideas have been put forth this week, one in particular resonates strongly: Involve more women. Women working in the energy sector hold disproportionately fewer leadership positions globally: Women hold 24 percent of senior management roles globally and only 14 percent of senior management positions at the top 200 worldwide power and utility companies. We at the Clinton Climate Initiatives Islands Energy Program, which is helping island nations transition to renewable energy, have found women to be key drivers of clean energy efforts. To ensure that the clean energy sector develops the most innovate solutions to climate change possible, we need a greater diversity of perspectives&#8202;&#8202;including the perspectives of women&#8202;&#8202;at the highest levels of leadership. Our team has seen many women managing key processes of clean energy projects in the island nations we work, yet are not recognized with the formal leadership roles they need in order to deliver greatest impact. Women represent an untapped talent that could&#8202;&#8202;if harnessed&#8202;&#8202;accelerate clean energy development. The absence of women at the top isnt only an injustice. Its a climate change risk. In February 2016, the Clinton Climate Initiative founded the first network of its kind to empower rising women leaders working in island energy sectors&#8202;&#8202;the Women in Renewable Energy Network (WIRE Network). The WIRE Network provides a common platform for women working in islands to support and mentor each other. It also offers technical and leadership skills development opportunities for women looking to propel their careers faster and further. In its first year, the WIRE Network grew to over 350 members, and several of the WIRE Networks mentoring program participants received promotions that they directly attributed to their growth through participating in the network. Motivated by their mentors, Jamaican Transmission and Distribution Engineer Tanya Hylton earned her Project Management Professional certification, a license needed to advance her career, and Hannah Olmberg-Soesman recently became Chief Executive Officer of a solar company and led an all-woman solar energy installation in rural Suriname. The WIRE Network is not alone in recognizing gender inclusion as an imperative, and at COP23 41 organizations have united together under the common belief that empowering women is key to transitioning to clean energy. This coalition is launching the Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) People-Centered Accelerator, bringing together a group of like-minded partners who are committed to seeing the full and equal participation of women, from CEOs to rural farmers, in promoting clean energy efforts globally. SEforALL works directly with the United Nations to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and they see women as key to achieving this objective. Its also critical to advancing UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 on Access to Energy, which aims to engage all people&#8202;&#8202;both men and women&#8202;&#8202;to achieve access to sustainable and reliable energy for all. As we celebrate COP23s Gender Day, we&#8202;&#8202;all 41 organizations&#8202;&#8202;recognize that we can only achieve our climate change interventions with the full participation of women. We commit to empowering women, and thereby safeguarding our planet. \</doc>

Oxford: The Department of Oxfam International has issued the following news release: Communities hit by climate-related disasters may have to wait even longer for help since negotiations at COP23 are failing to make meaningful progress on  loss and damage finance. Tracy Carty, the head of Oxfam\' s delegation at COP 23 said:  This is a maddeningly familiar situation; rich countries are once again refusing to have meaningful discussions on how to raise money to help communities facing the worst impacts of climate change.  The current proposal is completely inadequate. What we need is a legitimate process to explore how to raise funds for loss and damage, not a one-off workshop. Ministers have just three days to show communities on the frontlines of climate change that they\' re not alone.  There are plenty of ways to raise funds for loss and damage, from taxes on fossil fuel extraction to international shipping, but rich countries don\' t want to even consider them. Negotiating in this way only erodes trust between countries and makes actual progress even harder. Notes to editors: Oxfam has a delegation at COP 23 in Bonn covering different aspects of the negotiations and are available for interviews. \</doc>

Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., D-California, issued the following news release: California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today met with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau in San Francisco, where the two leaders pledged to expand cooperation on climate action, trade and criminal justice reform. "We've got a lot to do with Canada while our Washington government is temporarily missing in action. In terms of climate action, California and more than a dozen other [U.S.] states are taking real action. I'm looking forward to forging agreements with various provinces in Canada and particularly in zero-emission vehicles -- electric cars, hydrogen cars," said Governor Brown at the opening of today's meeting. "I'm hoping Canada, California and the rest of America can really commit to developing the technologies that will allow us to have zero-emission vehicles be a big part of our future." "It's a real pleasure to meet with Governor Brown, an opportunity to talk about all the great connections between California and Canada," said Prime Minister Trudeau. "Climate change has been an issue that the Governor has been a leader on and I want to congratulate him on that and thank him as well for the cap-and-trade system Ontario is part of and others and the fact that we have so much work to do together as friends and as a planet." The Governor and Prime Minister discussed the importance of getting more zero-emission vehicles on the road, increasing cooperation between U.S. states and Canadian provinces ahead of this year's UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) and Canada's participation in the Global Climate Action Summit, which will be held in San Francisco this September. The two leaders also discussed ongoing NAFTA negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico and Governor Brown and Prime Minister Trudeau agreed to explore opportunities for criminal justice reform experts from California and Canada to collaborate. Today's meeting builds on the long-standing cooperation between California, Canada and a number of Canadian provinces to combat climate change. Last year, Governor Brown welcomed Canada to the Under2 Coalition, a global pact of more than 200 cities, states and countries - representing 1.3 billion people and 40 percent of the world's GDP - committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. At last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), Governor Brown joined Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, to affirm North America's commitment to the Paris Agreement. Additionally last year, Governor Brown met with the Premiers of Quebec and Ontario - both members of the Under2 Coalition - and signed an agreement officially integrating their cap-and-trade programs. California along with the states of Oregon and Washington and the province of British Columbia are members of the Pacific Coast Collaborative, a pact formed to strategically align policies to reduce greenhouse gases and promote clean energy.

WWF Global issued the following news release: Negotiators have just seven days to hammer out crucial details that will ensure the Paris Agreement stays on track to be fully operational by 2020. Specifically, key issues in the rules governing the Paris Agreement's implementation and important discussions about how countries can improve their national climate plans - due to be submitted by 2020 - must be agreed here at COP23 . "About a week in, we are at a time in the negotiations when the issues on the table, such as pre-2020 action, and loss and damage, are complex but essential to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Now is the time for the Fijian presidency - and for all of us - to step up and remind ourselves that it has been two years since the world entrusted decision-makers to build a climate safe and resilient future for all. If our ambition was high then, the stakes are even higher now and our collective vision cannot falter." Naoyuki Yamagishi, head of climate and energy, WWF-Japan said: "By the end of these negotiations, we need to finalize the roadmap for the next year to ensure all actors are ramping up their actions before 2020 and setting the foundations for the global stocktake. The decision negotiators make in the next seven days will largely shape our ability to accelerate action on the scale needed to keep the Paris Agreement's temperature goals in sight." Fernanda Viana De Carvalho, policy manager of WWF's global climate & energy practice, said: "This round of climate negotiations opened with a clear sense of urgency but this is yet to translate into the results we need to see to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. The next week must yield faster and greater progress on key issues, such as loss and damage, and pre-2020 ambitions, to ensure that 2018 will see countries raise ambition in both the short and the long term." Sandeep Chamling Rai, Senior Advisor on Global Adaptation Policy, WWF-Singapore, said: "These UN climate talks were always going to be a litmus test for progress on adaptation and loss and damage issues but as negotiations carry on, countries must remember the decisions they take will impact the lives of vulnerable communities and ecosystems for years to come. The world's most vulnerable people are looking to Bonn and countries, developed and developing, need to deliver on their promises and implement the full functions of the Warsaw International Mechanism and operationalization of Global Goal on Adaptation."

Nov 06, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 climate negotiators consider: How to ensure a structured policy dialogue between governments and other stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership How to formally introduce and incorporate input from non-state actors in the Facilitative Dialogue Building partnerships for resilience across global supply chains and in vulnerable communities experiencing climate impacts Supporting carbon markets and enabling cross-border collaboration on mitigation effortsDESCRIPTION: BONN, Germany, November 6, 2017\~/3BL Media/ --\~Today at the start of COP23 , the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) released key policy recommendations for this year's round of climate negotiations ahead of next year's global stock take on progress made towards the Paris Agreement. Strong business leadership will continue to accelerate implementation of climate action, but collaboration between business and government is a necessary enabler for scaling climate action across the world. 'Business is an essential implementation partner in reducing emissions and therefore needs to be fully involved in shaping the next round of national climate action plans,' said Peter Bakker, President and CEO at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Having analyzed the politics, policies and priorities around this year's Conference of the Parties (COP), WBCSD and its members are focusing this year's business advocacy efforts on:The Marrakech Partnership: Business is calling for a more structured approach to dialogues with policymakers.The Marrakech Partnership[2] for global climate action provides a platform for showcasing successful approaches to reducing greenhouse gases and enhancing climate resilience. The Partnership will need to focus more on policy dialogue between governments and other stakeholders to enable deployment of climate solutions at scale.The Facilitative Dialogue: Business is pushing for clear mechanisms to provide input into the Facilitative Dialogue[3] for taking stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement and increasing ambition in the next round of NDCs.A draft design of what the facilitative dialogue will look like and how stakeholders can be involved will be presented during COP23 .Climate resilience: Climate change is a significant and material risk to business. Companies are pushing for partnerships that will build resilience across their supply chains and the frontline communities experiencing climate impacts. Carbon pricing: Business is also calling for a meaningful carbon price. Governments need to find ways to align carbon pricing mechanisms, ensuring that pricing is credible, predictable and high enough to drive ambition consistent with the Paris Agreement. See our new in-depth guide for policy makers on carbon pricing[4].'The private sector will be the force behind emissions reductions across global supply chains,' said Maria Mendiluce, Managing Director at WBCSD. 'As we build on the success of Paris, companies have become full partners in shaping an inclusive and prosperous low-carbon economy.'

The study is titled "Global Energy System based on 100% Renewable Energy - Power Sector" The study was carried out by Finland's Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and the Energy Watch Group (EWG). The Energy Watch Group (EWG) is described as "an independent, non-profit global network of scientists[1] and parliamentarians." The study was presented earlier this month during a renewable energy[2] showcase event on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 in Bonn. The authors spelled out the extent to which they say this is feasible: A global electricity system fully based on renewable energy[3] is feasible at every hour throughout the year. It is said to be more cost effective than the existing system, largely based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. "There is no reason to invest one more dollar in fossil or nuclear power production," said EWG president Hans-Josef Fell." The study pointed out benefits accompanying such a transition to renewables bringing greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector down to zero and reducing total losses in power generation. It would create 36 million jobs by 2050, 17 million more than the sector has today. Total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100% renewable electricity[4] in 2050 is given as \€ 52/MWh (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to \€ 70/MWh in 2015. Their model, said Alex Kirby in Climate News Network, "simulates the most efficient energy supply with an optimal mix of technologies and locally available renewable resources[5]." What about wind farms? Other power sources? The authors said solar will make up 69 per cent of the energy mix by 2050. (Wind energy increases to 32% by 2030. Beyond 2030 solar PV becomes more competitive.) In sum, the transition would be driven by solar PV and battery storage, with solar PV accounting for 69% of the total 2050 energy mix followed by wind with 18%, hydropower with 8%, and bioenergy with 2%, according to the study. As for batteries, they were said to be the key supporting technology for solar PV. "The storage output[6] covers 31% of the total demand in 2050, 95% of which is covered by batteries alone." Kirby quoted Christian Breyer, lead author of the study and professor of solar economy at LUT. "A full decarbonisation of the electricity[7] system by 2050 is possible for lower system cost than today, based on available technology. Energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will," Breyer said.

For Immediate Release As Cop23 Closes, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Joins Senate Colleagues To Reaffirm Support For Paris Climate Agreement 11.20.17 WASHINGTON, D.C. - As the United Nations 23rd Conference of the Parties wraps up in Bonn, Germany, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a Senate Resolution, led by Senators Edward J. Markey (D- MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump`s intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. ``There is no doubt that global climate change poses a growing threat to our planet, our country, our Great Lakes and Wisconsin,`` said Senator Baldwin. ``Turning our back on the world and backing out of the Paris Agreement is bad for our environment and bad for our economy in Wisconsin. The U.S. must show strong leadership on climate change, reaffirm our commitment to future generations and take action to address this challenge.`` The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB): The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will more than double the level of climate financing it will mobilize for its Pacific developing member countries to over $500 million between 2017 and 2020. ADB Vice-President Stephen Groff made this announcement as ADB signed two agreements: first with the Government of Fiji for a $42 million loan to improve water and sanitation services to over 300,000 people in the greater Suva area, while ensuring that critical infrastructures are climate resilient. Second is with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for a $31 million grant to the country through ADB. Apart from Mr. Groff, signatories for the two agreements were Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and Climate Change for Fiji, and Howard Bamsey, GCF Executive Director. The agreements were signed during the climate change discussions in Fiji in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ), which Fiji will chair. "ADB has been supporting Fiji to improve water and sanitation for more than 20 years," said Mr. Groff. "With this new investment, we expect to assist Fiji expand water supply by 40,000 cubic meters per day, ensure 98% of households in Suva have access to clean water, and expand the sanitation network for additional 4,500 households to access reticulated sewerage by 2023." "This project aims to improve access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services to Fijians in the greater Suva area, taking into account the increasing population and the need for more resilient infrastructure. Fiji appreciates the financial and technical assistance provided by ADB and GCF and thanks them for recognizing the importance of this project," said Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum. "Access to financing for such projects, which consider adaptation and the effects of climate change, is a key objective for Fiji's Presidency of COP 23 ." The Fiji Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Investment Program was among the first group of projects approved by the GCF Board at its meeting in Zambia in 2015. The investment will also be cofinanced by the European Investment Bank. During his visit to Fiji, Mr. Groff met with Fiji Prime Minister Bainimarama and Australia's Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled $31.7 billion, including $14 billion in cofinancing. \</doc>

Nov 05, 2017( Digital Journal: HYPERLINK http://www.digitaljournal.com http://www.digitaljournal.com COP23 , begins on Monday in Bonn, Germany. However, plans by the Trump administration to promote coal as a solution to climate change has angered many who will be attending the climate meeting. The White House confirmed on Thursday it was sending a delegation of "negotiators" to the UN climate meeting, scheduled to last for two weeks. In June, Trump announced the U.S. was pulling out of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord but under the rules, the U.S. cannot leave the agreement until 2020.It has also been learned, according to the BBC,[1] that the White House is also supporting an event to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power, headed up by speakers from coal giant Peabody Energy and others. The plan is to show how coal and other fossil fuels can help in curbing the impacts of rising temperatures. In a statement, a White House spokesman said the presentation and discussion will build on the administration's attempts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting[2] that was held in July this year. "It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean," the spokesman said. The absurdity of the claimsThe Trump program, entitled 'The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,' will also feature NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter besides Peabody Coal. 'As the world seeks to reduce emissions while promoting economic prosperity, fossil fuels will continue to play a central role in the energy mix,' a preview of the Nov. 13 presentation says, reports the New York Times.[3] Barry K. Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, will also be a speaker, and he says he plans to "deliver a dose of reality" to a forum dominated by activists demanding an end to coal, oil, and gas. Worthington argues there are 'no credible projections' showing fossil fuels will meet less than 40 percent of global energy demand by 2050. Worthington says his message to the delegates will be a 'horrible experience' but it is important for many to hear. 'The reality of it is the world is going to continue to use fossil fuels,'' he said, £nd if I can throw myself on the hand grenade to help people realize that, I'm willing to do it.' 'This discussion is a follow-up to the Administration's success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies,' White House spokesman Raj Shah, said in a statement. 'It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean. Through innovation, the United States continues to be a global leader in cutting carbon emissions.' Anger and dismay over U.S. promotion of fossil fuelsIn addition to a number of lawmakers voicing their distaste for the White House stunt, critics worldwide are calling it a "poke in the eye of the international community." Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, says fossil fuels are hurting, not helping the world's poorest countries. 'Any country or company continuing to champion further exploration for and mining of coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be willfully carrying out a crime against humanity, and they would be held accountable,' he said.

The following information was released by the Episcopal Church: By ENS Staff [Episcopal News Service] Episcopalians from across the church are heading to Bonn, Germany, for the 23rd United Nations climate change conference , where they hope to continue the advocacy begun at the past two gatherings. Officially known as the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Nov. 6-17 conference is an annual intergovernmental meeting to focus on global dialogue and action around the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Fiji is presiding over COP23 in Bonn with the support of the German government. More information on COP23 can be found here. Previous meetings have produced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, which serves as the basis for standards on climate action and lowering carbon emissions. Appointed by Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, the 11-member COP23 delegation will share Episcopal Church resolutions on climate change and information about the church and its ministries centered on ecojustice. Led by Diocese California Bishop Marc Andrus, the delegation will offer a spiritual presence through daily interfaith prayer and worship, and by encouraging active churchwide participation by Episcopalians through virtual participation and social media. "Our goals are to build on the work done at previous conferences by urging member states to implement the Paris Agreement and pay particular attention to developing nations and the poor," said the Rev. Canon Charles Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop for ministry beyond the Episcopal Church, in a press release. Robertson said the delegation also hopes to "network within the accredited and public zones of the conference to spread the word about what the Episcopal Church is doing on climate issues." In addition, the delegation hopes its efforts will "raise awareness across the Episcopal Church of the importance of engaging on climate change as Christians," according to Robertson, and "digitally engage Episcopalians in that work." This event marks the third Episcopal delegation to attend a COP meeting. A delegation attended COP21 in Paris in 2015, advocating for an agreement aligning with General Convention resolutions related to climate change. In 2016, a delegation traveled to Marrakesh, Morocco, for COP22, which focused on implementing the Paris Agreement and birthed the "We're Still In [the Paris Agreement]" movement. The Paris Agreement, which went into effect Nov. 4, 2016, calls on the countries of the world to limit carbon emissions, which will require a decrease in dependence on fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources; and for developed countries, those responsible for the majority of emissions both historically and today, to commit to $100 billion in development aid annually by 2020 to developing countries. The agreement, which is a legally binding agreement, established specific actions and targets for reducing greenhouse gases emissions, mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, and financing mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries. Signatory countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and to make strong efforts to keep the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Bonn meeting takes place against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's oft-repeated promise to fulfill his campaign vow to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and curb the country's commitment to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. According to the agreement's rule, the United States cannot actually withdraw until 2020. He claimed in his initial June 1 announcement that the pact was bad for the U.S. economy but said he might be open to renegotiating its terms to be more "pro-American."

Nov 13, 2017( Curbed: http://curbed.com http://curbed.com / Delivered by Newstex) How U.S. 'sub-national' actors plan to play a role in cutting emissions Politicians, business leaders, and activists from around the world are currently meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the COP23 United Nations climate talks, which run from November 6 to 17. Since the United States federal government officially announced that it was pulling out [1]of the Paris climate accord, various coalitions of U.S. cities, states, businesses, and other organizations have joined together to pledge their efforts to help the U.S. meet its treaty obligations. This international gathering, the first since Trump pulled out of the agreement, has shone a spotlight on the changing stance of the United States an official government sponsored event promoting 'clean' fossil fuels [2]was met with protests and derision and the progress of other groups trying to keep the country on track to meet its pledge, some of whom set up their own pavilion[3] to promote American environmental efforts. Here are the important events and news from the conference, as it pertains to U.S. cities, and how they're participating in international efforts, despite the lack of action from the Trump administration. We'll be updating this throughout the conference. Non-state actors pledged to maintain the U.S. pledge in the Paris Accord carry significant economic weight. America's Pledge releases report on measuring current U.S. contributionsImmediately after the U.S. officially withdrew its participation in the Paris Accords, various coalitions of subnational actors cities, states, businesses, and colleges said they'll continue to work to reduce emissions and stay in line with the Paris Agreement. One of the big challenges of advancing these efforts has been keeping track of this unofficial participation. On Saturday, the group America's Pledge[4], co-chaired by California governor Jerry Brown and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, released the group's Phase One report[5], which outlined the scope of current climate actions and potential areas of action for members of this coalition, which represent more than 2,300 states, tribal nations, counties, cities, businesses, nonprofits, universities, and colleges. It can be hard to keep track of all the groups participating, including Under2 Coalition for states, cities, and regions, the Global Covenant of Mayors for cities, We Mean Business for companies, the U.S. Climate Mayors, the U.S. Climate Alliance, as well as We Are Still In. But according to the report, if all the U.S. actors participating are taken as a whole, they represent a combined GDP larger than 195 out of 197 Parties to the Framework Convention (including both Germany and Japan). In addition to creating a framework for measuring and compiling participation and impact, the report also reiterated the key roles [6]cities and states are playing in this effort. As of October 1 of this year, 20 U.S. states and 110 cities have enacted quantified emission-reduction targets. It's bolstering efforts by cities globally to help cut emissions. According to a report released by the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate ...ergy[7], existing pledges by cities alone could reduce annual CO2 emissions by 1.3 billion tons by 2030. The next America's Pledge report will go into more detail on specific policy proposals, especially around electric vehicle adoption, renewable energy adoption, and improving building energy performance, and outline a path towards meeting U.S. goals. But in the meantime, it appears that these nascent groups, what Governor Brown calls a 'Grand Coalition,' do carry enough weight to make a significant difference. Cities, states, businesses and other members of U.S. climate coalitions also represent a significant portion of U.S. emissions Virginia joins Under2 Coalition, and U.S. cities pledge to be net-zero by 2050At both the state and local level, U.S. politicians made a few big pledges. Virginia just became the 11th state to join the Under2 Coalition, along with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York State, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and will work with them to promote more sustainable policies. In addition, Austin, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and Portland promised to become emission net-zero by 2050[8], part of a group of 25 global cities making the pledge. This action was organized by C40, a network of cities collaborating to fight climate change and reduce emissions.

If we put hydro there and other non-fossil fuels, we will definitely be achieving the target much earlier than 2030,' he added.The 40 per cent non-fossil fuel target is a commitment India had made at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21).Bhalla's comments gain significance as the next round of UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) is going to be held later this month.At the event, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) partnered with the public sector undertaking Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) for 'Creating and Sustaining Markets for Energy Efficiency'.'This project will receive a composite funding of $454 million comprising the GEF grant of $20 million and co-financing of $434 million in the form of loans and equity, including a $200 million loan from the Asian Development Bank,' an EESL statement added.ADB's Country Director in India Kenichi Yokoyama said at the event, 'We are working on extending our partnerships and growing in States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and North-Eastern States.'Announcing its Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2018-2022, ADB said it plans to raise its annual lending to India. In a September, an ADB statement said that this will be to a maximum of $4 billion to support the country to accelerate inclusive economic transformation toward upper middle-income status.Yokoyama told BusinessLine , 'We are keen on energy efficiency project expansion, and also supporting the distribution systems. Annually, we are lending about $2.2 billion in the sovereign as well as $600 to 700 million in the project side, so that's about $3 billion.

The office of Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., issued the following news release: As the United Nations 23rd Conference of the Parties wraps up in Bonn, Germany, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led their colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector. "We will not allow President Trump's intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to turn America from leader to laggard on climate action," said Senator Markey. "In the face of the Trump administration's climate denial, state and local leaders, the business community, and the American people are taking action to address global warming and spur clean energy deployment. At COP23 , our delegation delivered the message that COP really stands for 'Can't Obstruct Progress' and that we are still in and we will win." "Denying climate change doesn't stop the climate from changing," said Senator Whitehouse. "And President Trump reneging on the Paris agreement can't erase America's commitment to meeting our climate goals. Rhode Island is still in. And so are states and cities across the country, leading corporations, and millions of Americans. We won't turn back." "President Trump can try to stop climate progress, but his denialism is no match for the incredible efforts of states, cities, businesses, and more all over the U.S. who are stepping up in his place," said Senator Merkley. "By working together toward a bold vision of 100% clean and renewable energy, grassroots America can and will keep the U.S. on track to meet or even exceed our Paris commitment."

The White House and energy industry officials on Monday defended the Trump administration's support for fossil fuels and nuclear power at a United Nations climate change conference A group of officials, led by Trump's chief energy and environment assistant, told attendees at the Bonn, Germany, conference that nuclear power and fossil fuel technologies designed to capture carbon emissions are essential to the global energy sector, even as it pushes to tackle climate change. A message focused on the use of fossil fuels and expensive nuclear power is out of step with the underlying themes of the U.N. conference, which is focused on greening the energy sector and reaching the greenhouse gas reduction goals of the Paris climate deal. But George David Banks, President Trump's special assistant for international energy and environment, contended the globe can't effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions while growing electricity access without relying on traditionally large sources of power. "This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our head in the sand and choose to ignore the realities of the global energy system," Banks said at the COP23 climate event. "The significant cuts in emissions envisioned by the framework and by the Paris agreement require advanced technologies, including [carbon capture and sequestration]," he said, noting technology designed to cut carbon emissions at power plants. "The math otherwise does not work, no matter how much we want it to," he said. The White House's presentation comes as the Trump administration prepares to pull the United States out of the Paris climate deal, an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Trump does not believe the scientific consensus behind human-caused climate change, and has instead pledged to help the American fossil fuel sector as president. His approach to climate issues has created deep skepticism on the global stage. Democrats \£f including senators and governors \£f traveled to Bonn this week to make the case that states and the private sector are committed to the Paris deal despite the Trump administration's approach to the issue. But Banks argued that the administration would remain active in international efforts to overhaul the energy sector, even with its focus on fossil fuels and nuclear power. "The United States will truly support an £ll of the above' approach and maintain a leadership role in innovation on all energy fronts," he said. "All this is to say we believe that there is a rational way forward that does not force countries to choose between mitigation and development and energy security. This is the U.S.'s vision for a balanced approach," he said. The United States's panel discussion \£f the Trump administration's only official event of the 11-day climate conference \£f was a tense one, with questions from the audience ranging from fossil fuel financing to a Trump tweet alleging climate change is a Chinese hoax. Banks sat alongside fossil fuel and nuclear industry officials \£f as well as a former Obama administration State Department diplomat \£f for the U.S.'s presentation. At one point, a large group of protesters interrupted the event for about five minutes, singing a rendition of Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA," rewritten with anti-coal lyrics. Amos Hochstein, an Obama administration energy diplomat who currently works for a natural gas firm, at one point admonished protesters to listen to the U.S.'s position. "If you really care about clean air, if you really care about climate change, then we have to stop siloing ourselves into communities where we're only talking to ourselves," he said. "We are only going to be able to move forward if we actually have this kind of conversation together," he said. \</doc>

World Resources Institute issued the following statement by Climate Program Global Director Paula Caballero:    The UN climate negotiations ( COP23 ) presided over by a Fiji Presidency concluded in the early hours today in Bonn, Germany with countries making progress on the rules for the Paris Agreement and putting in place a process to assess progress on climate action that should set the stage for countries to commit to enhancing their climate commitments by 2020.    "The Bonn climate talks put substance over style. Negotiators made steady progress on important details of the Paris Agreement and laid the groundwork for greater acceleration next year. The stage is set to finalize the rules that underpin the Paris Agreement in 2018 and for countries to commit by COP24 to enhance their national climate plans by 2020. "Bonn saw good progress, but negotiators have a lot of homework to do. Countries will need to intensify talks next year to navigate critical and sensitive topics such as transparency, accounting and raising ambition over time. "An appeal for developed countries to ramp up their climate efforts before 2020 became an unexpectedly prominent topic at the talks. Delegates reached common ground by agreeing to form special stocktaking sessions to review progress towards curbing emissions and delivering on climate finance in the immediate term. "The Fiji Presidency unveiled a roadmap for the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue, a year-long process to assess progress and identify opportunities for countries to make bolder commitments. As the birth place for nationally determined contributions (NDCs), Poland can demonstrate leadership alongside Fiji by facilitating a smooth path on the next round of national climate commitments. "As climate change intensifies, so too will its devastating impacts on the world's most vulnerable people. In Bonn, negotiators linked the Adaptation Fund to the Paris Agreement. This financial institution provides critical support to help developing countries manage climate impacts. Both the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund saw new pledges that will enable them to continue their work supporting urgent to support urgent adaptation needs in vulnerable countries. Negotiators also established an expert dialogue to identify ways in which to support countries facing loss and damage." "Outside the negotiating rooms, a broad range of voices continue to show strong support for climate action. We heard from companies like HP, Mars, and Wal-Mart, which are among over 320 major companies that have committed to or have already set science-based emissions targets. The Global Covenant of Mayors brings together 7,500 cities and local government with the potential to reduce the equivalent of 1.7 billion tons of emissions. "Having already abandoned its leadership role on climate, the Trump administration appears to be living in an alternate universe with its focus on fossil fuels. Now that the United States is the only nation that is not on board with the Paris Agreement, the Trump Administration should carefully consider whether being completely isolated on the climate issue really benefits the American people. "While the U.S. official presence was subdued in the negotiations, the country's subnational climate action was on full display. The America's Pledge report shows that a coalition of U.S. states, cities and businesses - equivalent to more than half of the U.S. economy and population - are committed to carry climate action forward. "We are living in unusual and alarming times. The latest studies show that global emissions are again on the rise and the world is off track of where it needs to be. In the coming months, we need a greater sense of urgency to make the deep shifts needed in our economies to address the climate challenge. 2018 needs to be the year that all countries and leaders across sectors step up."

FILE - In this April 3, 2014 file photo giant machines dig for brown coal at the open-cast mining Garzweiler in front of a power plant near the city of Grevenbroich in western Germany. A U.N.'s environment report Tuesday Oct. 31, 2017 says countries and industries need to do more to meet targets to trim emissions of greenhouse gases that experts say are contributing to global warming. In its latest "Emissions Gap" report issued ahead of an important climate conference in Germany next week, UNEP takes aim at coal-fired electricity plants being built in developing economies and says investment in renewable energies will pay for itself _ and even make money _ over the long term. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File) University of Connecticut staff and students will be attending a third United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany on Saturday Nov. 11 for seven days, according to Sarah Munro, the Sustainability Program Coordinator for the Office of Environmental Policy . COP 23 will focus on advancing the goals of the Paris Agreement and its guidelines, according to the United Nations website. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will not greatly impact U.S. involvement at the climate meeting, Munro said. A national group of government officials, companies, churches and universities called "We Are Still In" will still be attending COP 23 even without official U.S. representation. The trip is organized by UConn's Green Campus Academic Network , a group created to promote sustainability-related engagement and leadership, according to the OEP website. This year the UConn group will include 14 students, which is an increase from last year's number of 12, Munro said. "We have students that are really engaged and passionate in these topics," Munro said. GCAN attended their first conference, COP 21, in 2015 in Paris, France, when the Paris Agreement was signed, Munro said. Staff at the OEP spent the entire summer before the climate meeting reaching out to deans and different groups on campus for sponsors, she said. "It was very easy (to) ask. People saw it as an opportunity for engagement and experiential learning for students," Munro said Students learned new perspectives at the panel, said Margaux Amara, a seventh-semester honors molecular and cell biology major, who attended the conference last year. "A lot of our days were listening and engaging in panel discussions with experts from all over the world," Amara said. When the UConn group returned, they had a meeting with UConn president Susan Herbst that was much longer than they had planned, Munro said. "(Herbst) kept waving off her next meetings and we ended up sitting there for a little over an hour talking about our experiences in Paris," Munro said. GCAN attended COP 22 in 2016 in Marrakech Morocco, Africa, soon after the election of Trump, Amara said. "There was one (American) man that traveled all the way to Marrakech with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump and stood in front of the green zone protesting," Amara said. Nobody at the conference even understood who the man was or why he was standing there, Amara said, because the U.S. is the only country with a significant population of people with doubt about climate change. "When I say that the whole entire world is fundamentally on board with climate change except (the U.S.), that is the truth," Amara said. After the climate meeting in 2016, Herbst signed on to the group We Are Still In, Munro said. "We would have (still gone without that happening) but it shows that she's committed to it as well, which is fantastic," Munro said. "It's nice to know that ... our university president views (the climate meeting) as an important (event)." Amara said she wishes she could return for this year's panel, but understands the importance of other students having the experience. "It's a really wonderful opportunity," Amara said. "It is life-changing." \</doc>

The Institution of Chemical Engineers issued the following news: The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) Energy Centre, in collaboration with the Future Climate - Engineering Solutions (FC-ES) network, hosted a UK government pavilion event at the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. As the world looks for opportunities to deliver and accelerate commitments to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the discussions in Bonn offered a timely reminder of the importance of industry and government collaboration in developing achievable emissions reduction strategies. Speakers from a range of sectors discussed evidence-based solutions for putting climate policies into action, calling for a deeper partnership between governments and engineers to develop effective implementation strategies. Opening the discussion, FC-ES steering group member Beatriz Fernandez presented the findings of the network's National Energy Planning Good Practice Framework. The framework brings together insights from developers of national energy plans around the world to understand the key features of an effective plan. Reflecting on the project, Ms. Fernandez emphasised the need for early stakeholder engagement, and equal consideration of factors such as affordability, security and sustainability. The importance of considering the wider context in energy and climate planning was echoed by IChemE Energy Centre Board Member, Mark Apsey, who outlined the benefits of a systems thinking approach for addressing the challenge presented by the water-energy-food nexus: "Chemical engineers don't think about how to fix just one part of the problem - we look at choices in the whole system to understand what the best options are. We have an opportunity to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions. Systems thinking can help us realise this." IChemE Energy Centre, Chair, Professor Stef Simons, said: "The considerable challenge of meeting emissions reduction targets cannot be overcome without deep collaboration between industry and policy makers. The IChemE Energy Centre's involve-ment with Future Climate - Engineering Solutions is an example of what the engineering profession can bring to this partnership. "Engineering solutions are fundamental to developing coherent national energy and climate plans and COP23 Andrew Webster, Co-Chair of the Future Climate - Engineering Solutions network, outlined the UK Department for Business of Energy and Industrial Strategy's Global Calculator project, discussing its use by government, NGOs and the public to explore the relationship lifestyle choices, the energy system and climate impacts. Speaking after the event, Mr Webster said: "This was my first time at a COP event and it's been a really positive experience. The voice of engineers remains largely absent from the UNs climate programme, and as a professional mechanical engineer, I'm convinced we must continue to show up, and speak up. We must use our skills to enable governments, the public, NGO's and activists to understand the technical opportunities that can deliver on climate goals, and more importantly the connectedness of their choices. Off the back of this meeting, we will work with other national engineering organisations to develop these options in our energy and climate plans." What is chemical engineering? Chemical, biochemical and process engineering is the application of science, maths and economics in the process of turning raw materials into everyday, and more specialist, products. Professional chemical engineers design, construct and manage process operations all over the world. Oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, food and drink, synthetic fibres and clean drinking water are just some of the products where chemical engineering plays a central role.

Washington: Office of the Senator Ed Markey has issued the following news release: As the United Nations 23rd Conference of the Parties wraps up in Bonn, Germany, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led their colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump\' s intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector.  We will not allow President Trump\' s intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to turn America from leader to laggard on climate action, said Senator Markey.  In the face of the Trump administration\' s climate denial, state and local leaders, the business community, and the American people are taking action to address global warming and spur clean energy deployment. At COP23 , our delegation delivered the message that COP really stands for \' Can\' t Obstruct Progress\' and that we are still in and we will win.  Denying climate change doesn\' t stop the climate from changing, said Senator Whitehouse.  And President Trump reneging on the Paris agreement can\' t erase America\' s commitment to meeting our climate goals. Rhode Island is still in. And so are states and cities across the country, leading corporations, and millions of Americans. We won't turn back.  President Trump can try to stop climate progress, but his denialism is no match for the incredible efforts of states, cities, businesses, and more all over the U.S. who are stepping up in his place, said Senator Merkley.  By working together toward a bold vision of 100% clean and renewable energy, grassroots America can and will keep the U.S. on track to meet or even exceed our Paris commitment. Other Senators co-sponsoring the resolution include Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). \</doc>

Christian Aid issued the following news release: As the UN climate summit in Bonn came to a close, Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow, said this year's meeting showed an encouraging appetite for action on emissions before 2020. He said: "There was a concern that the suffering caused by 2017's extreme weather events might be ignored here in Bonn but actually we saw appetite for more short-term emission cuts from developed countries than some expected." He said: "Everyone knows the Paris Agreement pledges alone are not enough to combat climate change - they only get us to a world of three degrees. "The ratchet mechanism that made the Paris Agreement not just a static document but a living thing that strengthens itself over time, now has a name: The Talanoa Dialogue. That mechanism has now been switched on. However despite that progress, COP23 still failed to deliver the financial support needed to accelerate the efforts of developing countries wanting to follow a clean energy path. Adow said: "Developing countries don't want to be left with the polluting fossil fuel systems of the past that drive climate change. But they need the promised financial support from richer nations to switch tracks and make the most of their clean energy resources. That finance has not been forthcoming here - but hopefully developed countries will step up and commit more of this at the summit hosted by Emmanuel Macron in Paris next month. "This summit also saw a dividing line emerge on coal between President Trump and a clean energy alliance consisting of America's closest neighbours and allies: the UK, Canada and Mexico. This group is on the march and will rally more members to its banner over the next year as we head towards the meeting in Poland." This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.

New York: Natural Resources Defense Council has issued the following news release: It has been almost two years since world leaders agreed to the historic Paris Agreement. Since then a lot has changed (both positive and negative). As leaders meet in Bonn, Germany for the next round of international climate negotiations there will be several key issues on the table. This meeting will set the tone for how leaders will come together in the era of President Trump and show that they are prepared to carry forward climate action. Here are four key themes to watch at COP 23 (the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC): While President Trump has announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, we\' ve witnessed a resounding revolt in the U.S. to that decision (as our new issue brief documents) by Governors, Mayors, business leaders, and citizens. States are committing to expand renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner transportation. Mayors are committing to go to power their cities with 100% renewable energy and are finding ways to use energy more efficiently. Business leaders are committing to power their companies with 100% renewable energy and to ensure that their supply-chains are helping solve climate change, not make it worse. At the climate conference, we will see a much larger contingent of U.S. sub-national leaders than typically comes to these meetings. They are showing up in force with one clear message: Trump may be trying to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, but we are still in and committed to helping deliver on America\' s climate targets. 2. Countries are acting at home Key countries are showing that they aren\' t just waiting for the future to implement new actions to reduce their emissions and meet their Paris targets. While not all countries are yet on track to meet their targets, we have seen noticeable progress in some of the world\' s biggest emitting countries. Here are some examples (from our new issue briefs on key countries): China has made significant progress towards its Paris targets. Coal consumption has remained relatively flat since its peak in 2013, and China\' s wind and solar energy deployment continue to grow at the fastest pace in the world. India is on track to achieve and exceed its Paris climate commitments. In just one year, from 2016 to 2017, India increased its renewable energy capacity by 11.3 gigawatts (GW) making critical progress towards its target to install 100 GW of solar, 60 GW wind, and 15 GW of biogas by 2022. Mexico has been making progress on climate change policies both domestically and internationally, but the country must increase its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy resources if it is to meet its target. Japan needs to raise the ambition of its emissions reduction target and stop its rapid expansion of new coal power plants. Canada unveiled the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change Canada\' s first truly comprehensive climate action plan. However, enhanced climate policies are still needed to fulfill Canada\' s international obligations. European Union is making progress towards its target through its 2030 climate and energy framework. While member states\' carbon targets for 2030 are a step in the right direction, more action is needed to ensure the EU\' s target is realized and even overachieved. Brazil has put forward some actions to help meet this target, but recent political developments in the country have led to a spike in deforestation rates and threats to protected areas, which may hamper national progress in mitigation. And these actions are starting to show up in global emissions data. Prior to 2014, global emissions of carbon dioxide had been growing at a significant pace adding roughly 0.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) per year between 2005 and 2014 (with some occasional annual variation). But between 2014 and 2016, these emissions have remained essentially flat. 3. Paris Agreement  rulebook matters a great deal The Paris Agreement established the essential foundations for how the world is going to advance international climate action for decades to come. Critical to its continued success will be ensuring that the  rulebook for the Paris Agreement helps to ensure that countries meet their targets and creates incentives for countries to beat their targets. Countries agreed to finalize the details of the Paris rulebook next year, so this year\' s meeting needs to ensure strong progress towards building a system of strong rules to help ensure that the promise of the Paris Agreement is translated into reality in the years ahead. This includes making significant progress in Bonn towards defining rules around: An  enhanced transparency and accountability system so that countries report progress towards their targets every two years; Spurring countries to announce stronger emissions reduction targets in the coming years; and The detailed information that countries will provide as they announce future targets so that we can be sure that we fully understand the environmental implications of their new targets. 4. More needs to be done: the Paris targets are the floor, not the ceiling of ambition While significant progress is being made by many key countries to meet their target, stronger action will be needed in the coming years if we are going to be on a safer climate trajectory. A recent report from U.N. Environment states it clearly:  there is an urgent need for accelerated short-term action and enhanced longer-term national ambition, if the goals of the Paris Agreement are to remain achievable  . Recognizing this dynamic, the Paris Agreement created a dynamic process for countries to adopt more aggressive commitments starting in 2020. We were confident after Paris that countries would find that they could commit to strengthened targets in the coming years. Countries will need to be prepared to announce even stronger targets in the years to come. There are emerging positive signs that some key countries will be in a position to deliver even greater ambition than they promised in 2015. \</doc>

Mokhotlong, Nov. 16 -- When climate change continue to affect countries with unusual weather patterns, Mokhotlong agricultural farmers said they are fearful that the prevailing snowfall is likely to impact negatively on both crops and livestock. Mokhotlong and other highlands districts have received snowfall in summer after Lesotho Meteorological Services (LMS) issued an early warning this week whereby moderate to heavy rains were forecast mostly on the lowlands while in the highlands cold weather conditions with posibility of snowfall was also predicted. In an interview, one of the crops farmers Mr. Thabo Moleko said it is uncommon to experience snow especially in summer season and as a result they are fearful about crops which were already growing, adding that they are likely to be badly destroyed due to snow. Mr. Moleko said even though it is not that much cold because of yesterday rain, the prevailing snowy conditions are going to shorten the life span of crops and thus also affecting the yield. He further said they are grateful that snowfall is going to leave behind enough moisture in the soil more especially when they are still within summer cropping season. However, Mr. Moleko said they will closely monitor the situation of crops after the snowfall in case conditions may demand them to replant. Also interviewed, Sanqebethu Wool and Mohair Growers Association (SWMGA), Mr. Monts'i Masiu said most farmers are still in the middle of sheep shearing activity whereby about 400 flock of sheep was sheared only yesterday and they are wondering how they are going to cope under such cold weather conditions. Mr. Masiu said although they were notified by the upcoming chilling weather conditions, they were not prepared as farmers to receive snowfall in the middle of summer. He said the worst part of it, most small stock farmers have shifted their flock of sheep to the highlands cattle post range lands where there are no shelters unlike in rural settlements range lands. When approached for comment, District Administrator (DA) Administration Manager, Mr. Maletsika Motsokotsi said they strongly appeal to road users to cancel their trips until further notice as all roads linking Mokhotlong to other districts are still closed by snowfall. Meanwhile, leaders of global countries are currently attending COP 23 United Nations Climate Change Conference HYPERLINK content.services@htlive.com \</doc>

WWF Global issued the following news release: As the UN climate talks end later today, WWF recognizes the progress made on laying the groundwork for increasing climate ambition up to 2020 and beyond, but notes that 2018 will be key for countries to clearly signal their intention to step up and enhance their climate plans. In the hours remaining, WWF urges parties to resolve the issues still pending. A year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, negotiations over the past two weeks have seen countries come to agreement on critical issues of pre-2020 action and support, and the role of gender, local communities and Indigenous Peoples in climate action. However, much remains to be done to ensure we seize the small window of opportunity we have to achieve the objectives of this landmark climate accord. Governments must strengthen urgent action, finalize the Paris Agreement rulebook and decide collectively to review and strengthen ambition of post-2020 climate commitments urgently. "From the onset, the paradoxes at this COP have been many. Negotiators have gathered in Bonn under a Fiji Presidency and, as states deliberate on future action, cities, regions, businesses and communities have stepped up their efforts toward achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. We also saw that despite the momentum seen in the corridors in Bonn, domestically countries are still falling behind" said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, head of WWF's global climate and energy programme. "In a year marked by extreme weather disasters and potentially the first increase in carbon emissions in four years, the paradox between what we are doing and need to be delivering is clear: countries must act with greater climate ambition, and soon, to put us on a path to a 1.5degreeC future." By raising the profile of pre-2020 action in the UNFCCC process, and agreeing on the design of a process to review and increase ambition through the Talanoa Dialogue, COP23 has provided important building blocks to move the spirit of the Paris Agreement forward. But success is far from guaranteed. The Polish presidency must complement, and aim to bolster, Fiji's efforts to accelerate progress towards finalizing the Rulebook that will guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement and ensure scaled up, predictable finance for developing countries, including for loss and damage. "Two years ago, countries around the world were entrusted with an important mandate in Paris. Today, they are making progress but with the impacts of climate change accelerating, the pace and scale of the response is still insufficient. It is time to show bolder vision, innovation, and urgent action - domestically and on the international front - and build on the clear momentum we are seeing in our societies and economies already. We look to Poland to continue Fiji's legacy to translate the ambition and vision of the Paris Agreement into reality," added Pulgar-Vidal. Countries are not the only ones taking action. Through the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, efforts underway by states and non-State actors - including cities, regions, business, investors, and civil society - to galvanize climate action were in the spotlight at COP23 in Bonn. The WWF 'PandaHub' Pavilion hosted a full programme of dialogues and events to showcase the value of collaboration and innovation to create a sustainable, resilient future for all. In addition, the U.S. Climate Action Center brought together over 100 prominent leaders from U.S. state and local governments, private sector and academia showing the U.S.' commitment to remaining a global frontrunner in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. WWF is one of many organizations supporting the new generation of climate leaders who comprise the "We Are Still In" movement, the largest U.S. coalition ever assembled in support of climate action. "Never before has a coalition of American business, state and local leaders come together under a common banner to drive climate action," said Lou Leonard, WWF's senior vice president of climate change and energy. "By working together, they can ensure that the United States meets its commitment under the Paris Agreement while creating new jobs and creating a safer future for communities in America and around the world." The 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the UNFCCC will take place from 3-14 December 2018, in Katowice, Poland. This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.

Greenpeace International issued the following news release: Activists from Greenpeace in Germany and Pacific Island Represent have sent a message to leaders meeting at the UN climate talks in Bonn, projecting an image of faces onto a coal power plant and calling for an urgent phase out of fossil fuels. The message "No future in fossil fuels" and # COP23 was projected onto the polluting Neurath coal power plant alongside faces from the Pacific Islands and around the world to put a spotlight on the impact the emissions from climate summit host nation Germany have on the Pacific. The activists were also critical of Pacific regional neighbour Australia and the impacts its coal exports and emissions have on small island states, where people are already living with the consequences of climate change. "The unabated mining and burning of fossil fuels is driving climate change, making cyclones and storm surges more frequent and more intense," Pacific Island Represent activist Alisi Nacewa said. "The damage already caused by fossil fuels cannot be reversed but we can still prevent entire Pacific Islands from being swallowed up if we rapidly phase out fossil fuels. Paris Agreement signatories have already promised this. Now is the time to do it." As signatories to the Paris Climate Agreement, Germany and Australia have agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but are so far failing to act on that promise. Germany still generates more than 40 percent of its electricity from coal (1) and has continued to build dirty coal plants since committing to emissions reductions, while Australia has greenlighted the construction of Adani Group's Carmichael mega coal mine and continues to hand out billions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies. "Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to comply with the German climate target of a 40 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020. This is only possible with a coal phase-out," said Greenpeace Germany climate expert Karsten Smid. "If she fails to do so, she is sacrificing the fruits of the clean energy transition for the sake of the coal industry." The Neurath brown coal-fired power plant is located 50 kilometres from the climate conference. With an output of 4400 megawatts, Neurath is the largest coal-fired power plant in Germany and the second largest in Europe. With annual emissions of 32 million tons of CO2, it is one of the most climate-damaging coal-fired power plants in the world. The power plant's CO2 emissions are more than twice as high as those of the island state of Fiji. Despite massive protests, Chancellor Merkel laid the foundation stone for the new BoA 2&3 lignite blocks from the energy company RWE in Neurath in August 2006. Pacific Island Represent activist Samu Kuridrani added: "Expanding fossil fuel industries at home, while sweet-talking to vulnerable countries on the world stage, goes against the spirit of the Paris Agreement. We want to show world leaders that we see through their deception and demand real action. You can't claim to be a friend of the Pacific while ramping up your fossil fuel industry."

The Asian Development Bank issued the following news release: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will invest $1.5 million to assist Fiji's Presidency of the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and join the Government of Fiji's COP 23 Advisory Panel. "ADB's support for Fiji's Presidency of COP 23 comes as ADB is doubling the total financing we provide for climate change to $6 billion by 2020," said Stephen Groff, ADB's Vice President for East Asia, South East Asia, and the Pacific. "ADB was also very pleased to have assisted Fiji in mobilizing $31 million in grant financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to improve water supply in Suva. This was among the very first round of proposals agreed by GCF." The ADB contribution was warmly welcomed by Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney General, Minister for Economy, and Minister for Climate Change. "As our Honorable Prime Minister and incoming COP 23 President, Frank Bainimarama, has highlighted, COP 23 will be critical to keep up the momentum for decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and arrest the current state of global warming. Fiji is pleased to extend an invitation to the ADB President to join the Advisory Panel for COP 23 , and appreciates ADB's valuable technical advice," he said. ADB's support to Fiji's COP 23 Presidency will include technical advice worth at least $0.5 million to assist the Pacific country become a global leader on green transport issues and explore options to expand insurance coverage for households, farmers, and businesses to cover potential losses from natural disasters. Recognizing that small island developing countries are the most at risk from climate change, ADB will also provide $1 million in grants to the Fijian government to ensure Pacific island countries have a strong voice in the lead up to COP 23 . ADB's Board of Governors yesterday formally approved Fiji to host ADB's 52nd Annual Meeting. This will be the first time ADB will hold its Annual Meeting in any Pacific developing member country.

Delta, a global leader in power and thermal management solutions and a long-term advocate for climate change action, was invited by ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) for a speech in its side event during the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference.\~As the only corporation invited to the side event, Delta exchanged constructive views and practices with the cities of Toyama City, Ulan Bator, Shenzhen and New Taipei City, as well as the Asian Development Bank.\~During the event, which was overflowed with dozens of decision makers and climate experts, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, offered effective ways for the private sector to contribute in the development of sustainable cities while elaborating on Delta's concrete achievements in enabling low-carbon buildings, transportation and energy infrastructure. Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, participated in ICLEI's side event through a speech themed "How can the private sector help facilitate a sustainable city?" in which she remarked, "Delta has committed to carbon reduction in its operations and businesses. We have successfully established 25 green buildings globally with our energy-saving technologies, and further provide building automation, EV charging and smart LED street lighting solutions to facilitate sustainable cities across the world.\~At the COP23 side event exhibition area, Delta has also been granted permission to showcase its endeavours and accomplishments in nurturing green buildings, low-carbon mobility and environmental education to share Taiwanese companies' experiences in sustainability with the world." Delta has attended the COP UN Climate Change Conferences for 11 consecutive years and once again promotes a more active role of the private sector in climate change at the conference. At the COP21 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, Delta's chief executive officer, Mr. Ping Cheng, and Delta Electronics Foundation's executive director, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, were not only invited by the German Pavilion of COP21 to provide keynote speeches, but also led the company to share its green building experience through the "Delta Green Building Exhibition" held at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Nov 30, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP 23 ), held 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, agreed on a framework for addressing agriculture's impact on climate. The framework includes assessing soil health, soil carbon and water management, nutrient use and manure management, and the impact of climate change on socio-economics and food security. Agriculture was also a key agenda item at the COP's side events as international organizations, research institutions, governments, civil society and the private sector discussed initiatives needed to achieve countries' climate targets for agriculture. Scientists from the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) presented research findings at several side events, highlighting the benefits that trees in agriculture, aka agroforestry, bring to the fight against climate change.

Morocco's decades-long commitment to clean and sustainable energy is widely recognized. The 2017 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Morocco alongside France, Sweden, and the UK in the top ten most climatically conscious countries, and number one in the developing world, based on criteria including CO2 emissions, renewable energy development, efficiency, and climate policy. Undoubtedly, Morocco will continue to be on the upswing. The northern African nation has strongly promoted a transition towards renewable energy, which it is now implementing. Morocco is widely expected to rank even higher in the coming years The Moroccan Press Agency reported that Princess Lalla Hasnaa represented in Bonn, King Mohammed VI at the opening ceremony of the high-level segment of the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 23 ). The opening ceremony of the COP23 high-level segment was marked by speeches by the UNSG, president of the Federal Republic of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Fiji's Prime Minister and COP23 president Frank Bainimarama and UNGA president Miroslav Lajcak. The high-level segment will resume in the afternoon with statements by several heads of state. The COP23 , held on November 6-17 under the presidency of the Fiji Islands, is meant to devise rules and regulations that would help carry out the Paris Agreement aimed at curbing global temperature rise below 2\'b0 Celsius. As part of the continuity of the Marrakech event, Fiji's COP23 presidency makes it a top priority to preserve the multilateral consensus laid down in the Paris Agreement to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions, with the ambition of keeping the current momentum for the implementation of the said Agreement via a series of climate actions. It is worth noting that Morocco last year hosted the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22) in Marrakesh. A car Berenice that has witnessed a major success. On the sidelines of that successful climate summit King Mohammed VI delivered a powerful message in which he shares his vision and commitment to clean and sustainable energy in the African continent. He is a powerful excerpt of that speech: "I suggest that we build an African continent that is resilient to climate change and that commits resolutely to sustainable development; an African continent that will use its resources in an optimal way, while respecting environmental and social balances; a continent that will seek to promote inclusive development, in line with the specific features of its identity, particularly the culture of sharing, of fairness and of solidarity. Before going any further, I would like to raise a fundamental question. It goes without saying that the concern about the future of our planet and the interest taken in the issue by active civil society organizations are real. But are there really any common, action-oriented objectives? There are two basic elements I would like to consider with you in this regard.. First, there is a disparity between the North and the South when it comes to culture and the environment. That disparity concerns priorities as well as means. For this reason, it is important to harmonize, even unify, environmental education efforts. The Moroccan Presidency will seek to achieve that objective during its term. Do we need to point out that the colonial era is over, and that imposed decisions cannot be productive? Do we need to point out that stakeholders lack neither the commitment nor the goodwill required, though they sometimes lack the necessary means? We are all aware that what is at stake is the preservation of life, and that we need to work together to protect the Earth. It is precisely for this reason that I would like to see a convergence of views regarding our actions on the ground." \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): "Forests Day," the flagship event on forests at the 23 rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), took place on 12 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, providing a comprehensive look at recent progress and new commitments on protecting and restoring forests with a focus on advancements by non-Party stakeholders. Building on initiatives of past UNFCCC COP Presidencies and Champions such as the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, days dedicated to the contribution of forests to climate action have been organized at UNFCCC COPs since COP 20 in 2014. At COP 21 in Paris, Decision 1/CP.21 formally recognized that commitments from all actors - non-Party stakeholders (i.e. business, NGOs, indigenous peoples, etc.) as well as Parties - are urgently needed to achieve both the Paris Agreement goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Global Climate Action Agenda was therefore created to be an interface between action on the ground and the UNFCCC negotiation process and to scale up ambitious climate action by all Parties and non-Party stakeholders in the period 2016-2010. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Cities, the transport sector and ocean advocates today announced a number of new initiatives to push for further, faster climate action, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany. These announcements were made under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, created last year to spur action by state and non-state sectors to help implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. New Transport Decarbonisation Alliance In a major new partnership, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Costa Rica and the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) launched the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance to stimulate greater political leadership in the sector. Transport contributes about one quarter of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and about 15-17 per cent of the entire spread of human CO2 emissions. More ambitious and coordinated action on transport is required to deliver on the Paris Agreement, said Jose Mendes, Deputy Minister for Environment of Portugal. Six new voluntary sector initiatives were also introduced in Bonn to address specific aspects of transport and climate change. These include: the 'below50' (expanding the global market for the world's most sustainable fuels); the EcoMobility Alliance (cities committed to sustainable transport); EV100 (accelerating the transition to electro-mobility); Walk 21 (valuing and delivering more walkable communities); the Global Strategy for Cleaner Fuels and Vehicles; and the Transforming Urban Mobility Initiative (accelerating implementation of sustainable urban transport development and mitigation of climate change). Electric cars parked at the UN Headquarters, in New York, as part of a campaign to raise awareness on sustainable electricity. (file) UN Photo/JC McIlwaine Cities and communities speed coordinated climate action Similarly, global cities and communities also announced new efforts Saturday to coordinate their climate action commitments to deliver bigger and faster results together. Local and regional governments are making commitments that will help national Governments close the gap between current national commitments and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, said Gino Van Begin, Secretary General of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability, a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions working together for sustainable development. Urban areas account for around two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global energy use. Their overall contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 and 49 per cent globally, depending on base assumptions of data used. Also at a press conference at COP 23 , the Mayor of city of Pittsburgh (in the United States), William Peduto, announced that 367 American mayors have agreed to be part of the Paris Agreement no matter what our Federal Government did. It's going to happen at the local level, he said. The new initiatives announced include efforts ICLEI and the global NDC Partnership (a coalition of countries and institutions working to mobilize support for climate goals and enhancing sustainable development) to design, implement and align climate action strategies across all levels of governments. Similarly, the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (a group of some 40 organizations working to mobilize investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure in cities and urban areas internationally) is mapping available finance to match known infrastructure projects a critical requirement to help local governments identify funding.

Photo: OCHA/Danielle Parry Threat of ocean warming and ocean acidification Also Saturday at COP 23 , a new declaration was signed to strengthen global response to climate change impacts on oceans and coastal zones. Oceans are the planet's largest carbon sink, a major regulating force of global climate, and fundamental to the survival and well-being of humanity. Oceans have featured little in the UN climate negotiations to date, and yet they are not only important for planetary survival but also offer great opportunities for innovation towards a low-carbon blue economy, said Biliana Cicin-Sain, President of the Global Ocean Forum. Isabel Torres de Noronha, Executive Secretary of the Future Ocean Alliance, a non-governmental organization, in an interview with UN News, underscored that ocean acidification might put at risk not only ecosystems but also many economic activities and food security of coastal populations. Among initiatives at national level, she highlighted one from Viet Nam about strengthening the coastline by planting forests of mangroves. \</doc>

Salem: The Office of Governor, Oregon has issued the following news release: Governor Kate Brown, along with the governors of Washington and California, today announced that West Coast leaders will participate in the Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany, this November to represent subnational jurisdictions committed to climate action. The announcement was made at a ceremony recognizing Fiji as the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition and Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama as the incoming COP23 president.  The \' America First' doctrine should put our children first. Future generations will judge us not on the facts of global climate change, but what we've done to tackle it, Governor Kate Brown said.  Strengthening the commitment to combat climate change sends a strong message to our global allies. The Paris Agreement is a blueprint from job creation and prosperity, and despite the decision by the White House to retreat, I will continue to work with leaders on the West Coast, across the country, and around the world in pursuit of greenhouse gas reduction goals and working toward the development of a greener, cleaner energy mix of the future." The Under2 Coalition is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius \- the level of potentially catastrophic consequences \- by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels, or holding emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050. With the addition of Fiji, the coalition now includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to more than 16 percent of the global population and more than 39 percent of the global economy.  As the incoming President of COP23 , Fiji looks forward to working with this group of states and regions in the global effort to advance climate action at every level of society, said Prime Minister Bainimarama. "This is true now more than ever following the Trump Administration's announcement that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. This decision has redoubled our commitment to forge a Grand Coalition that includes all levels of government, businesses and civil society, to take climate action forward with the urgency it deserves. We look forward Governor Brown's help in mobilising like-minded leaders from around the world in support of our goal to achieve concrete outcomes at COP23 . At today's ceremony, Governor Kate Brown, California Governor Jerry Brown, and Washington Governor Inslee were the first U.S. state leaders to announce that they will participate in COP23 as part of a delegation of U.S. governors that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a partnership formed in response to the White House's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. The alliance now includes 13 U.S. states \- led by both Democrats and Republicans \- committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. The U.S. Climate Alliance complements the goals of the Under2 Coalition, which nine climate alliance members have also joined.

A group of nonfederal leaders today announced they will showcase ambitious plans to combat climate change during the next round of U.N. climate talks in Bonn, Germany, next month. At a pavilion at the talks, a group of more than 40 organizations and 2,584 individuals using the slogan We Are Still In will demonstrate the United States' resolve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite President Trump's announcement that he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the group said. A Republican elected leader, Native American tribes, five counties, and 213 churches and congregations today signed on to the We Are Still In declaration. "It's critical for the world to know that the U.S. will continue to lead on climate change -- and that we can fulfill our Paris commitments even without help from Washington," said Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and U.N. special envoy for cities and climate change, in a statement. "By pitching a big tent in Bonn, we are providing space for American mayors, governors and business leaders to collaborate with their counterparts around the world," he added. The pavilion is the first to be sponsored exclusively by nonfederal agents and will provide space for exhibitions starting Nov. 9. Its sponsors include Bloomberg Philanthropies and NextGen America. A large number of state governors, mayors and council members along with private leaders plan to travel to Bonn for the 23rd Conference of the Parties, including U.S. Climate Alliance members Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D). The We Are Still In campaign has garnered bipartisan support with signatories in all 50 states since it launched following Trump's Paris withdrawal announcement. Its membership is composed of nine states, 252 cities and counties, 1,780 businesses and investors, 339 colleges and universities, and 213 communities of faith -- all totaling $6.2 trillion of the U.S. economy. \</doc>

Nov 12, 2017( Global Voices: HYPERLINK http://globalvoicesonline.org http://globalvoicesonline.org COP23 [1]) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2017 is set to be one of the\~hottest years on record.[2][ Image removed: ] COP 23 Logo. Source: COP 23 Website. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia have predicted a harsh fate for the\~Middle East and North Africa[3]\~(MENA) region. Jordan currently faces one of the most severe droughts[4] in recorded history. In the absence of international climate policy action, the country could receive 30 percent less rainfall by 2100 and annual temperatures could increase by 4.5 Celsius. The landmark Paris Agreement[5] at COP 21[6] in 2015 provided the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. The 2017 Bonn meeting will be paramount in building the rules to enact the Paris deal and toughen national actions to meet the goal of keeping the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius[7].MENA faces massive heats wavesIn October 2015, the journal Nature Climate Change predicted that heat waves in parts of the Persian Gulf could threaten human survival[8] by the end of the century. Heat wave duration in the MENA region will prolong dramatically, lasting 80 days by mid-century and 118 days by the end of the century compared to the present average of 16 days, even if greenhouse gas emissions decline again after 2040.[ Image removed: ] Screenshot from Google Earth of the Persian Gulf and neighboring countries. Unrestrained demand for water for agricultural purposes in the region has led to groundwater over drafting, declines in water quality and land degradation including salinization (increasing salt content in the soil).Climate change is expected to compound[9] these trends and the agriculture sector will hit the hardest. More frequent and intense heat waves and reduced rainfall will curb growing seasons. With less rain, there will be a reduction in soil moisture, river runoff, and aquifer recharge. Increased uncertainty will affect productivity, and make agricultural planning more difficult. As Safa' Al-Jayoussi from 'Climate Action Network - International[10]' told Al-Ayam newspaper:[11] \£b                                                                                                                                                                                   .' The Arab region is currently suffering from drought, which is only the beginning of the consequences of climate change and therefore the discussions should take into account the communities most affected by the damage on the one hand and compensation for the losses resulting from that phenomenon, on the other hand. Jordan, for example, draws 160 percent more water from the ground than is replenished by nature, yet there is little incentive to conserve this precious resource. The use of water for irrigation remains heavily and unsustainably subsidized by the government, and wastage is a major issue. More than half of Jordan's water is used for agriculture which only produces only a small share of the local food supply. An estimated 50 percent of the water supply is lost due to misuse or theft. Egypt faces similar problems:Climate change drives hunger - it hits the most vulnerable the hardest. As Egyptian farmers struggle to adapt, @WFP[12] is there to help. # COP23 [13] pic.twitter.com/3a7QQutIDB[14];  WFP Middle East (@WFP_MENA) November 6, 2017[15]Harnessing the power of sun and windMiddle Eastern countries are paying a heavy price for their focus on fossil fuels[16] in the form of air pollution and contaminated water. Increasing desertification[17] has adversely affected farming. The fishing industry suffers from deteriorating quality in coastal waters and the negative effects of changing sea temperatures on catches. But fossil fuels continue to enjoy huge subsidies and are so\~underpriced[18]\~that it is difficult for renewable energies to break through. They are perceived as not being cost-competitive because of the sometimes-hidden subsidies offered to fossil fuels.Share of Renewable Energy Capacity in the Arab World, Turkey and Iran (2016) #FESMENA[19] # COP23 [20] #CANAW[21] pic.twitter.com/Jfd3s7GomN[22];  @CANArabWorld (@CAN_ArabWorld) November 5, 2017[23]Only some countries in the region have grown rich by exploiting fossil fuels with the majority sourcing less than 1 percent of electricity from renewables. While all MENA countries stand to benefit from the sun, and the region has huge potential for solar energy and wind power, renewable energies investment is among the lowest in the world. MENA falls behind similar-income countries in this regard, but also behind many poorer countries.Countries in the Arab World have voluntary committed to renewable energy targets as a percentage of overall electricity generation capacity. #CANAWA[24] #FESMENA[25] # COP23 [26] pic.twitter.com/gWeGGMFg2O[27];  @CANArabWorld (@CAN_ArabWorld) November 8, 2017[28]MENA braces for a future of extremesAccording to the\~Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC[29]), anthropogenic climate change is already significantly increasing the likelihood of extreme weather events like heatwaves[30], floods[31], and wildfires.\~[32]The impact of these natural disasters may be irreversible, severe and widespread for billions of people unless action is taken now to drastically cut global carbon emissions. Over the last decade[33], various nations have announced long and medium-term development plans for alternative installations to fossil resources. For example, Morocco and Jordan have been driven to diversified their energy sources to meet a greater dependency and demand for fuel imports that continue to increase in cost.The Moroccan government is on the verge of achieving its objective to produce 2 Gigawatts (GW) of solar energy and 2 GW of wind energy by 2020, whereas its current wind capacity is over 750 Megavolts (MV). The Jordanian government is planning to increase its initial objective of 600 Megawatts (MW) of solar power to 1 GW by 2020. Current pledges for carbon cuts by the world's nations would mean at least 3 degrees Celcius of global warming and severe damage,\~[34]experts warn. Without serious preparation to build trust and agreement, deals are likely to delay, as the failed COP in Copenhagen in 2009 revealed. While the Paris Agreement included a mechanism to review and ratchet up these pledges, the rules have not been set, adding pressure to the Bonn meeting to complete this vital work before 2018.Written

Nov 16, 2017( Pambazuka News: HYPERLINK http://www.pambazuka.org http://www.pambazuka.org Human dignity and life are not respected at all. Recent climate disasters in Puerto Rico expose this immoral behavior. After suffering two hurricanes (Irma and Maria), the US administration blocked any form of assistance to rebuild the island, only allowing its corporations. For Jes\'fas V\'e1zquez Negr\'f3n from Puerto Rico, who was attending the people's mobilizations parallel to the 23rd edition of the Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, climate change is real. "We are here to remind the world that the change must be systemic. That is why the proposal of systemic change proposed by La Via Campesina, a global grassroots movement and alliance, is crucial.' The peasant struggle is not just about climate resilience - which is an act of resistance in itself. It is also a global fight against the expansion of agribusiness, which relies on free trade agreements. There is an urgent need to critically question the mass production of meat[1] and reduce the import of feed from the global south to Europe. To make sure they keep growing despite global climate change, transnational corporations have developed their own ways - false solutions such as blue carbon, REDD [1] mechanism and climate smart agriculture. Another issue that is generally undermined in climate change debates is migration. There are today more than ever before a growing number of climate-migrants. According to Massa Kon\'e9 of the Global Convergence of Land and Water Struggles - West Africa, the climate and the migrantion crisis are the two sides of the same coin. ' It is those who try to contain migrations who have also provoked it! It is their false solutions that are taking over our land, disturb our rainfall, that create wars! This is why migration increases everyday', says Kon\'e9. The good news is that the debates have a strong youth movement that is leading the struggle in various places of the globe, as they are the future of humanity. 'We are the present for a better future and we will not give up, but continue to defend the interests of the peasants, the whole society, for a social transformation. We, peasants across the world, firmly reject the industrial model of agriculture which is at the very root of climate change', says young French peasant Fanny Metrat of Confederation Paysanne. 'We are the ones who can cool the planet and feed the world', she added. There have been many COPs before and many more will follow, but their impact on public policies is minor. Sustainable development, green economy, REDD are the buzzwords of capitalism being hammered these days in Bonn. But social movements expect governments and multinationals around the negotiating table to deliver real solutions. To change the system, grassroots and peasant movements have to keep growing and establish more alliances. Our governments do not realize the urgency of the situation but the peasantry suffers from it on a daily basis. Food sovereignty and peasant agroecology - which should be understood in the context of national sovereignty - are the true solutions to build their resilience and resistance.

Conservation International issued the following news release: Conservation International joins leaders across the climate movement at COP 23 , the annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Bonn, Germany, November 6 - 17. Participating nations will meet to advance the goals of the Paris Agreement and achieve progress on its implementation guidelines. The negotiation session is hosted by the Government of Fiji, the first time a Pacific Island country has led these negotiations. Nature-based solutions to climate change are essential strategies for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. These climate solutions include: reducing deforestation, oceans and island-scale resilience, tropical reforestation, mangrove restoration, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal carbon management, and climate-resilient agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries. In anticipation of negotiations at COP 23 , Conservation International calls on countries to: expand use of nature-based solutions in national climate action, include natural climate solutions as part of market-based mechanisms, and Incorporate the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples in climate decisions and actions. Conservation International's oceans work will take center stage at several side events throughout the conference, highlighting key successes in the Pacific, a nod to the host of this year's negotiations. Conservation International will also highlight strategic collaborations with countries and non-state actors on protecting ocean health and coastal ecosystems through conservation and sustainable management. "Fiji and other Pacific Island nations are sharing here at COP23 the stark reality affecting indigenous people living off or near oceans today," said Shyla Raghav, Climate Lead, Conservation International. "Sea level rise, ocean acidification among others are shifting the Pacific Islands' way of life. Conservation International has been active in collaboration with Fiji, the Cook Islands, Samoa and other island nations on adapting to climate change impacts. Partners in the Paris climate accord are needed to ramp up action now on commitments and contribute to nature-based solutions preventing climate refugees from all island nations."

Syria will join the Paris Agreement on climate change, leaving the U.S. the only country that will not participate in the global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Multiple media outlets reported from the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, on Nov. 7 that Syrian officials have announced they will soon deliver their documents to formally join the global climate pact. The news follows a decision by Nicaragua in October to join the agreement as well, leaving the U.S. the lone country to back away from the deal that was signed a year ago. Nicaragua had originally declined to sign on, arguing that the deal was too weak to drive the change needed to combat climate change. The move by Syria is largely symbolic, as the Arab nation remains embroiled in a civil war. But leaders gathered for the Conference of the Parties 23 in Germany nevertheless welcomed the commitment, The Guardian reported. Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama speaks at the opening of the COP 23 Fiji UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 6. The two-week meeting is the first major conference on climate change since President Donald Trump said the U.S. will pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change unless his administration can secure a better deal. Source: AP Photo/Martin Meissner President Donald Trump announced in June, after much deliberation, that the U.S. would leave the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the deal, however, the process to do so cannot begin until 2020. The U.S. is therefore still a participant and is attending the latest discussions, which kicked off in Germany on Nov. 6. Reuters reported Oct. 28 that U.S. officials will have a large role to play behind the scenes as delegates to the Paris Agreement work in Bonn to develop a rulebook to govern the accord. The U.S. officials have pledged to be constructive and will even reportedly co-lead a section of the talks on transparency along with Chinese officials. But the U.S. has largely scaled back its participation outside of the more formal talks. The U.S. State Department did not hold any briefings that address the latest talks, and Reuters reported that the attendance of U.S. leaders is unclear. The U.S. also did not host a pavilion at this year's talks, as it has done previously. U.S. officials will, however, convene a side event called "The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation." The event does not yet list the speakers, but The New York Times reported Nov. 2 that officials from Peabody Energy Corp., NuScale Power LLC and Tellurian Inc. will participate. While the federal government intends to cease participation in the Paris accord, many state and local officials are stepping up. For instance, California Gov. Gerry Brown will spend about 10 days in Germany to underscore his state's continued commitment to the Paris Agreement. "While the White House declares war on climate science and retreats from the Paris Agreement, California is doing the opposite and taking action," Brown said in an Oct. 31 statement. "We are joining with our partners from every part of the world to do what needs to be done to prevent irreversible climate change." Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama is presiding over the Bonn conference, and he noted in his opening remarks the recent spate of devastating hurricanes and other extreme weather events that have battered the U.S. and other parts of the world. "The human suffering caused by intensifying hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, floods and threats to food security caused by climate change means there is no time to waste," said Bainimarama, who assumed the role of President of the COP 23 from Morocco on Nov. 6. \</doc>

In the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown is taking up the mantle of chief U.S. advocate for action on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions as the leader of the world's sixth-largest economy. Shortly after Trump made his decision, the governor announced that he will travel to China on June 2 to "strengthen California's long-standing, climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation." While in the country, he plans to visit Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces, which are members of the Under2 Coalition, a group of 170 cities, states and countries that have pledged to slash emissions 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050 in a bid to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees C or less. California and the German state of Baden-W\'fcrttemberg co-founded the Under2 Coalition in 2015 ahead of COP21 in Paris. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions, representing about 89 million people, or 28% of the U.S. population, have joined the Under2 Coalition, according to Brown's office. Brown will then fly to Europe to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, or COP 23 . "Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course," Brown said in a June 1 statement. "He's wrong on the facts. America's economy is boosted by following the Paris Agreement. He's wrong on the science. Totally wrong. California will resist this misguided and insane course of action. Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle." The governor's comments came as California lawmakers advanced a flurry of clean energy and environmental measures billed as "Trump insurance," including legislation that would set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2045. It would also accelerate the state's current 50% renewables portfolio standard by four years, to 2026, and set a new 60% requirement for 2030. "Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement confirms that Washington is retreating from being a global leader," Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\'f3n, the bill's author, said in a June 1 statement, echoing comments made at recent press conferences in Sacramento and Anaheim. "California already has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, and our economy dwarfs all but a handful of nations. This is our chance not just to lead the world in fighting climate change and cleaning the air we breathe, but to strengthen our middle class for decades to come with quality clean energy jobs that can support families and lift communities across our state." \</doc>

The following information was released by the UK Government: Global alliance, launched by UK and Canada, to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to the use of unabated coal power. An alliance of nations and states committed to moving the world from burning coal to cleaner power sources was launched today (16 November 2017) by more than 20 partners at COP23 , the United Nations climate change talks. The UK was one of the first countries to commit to ending unabated coal power generation by 2025. In July 2012, our generation profile still included 40% coal. In July this year, this fell to 2% and in April, the UK had its first full day when no coal was used for 135 years. The Powering Past Coal Alliance plans to grow to 50 or more members by this time next year. Its ambition is to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to unabated coal power. The members of the alliance commit to taking action such as setting coal phase out targets, committing to no further investments in coal-fired electricity in their jurisdictions or abroad. Unabated coal is the generation of electricity from a coal plant without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide. It emits twice as much CO2 as gas per unit of electricity. The announcement comes as the UK government prepares to launch its flagship Industrial Strategy to get the economy firing while building on its strengths like clean growth and embracing the opportunities of technological change. Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry, said: Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity. The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit. Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said: Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health, and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy and this is only the beginning. The new coalition will work with businesses, civil society and governments to offer technical and practical help to accelerate the transition away from coal. However, it recognises that not all countries can completely phase out the use of unabated coal at the same rate. To stay below the 2C target agreed as part of the Paris accord 2 years ago, OECD countries across the world need to phase out coal by 2030 and global use will need to reduce by two-thirds by 2040. Today's launch of the alliance comes after British Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the UK's commitment to phase out unabated coal by 2025 in a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September. In its first meeting, the alliance agreed that transitioning away from coal-fired electricity is one of the most important steps the international community can take to meet the aims of the historic Paris agreement at which the UK played a leading role 2 years ago. The UK has already begun its transition away from coal, in part as a result of renewable energy sources becoming cost effective. Offshore wind, for example, is now half the cost it was 2 years ago. Since 1990, the UK has reduced its emissions by 42%, while growing our economy by 67%. This is in no small part due to the 85% reduction in coal use we've seen in that time. However, domestic action alone is not enough. It is important that we restrict financing for coal projects abroad. The UK government announced in 2014 that it would end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances. UK Export Finance has not supported a coal project since 2002.

The Global CCS Institute issued the following news release: Policy parity and the rapid acceleration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are imperative to meeting Paris climate change targets, climate experts heard today. Launching its Global Status of CCS Report: 2017 today at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Global CCS CEO, Brad Page, said renewables alone would not meet international climate change targets, and expert opinion was conclusive that CCS must be part of a suite of clean technologies needed achieve below 2 degree targets. "In the past year, we have seen significant advances in the number of facilities being deployed and awareness of CCS as a pivotal climate change solution is the highest it has ever been. "Two large-scale facilities came onstream in the United States, eight moved into various stages of development in China, and in Europe, we have seen realisation that CCS is the only technology capable of decarbonising industry and creating a new energy economy - including hydrogen, bioenergy and 2degreeC re-use applications. "However, the challenge still remains to ensure that CCS receives the same consideration and incentivisation as other clean technologies, particularly renewables." Also speaking at the launch, Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, pointed out that the Paris Agreement had been drafted, signed and ratified to date by 169 countries at an unprecedented rate but that there was still a significant gap between the collective national commitments to cut emissions and the goals of the Agreement. He said: "Most serious analysis has concluded that it will be very difficult to achieve the Paris goals without carbon capture and storage or use." "We must pursue low-carbon and zero-carbon growth across the board in our cities, infrastructure and land use. Carbon capture and storage or use can play a key role in the transition to low-carbon economic growth and development in many parts of the world." Echoing these comments, Energy Future Initiative Distinguished Associate, Dr Julio Friedmann, said current policies in most jurisdictions were biased and short-sighted. "All the benefits commonly cited for renewables and nuclear, such as native industrial support, cost reduction, and emissions reduction, apply to CCS/CCUS as well. Attention must be paid, and speed is needed." The Global Status of CCS: 2017, includes a commentary from Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Patrick Suckling, who says we must pull all levers to implement the Paris Agreement. "Without CCUS, the IPCC says the cost of meeting global targets will double and the IEA says the energy transition would cost US$3.5 trillion more. Achieving the Paris Agreement's goals will require a renewed focus on international CCS/CCUS collaboration. A renewed push would provide governments with the confidence to develop technology neutral energy and climate change policies that provide incentives to all emissions reduction technologies, including CCUS. This will help to ensure our energy and industrial sectors are affordable and reliable as we transition to a lower emissions future." Also writing in the Report, the Father of the phrase "global warming", Colombia University Professor, Wallace Smith Broecker, said the dependence on fossil fuels will come to an end and the world will be powered by renewables. "But as this energy utopia lies many decades in the future, by the time we arrive there, we will be saddled with an atmosphere laden with excess CO2. Garbage brought disease to our streets. We learned to dispose of it. Sewage poisoned our waters. We learned to treat it. CO2 threatens to change our climate. Hence, we must learn how to capture and bury it." Key highlights from the Global Status of CCS: 2017 are:  To reach Paris climate targets:  more than 2000 CCS facilities will be needed by 2040  14 per cent of cumulative emissions reductions must be derived from CCS;  There are now 17 large-scale CCS facilities operating globally, with four more coming onstream in 2018;  Current CO2 capture is 37 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) - equivalent to removing eight million cars from the road each year;  CCS is the only clean technology capable of decarbonising industry - steel, chemicals, cement, fertilisers, pulp and paper, coal and gas-fired powered generation;  To date, more than 220 million tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 has been safely and permanently injected deep underground;  In Asia and the Pacific (APAC), 11 CCS facilities are in varying stages of development including eight in China;  In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), four large scale facilities are operating successfully (two in Norway and two in the Middle East), with two more in early development in the United Kingdom);  Twelve of the 17-large scale facilities in operation are located in the United States and Canada and two of those came onstream in the past twelve months (Petra Nova and Illinois Industrial);  CCS is now proving its versatility across five industrial sectors in the United States - natural gas processing, power, fertiliser, hydrogen and biofuels;  On a like-for-like basis, CCS is cheaper than intermittent renewables and costs continue to fall.

The following information was released by the Carnegie Institution for Science: all seen the photos. Long panel tables full of people from around the globe hashing out the intricacies of how to best fight climate change for endless grueling hours. But what's it like to be in the room? Carnegie's Geeta Persad will be there and she'll checking in with us periodically to offer an insider's look at the 3rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeor COP 23 for shortin Bonn, Germany. Persad says she hopes the experience will help her understand how scientific information is used as currency during the discussions. Her goal is to learn how scientists can make their work more accessible and useful to decisionmakers. But we get to come along for the ride and see how the process works through her eyes. Lucky us! As part of her observing efforts, Persad will meet with an assortment of people including academic delegations, past negotiators, and nonprofit group representatives. And we'll get to hear all about it. Persad's presence at COP 23 is motivated by a grant that she and Carnegie's Ken Caldeira recently received from the National Science Foundationalong with Jennifer Burney of University of California San Diego, Marshall Burke, of Stanford Earth System Science, and Eran Bendavid, of the Stanford Medical School. Together, the team of grantees aims to help countries optimize how they meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement with a focus on the short-lived air pollutants, like soot, which are co-emitted by many of the same processes that give off the longer-lived and much more commonly talked about carbon dioxide. After four years of work that will involve climate modeling and geospatial and economic analysis, they plan to build a simulator that will let users see how different mitigation options available to individual countries might map to different local and global costs and benefits. So watch this space for updates, and follow Persad on Twitter. \</doc>

The International Chamber of Shipping issued the following news release: The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is representing the world's national shipowners' associations and over 80 percent of the world merchant fleet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn this week. ICS will emphasise how the shipping industry is supporting the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop an ambitious CO2 reduction strategy. ICS Director of Policy, Simon Bennett explained: "ICS has a vision of zero CO2 emissions from shipping in the second half of the century. We are confident this will be achievable with alternative fuels and new propulsion technologies." ICS says its vision might be delivered with batteries or fuel cells using renewable energy, other new technologies such as hydrogen or even something not yet anticipated. In the meantime, the shipping industry has proposed that IMO Member States should adopt a suitably ambitious goal for reducing total emissions from the entire international shipping sector by an agreed percentage by 2050. ICS is pleased that a large number of IMO Member States have already come forward with detailed proposals. Several EU and Pacific island nations have jointly proposed that the sector should reduce total CO2 by as much as 70 percent by 2050. Mr Bennett commented: "Japan has set out in detail to IMO how a 50 percent total cut by 2060 might be achieved. In view of projections for future trade growth, an objective in this range, while still incredibly ambitious, therefore seems more realistic." He added: "It will be for governments to agree the actual reduction number when they adopt an initial IMO strategy next April. And this is also going to have to address the legitimate concerns of major economies such as China and India about the implications for future trade and their sustainable development." Whatever is decided, ICS says that the entire world fleet is probably unlikely to enjoy global access to new alternative fuels for at least another 20 or 30 years. Moreover, population growth and further improvements to global living standards will probably determine that demand for shipping must continue to increase, as it is already by far the most carbon efficient form of commercial transport. ICS says that, using a combination of technical and operational measures, the international shipping sector already appears to have reduced and held its total annual CO2 emissions at about 8 percent below its 2008 peak. This is despite an increase of about 30 percent in maritime trade, estimated in tonnes of cargo transported one nautical mile (tonne-miles) over the period up to the end of 2015. ICS cautions that these latest estimates by third parties will have to be verified by the next official IMO Greenhouse Study in 2019 using the new IMO CO2 Data Collection System. "They are nevertheless encouraging especially given the dramatic reduction in fuel prices since 2014. Moreover, a significant increase in marine fuel costs is expected in 2020 due to the mandatory global switch by the entire world fleet to low sulphur fuels. This should greatly incentivise, to the extent this is possible, the further reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by ships." said Mr Bennett.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., Nov. 8 -- Purdue University issued the following news release: A research team from Purdue University is attending the UN Climate Change Conference to conduct research for projects related to the Paris Agreement. COP 23 began Monday (Nov. 6) and runs through Nov. 17 in Bonn, Germany. The goal of the meeting is to work out some of the details related to the Paris Agreement, the so-called Paris Rulebook, which has to be finished at COP 24 in 2018. The Paris Agreement didn't create any legal obligations for states to act on climate change but required them to make voluntary promises of action toward shared goals every five years. To ensure parties keep their promises and to inform the regular revisions of these pledges, the agreement established a process for reviewing collective progress, also every five years, called the global stocktake. What this process will look like is yet to be determined. Manjana Milkoreit, an assistant professor of political science at Purdue, is leading research that seeks to support the design process. "The first global stocktake is set to happen in 2023, but it's unclear what that will look like," she said. "How often will they meet? Who's going to be there? What will they talk about? What kind of information will they have in front of them? All of these questions need to be worked out." Milkoreit is joined at the conference by graduate student Kate Haapala. They plan to sit in on negotiation sessions and interview participants to identify takeaways for the design of the global stocktake. "In particular, I'm going to ask what can be learned from existing mechanisms in other international institutions and past experiences within the climate change regime," Milkoreit said. "Between 2013 and 2015, there was a periodic review of the global temperature goal, and that process might serve as a useful blueprint for the global stocktake." Milkoreit also is working with a larger interdisciplinary team to design a science-policy engagement process using a serious game that will help climate negotiators learn about complex scientific concepts, such as climate tipping points. A tipping point is an abrupt shift in Earth systems, sometimes into an irreversible new state with major implications for life on Earth, such as the melting of major ice sheets or the degradation of coral reefs. Purdue professor Jason Reed and graduate student Roberta Weiner also are attending COP 23 . They plan to interview conference participants and observe negotiations with specific questions in mind: What do climate negotiators already know about climate tipping points, and what do they want or need to know? They'll use their observations to design the game back at Purdue. Milkoreit's team is focusing on a fairly specific set of questions, but conference attendees from other nations will likely come with one of their own: What will the role of the United States be in climate negotiations going forward? President Trump announced the country's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June, but as of now, that's purely symbolic; it isn't possible to formally pull out of the agreement until 2020. The American delegation is present at COP 23 , but how involved they will be and what aims they will pursue remain open questions.

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "A 2-degree Celsius increase in temperature will still mean the disappearance of our islands and homes, and consequently the death of our identity, language and culture," said Rev. Tafue Lusama, general secretary of the Tuvalu Christian Church, speaking at a side event organised by the World Council of Churches, Bread for the World, ActionAid, and Climate Action Now-South Asia at the 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP 23 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP 23 is currently underway in Bonn, Germany from 6-17 November. According to the 5th Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 2-degree Celsius rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels carries with it an increased risk of sea level rise and extreme weather events such as powerful storms, floods, droughts, and heat waves, particularly affecting small islands, the tropics and the polar regions. The landmark Paris Agreement obliges countries to keep global temperature rise to under 2 degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change. However, nationally determined contributions remain vastly insufficient to reach this target and the latest estimates indicate that the planet is well on track for at least a 3-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures, causing permanent and irreversible loss and damage. The Paris Agreement supported the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage which was established by the UNFCCC at COP 19 in Warsaw in 2013 to provide a platform for broadening our understanding of climate change impacts and exploring approaches to addressing loss and damage. "The government of Tuvalu was already raising the issue of loss and damage as early as 1991," said Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager at ActionAid and one of the panelists at the side-event. "Because we have failed over the last decades to sufficiently mitigate and adapt to climate change, there is now an urgent need to address climate-induced displacement as well as to provide funds to compensate for the loss and damage." While financial compensation is important for helping affected people and communities get back on their feet, it is not enough to truly remedy their suffering. "How can you value the loss of lives, lands, languages, and cultures in monetary terms?," asked Rev. Henrik Grape, who coordinates the WCC Working Group on Climate Change. Grape offered a moral and ethical perspective to the side-event topic. "Clearly these have non-material, even spiritual dimensions. As churches and faith communities, we need to foster deeper discussions on non-economic loss and damage caused by climate change and how it can really be redressed. In such discussions we need to ensure in the first place that the voices of the most vulnerable are heard. And we need to stand in solidarity with them." How can we practice solidarity? "Join us in our fight to keep global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius," said Lusama. "We do not want to become forced migrants, to lose our roots, to have no point of reference on the face of the planet. Therefore we need to act now."

SACRAMENTO, Calif. /California Newswire/ - In response to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued the following statement today: "Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course. He's wrong on the facts. America's economy is boosted by following the Paris Agreement. He's wrong on the science. Totally wrong. California will resist this misguided and insane course of action. Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle." Building on the global momentum to combat climate change and continuing California's leading role in broadening collaboration amongst subnational leaders, Governor Brown will travel to China tomorrow to strengthen California's long-standing climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation. The Governor will also attend the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany to represent subnational jurisdictions that remain committed to climate action. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, has advanced its nation-leading climate goals while also growing the economy. In the last seven years, California has created 2.3 million new jobs - outpacing most of the United States - cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a $27 billion budget deficit and has seen its credit rating rise to the highest level in more than a decade. California will resist this misguided and insane course of action. Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle. California's Leadership on Climate Change Governor Brown attended the United Nations' 2015 Climate Conference (COP21) at the invitation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary and France's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development. Over the course of the conference, the Governor met with the UN Secretary-General, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change, France's Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, the U.S. Energy Secretary and former Vice President Al Gore, and participated in a number of events with other world leaders. Last April, the Governor traveled to the United Nations Headquarters in New York to participate in events marking the first day parties signed on to the Paris Climate Agreement. California's ambitious climate action includes the Under2 Coalition - an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences - formed in 2015 by California and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany in the lead up to COP21. The growing coalition now includes 170 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.18 billion people and $27.5 trillion GDP - equivalent to 16 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the global economy. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions have joined the Under2 Coalition, representing 89 million people and 28 percent of the U.S. population. The Governor's upcoming trip to China includes meetings in Sichuan and Jiangsu, the first Chinese provinces to join the Under2 Coalition. In March, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. These efforts build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru, Chile, Australia ,Scotlandand Sweden and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. \</doc>

Nov 13, 2017( International Business Times News: HYPERLINK http://www.ibtimes.com http://www.ibtimes.com United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany, some bad news has surfaced. The latest projections for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2017 show an upward trend, reversing the near-flat growth seen the last three years. The forecast by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), published Monday in a series of reports in three different journals, says 2017 will see a record 41 billion tons of CO2 emissions globally, an increase of 2 percent compared to 2016. The years from 2014 to 2016, by contrast, had seen little-to-no growth in CO2 emissions, making the 2017 projections particularly worrisome. Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9 of the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, who was lead researcher for one of the reports, said in a statement[1] Monday: 'Global carbon dioxide emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing. With global carbon dioxide emissions from all human activities estimated at 41 billion tons for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius.' In another statement[2], Robert Jackson of Stanford University, who co-chairs GCP, also warned of a rising trend in 2018: 'Several factors point to a continued rise in 2018. That's a real concern. The global economy is picking up slowly. As GDP rises, we produce more goods, which, by design, produces more emissions.' The increase being seen in 2017 is led by China, whose CO2 emissions are set to grow 3.5 percent through the year. This, Jackson said, was despite green energy sources becoming increasingly popular in China but still being insufficient to meet the burgeoning energy demand  a gap that has been filled by 'new oil, coal and natural gas infrastructure.' Steam rises from the chimneys of the coal power plant of RWE in Neurath, Germany, March 4, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay CO2 emissions from the United States and the European Union are expected to fall by 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, but those declines are smaller than the average per year during the last 10 years. India's emissions are expected to rise by 2 percent, which is much slower than the average 6 percent increase seen during the last decade. A lot of the emissions from specific countries are linked to their economic activity, and therefore, an uptick in countries' gross domestic product growth could lead to a spurt in their CO2 emissions too. This was seen in 101 countries, where emissions grew in line with economic growth. However, 22 countries are expected to have reduced their emissions despite economic growth Carbon emissions from fossil fuels still account for an overwhelming chunk of total emissions  37 of the total 41 million tons. Energy from renewable sources has shown a rapid growth of 14 percent every year for the last five years, but that is off a low starting base, according to a statement[3] by Future Earth, a research initiative that partially sponsors GCP. But for the policymakers meeting at COP 23 , and for the rest of the world too, Jackson offers some hope, despite President Donald Trump's promises (so far largely unfulfilled) to revive the fossil fuel industry. 'This year's result is discouraging, but I remain hopeful. In the U.S., cities, states and companies have seized leadership on energy efficiency and low-carbon renewables that the federal government has abdicated. Prices for wind and solar power are plummeting, and batteries and storage are helping to balance supply and demand for electricity. The world's energy future is changing before our eyes.' The three reports  'Global Carbon Budget 2017[4],' 'Towards real time verification of CO2 emissions[5]' and 'Warning signs for stabilizing global CO2 emissions[6]'  appeared in Earth System Science Data Discussions, Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters respectively.

The following information was released by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) of Germany: COP23 , announced the creation of a Regional Pacific NDC Hub in the framework of the Partnership to facilitate NDC implementation. The NDC Partnership supports emerging economies and developing countries in translating the provisions of the Paris Agreement into national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Federal Development Minister Gerd Mller stated: "Those least able to defend themselves are the ones suffering most because of the impacts of climate change. That is why we support in particular developing countries in combatting the impacts of climate change - for instance, with tailor-made climate solutions for every country. The NDC Partnership provides the ideal framework to this end. It is the eleventh hour, and the only way to save the global climate is by joining forces." The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development will provide an additional 31 million euros for short-term support in the framework of the NDC Partnership which will be implemented by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the deutsche Gesellschaft fr internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Partnerships Secretariat. In addition, the Federal Development Ministry will provide start-up funding for the Regional Pacific NDC Hub together with the UK and Australia, among others. Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks commented: "Implementing national climate action programmes is a challenge for all countries. This makes it all the more important that we support one another and share what we are doing and how we can raise the level of ambition. The problem of climate change can only be resolved through multilateral action. This characterises the NDC Partnerships spirit." In the context of the NDC Partnership, the Federal Environment and Development Ministries are working closely together. Developed countries and multilateral institutions are supporting emerging economies and developing countries in achieving their NDCs and aligning them with their national development goals. To this end, they are promoting access to funding and technical support. NDC members are also involved in an exchange of knowledge and experience on climate action and adaptation measures. Since the Partnership was founded one year ago, its membership has almost doubled from 41 to 77 members, with 48 developing countries, 16 developed countries and 13 international organisations. The German Government has geared its entire climate finance amounting to 3.4 billion euros from budget funds in 2016 alone towards the NDCs of partner countries helping them to achieve their mitigation and adaptation goals. \</doc>

Christian Aid issued the following news release: "It is important that the world protects the Paris Agreement from the assault of President Trump" Ahead of the UN climate summit in Bonn next week, Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow, said that this was a fitting year to have the talks presided over by a small island state threatened with sea level rise. He said: "It is a historic moment for the UN climate negotiations to be in the hands of a country on the very front line of climate change. This year we have seen the terrible cost of a warming planet, especially with the island nations in the Caribbean bearing the brunt. "In Bonn it is vital that the reality of climate impacts suffered by the most vulnerable nations are brought into the heart of the negotiations and effective support provided to those in need. If climate impacts cannot be addressed at a COP under the presidency of a small island state in a year the world has experienced a slew of unprecedented extreme weather events then when can it be?" Adow added that as this is the first meeting since Donald Trump became American president it was an important opportunity to show the global effort to tackle emissions would not be derailed. He said: "It is important that the world protects the Paris Agreement from the assault of President Trump. So far Trump's announced withdrawal from the agreement has actually galvanised global action but it's vital that this is demonstrated clearly in Bonn. "The work done in Bonn will go a long way to laying the ground work ahead of next year's meeting where countries will take stock of their national pledges in the Paris Agreement and ratchet them up to ensure we deliver a safe and secure world for us all."

The following information was released by the United Nations: Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed's remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Pre-COP [Conference of Parties] Partnership Day in Suva, Fiji, today: I am so happy to be with you here in Fiji. Your commitment and partnership are what will make the Paris Agreement succeed in transforming our world. The Paris Agreement represents a turning point in international cooperation to combat climate change. It is a hallmark of the Agreement that so many leaders from cities, States, regions, territories, the private sector, the investment community and civil society came in with pledges and initiatives to take climate action. The enthusiastic support for the Paris Agreement as a key pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development continues. In the run-up to and during Climate Week in New York in September, on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, many more companies and local authorities committed to action. RE100, an initiative in which companies commit to 100 per cent renewable energy, welcomed new partners including Estee Lauder, Kellogg's and DBS Bank. EV100, launched this year, is bringing together companies committed to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and making electric transport the new normal by 2030. The Under2 Coalition, whose members are committed to reducing emissions by up to 95 per cent by 2050, welcomed new signatories, including major cities and the Marshall Islands, which became the seventeenth nation to endorse the Coalition. The Under2 Coalition now includes 187 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion of GDP equivalent to more than 16 per cent of the global population and 39 per cent of the global economy. We could spend all day trying to capture the breadth and scale of this momentum. We are moving taking important steps, but of course it is not enough. Paris is a global agreement of nations but it needs the global support of all sectors of society from all across the planet to minimize risks and provide security and opportunity for all. In the words of Frank Bainimarama, Fiji's Prime Minister and the incoming President of the next United Nations climate change conference , we need a grand coalition. While support for the Paris Agreement from subnational governments is gathering momentum in developed and developing countries alike, support from business and investors is still predominantly from Europe and the United States. This must change. So, I welcome the establishment of the Climate Action Pacific Partnership as an important new piece in the grand coalition jigsaw puzzle and a new catalyst for the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. The bringing together of business, investors, funders and Governments from within and outside the region to accelerate implementation of national climate action plans is a significant new development. The other challenge is to bring all sectors of society and the economy into alignment with the Paris Agreement's pathways, timetables and goals including finance, so that funding flows into the low-carbon, sustainable economy that must be the future. We must also engage and enrol the higher-emitting sectors of the economy. As some of you may recall, during the high-level segment of the General Assembly last month, the Secretary-General outlined six-high impact areas where our collective efforts can bring a structural change in the global and national economies: investing in clean technology; putting a price on carbon; making the energy transition; mitigating risk; augmenting the contribution of subnational actors and business; and mobilizing finance. Our shared challenge is to connect reality on the ground with collective action in these areas. By the 2019 Climate Summit, we must be able to show that climate action works and that transformation is well under way. I am very encouraged that a number of leaders have come forward. The Prime Minister of Sweden announced his intention to create a zero-emission steel industry through the full electrification of furnaces using hydrogen rather than coal as fuel. The Prime Minister of Denmark voiced his intention to establish a "Clean Energy Investment Coalition" to accelerate a shift from fossil fuels. The international Solar Alliance led by India and France intends to mobilize $1 trillion by 2030 and bring together rich countries to deliver solar energy in some of the poorest countries of the world. Let us also recognize the key role of non-State actors in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Secretary-General and I encourage all involved to uphold these pledges and commitments. This is just the kind of innovation that the Paris Agreement, supported by the private sector and partnerships, can catalyse and take to scale worldwide. I look forward to your outcomes here as a contribution to the success of the United Nations climate conference in Bonn. This is the next staging post for accelerating action and ambition. Urgency and speed must be our bywords. This Pre-COP and COP23 come against a backdrop of a distressing period of extreme weather events that have brought misery and economic damage to so many people, from Asia to the Caribbean and Central America and the United States. The Secretary-General is concerned that international governance and the global development system are not fit for purpose to address these challenges well in advance of their impacts. Besides removing barriers to accessing financing, innovative financing mechanisms are needed to meet the needs to middle-income countries that face such external shocks. Such events are virtually certain to become not only more frequent but more intense. It is time to rethink our approaches. I am pleased to note that these two Partnership Days are being spent on the crucial issue of better managing climate risk and building resilience. We know there is a lot more that can be done to assist and buffer small island developing States and vulnerable regions from such events. And there is a lot more that richer Governments, working with the private sector including the insurance and re-insurance industries can do to support countries and people to rebuild. I am pleased to see the German Government here, which I understand will announce plans at COP23 to take forward the InsuResilience initiative, aimed at helping 400 million of the world's poorest people with direct and indirect affordable insurance. COP23 in Bonn can also take forward the Clearing House on Risk Transfer, also requested at the 2015 Paris climate change meeting. We live in a world of rising risks from climate change including risks to the very life support systems upon which so many depend. These include our seas and our oceans so I welcome your discussions today on how to breathe life into the Oceans Pathway Partnership with a view to bringing action on healthier oceans into the United Nations climate change process by 2020. But, while the risks rise, so too does the momentum for change. Cities and regions, businesses and investors are playing a critical role, providing crucial support and new levels of creativity to help Governments as they fast-forward their climate action plans and the wider sustainable development agenda. So, I congratulate the Government of Fiji and everyone taking part in these Partnership Days here at the Pre-COP. Thank you for all your work. It underlines that the United Nations climate process is strengthening its foundations and potential. It shows that the Paris Agreement is not a chain that can be broken by a weak link, but a web of ever deepening and widening influence in terms of realizing a better, safer and more secure future for every one on Earth. Thank you. Environmental issues and sustainable development \</doc>

Jan 15, 2018( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 )[11]\~in November in Bonn, Germany. Several scientists from the World Agroforestry Centre took the opportunity to present their research findings at many of the side events, mostly highlighting the benefits that agroforestry brings to the fight against climate change. Our guest author, Tony Bartlett, ACIAR's Forestry Research Program Manager, discusses the\~impacts that agroforestry has had in North West Viet Nam[12]. During the\~ASEAN Working Group on Social Forestry[13]technical partners' meeting, held in Indonesia, the World Agroforestry Centre was tasked to develop high-level guidelines for member states to design and implement agroforestry policies. Watch how the\~Accelerating the Adoption of Agroforestry Project[14],\~also known as the Triple A, works with key groups in Kenya to reach thousands of households. This project aims to identify best practices in agroforestry for farmer-to-farmer learning championed by elected lead-farmers. Also look out for the story on how ICRAF is working with farmers in Indonesia to cultivate sandalwood as part of\~the Indonesia Rural Economic Development project[15]. ICRAF's Viet Nam office celebrated its 10th\~Anniversary with a number of key events. The organization signed an MoU with the Viet Nam Farmers' Association a group that plays a key and central role in farmers' movements in the country. This event was aired on\~VTV1[16]. In addition, ICRAF's Director General, Tony Simons, and Country Coordinator, Delia Catacutan,h were interviewed by\~VTC10[17]\~Television. During the interview, the two highlighted the organization's key activities in the region. The achievements of ICRAF-Viet Nam in transforming lives in South Asia with agroforestry in a short period of 10 years are truly commendable. Congratulations to the entire team for their determination and dedication. The first quarter of 2018 promises to be an eventful period. The World Agroforestry Centre will, during the first month, participate in the\~Second CGIAR General Assembly in Morocco[18]. A month after that, the organization will be involved in a number of key events including the\~Second European Symposium on Pollarding[19],\~Africa Climate Smart Agriculture Summit[20]\~and an international conference,\~Working Across Sectors to Halt Deforestation and Increase Forest Area[21]. The Centre continued to enjoy extensive\~media coverage[22]\~in the past few months. News stories covering our activities in Asia, America and Africa were carried in The Economist, Mongabay, Viet Nam News and other outlets. During this same period, the World Agroforestry Centre produced over 100\~publication[23]s[24]\~on its activities. Read about the factors affecting adoption of smallholder agroforestry systems in Indonesia, and how the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework was used to assess the extent vegetation characteristics contribute soil functions that are key to farmers' livelihoods. We'd like to wish our readers\~all the best for the festive season[25], and look forward to\~sharing more exciting stories in 2018! Agroforestry to Meet the Paris Agreement In a groundbreaking though long overdue decision, national delegates at the Twenty-third Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 23 ), held 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, agreed on a framework for addressing agriculture's impact on climate. The framework includes assessing soil health, soil carbon and water management, nutrient use and manure management, and the impact of climate change on socio-economics and food security.\~Read more...>[26] ICRAF Viet Nam Celebrates 10 Years 2017 has been a special year for ICRAF in Viet Nam. The country office celebrated its 10th\~Anniversary on 1st\~December in the presence of the Board of Trustees, Senior Leadership Team and other colleagues from its headquarters in Nairobi. The occasion was graced by Dr. Le Quoc Doanh, Vice Minister of Viet Nam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and witnessed by key national partners from government agencies, NGOs, multilateral organizations and the donor community in Hanoi.\~Read more...>[27] Impacts Through Agroforestry in Northwest Viet Nam In the northwest of Viet Nam the predominant farming system practised on large areas of very steep land involves monocropping of hybrid maize, which is mostly used for animal feed. This approach results in widespread soil erosion, a progressive decline in crop productivity and ongoing degradation of remnant forests.

Washington (November 17, 2017) - As the United Nations 23rd Conference of the Parties wraps up in Bonn, Germany, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led their colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector. "We will not allow President Trump's intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to turn America from leader to laggard on climate action," said Senator Markey. "In the face of the Trump administration's climate denial, state and local leaders, the business community, and the American people are taking action to address global warming and spur clean energy deployment. At COP23 , our delegation delivered the message that COP really stands for 'Can't Obstruct Progress' and that we are still in and we will win." "Denying climate change doesn't stop the climate from changing," said Senator Whitehouse. "And President Trump reneging on the Paris agreement can't erase America's commitment to meeting our climate goals. Rhode Island is still in. And so are states and cities across the country, leading corporations, and millions of Americans. We won't turn back." "President Trump can try to stop climate progress, but his denialism is no match for the incredible efforts of states, cities, businesses, and more all over the U.S. who are stepping up in his place," said Senator Merkley. "By working together toward a bold vision of 100% clean and renewable energy, grassroots America can and will keep the U.S. on track to meet or even exceed our Paris commitment."

Other Senators co-sponsoring the resolution include Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.).

The following information was released by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM): Member States at the annual Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ), convening from 6 17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, have today adopted a new roadmap to incorporate gender equality and womens empowerment in climate change discourse and actions. The creation of a Gender Action Plan was agreed upon by the Parties at last years conference (COP22), to bolster the role of women in climate action. Women commonly face higher risks in responding to natural hazards and greater burden from the impacts of climate change. Although they have intimate local knowledge and are managers of common natural resources, they are often left out of the picture when decisions on climate action are made. The aim of the Gender Action Plan is to ensure that women can influence climate change decisions, and that women and men are represented equally in all aspects of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as a way to increase its effectiveness. As the agreement on the Gender Action Plan was finalized, President of COP23 and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, welcomed the result and said to the UN: This recognizes the role of women in climate action. It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy both nationally and internationally, added Nazhat Shameen Khan, the Chief Negotiator for the COP 23 Presidency, also according to the UN. The Gender Action Plan sets out, in five priority areas, the activities that will help achieve this objective. These range from increasing knowledge and capacities of women and men through workshops and information exchanges, so that they can systematically integrate gender considerations in all areas of their work, to pursuing the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in national delegations, including women from grassroots organizations, local and indigenous peoples and women from Small Island Developing States Other priority areas refer to the need to increase integration of the gender considerationssuch as addressing womens specific vulnerability to natural disasters as well as understanding womens role in agriculture and food production, and supporting women entrepreneurs in the energy sectorinto the areas of work of all Parties to the Convention; and to increase climate-related financial resources that integrate gender priorities and reflect the needs of women and girls. Lastly, the Gender Action Plan seeks to improve tracking of the implementation of the gender-related decisions. UN Women provided technical support to the Parties throughout the process of developing the Gender Action Plan. The organizations Deputy Executive Director, Yannick Glemarec, welcomed the decision, saying: The Gender Action Plan is the culmination of two decades of efforts to integrate gender perspectives in climate negotiations. It will help practitioners and stakeholders leverage co-benefits between gender equality and climate action to achieve sustainable development. The first report to evaluate the progress on the implementation of the Gender Action Plan will be presented in November 2019. \</doc>

PRESS RELEASE AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands, 10 November 2017 - LeasePlan Corporation N.V., a global leader in fleet management, will today announce at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, the launch of its electric vehicle pilot program for corporate companies. The launch of the pilot program marks another step in LeasePlan's ambition to achieve net zero emissions from its total fleet by 2030. LeasePlan's new electric vehicle pilot program is designed to make it as easy as possible for the growing number of companies that want to make the switch to low-emission vehicles. The pilot is fully scalable: customers choose how many electric vehicles form part of the pilot. LeasePlan will also facilitate the implementation of charging infrastructure at customers' offices and employees' homes. Wherever possible, LeasePlan will work with partners to ensure the charging infrastructure is supplied with 100% renewable energy. Carbon offsetting will also be available for the non-electric cars that do not form part of the pilot. The full pilot will be available in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK from December, with a further rollout planned for Italy, Spain and Sweden in the first quarter of 2018. CEO Tex Gunning: "We see an increasing demand for electric vehicle fleets from corporate companies that want to lower their overall emissions and help tackle climate change. As part of our 2030 Sustainability Strategy, LeasePlan is fully committed to helping these customers make the switch. We're therefore delighted to be launching our electric vehicle pilot program for large corporate organizations here at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn. Making the switch to an electric fleet is one of the simplest ways for companies to rapidly lower their emissions and help tackle climate change - and we are committed to facilitating those companies that want to make the transition." Sustainability strategy Today's announcement marks another milestone in LeasePlan's sustainability strategy, which aims to achieve net zero emissions from the total LeasePlan fleet by 2030. Key elements in the strategy include educating customers on What's next in low-emission vehicles; facilitating the uptake of low-emission vehicles with attractive customer propositions developed by the LeasePlan Electric Vehicle Experience Centre; leading the development of a sophisticated second-hand car market of well-maintained, high-quality lease vehicles; and transitioning LeasePlan's own employee fleet to an electric vehicle fleet by 2021. LeasePlan is also a founding partner of EV100, a new global business initiative designed to fast-track the uptake of electric vehicles and infrastructure, launched by The Climate Group around the UN General Assembly in September.

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued the following remarks at the high-level event at COP23 : "I thank Prime Minister Bainimarana for his remarks. And I want to congratulate him for his remarkable Presidency of COP23 . My sincere gratitude for the excellent work that Fiji, the Government of Fiji and yourself, Prime Minister, have done. "And you are right. We need more ambition. We must go further and faster together. "It is fitting that this year's conference is led by Fiji, a nation on the frontlines. "Last month I visited other small islands facing the impacts of a warming world: Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica. "The hurricanes' damage was beyond belief. "The catastrophic effects of climate change are upon us. "And the voice of small island State that are on the frontlines of the impact of climate change must the voice of us all. "In the battlefield, when the frontline is decimated, the whole army is lost. And the same would happen to the planet with climate change. "Floods, fires, extreme storms and drought are growing in intensity and frequency. "Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they have been for 800,000 years. "Climate change is the defining threat of our time. "Our duty -- to each other and to future generations -- is to raise ambition. "We need to do more on five ambition action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership. "First, reducing emissions. "The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report shows that current pledges will only deliver a third of what is needed to stay in the safety zones of the Paris Agreement. "The Global Carbon Project reported earlier this week that 2017 will see the first increase in CO2 emissions in three years. "The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less. "And we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees. "We need at least a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. "Yet there are also encouraging signs of progress. "For years, many insisted that lowering emissions would stifle growth, and that high emissions were the unavoidable cost of progress. "Today that dogma is dead. We are beginning to de-couple emissions from economic growth. "Massive economies such as China and India are on track to surpass their Paris pledges. "Carbon markets are growing and merging. The Green Bond market is expanding. "It is crucial for all countries to follow through on their Paris commitments. "The agreement itself calls for raising ambition -- and so I urge you to use the 2020 revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions to close the 2030 emissions gap. "Ladies and Gentlemen, "Mitigation is essential, but climate change is already upon us, and will only worsen in the short-term. "It is essential that we adapt and that we strengthen resilience. "The Green Climate Fund can play a catalytic role on this, and I appeal to its members, especially donor nations, to bring this mechanism fully to life. "I have also asked the UN system to promote adaptation and resilience efforts at the country level. "I commend the 2015 pledge by G7 nations to provide insurance against extreme weather events for 400 million more vulnerable people by 2020. "And I welcome the announcement here in Bonn, led by the Government of Germany, to fast forward this ambition. "The insurance industry itself has long sounded the alarm about climate change. "The industry is keen to promote coverage for people at risk -- and it is pressing business and governments alike to figure climate shocks into their planning, policies and operations. "I will do everything to facilitate these efforts. "Third, finance. "Greater ambition on emissions, adaptation and resilience is inextricably linked to funding. "We need to mobilize the agreed 100-billion-dollars annually for developing countries. "Upholding this promise is essential for building confidence and trust. "It is crucial for enabling all countries, but especially the most vulnerable, to face inevitable climate impacts and to grow their economies cleanly. "In addition, markets can and must play a central role in financing a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. "Yet markets need to be re-oriented away from the counter-productive and the short-term. "We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future that will place savings and societies at risk. "Infrastructure investment will be crucial. "The world should adopt a simple rule: if big infrastructure projects are not green, they should not be given the green light. "Otherwise we will be locked into bad choices for decades to come. "Investing in climate-friendly development is where the smart money is headed. "I welcome the initiative of President Macron to convene the "One Planet summit" next month to focus on financing. "I will be working to scale up international financing in renewable and energy efficiency projects to reduce at least 1 gigaton or more of carbon emissions by 2020. "The formation of a clean energy investment coalition, as proposed by Denmark, is an idea worth pursuing. "We should also work with greater determination towards carbon pricing. "This is a key instrument for driving down greenhouse gas emissions. "More than half of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement cite the need for carbon pricing. "Last year, carbon pricing initiatives generated 22 billion dollars. "Growing carbon markets in Europe and North America, and China's expected announcement of one of the world's largest emissions trading systems, are a good sign. "But to meet the Paris goals we need at least 50 per cent global coverage and a higher price on carbon to drive large-scale climate action. "I urge G20 countries to set a strong example. "The fourth ambition action [area] is partnerships. "Partnership -with the private sector, local and regional governments and civil society -- will make or break efforts to implement the Paris Agreement. "In particular, the only way to keep below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees is to mobilize the private sector to move on an energy transformation. "With government incentives, such as clean energy and transport policies, business can move the markets to promote the green economy we need. "We need to engage global technology giants, the oil and gas sector and the automotive industry so their business plans are consistent with the Paris goals. "And we need to engage the agricultural and forestry sectors to ensure climate friendly land use. "But we must engage all actors -- national, regional and local governments, philanthropists and investors and consumers -- in the transformation to a low-emission economy. "Cities and civil society can and must play a crucial role in bringing about this fundamental shift. "Next year, the Governor of California and my special envoy Michael Bloomberg, together with Anand Mahindra, will bring together cities, states, businesses and citizens' groups to encourage further commitments from these vital actors. "One can see action everywhere, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider landscape of actors and institutions. "Let us build on this momentum. "Ladies and Gentlemen, "Solutions to climate change will enable us to meet many of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. "I encourage you to be bold in your deliberations and decisions here in Bonn - and at home. "By embracing low-carbon climate-resilient policy making, you can set the world on the right path. "And where you lead, business and civil society will follow. "In September 2019, I will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels. "More immediately -- in this 20th anniversary year of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Climate Change Convention -- I call on all relevant nations that have not done it so to ratify the Doha Amendment. "I also call on world leaders to ratify and implement the Kigali Amendment to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer.. "I can think of no greater way to show your people that you care for the well-being of your citizens than to claim the mantle of climate leadership. "Show courage in combatting entrenched interests. "Show compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children. "As a former politician myself, I have no doubt that in today's world, this is the path to progress today and a meaningful legacy for tomorrow. "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, "Ultimately, there is only one ambition that matters - to build a secure world of peace, prosperity, dignity and opportunity for all people on a healthy planet: sustainable and inclusive development. "The world counts on your wisdom and foresight. This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 15, 2017. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6076778 MSTRUCK \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Investment Bank (EIB): This inaugural Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP) EUR 5 million investment will support energy efficiency and renewable energy development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The investment will enable the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to leverage private funding, increasing impact in the region. The objective is to achieve annual primary energy savings of 125,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of 35,000 metric tons. The recently launched Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, a joint initiative between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Government of Luxembourg, is investing EUR 5 million in C Shares of the Green for Growth Fund (GGF). This first investment of the platform was announced today by the EIB at COP 23 , the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference. Speaking at COP23 The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform will fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The GGF is an ideal investment partner due to its proven capability to facilitate investments of households, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises into energy efficiency and renewable energy. The GGF also has strong experience in direct financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in low and middle-income countries. Through its innovative public private partnership structure, the GGF is able to leverage public financial resources with private investments High impact is additionally achieved through on-the-ground support and capacity-building activities from the fund's Technical Assistance Facility. LCFP's EUR 5 million investment will focus on climate change mitigation in the MENA region. In 2016, the GGF expanded to the MENA region, where it sees a high demand for the implementation of energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy. Speaking at COP23 Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, said: For Luxembourg, being an important financial centre, unlocking private finance is a key objective. We are very pleased to partner with the EIB on the Climate Finance Platform. Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg Minister for the Environment, said: We need innovative solutions to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. This initiative will finance three projects that would otherwise struggle to attract private investment, especially climate adaptation projects in developing countries. Background information: About the EIB The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, is committed to supporting implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and backing climate-related investment around the world. The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020. At COP23 HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/cop23 www.eib.org/ About the GGF The Green for Growth Fund invests in measures designed to cut energy use and CO2 emissions by a minimum of 20% in 19 markets across Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova, the Middle East and North Africa.

More than 700 activists gathered in Suva, Fiji's capital, to explore the latest trends - from climate change to human rights, from innovation to social justice. Anything that can help empower and mobilise citizens. The lively debates in panel discussions, workshops and lectures made the event look like a carnival of creative new ideas and tested knowledge. The Innovation Lab brought together human rights defenders to share their tools, tactics and strategies. Oxfam addressed the long term problems that the 300 nuclear tests in the Pacific had caused. And the Public Interest Registry taught participants how to inspire donors to give and supporters to take action. A lot of attention went to activist stars like Kumi Naidoo (Greenpeace, CIVICUS, ...), Helen Clark (former prime minister of New Zealand) and Jose Ramos-Horta (former president of Timor-Leste). The youthful and charming winners of the 'Nelson Mandela - Graca Machel Innovation Awards' won many hearts when the annual prize was handed out. Special focus on the Pacific For the first time this global event was hosted in the Pacific. The conference focussed on the plight of small islands affected by rising sea levels and more frequent and extreme weather. "The peoples of the Pacific, like those in other small island states, have to tackle the devastating impacts of climate change alongside other development challenges," says Danny Sriskandarajah, secretary general of CIVICUS. CIVICUS, an alliance for citizen participation, organized the conference in cooperation with PIANGO, the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation. Fiji has taken a leading role in the Pacific to address climate change. The republic has already presided over the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn and co-hosted the UN Oceans Conference in New York earlier this year. It collaborates closely with other Pacific states and territories. Brianna Fruean, a 19 year old student from Samoa, is one of the Pacific Climate Warriors, a cooperation between 12 island nations. "My grandfather liked to take me to the markets to look at the rich variety of fish. But the corals are devastated due to climate change. If you go to the fish markets now it's not so plentiful anymore. That's how my passion for climate change began." "It is critical that every person on this planet recognizes the importance of what is going on in the Pacific," says Danny Sriskandarajah. "Everybody must act. Whether it is change in their consumption behavior or putting pressure on their local and national authorities." Many inspirational voices Speaking at the closing event, Joanna Kerr - the Canadian head of Greenpeace - said that the problem of climate change will require enormous civil society mobilisation to address. "The problem is so huge it can be hard to stay optimistic. But the hope and resilience of the Pacific gives us hope." She applauded the ordinary Pacific peoples' appreciation for climate change. Another inspirational voice of hope was that of Victor Ugo, a Nigerian doctor. He came to ICSW to collect his 'Nelson Mandela - Graca Machel Innovation Award' for his work on developing awareness on mental health in Nigeria. He experienced several eye-openers at the conference. "I'm eager to go home and try out all the things that I've learned here in Fiji. I want to help people with mental illnesses to speak out so they can achieve something in their communities. There is still an awful lot of work to do in Nigeria on mental health. But challenges are not restrictions," Ugo said. If conferences are about motivating people to keep on going forward, then ICSW has done its job. This article is part of a series about the activists and communities of the Pacific and small island states who are responding to the effects of climate change. Leaders from climate and social justice movements from around the world met in Suva, Fiji from 4-8 December for International Civil Society Week. \</doc>

Greenpeace International issued the following news release: Tomorrow, environmental organisations Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth take on the Norwegian government in court for opening up new areas in the Arctic to oil drilling. They are arguing that drilling for oil violates the Paris Agreement as well as the Norwegian constitution. Winning the case could set a precedent for future climate cases around the world. Norway's Grandparents Climate Campaign has also joined the case, as intervenors against the government and in support of the environmental groups. Truls Gulowsen, Head of Greenpeace Norway said: In the trial, set for 14-23 November, the plaintiffs will argue that the Norwegian government has violated the right to a healthy and safe environment for future generations granted by the Norwegian Constitution. This will be the first time this right is used in court. Around the world some 90 countries have a Constitutionally protected right to a healthy environment, and this lawsuit can have a ripple effect helping guide other jurisdictions on how to interpret these rights in their legal systems, and inspiring more people to hold their governments to account. Ingrid Skjoldvcr, Head of Nature and Youth, added: At the same time as the climate trial starts in Norway, Fiji is hosting the United Nations climate change conference COP 23 in Bonn, and attending the first day of the trial in Oslo are two young Pacific Islanders representatives from Fiji. Alisi Nacewa, Pacific Island Represent activist said: "We are here in Norway because our home is on the frontline of climate change. Our way of life is being impacted by extreme weather and rising sea levels right now. There is no way the continuation of oil and gas extraction, can deliver a world below 1.5 degrees. No way. No matter how politicians try to spin it. The Norwegian government has signed the Paris Agreement but they continue to drill for oil and supply the world with more fossil fuels. The two are in complete contradiction. It's time to hold countries accountable for breaking their Paris commitments." The Norwegian government will defend their decision to, for the first time in 20 years, open up a new oil drilling area in the Barents Sea, allowing 13 oil companies to start new exploration campaigns in the Arctic. Norwegian state-owned Statoil has already begun their drilling operations in the Arctic this summer. The 13 oil companies that have new license blocks in the Barents Sea are: Statoil (Norway), Capricorn, Tullow and Centrica (UK), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (USA), DEA (Germany), Aker BP (Norway), Idemitsu (Japan), Lukoil (Russia), Lundin Petroleum (Sweden), OMV (Austria), PGNiG (Norway/Poland).

The office of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., issued the following news release: Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after the Trump administration announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Senator Shaheen is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, as part of a congressional delegation, traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference . "This decision is a devastating blow to America's global leadership with grave implications for New Hampshire and future generations," said Shaheen. "Climate change is not only a direct and growing threat to New Hampshire's environment and economy, but to our national security as well. The Trump administration has just squandered an historic opportunity to curb global emissions and mitigate the dangerous effects of climate change. The Trump administration has also, once again, needlessly undermined our relationships with key allies by sending the message that we can't be trusted to honor our international agreements. I strongly urge President Trump to reconsider this short sighted decision." Copyright Targeted News Services 07M-Vitin-5881203 07M-Vitin \</doc>

The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development issued the following news release: As the latest round of United Nations climate talks reaches its conclusion, CAFOD says countries have made progress on some aspects of a plan to tackle climate change, but still have significant work to do when they meet again in a year's time. Nearly 200 countries met in Bonn, Germany, for two weeks of talks on how to implement the Paris climate agreement, which was agreed in 2015 and aims to cut carbon emissions and limit global temperature increases to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. CAFOD campaigns for action on climate change because it is affecting the poor communities it works with overseas, pushing people back into poverty in many areas. CAFOD says positive progress was made on defining a 'rulebook' for how the agreement will work, although there is still a lot of decisions to be made at the next round of talks, scheduled to take place in Poland in November 2018. There was dismay at this year's talks at attempts to promote the use of coal by the United States, which President Donald Trump has said will withdraw from the Paris agreement - leaving it the only country in the world outside the accord. Other countries rallied to fill the leadership vacuum left by America, with several countries joining an alliance led by the UK and Canada agreeing to phase out the use of coal for power generation by 2030. However, CAFOD says despite the positive steps taken in many areas, money remains the real sticking point for achieving the goals of the Paris agreement. Sally Tyldesley, Climate Analyst at CAFOD, said: ""Ultimately, to build the trust needed now to deliver the Paris agreement, developing countries need to feel assured that richer nations that have caused the problem are going to stump up the cash they've promised to help poorer countries cope with climate change. There's been a sense this year of developed countries hiding behind negotiations on other issues, such as agricultural policy, to avoid reaching the point where money has to be talked about, but developing countries want to see that richer nations are doing more than just expressing sympathy and empathy and instead are putting their money where their mouth is on climate action." The Catholic Church and 18 Catholic development agencies from around the world joined forces at the climate talks to launch a new paper, Climate Action for the Common Good, to encourage governments to respond to the climate challenge in a way that reflects the spirit of Pope Francis's landmark encyclical Laudato Si', which was credited as having a significant impact on the world successfully agreeing a global climate deal in Paris[1]. The Church aimed to remind governments that massive transformational change is needed to tackle climate change, in the cultural, economic, social and spiritual perspectives of today's lifestyles and for future generations. Fr. Bruno Marie Duffe, Secretary for the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, said of the paper's launch: "We should not underestimate the importance of the moment we are in now. We are in the middle of the river, and we cannot go back. We have to be together, and we have to be strong, even if one state decides to go back. We have had the Paris agreement and now we have to move from the ethical intentions to making the political happen, and to do that we will need a new model of development that is rooted in dialogue and mutual solidarity, and that recognises the talents that each party has to contribute."

Unless HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/canada Canada steps up to the plate now, the upcoming meeting, also known as the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parities ( COP23 ), could become one more missed opportunity for Canada. Canada has -- since the nation's abdication from the Kyoto Accord in 2011 -- been a relative laggard on climate change policy. According to the HYPERLINK 2017 Climate Change Performance Index , released by the Climate Action Network Europe, Canada still ranks among the worst of the 58 countries assessed.

For Norway, electric vehicles represent a strategic industry that will boost its economy.

On a sector-by-sector basis, we should implement carbon reduction policies by specific dates. Most carbon emissions come from the energy and transportation sectors; focusing on these can be tremendously effective at reducing carbon emissions. We could, for example, ban the use of combustion engines in vehicles by 2025, stop all newly proposed pipeline projects and plan a phase out of tar sands operations by 2030. Canada should also phase out coal-fired and gas power plants in favor of renewable energy by 2025. Other sectors such as buildings, agriculture and industry also emit greenhouse gases, and must be addressed. Definitive policies in a stable environment are critical for building Canada's future clean sustainable industries. By standing out on climate change, Canada would win international respect and regain the trust that it has recently lost. Global Connections If Canada leads on the Paris Agreement, the country demonstrates that it is a viable trade partner in Europe's eyes. EU nations have a HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/towards-circular-economy_en defined circular economy International trade could also reduce our economic reliance on the United States, a nation that is increasingly isolating itself, and connect Canada -- and the provinces -- to markets that would allow us to be part of the global circular economy. Sustainable development opportunities with the European Union, China and India could open markets for Canadian provinces whose economies now rely on fossil fuels, allowing for their economic diversification. These provinces need support to make the shift. Eight years ago, Canada set a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. That target now looks unattainable, but it could still meet the 2030 target of reducing emissions by 30 percent relative to 2005 levels. The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is a step in the right direction, but we need more. As long as Canada's climate policies continue to feed fossil fuel use, the country will not lead at COP23 -- a missed opportunity at a crucial time.

By Garima Maheshwari What was expected and proclaimed to be a rather technical working conference to hash out the rules for 2018 is turning out to be a political minefield with the potential to undermine the very basis of 'climate justice' that has formed the core of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1992. On the very first day of COP-23 , at the plenary session itself, the presidency held by Fiji has backtracked on the pre-2020 promises to the majority of developing countries, grouped under coalitions like 'like minded developing countries', 'BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China)' and G-77+China. Fiji twisted the hard-fought inclusion of 'pre-2020 commitments' on the COP-23 agenda and declared that they would not be discussed in the main negotiations. Under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period, the pre-2020 commitments obligate the developed countries to meet their mitigation targets and also provide 'mean of implementation' - like finance, technology and capacity-building - to developing countries. Post-2020, as envisioned in Paris, even developing countries would be nearly equal partners in mitigation. The understanding that the pre-2020 commitments would be fulfilled had allowed for consensus on discussing ambitious mitigation commitments by developing countries. The commitments arising out of historical responsibility of the developed countries forms the core of climate justice, hard-won by developing countries since 1992 under UNFCCC. India, China and others have always been clear that the Paris Agreement falls within the UNFCCC, and yet the attempt now is to subvert the principles of UNFCCC itself. One wonders why Fiji is playing this politics. The island nation wants the temperature limit controlled up to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels; and for that, ambitious mitigation action is necessary. Although this can be justified, would it not make more sense to compel the developed countries to stick to their mitigation targets and other commitments (since that would also incentivise developing countries to ramp up climate action)? This would have been the most rational course to take for Fiji and it would have kept all parties on board, instead of alienating a whole section of developing countries and the African group of least developed countries that acutely needs the finance. It would have cohered with Fiji's understandable ambitions to leave a mark or a legacy on the COP. The only explanation for Fiji's hostile turnaround is that it has joined forces with the developed countries' bargaining positions. This politics renders the term climate justice vacuous and vulnerable to political appropriation. The term is often used loosely in the COPs, and the implications of each definition would be very different. It has become even more vacuous and narrowly quantified ever since the Paris Agreement provided breathing space to countries. While everyone was complacent at Paris (despite its weak climate pledges), now the whole thing seems to be backfiring and threatening the very nature of climate regime built over the last 25 years. This space is being utilised by advanced historical emitters and developing countries alike. For the advanced historical emitters, attempting to avoid pre-2020 commitments and focusing mainly on mitigation actions after 2020, would solve the purpose of letting the advanced polluting economies go scot-free on their earlier commitments as well as avoid the tricky issues of finance and technology transfers by privileging mitigation over adaptation. Developing countries appear cornered for now. From the way the current political positions are panning out, even speculations about China assuming leadership at Bonn seem exaggerated. Countries' political positions are determined more by their alliances and less by sincere climate action back home. In fact, in the latter case, India is about to meet its 2030 commitments, but the vexatious politics at UNFCCC is far from being in India's favour. China may have allied with the US at Paris, but right now the usual multilateral voice of G-77 and 'like minded developing countries' would likely predominate. Nevertheless, these countries will find themselves on the backfoot in the mitigation debate. They may refuse to cooperate altogether on the post-2020 Paris agenda if the pre-2020 commitments and mobilisation of finance is not done. By also stressing that adaptation is a priority for developing countries, the adaptation versus mitigation debate threatens to lock down critical aspects of negotiations. This would be a loss for the island states. The G-77+China and the island states have a lot to share - including critical issues like mobilising finance for the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage (which has been perennially stuck because of developed countries' resistance). Therefore, alienating the developing countries under the delusion that ambitious mitigation action is possible by allying with the developed countries will only obstruct climate action further. Disasters due to climate change are a reality and current pledges and measures can only be temporary palliatives, but even so, to bargain over the bare minimum of commitments shows that climate inaction is here to stay.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry issued the following news release: On the second day of FICCI's delegation visit to UNFCCC, COP 23 Bonn a side event was organized at the Fiji Pavilion by FICCI. The side event titled Innovative Climate Financing for Adaptation and Resilience was a COP 23 endorsed event and was in line with the Fiji's call for nations at the COP 23 to build a grand coalition between Government, civil society and the private sector to improve the resilience of all vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change is incredibly important for carving out next steps for success. The session highlighted the possible steps that these countries and different stakeholders can take to adapt to climate impacts through innovative financing. While giving his keynote address, Mr. Upendra Tripathy, Interim Director General, International Solar Alliance (ISA) spoke on Innovative financing for building resilience. He underscored the importance of ISA Solar Pumps Programme and how it can help in providing scale for adaptation and building resilience in the prospective member countries. The session was moderated by Ms. Rita Roy Choudhury, Assistant Secretary General, FICCI and she highlighted that the private sector has an important role to play in adaptation and building resilience by mobilizing financial resources and technological capabilities, leveraging the efforts of governments , engaging civil society and community and develop innovative climate services and adaptation technologies. Ms. T. S. Raji Gain, Chief General Manager, NABARD highlighted the Major Resilience Building initiatives by NABARD- the NRM based initiatives like the Participatory Watershed Development Programmes Tribal Development Projects for sustainable livelihoods etc. and the Innovative Financial Models like the UPNRM which entails replacement of irrigation pump sets, energy plantation and renewable energy deployment among others. Mr. Manish Chourasia, Managing Director, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited, while mentioning that mitigation receives almost twice as much finance from the private sector as from the public sector highlighted the need of factoring in the climate risks into development and shift in mentality from donation based approach. Mr. Dinesh Pruthi, Deputy General Manager, NABARD while giving examples of initiatives like the affordable housing scheme mentioned that adaptation financing is one of the key focus areas for SBI which is India's largest Bank. Mr. Leonard Chan - Vice Chair, Fiji Business Risk Resilience Council while speaking on Business risk resilience and the role of innovative financing in the context of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) underscored that it is extremely important to build public private partnerships by creating Business Government networks for the success of innovative financing and models. Speaking on the Innovative financing for adaptation: Experiences from India, Dr Ashish Chaturvedi, Director-Climate Change, Indo-German Environment Partnership-Rural Areas, GIZ India highlighted that it is important to understand the linkages between climate change , national and developmental priorities and utilizing the indigenous knowledge plays a big role in autonomous adaptation.

The following information was released by the Government of Sweden: Negotiations on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement have been constructive, but have been marked by tough discussions, especially regarding how countries are to report their emissions. Countries have now submitted their views on the rules, and work is now continuing to ensure a decision on the rules can be taken next year. Negotiations on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement have been constructive, but have been marked by tough discussions, especially regarding how countries are to report their emissions. Countries have now submitted their views on the rules, and work is now continuing to ensure a decision on the rules can be taken next year. Alongside negotiations on the rules, decisions have also been reached on several important issues. The Fijian Presidency put forward a proposal for the 'Talanoa Dialogue', which will be the first opportunity since Paris for countries to evaluate how global climate action corresponds to the 1.5 degree Celsius goal and how ambitions can be raised. Sweden also announced that it is concluding its ratification of the Doha Amendment that establishes the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. "Sweden is now leading the EU in concluding its ratification of the Doha Amendment. We are pleased that the EU has also announced that it will conclude ratification before the end of the year," says Minister for International Development Cooperation Isabella Lovin. The Doha Amendment means 20 per cent joint emission reductions compared to 1990 levels by 2020, when the first commitment period of the Paris Agreement begins. "We are also providing an additional SEK 185 million each to the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund, which is an important signal to many developing countries that we are prepared to resolve the issue of financing climate action," says Ms Lovin. At the conference, the UK and Canada launched the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance', a global coalition to phase out traditional coal power. Sweden and more than 20 other countries have already joined the alliance. A two-year gender action plan (GAP) for gender-responsive implementation of the Paris Agreement was also adopted at the conference. The GAP will ensure women's participation in negotiations and decision-making processes. It is also gratifying that the £ction agenda', which gathers civil society actors, is larger than ever and has contributed positive momentum to the negotiations. The first Yearbook of Climate Action, capturing climate actions taken since 2016, was launched at the conference. The Yearbook shows that 70 per cent of the initiatives have launched new commitments since 2016 and that around half of these have set emissions reduction targets. The participation of civil society in reducing emissions will play a vital role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC): Despite the irresponsible attitude of the US government, the UN COP 23 climate conference, which is ending today in Bonn, has confirmed that climate change is a major priority for countries, cities which are playing a leading role in implementing climate action civil society, business organisations and trade unions, says the ETUC. "The Paris Agreement has launched a dynamic and, even though things are not moving fast enough, the world is clearly mobilised to fight climate change and trade unions are on the frontline," said Montserrat Mir, ETUC Confederal Secretary. "More than 100 trade unionists came to Bonn to demand a Just Transition towards a low-carbon economy that leaves no worker behind. Through their active role in the workplace or in industrial relations, trade unions are bringing the fight against climate change into the daily lives of millions of workers. "Polish and Fijian governments must now prepare for COP 24 in Katowice in 2018. Governments must clearly commit to translating the Just Transition principles into concrete policy instruments. The ETUC therefore calls for a 'Katowice plan of action for Just Transition' to be adopted at COP 24. "We welcome the agreement at COP 23 on a Gender Action Plan to promote women's role in tacking climate change, and the Fiji Presidency's commitment to integrating gender into all the work around climate policy both nationally and internationally." The ETUC will work with its members: - To prepare trade unions to be involved in climate policy planning (NDCs) in the context of the ETUC project on follow-up of COP 21; - To launch a high-level political initiative on Just Transition next year in Katowice; - To raise EU climate ambition in line with the Paris objectives; - To press the EU to revise upwards its 2050 Roadmap; - To urge the EU to prepare a 2050 Just Transition Roadmap to anticipate changes in the labour market; - To prepare an EU budget capable of transforming the EU into a low-carbon region by 2050.

The following information was released by the Global Environment Facility (GEF): Regarding the announcement of new funding for the GEF Least Developed Countries Fund, GEF CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii said, "It's the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities that suffer the most. I want to thank the governments of Germany, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and the region of Wallonia, for their support and commitment to help those most impacted build resilience." Today, the Government of Sweden announced it would provide additional funds of SEK 185 million each to the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the GEF Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). Also, Belgium has decided to make available an additional grant of 7 million EUR to the LDCF, while the Wallonia region of southern Belgium announced 3.25 million EUR to the fund. On the opening day of COP23 , the German government announced EUR 100 million to support developing countries in climate change adaptation, including 50 million each to the LDCF and AF. Italy and Ireland also announced financial contributions to the Adaptation Fund. Welcoming the new financial support for the most vulnerable countries announced here at the UN Climate Conference in Bonn ( COP23 ), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii, said "It's the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities that suffer the most. I want to thank the governments of Germany, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and the region of Wallonia, for their support and commitment to help those most impacted build resilience." Least developed countries (LDCs) are the most vulnerable to climate change, yet the least able to adapt. In many cases, they lack the technical, financial and institutional capacity to identify the best ways to build resilience. That's why the UNFCCC decided to establish the LDCF in 2001. To date, the LDCF has supported more than 250 projects in 51 countries. Naoko Ishii was speaking at the 10th anniversary of the Adaptation Fund being celebrated in Bonn today. Since it was established, the Adaptation Fund has grown to commit USD 462 million to 70 concrete, localized projects that help the most vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change, while serving nearly 5.5 million direct beneficiaries around the world. During COP23 On Monday, the GEF announced USD 1 million in support of a first of its kind climate resilience investment fund. The fund will boost adaptation efforts in some of the world's most vulnerable countries.

Remarks Judith G. Garber Acting Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Bonn, Germany November 16, 2017 ________________________________ President of COP 23 , Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates. The United States is pleased to be engaging with other Parties here at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement. Although he indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people. Irrespective of our views on the Paris Agreement, the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems. President Trump made this clear when the United States joined other G-20 countries in the G-20 Leaders' Declaration in stating that we remain collectively committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working towards low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems. Our guiding principles are universal access to affordable and reliable energy, and open, competitive markets that promote efficiency and energy security, not only for the United States but around the globe. The United States will continue supporting a balanced approach to climate mitigation, economic development, and energy security that takes into consideration the realities of the global energy mix. Over the past 10 years, the United States has shown that it can reduce emissions while growing the economy and promoting energy security. Since 2005, the United States' net greenhouse gas emissions have decreased 11.5 percent while the U.S. economy has grown 15 percent, adjusted for inflation. A large portion of these reductions have come as a result of the adoption by the private sector of innovative energy technologies --fostered by early stage innovation by the public sector. Collaborative U.S. public and private efforts over the past ten years have resulted in dramatic decreases in the cost of low-emissions technologies and fuels, including natural gas, solar, wind, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Natural gas prices have dropped to about a third of what they were in 2007 and the cost of utility-scale solar PV has dropped by more than 64 percent. We want to work with other countries to continue advancing the development and deployment of a broad array of technologies that will ultimately enable us to achieve our climate and energy security goals. Already, the United States is working bilaterally with countries such as China and India to advance power sector transformation and smart grid technologies, energy efficiency, and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage. We are also engaged in many multilateral initiatives. Through the Clean Energy Ministerial, we are engaging our national laboratories to provide in-depth technical expertise to pursue new global opportunities to leverage the potential of advanced energy technologies including carbon capture, utilization, and storage, and nuclear energy. Through our work with Power Africa, we have catalyzed some $60 billion in energy investments that will provide modern energy services for roughly 300 million citizens across Africa by 2030. And through the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, we are working with island states to identify cost-effective options for using advanced energy technologies to diversify and strengthen their power systems and increase energy access. Of course, we know that each country will need to determine the appropriate energy mix based on its particular circumstances, taking into account the need for energy security, promotion of economic growth and environmental protection. In that context, we want to support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of source. Beyond energy, the United States will continue to help our partner countries reduce emissions from forests and other lands, to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and to respond to natural disasters. Our Sustainable Landscapes programs are helping partners to protect well over 2 million square kilometers of forests and other landscapes, reducing more than 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, while enhancing sustainable development, generating local livelihood opportunities, and protecting biodiversity and water resources. U.S. government technical agencies also continue to help partners improve their capacities to monitor and report on terrestrial carbon through the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon has helped countries conduct forest inventories, develop maps of forests and other ecosystems, and worked to include forests and other landscapes in national greenhouse gas mitigation strategies and targets. In sum, the United States intends to remain engaged with our many partners and allies around the world on these issues, here in the U.N. Framework Convention and everywhere else. Thank you. \</doc>

Phoenix: Arizona Center for Biological Diversity has issued the following news release: The Center for Biological Diversity submitted Freedom of Information Act requests today seeking public records from three federal agencies to shine a light on the Trump administration\' s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The request seeks all reports and memoranda that the administration relied upon when it made its decision, as well as related emails, telephone logs and notes from meetings involving President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and other administration officials. As the international community prepares for this November\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, the Center hopes to determine how Trump\' s Paris decision was influenced by a poor understanding of climate science and lobbying by the fossil fuel industry. The Center also looks to uncover whether any new scientific or economic analysis was used in justifying the withdrawal.  We need to know if Trump put any real thought at all into this profoundly dangerous decision, said Clare Lakewood, a staff attorney at the Center.  Withdrawing from the Paris agreement isolated America by highlighting this administration\' s reckless contempt for our planet\' s future. Americans have a right to learn how Trump officials were influenced by scientific ignorance and fossil fuel industry lobbyists.

The 350.org issued the following news release: Today, community and grassroots leaders from the United States announced their platform at COP23 called the "U.S. People's Delegation" to counter the Trump Administration's fossil fuel agenda and to hold US states, cities, businesses, and the public accountable to commitments to climate action. The platform, includes youth, Indigenous peoples, frontline communities, advocates, and policymakers who have come to Bonn with organizations from across the U.S. They have come together to show what climate leadership should look like. With the Trump Administration rolling back climate protections, expanding fossil fuel development, ramming through dirty infrastructure, and withdrawing the U.S. from its commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the People's Delegation and the organizations involved are taking action to protect communities and isolate the Administration by demanding a fossil free future and real climate action on the local level. Among the demands are:  A just and equitable transition to 100% renewable energy in all cities and states.  For U.S. elected officials to step up in meaningful ways to ensure bold climate action in the face of the current Administration's rollback on climate protections, the persistence of ongoing climate disasters, and the impact of existing inequalities and governmental negligence on frontline and vulnerable communities.  A halt to all new fossil fuel projects, with the understanding that the fossil fuel industry continues to perpetuate the climate crisis and sow climate denial, creating a bleak future for generations to come.  A demand to stop negotiating cap-and-trade, carbon offsets, carbon pricing, and other market schemes that avoid cutting pollution at the source. At COP23 , while the People's Delegation is calling for meaningful climate action, the Trump Administration is pushing coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an "answer" to climate change. The organizations represented in the People's Delegation include: SustainUS, Sunrise Movement, Indigenous Environmental Network, Global Grassroots Justice Alliance, and the Climate Justice Alliance as part of It Takes Roots, U.S Human Rights Network, Climate Generation, Our Children's Trust, NextGen America, and 350.org. Quote List: Varshini Prakash of SustainUS and Sunrise Movement said, "I have seen climate change-fueled floods destroy lives and livelihoods where my family is from in India. In southern India, thousands of farmers have committed suicide because of drought. Within my lifetime, my home in the States could be underwater if we do nothing to stop climate change. No one should have to live in fear of losing the people that they love or the places that they come from. I'm going to COP23 as part of the People's Delegation to show that the American people are still in, that we're ready to fight back against Trump and his regressive policies, and that we refuse to let wealthy CEOs and oil barons lead us down the path of destruction." Dallas Goldtooth of Indigenous Environmental Network, part of the It Takes Roots delegation said,"We head to COP23 as part of Indigenous Environmental Network and with the U.S. People's Delegation to continue the to rise up as Indigenous, Black, and Brown communities against extraction, colonialism and to call for real action from elected leaders who have pledged to address climate change." Kiran Ooman, a youth plaintiff with Our Children's Trust said, "Growing up in the Pacific Northwest of the United States I have witnessed the effects of climate change, from the steady increase in forest fire severity to unnaturally high pollen counts. However, my concern also includes the places where my family live, including India and Florida, where the fatal threat of storms are worsening each year. We are working to hold the Trump Administration accountable not only for their inaction but also for the actions they are taking, such as pushing through new fossil fuel infrastructure and cutting back on environmental regulations, which puts the climate and all people of the earth in danger. As young people, we face the consequences of these actions most acutely, and that's why I'm I'm here at COP 23 with the U.S. People's Delegation: To remind the international community that despite our youth we are fighting the unjust actions of the US Government, and we need your support in defending our futures." Katia R. Aviles Vazquez of Organizacion Boricua, representing the It Takes Roots delegation said, "Puerto Rico has been the victim of a perfect storm of natural weather extremes, fiscal austerity measures, bad management and planning, combined with a colonial situation that prevents us from trading and learning from our sister islands in the Caribbean region. Along with the Caribbean, Puerto Rico was hit by two of the largest hurricanes in recorded history within two weeks of each other in the month of September. Organizacion Boricua has been working on the frontlines under the most dire conditions of colonialism, corruption, and climate change. We demand a Just Transition." Dyanna Jaye, representing ICLEI U.S. Local Governments for Sustainability and Sunrise Movement said, "Flooding is routine in my coastal Virginia home town; our lands are being slowly reclaimed by the Atlantic Ocean and communities have been forced to flee their homes. From monster hurricanes to the wildfires and deadly heatwaves in the American West, 2017 has shown that the threat of climate change is now. Yet, Trump has allied with fossil fuel CEOs who are dead set on profiting from pollution, including Exxon CEO turned Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. They have no right to represent the American people. Though Trump and his billionaire friends may try to pull us backwards, we, everyday Americans, will keep moving our country forward and make sure our cities, universities, and states take the action we need to stop climate change and create good jobs in our communities." Ellen Anderson of Energy Transition Lab, with the Climate Generation delegation said, "We are here to let the world know that most Americans support action on climate change, despite what you hear from Washington. In our state of Minnesota,we are leading the way for the Heartland of America, showing that you can cut carbon, build out renewable energy, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and save money by shifting to a clean energy economy. Our Lt. Governor said to our delegation last week that our state is completely committed to this clean energy transition, and feels the sense of urgency to move forward faster. Our delegation represents academia, educators, and students along with civil society, youth, and indigenous communities, all standing together with the other nations of the world to support and learn from each other how to tackle this existential challenge." Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Manager and coordination of the U.S. People's Delegation said, "The U.S. People's Delegation is at COP23 to share loud and clear the message that communities back home demand a fast and fair transition to a world free of fossil fuels with 100 percent renewable energy for all. 350.org is proud to be supporting the work of organizations who were already bringing delegations to COP23 . Our work collectively as part of the U.S. People's Delegation is aimed at amplifying the urgency of climate action, holding accountable elected officials who have said they will step up against the Trump Administration to ensure they turn their words into action, and sharing our stories and solutions from diverse communities. We do not have time to waste, we need real climate action now." Among the events that the people's delegation will conduct this week that are open to the public: U.S People's Delegation Speak Out Date & Time: Thursday, November 9th, 4-6pm Location: U.S Climate Action Pavilion, Fiji Room, The DHL Post Tower Charles-de-Gaulle-Strase 20, 53113 Bonn Germany U.S People's Delegation Town Hall with Elected Officials Date & Time: Saturday, November 11th, 4-6pm Location: U.S Climate Action Pavilion, Fiji Room, The DHL Post Tower Charles-de-Gaulle-Strase 20, 53113 Bonn Germany For more information on the U.S. People's Delegation and the organizations involved, please go to HYPERLINK http://www.350.org/uspeoplesdelegation www.350.org/uspeoplesdelegation This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 7, 2017.

"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power" is the follow-up to the 2006 Oscar-winning documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," in which Al Gore laid out the case for climate change Armageddon. He's still at it, leading "climate leadership training" sessions as he circles the globe educating and cajoling politicians and business leaders to take up the cause of wind, and especially solar energy, as a replacement for fossil fuels. Gore's unstinting optimism, drive, and behind-the-scenes maneuvering at such events as the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is well documented in this film, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk. (Davis Guggenheim directed the first film.) I find much to admire in Gore's mission, although I wish the filmmakers had not delivered such a nimbus-tinged view of his exploits. The documentary is like the cinematic equivalent of humblebragging. But it does provide one great "told you so" moment: In the first film, skeptics scoffed when Gore touted scientific projections showing rising seas flooding the demolished site of the World Trade Center. In the new film, we are presented with footage of superstorm Sandy ravaging the site. Grade: B (Rated PG for thematic elements and some troubling images.)\~ \</doc>

Washington: Office of the MP Albio Sires has issued the following news release:  In 2015, the world celebrated the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France. The Paris Climate Agreement marked the first coordinated international effort to reduce global carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The United States joined 194 countries in agreeing to lower its carbon emissions and to assist still-developing nations to transition away from burning fossil fuels. Today, President Trump has announced that the United States of America will cede its leadership role in this historic effort to address one of the most important challenges of our generation by withdrawing our commitments from the Paris Climate Accords. This short-sighted and selfish act not only damages our nation\' s credibility abroad, but also endangers the future of our planet for the sake of scoring political points. By withdrawing from these commitments, we are telling the international community that the U.S. government is not serious about addressing climate change. I am disappointed by President Trump\' s decision and hope that this administration and Congress can work together to curb our carbon emissions and protect future generations from the devastating effects of rising global temperatures. \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Bank: 360-degree VR film produced for COP23 screening in Suva until 14 April COP23 has returned home to Fiji, with thousands expected to see the film in the coming weeks. Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK http://www.ourhomeourpeople.com www.ourhomeourpeople.com COP23 , and was recently named as a finalist in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Action Awards. The project is funded by the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the European Union, through the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program "This film and its characters convey, through the truly immersive experience of Virtual Reality, the message that we have long aimed to share with the world: that we Fijians are not standing still and accepting the realities of climate change; rather that we are resilient; we are coming together with strength to support each other and build our communities through these challenges," said Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 , the Hon. Frank Bainimarama . "[The VR film] was one of the highlights of the Fiji Pavilion at COP23 , [and] I urge as many Fijians as possible to try to see it. Because it is genuinely brilliant," the PM added. Ambassador Julian Wilson , Head of the EU Delegation for the Pacific, noted the emotional power of this film, and its story appeals to any community across the globe fighting climate change. "This global appeal is exactly what the spirit of the talanoa dialogue seeks stories that will spread and spark the discussions and accord that will be needed if we are to make a difference in the fight against climate change," said Ambassador Wilson. Lasse Melgaard , the World Bank's Resident Representative for the South Pacific, thanked the communities across Fiji who had committed so much of their time and hearts to the project. "We are incredibly grateful to the communities of Ra and Vunisavisavi, who shared their lives with our team for this story, and we are so pleased to be able to finally bring their story 'home' to Fiji to allow thousands of Fijians to experience this powerful, moving story in its true 360-degree format." He added said the film was a powerful way of sharing the findings of sharing the findings of the Fiji Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, the report launched at COP23 that provides a deep-dive analysis of the economic and social impacts of climate change on Fiji over the coming decades, and provides a set of recommendations as to the most effective investments to adapt and minimize its impacts. "The Virtual Reality project, and the Climate Vulnerability Assessment are designed to connect with the two elements that drive decision-making: the report is designed to connect with the head; and the Virtual Reality production with the heart." The 'return tour' will also include a series of community events to be held at the communities whose stories are featured in the film, including Nabukadra and Naramai (Ra Province) and Vunisavisavi (Cakaudrove Province). \</doc>

Mar 27, 2018( Futurity.org: HYPERLINK http://www.futurity.org http://www.futurity.org From climate to immigration to human rights, the state is increasingly acting on its own. 'Federalism was, until recently, the darling of conservatives,' says David Freeman Engstrom, a law professor at Stanford University. 'But in the current moment, federalism's valence has flipped. Sub-federal governments including states, counties, and cities are driving progressive policy agendas and moving onto the global stage in a wide range of areas. And California is leading the charge.'Challenging TrumpUnder the current administration, the incentives are high right now for California and other states and municipalities to advance priorities that are stuck in gridlock or moving backward at the federal level. 'As a former foreign policy-maker, the question I have been asking myself is: To what extent are we going to see progressive states challenge the Trump administration, particularly in the realm of foreign policy?' says Jeremy M. Weinstein, a professor of political science, who also served as deputy to the US ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration. 'And how will the federal government respond if there are multiple voices speaking for the United States in the international arena?' Take climate policy, for example. In 2017, Gov. Jerry Brown met with China's President Xi Jinping to negotiate a joint partnership to reduce carbon emissions. Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, president of the conference, named Brown special adviser for states and regions. When President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, hundreds of sub-federal governments including dozens of towns and cities in California pledged to abide by the agreement. But these are only recent cases. In 2013, well before the Trump administration, California began to connect its cap-and-trade system regulating how companies emit greenhouse gases to provinces in Canada. The result is a sub-federal system for regulating carbon that spans international borders.'One-voice doctrine'There's a problem with all this sub-federal activism, according to the researchers: It might run afoul of the US Constitution. 'One problem is that the Constitution says that states aren't supposed to enter into agreements with other states, whether domestic or foreign, except with congressional consent,' says Engstrom, noting that could include California's cap-and-trade linkages, and Congress can disallow them if it chooses. The conventional view of foreign affairs is based on the 'one-voice doctrine,' a premise that the federal government must speak as a cohesive unit on foreign affairs, which is out of sync with reality, Weinstein says. While working in government, Weinstein helped shepherd a range of international initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, an effort to engage national and sub-national governments in promoting transparency. Initiatives like this show how the one-voice doctrine doesn't match up with what is taking place. 'We are starting to see some fissures and cracks in the doctrine.' 'Anyone who has worked in the foreign policy space will tell you that the global stage is an increasingly crowded place, with nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and every level of government vying for influence and exercising their voice,' he says. The 'one-voice' idea is also legally vulnerable. 'We are starting to see some fissures and cracks in the doctrine,' Engstrom says. He and Weinstein cite recent legal cases that have opened up room for states to maneuver. For instance, in 2003 the US Supreme Court invalidated a California law that required insurance companies to provide information about policies related to Holocaust victims and survivors. What makes the case significant, the researchers note, is that the Supreme Court, in finding the state law preempted, said that its resolution of federal-state conflict in future cases would turn at least in part on the strength and the importance of the state concern.Climate change could turn military bases into foreign policy problems[1]'The idea is that, where the state is using its more traditional police powers to protect its people, the one-voice doctrine might need to be relaxed a bit,' Engstrom says. California is not alone in its attempt to build a legal case and infrastructure for an expanded role in foreign policy. Massachusetts challenged the federal government in 2007 in a case targeting the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to regulate carbon emissions. The state was able to convince the Supreme Court that the threat to its coastline and land was a sufficiently strong interest to justify a lawsuit, Engstrom says. 'That type of precedent is another type of crack. In effect, the Supreme Court is on record as saying that states have strong interests when it comes to climate change,' says Engstrom, who views this judicial precedent as key leverage for California going forward.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will speak at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP23 , in Germany today (Wednesday). Alongside UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, she will address the High Level Plenary session on behalf of states, regions and devolved governments at the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action closing event. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham has also been in Bonn to represent Scotlands interests in tackling climate change. She announced more than 3.6 million funding to help developing countries tackle the impact of climate change. The First Minister said: We are committed to tackling climate change at home, but in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is important we work together with our friends and partners across the globe. COP23 brings politicians and activists from around the world together, providing an opportunity to work towards our common goal of reducing greenhouse gasses and mitigating the effects of climate change. It is a privilege to be asked to represent the states, regions and devolved governments in the Marrakech Partnership. The UNFCCC Gender Plan recognises the importance of involving women in global efforts to tackle climate change. If we are to be successful in addressing this issue, we need to ensure that women are fully represented. The Scottish Government stands ready to play our part in helping achieve that goal. Background COP23 takes place 6-17 November in Bonn. 3.6 million for climate change projects. UN climate conference set to recognize the role of women in climate action.

The Society of Jesus issued the following news release: Timed to coincide with the upcoming UN COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, Jesuits and lay collaborators from around the world will hold a series of events in Bonn to complement and amplify the talks taking place next week. The main Ecojesuit event will be a dialogue on November 13 entitled "Laudato Si' - Environment is Relationship" hosted by the Aloisiuskolleg, a well-known Jesuit school in Bonn. Open to all COP23 delegates, NGO staff and members of the public, the event will gather speakers from around the world, including Micronesia, Latin America, Central Africa and the Philippines. The speakers will reflect and exchange on the challenges in caring for our common home. On the same day, Ecojesuit will host a "Laudato Si' Fair" at which representatives from various Jesuit institutions, Conferences and ecology-related initiatives will showcase their activities. The inspiration for Ecojesuit's presence at COP23 is Pope Francis' call in Laudato Si' for "a new and universal solidarity". Also relevant is last year's Jesuit General Congregation 36 call for greater interconnectedness and common work on challenging global concerns. Ecojesuit believes that COP23 is a context to highlight the Jesuits' vision for reconciliation between people and creation, including the voices and experiences of people from around the world, particularly the most vulnerable among us. Commenting on the initiative, Ecojesuit North America representative Cecilia Calvo, senior advisor on environmental justice at the Jesuit Conference in Washington, D.C., said, " COP23 is an exciting opportunity to connect with members of the Jesuit network and others around the world to share common efforts to respond to the urgent challenge of global climate change confronting the human family. This is a critical moment for all people and world leaders to respond to Pope Francis's call for ecological conversion and reconciliation with creation and one another, particulary the most vulnerable." Daily reports will be posted on Ecojesuit. Please also follow us at EcojesuitCOP23 and on twitter using the hashtag #EcojesuitCOP23. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6059603 MSTRUCK \</doc>

Stanford University issued the following news release: California - the country's most populous state and the world's sixth largest economy - is challenging the legal limits of federal power in foreign affairs. From climate to immigration to human rights, California is increasingly acting on its own. California's sub-federal activism is the topic of a new paper by Stanford professors David Freeman Engstrom and Jeremy M. Weinstein. Published March 26 in Washington Quarterly, Engstrom and Weinstein raise a crucial legal and political question: What if California had a foreign policy? In key ways, they argue, California already does. Taking a stance Under the current administration, the incentives are high right now for California - and other states and municipalities - to advance priorities that are stuck in gridlock or moving backward at the federal level. Take climate policy, for example. In 2017, Gov. Jerry Brown met with China's President Xi Jinping to negotiate a joint partnership to reduce carbon emissions. Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, president of the conference, named Brown special adviser for states and regions. When President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, hundreds of sub-federal governments - including dozens of towns and cities in California - pledged to abide by the agreement. But these are only recent cases. In 2013, well before the Trump administration, California began to connect its cap-and-trade system regulating how companies emit greenhouse gases to provinces in Canada. The result is a sub-federal system for regulating carbon that spans international borders. Constitutional erosion But there's a problem with all this sub-federal activism, according to Engstrom and Weinstein: It might run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. "One problem is that the Constitution says that states aren't supposed to enter into agreements with other states, whether domestic or foreign, except with congressional consent," said Engstrom, noting that could include California's cap-and-trade linkages, and Congress can disallow them if it wants. The conventional view of foreign affairs is based on the "one-voice doctrine," a premise that the federal government must speak as a cohesive unit on foreign affairs, which Weinstein said is out of sync with reality. While working in government, Weinstein helped shepherd a range of international initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, an effort to engage national and sub-national governments in promoting transparency. Initiatives like this show how the one-voice doctrine does not match up with what is taking place. "Anyone who has worked in the foreign policy space will tell you that the global stage is an increasingly crowded place, with nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations and every level of government vying for influence and exercising their voice," said Weinstein. The "one-voice" idea is also legally vulnerable. "The idea is that, where the state is using its more traditional police powers to protect its people, the one-voice doctrine might need to be relaxed a bit," Engstrom said. California is not alone in its attempt to build a legal case and infrastructure for an expanded role in foreign policy. Massachusetts challenged the federal government in 2007 in a case targeting the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to regulate carbon emissions. The state was able to convince the Supreme Court that the threat to its coastline and land was a sufficiently strong interest to justify a lawsuit, Engstrom said. "That type of precedent is another type of crack. In effect, the Supreme Court is on record as saying that states have strong interests when it comes to climate change," said Engstrom, who views this judicial precedent as key leverage for California going forward. David Freeman Engstrom is a professor of law and associate dean for strategic planning at Stanford Law School. Jeremy Weinstein, professor of political science, is also a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. Weinstein also serves as the director of the Stanford Global Studies Division. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6220671 MSTRUCK \</doc>

The following information was released by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD): At COP 23 the German government announced that it is pledging 20 million in climate finance to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to help smallholder farmers in developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and improve their food security. "With this financial pledge from the Federal Republic of Germany, IFAD will be able to channel additional resources to those who need it most," said IFAD Associate-Vice President, Perin Saint Ange. "These funds will not only help in our efforts to adapt smallholder agriculture to climate change but they will have additional benefits related to other important cross-cutting issues like gender equality, youth unemployment and nutrition security," added Saint Ange. Building on the success of IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), IFAD is now working to integrate climate change adaptation across its operations. These efforts will go a long way to helping the world's small farmers, who generate up to 80 per cent of the food produced in many developing countries, access the information, the inputs and the technologies they need to face the increasing risks to their lives and livelihoods posed by climate change. "We are very pleased to give this financing to IFAD to allow them to build on the fantastic work they've done in their Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme," said Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to Germany's Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. Germany and IFAD share a strong commitment to ensuring the resilience and prosperity of rural communities, where three-quarters of the world's poorest people live. Germany is a founding member of IFAD and remains one of its largest donors. For more about IFAD, join us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube. Press release No.: IFAD/61/2017 IFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience. Since 1978, we have provided about US$18.9 billion in grants and low-interest loans to projects that have reached some 470 million people. IFAD is an international financial institution and a specialized United Nations agency based in Rome the UN's food and agriculture hub. \</doc>

Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sires issued the following statement regarding President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States' commitment to the Paris Climate Accords: "In 2015, the world celebrated the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France. The Paris Climate Agreement marked the first coordinated international effort to reduce global carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The United States joined 194 countries in agreeing to lower its carbon emissions and to assist still-developing nations to transition away from burning fossil fuels. Today, President Trump has announced that the United States of America will cede its leadership role in this historic effort to address one of the most important challenges of our generation by withdrawing our commitments from the Paris Climate Accords. This short-sighted and selfish act not only damages our nation's credibility abroad, but also endangers the future of our planet for the sake of scoring political points. By withdrawing from these commitments, we are telling the international community that the U.S. government is not serious about addressing climate change. I am disappointed by President Trump's decision and hope that this administration and Congress can work together to curb our carbon emissions and protect future generations from the devastating effects of rising global temperatures."

Washington: U.S Department of State Diplomacy in Action has issued the following news release: President of COP 23 , Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates. The United States is pleased to be engaging with other Parties here at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement. Although he indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people. Irrespective of our views on the Paris Agreement, the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems. President Trump made this clear when the United States joined other G-20 countries in the G-20 Leaders\' Declaration in stating that we remain collectively committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working towards low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems. Our guiding principles are universal access to affordable and reliable energy, and open, competitive markets that promote efficiency and energy security, not only for the United States but around the globe. Over the past 10 years, the United States has shown that it can reduce emissions while growing the economy and promoting energy security. Since 2005, the United States\' net greenhouse gas emissions have decreased 11.5 percent while the U.S. economy has grown 15 percent, adjusted for inflation. A large portion of these reductions have come as a result of the adoption by the private sector of innovative energy technologies \- fostered by early stage innovation by the public sector. Collaborative U.S. public and private efforts over the past ten years have resulted in dramatic decreases in the cost of low-emissions technologies and fuels, including natural gas, solar, wind, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Natural gas prices have dropped to about a third of what they were in 2007 and the cost of utility-scale solar PV has dropped by more than 64 percent. We want to work with other countries to continue advancing the development and deployment of a broad array of technologies that will ultimately enable us to achieve our climate and energy security goals. Already, the United States is working bilaterally with countries such as China and India to advance power sector transformation and smart grid technologies, energy efficiency, and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage. We are also engaged in many multilateral initiatives. Through our work with Power Africa, we have catalyzed some $60 billion in energy investments that will provide modern energy services for roughly 300 million citizens across Africa by 2030. And through the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, we are working with island states to identify cost-effective options for using advanced energy technologies to diversify and strengthen their power systems and increase energy access. Of course, we know that each country will need to determine the appropriate energy mix based on its particular circumstances, taking into account the need for energy security, promotion of economic growth and environmental protection. In that context, we want to support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of source. Beyond energy, the United States will continue to help our partner countries reduce emissions from forests and other lands, to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and to respond to natural disasters. Our Sustainable Landscapes programs are helping partners to protect well over 2 million square kilometers of forests and other landscapes, reducing more than 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, while enhancing sustainable development, generating local livelihood opportunities, and protecting biodiversity and water resources. U.S. government technical agencies also continue to help partners improve their capacities to monitor and report on terrestrial carbon through the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon has helped countries conduct forest inventories, develop maps of forests and other ecosystems, and worked to include forests and other landscapes in national greenhouse gas mitigation strategies and targets. In sum, the United States intends to remain engaged with our many partners and allies around the world on these issues, here in the U.N. Framework Convention and everywhere else. Thank you. \</doc>

GENEVA, Dec. 31 -- Publication No. WO/2017/221113 was published on Dec. 28. Title of the invention: "PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING HYDROGEN FROM SHALE." Applicants: Georges Martino-Gauchi (FR). Inventors: Georges Martino-Gauchi (FR). According to the abstract posted by the World Intellectual Property Organization: "Process for manufacturing hydrogen from shale gas (or shale oil) in which: a) The shale gas (or oil) produced is converted into hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming or by partial oxidation by oxygen from the air in a plant set up nearby, b) The carbon dioxide generated with the hydrogen is separated from the gas mixture and recycled into the shale gas reservoir, it is used to carry out hydraulic fracturing. It may pass into a buffer reservoir. c) The carbon dioxide is finally sequestered in the borehole created for the exploitation of the gas. d) The hydrogen is used either directly in an electric power plant set up on the site and (or) injected into a hydrogen distribution network constructed for this purpose. The cost price of the hydrogen thus produced and distributed is of the order of magnitude of the price of imported natural gas having an identical energy content, this including the investments with a return time of less than four years. The invention thus makes it possible to reduce the releases of greenhouse gases to a level lower than those anticipated by COP21 ( United Nations Climate Change Conference )." The patent was filed on June 14 under Application No. PCT/IB2017/053536.

A lot of people have been saying this for a long time but there's resistance," said McCartney. "Particularly when you've got someone like Trump who says that it (climate change) is just a hoax. A lot of people like myself think that's just madness so it's maybe a good time now to try and focus people's attention and say 'look, forget about him we can do something'." Dubbing Trump's attitude about climate change "madness," McCartney accused the president of reversing "a lot of the advances that have been made" in battling global warming, which the president once claimed was invented by the Chinese in an attempt to hurt American manufacturing. The McCartney film was released ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference this week and focuses on animal agriculture as an under-covered aspect of climate change. The foundation of Meat Free Monday is to "raise awareness and inspire people to make a change in their diets from an early achievable starting point." The film is narrated by McCartney and features his music -- including tracks from his 1997 orchestral album Standing Stone and an unreleased song called "Botswana."

The film releases ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference next week and focuses on animal agriculture as an under-covered aspect of climate change. The foundation of Meat Free Monday is to "raise awareness and inspire people to make a change in their diets from an early achievable starting point." In 2009, the Meat Free Monday campaign began. According to press release the campaign "has had incredible response" since its launch "with many of the world's leading authorities on climate change endorsing meat reduction as an effective way of fighting global warming." "There's a simple but significant way to help protect the planet and all its inhabitants," the former Beatle says to camera in the film. "And it starts with just one day a week. One day without eating animal products can have a huge impact in helping maintain that delicate balance that sustains us all." One Day a Week was largely funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies. French film director Yann Arthus-Bertrand's Hope Production was part of the film's production. One Day a Week "amplifies this message using the breathtaking aerial photography with which Arthus-Bertrand has become synonymous."

The following information was released by the government of Ukraine: Today, on November 6, Bonn, Germany, has become the venue for the United Nations Climate Change Conference . The Ukrainian official delegation led by Ostap Semerak, Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources, authorized by the President of Ukraine to take part in negotiations and approval of decisions of the United Nations Conference, also participates in the conference, which will last until November 17. Within the framework of the event there will be held the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the second part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. In particular, this year, delegates should pay close attention to plans for implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, signed in December of 2015 in Paris, France. Then, by supporting the UN initiative, joining the agreement 195 nations assumed commitment to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable futures. The universal agreement's main aim was to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are also to join this year's International Climate Change Conference. \</doc>

Boston, MA: Corporate Accountability International has issued the following news release: Global negotiations seeking to implement the Paris agreement have been captured by corporate interests and are being undermined by powerful forces that benefit from exacerbating climate change, according to a report released ahead of the second meeting of parties to the Paris agreement \- COP23 \- next week. The report, co-authored by Corporate Accountability, uncovers a litany of ways in which fossil fuel companies have gained high-level access to negotiations and manipulated outcomes. It highlights a string of examples, including that of a negotiator for Panama who is also on the board of a corporate peak body that represents carbon traders such as banks, polluters and brokers. It also questions the role of the world\' s biggest polluters in sponsoring the meetings in return for access to high-level events. The report argues that as a result of the corporate influence, outcomes of negotiations so far have been skewed to favour the interests of the world\' s biggest corporate polluters over those of the majority of the world\' s population that live in the developing world. It finds that influence has skewed outcomes on finance, agriculture and technology. It comes as the 2018 deadline approaches for member countries to finalise the rule book that guides the implementation of the Paris Agreement. That rule book will determine things such as how compliance will be monitored and enforced and how the developing world will receive finance and support.  We\' ve been at many crossroads on climate change but this is perhaps one of the last of those that we have left, said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability.  If parties don\' t arrive at a set of guidelines that actually facilitates the transition we\' ve been talking about and keeps us under 1.5C, we may never have another shot at this.  We\' re doing this wrong right now. We have the wrong people at the table and we\' re looking to the wrong people for advice. If we don\' t course-correct at COP 23 and the next inter-sessional in Bonn, we\' re in real trouble. And you can look at what\' s happened so far to see the evidence of that. Examples of the infiltration of polluters into the official negotiations include: In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors issued the following news release: To meaningfully support the global climate agenda, the real estate and construction sector must develop a more systematic, coherent and aligned approach to data management. This is one of the key findings in a new RICS report, to be launched at the annual United Nations meeting on climate change, the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany this week. Find out more: High-visibility for the built environment at COP23 ( HYPERLINK http://www.rics.org/us/news/news-insight/news/action-packed-events-programme-ensures-high-visibility-for-buildings-at-this-years-cop23-in-bonn-germany/ http://www.rics.org/us/news/news-insight/news/action-packed-events-programme-ensures-high-visibility-for-buildings-at-this-years- HYPERLINK http://www.rics.org/us/news/news-insight/news/action-packed-events-programme-ensures-high-visibility-for-buildings-at-this-years-cop23-in-bonn-germany/ cop23 -in-bonn-germany/ ) About the report The report called "Global Trends in Data Capture and Management in Real Estate and Construction", draws on the views and insights of building sector leaders - including representatives working in public policy, finance and investment - who are part of the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (Global ABC). The Global ABC, of which RICS is a founding member, was established at COP21 in 2015 to develop a more coordinated sectoral approach to tackling climate change. "Within the Global ABC, RICS is part of a dedicated working group on measurement, data and accountability. Following an extensive global survey of our stakeholders, the report pulls together how collecting, managing and sharing data across the sector can support larger climate goals. Better data means more market transparency, more informed decision-making, reduced investment risk and the ability to track and measure the all-important targets set out in the Paris Agreement."- Ursula Hartenberger: RICS Global Head of Sustainability Energy use in buildings and construction represents more than one-third of global energy consumption and contributes to nearly one-quarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. The built environment sector therefore has an important role to play in reducing carbon emissions. Read and download the report ( HYPERLINK http://www.rics.org/us/knowledge/research/insights/rics-takes-data-and-measurement-centre-stage-at-cop23/ http://www.rics.org/us/knowledge/research/insights/rics-takes-data-and-measurement-centre-stage-at- http://www.rics.org/us/knowledge/research/insights/rics-takes-data-and-measurement-centre-stage-at-cop23/ cop23 / ) The report analyses how building related data, including physical, performance and financial information, is currently being captured and managed by key sector representatives. It also highlights the gaps that current data capture and management patterns can have for how countries and organisations meet their energy-saving and climate targets. "As part of our commitment to advancing the global climate agenda, RICS is promoting International Property Measurement Standards to inform energy performance measures as a key metric for benchmarking the physical size of a building. Given the emphasis on driving investment into more energy efficiency measures in the built environment, the report aims to help governments, investors, developers, corporate occupiers and property professionals understand how better data management can protect their investments and assets through supporting the global climate agenda."- Ursula Hartenberger: RICS Global Head of Sustainability Better whole life-cycle data capture, management and reporting enables government decision-makers, for example, to:  Assess and develop more effective sustainability policies and incentive schemes,  Kick-start innovation, and  Enable sector participants to build holistic strategies targeted at reducing carbon emissions during planning, construction and real estate use. Fragmentation and silo-thinking While the report lists an encouraging number of good practice examples and public and private initiatives, the overriding message of the survey is that the fragmentation and silo-thinking that the sector is known for, also translates into the way it handles its data. The report will be presented to key stakeholders at COP23 , to promote collective action and a common approach across the sector in an effort to meet global climate targets.

The 350.org issued the following news release: On Thursday, November 9th, community and grassroots leaders from the United States who make up the "U.S. People's Delegation", joined by activists from the Pacific Islands known as the Pacific Climate Warriors and Germany's Ende Gelaende activists, participated in a speak out and shared personal stories of how their communities are being impacted by unjust policies, governmental unaccountability, the fossil fuel industry, and ever-present climate disasters. The organizations represented in the U.S. People's Delegation include: SustainUS, Sunrise Movement, Indigenous Environmental Network, Global Grassroots Justice Alliance, and the Climate Justice Alliance as part of It Takes Roots, U.S Human Rights Network, Climate Generation, Our Children's Trust, NextGen America, and 350.org. "Throughout my experience of running bilingual workshops and doing door-to-door outreach on environmental issues in low-income neighborhoods of my hometown of Hayward, CA, I've noticed people are more willing to try something new and listen when they're approached by someone they can connect with. This is why we should have officials who come from the same backgrounds as the citizens --people able to speak the truth about their experiences and what they can do to improve their actions to help fight climate change. As a delegate with ICLEI-350.org's People's Delegation to COP23 in Bonn, I want the world to know what's working in neighborhoods like mine." - Daisy Guadalupe Romero, with the ICLEI delegation and a U.S People's Delegation participant "We are on fire in my home state of California. This year has been one climate disaster after another - it is clearer than ever what we're fighting to protect. Meanwhile, President Trump and former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson's 'America First' policies of climate denial will only benefit them and their friends in the oil industry. Their growing wealth comes at the cost of real lives and livelihoods destroyed by fires, storms and rising seas." - Kyle Lemle, a U.S People's Delegation participant with SustainUS "Puerto Rico has been the victim of a perfect storm of natural weather extremes, fiscal austerity measures, bad management and planning, combined with a colonial situation that prevents us from trading and learning from our sister islands in the Caribbean region. Along with the Caribbean, Puerto Rico was hit by two of the largest hurricanes in recorded history within two weeks of each other in the month of September. Organizacion Boricua has been working on the frontlines under the most dire conditions of colonialism, corruption, and climate change. We demand a Just Transition." - Katia R. Aviles Vazquez of Organizacion Boricua, representing the It Takes Roots delegation and a U.S People's Delegation participant "By saving our islands, we can save the world -- and this requires ending the fossil fuel industry. We're standing with the U.S. Pacific Climate Delegation as part of a global climate movement to say now is the time, and we cannot wait any longer." - Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Pacific Climate Warriors "We need to take climate justice in our own hands and shut down fossil fuel infrastructure, with our own bodies if necessary. When Ende Gelande stands up against the huge open-cast coal mines in the West Germany with mass actions of civil disobedience, we feel as a part of a global movement for climate justice, and we stand in solidarity with all people who are fighting to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Like-minded movements in North America such as Standing Rock have been an inspiration to all of us." - Dorothee Haussermann, Ende Gelaende in Germany "We need environmental justice policy, especially in communities inundated with refineries and chemical plants. In Houston, we just a major flood and this was not the first time. But this one, Hurricane Harvey, did a lot of damage displacing 40,000 - 60,000 people. On the west side where I live, we were flooded with toxins that were being released by a 52 mile stretch of refineries and chemical plants. We are here to demand that we address chemical security policy in order to protect communities, workers and everybody near those facilities during intensifying extreme weather events." - Juan Parras, T.E.J.A.S. (Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services), representing the It Takes Roots delegation "Indigenous voices have been systematically left out of these decision-making processes, while our treaties are broken for profit and power. I'm going to COP23 to uplift the voices and values that I learned from indigenous communities, including the mandate to protect the voices of all those yet to come - the seventh generation." - Michael Charles, a U.S People's Delegation participant with SustainUS "As a New Orleans native, I witnessed how devastating dirty energy like oil, gas, and coal is on entire communities. They obliterate entire ecosystems, erasing species and threatening the existence of countless more. Tragic events like Hurricane Katrina and the BP Drilling Disaster have left my communities traumatized. As climate change continues to intensify with no long term climate plans in place, so will the destruction of black, brown, and indigenous communities in the Gulf South. Furthermore, as the Trump Administration continues to roll back climate protections, the Gulf Coast community will become more prone to catastrophic events like Hurricanes Maria and Irma. I'm headed to COP23 with the U.S People's Delegation to paint a vivid picture of those impacted by climate disasters, to amplify the grassroots actions we are taking to support our communities, and stand in our power by resistance the Trump Administration's dangerous and destructive negligence of our communities." - Troy Robertson, a U.S People's Delegation participant with SustainUS After the 2016 election happened, I wanted to build a bigger coalition across Jefferson County in Colorado, a county of about 600,000 people, almost evenly split politically between Democrat, Republican, and Independent. So I started the Jeffco Climate Action Team, a coalition including architects, energy engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers, moms, and healthcare workers. Our group works across the county, attending city council meetings, researching local issues and candidates, showing up at the state legislature, writing letters to the editor and interacting with members of other environmental groups. I want other small towns to know it's possible, with the right coalition, to make change happen. It's worth doing, even in places that aren't known for environmental action. We are excited to share the stories and successes of Jefferson County as part of the ICLEI-350.org People's Delegation to COP 23 ." - Rhiannon Gallagher, with the ICLEI delegation and a U.S People's Delegation participant "We're going to COP23 to show the rest of the world that while #45 is in denial about the climate crisis but we are not, we see climate impacts in our communities and we are not turning a blind eye to this reality. We are going to Bonn to uphold the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to demand that governments implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples within their climate agendas." - Kandi Mossett, representing the Indigenous Environmental Network, It Takes Roots delegation and a U.S People's Delegation participant "After graduating, I wanted to start my professional career with direct climate action experience. So, I moved to California for a CivicSpark AmeriCorps Fellowship with the city of El Cerrito. As a CivicSpark Fellow, I managed various municipal projects surrounding climate action plan implementation. In my service year, I've seen that no matter the direction of policymakers at the federal level, local governments continue to lead the fight against climate change. I know that local governments can be decisive, action-oriented, and responsive to the community they serve, and that's needed now more than ever when it comes to taking meaningful climate action. I join ICLEI and 350's U.S. People's Delegation in Bonn to show the world what meaningful local government leadership looks like." - Justin Marquez, with the ICLEI delegation and a U.S People's Delegation participant "The U.S. People's Delegation is at COP23 to share loud and clear the message that communities back home demand a fast and fair transition to a world free of fossil fuels with 100% renewable energy for all. 350.org is proud to be supporting the work of organizations who were already bringing delegations to COP23 . Our work collectively as part of the U.S. People's Delegation is aimed at amplifying the urgency of climate action, holding accountable elected officials who have said they will step up against the Trump Administration to ensure they turn their words into action, and sharing our stories and solutions from diverse communities. We do not have time to waste, we need real climate action now." - Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Manager and coordination of the U.S. People's Delegation.

The following information was released by the World Bank: Fiji is set to use 360 Virtual Reality (VR) as a key part of its global push for stronger action on climate change at next month's COP23 Climate Change conference. As part of its Presidency of COP23 in Bonn, Germany, the Fijian Government will launch an immersive VR experience that aims to transport delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to experience the current and future impacts of climate change on the Pacific. Featured in this program is Our Home, Our People , which was produced by the World Bank. The video takes viewers to communities across Fiji to experience the stories of four people whose lives have already been fundamentally changed by climate change, including through last year's devastating Category Five Tropical Cyclone Winston. The VR experience includes the story of Vunisavisavi, a remote coastal community which has already seen significant relocation due to the impacts of rising sea levels. Our Home, Our People is launching alongside the Fijian Government's Climate Vulnerability Assessment 2017, a significant new report which sets out, in significant detail, the climate impacts already felt by Fiji, and identifies possible strategies and costs to make Fiji more climate resilient. The Fijian Government's High-Level Climate Champion, Hon. Inia Seruiratu , said that VR provides a powerful medium for helping decision-makers and members of the public more deeply understand the impacts climate change is already having on Fiji and Fijians. "Working with partners such as the World Bank, the Fijian COP23 Presidency is supporting a number of virtual reality projects as a way to share stories about climate change. We believe in VR's power to give audiences both decision-makers at COP23 in Bonn, and people across the world the chance to see and experience the impacts of climate change in far-away vulnerable countries and isolated communities like in the Pacific, in order to better understand our call for stronger action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increased investment in climate adaptation. I hope through VR the urgency to act will be highlighted." he said. Michel Kerf, World Bank Country Director Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands said Our Home, Our People is about delving into the stories behind the numbers and projections of how climate change will and is impacting Fiji and the Pacific. "VR is extraordinarily effective at taking audiences to another place, into other people's lives," said Kerf. "Our Home, Our People transports audiences including decision makers who can take action to change the course of climate change to the true heart of the issue in the Pacific." The Our Home, Our People project is produced by the Fijian Government, COP23 Secretariat and the World Bank, in partnership with the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and VR specialists, S1T2. \</doc>

Divest BU activism liaison Masha Vernik speaks at Divest BU's National Campus Day of Action at Marsh Chapel Wednesday afternoon. PHOTO BY MAISIE MANSFIELD-GREENWALD/ DAILY FREE PRESS STAFF DivestBU urged the Boston University Board of Trustees to adopt BU Bold - a version of the Climate Action Plan advocating that BU shift entirely to renewable energy by 2040 - at a rally Wednesday afternoon. The rally coincided with National Campus Day of Action - a movement to encourage students across the country to call for environmental action from their administrations in light of the ongoing COP23 : United Nations Climate Change Conference . The CAP was created by the Climate Action Task Force in September. The Board of Trustees will likely vote on whether to induct the CAP next month. "We're ... doing the best that we can along the way to make sure that the Board of Trustees votes on the BU Bold plan, which is the most aggressive form of the Climate Action Plan," Stephanie Eggers, DivestBU's media liaison, said before the rally. The adoption of BU Bold would require the university to adopt 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, Eggers, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, said. The goal is to eliminate emissions from "anything from electricity to heating and cooling and transportation on campus," Eggers said, "and then also trying to internalize emissions that come from outside BU's campus, like professors coming to work every day." In the week before the rally, DivestBU asked students to fill out paper baseball caps, representing the CAP, with a message about why they believe the Board of Trustees should pass the CAP or BU Bold, Eggers said. Rally-goers walked from Marsh Plaza to the building that houses President Robert Brown's office to deliver one of the caps for him to fill out, as well as a letter written and signed by DivestBU. Brown wasn't in the office, so members handed the caps and letter to his chief of staff. "It's just kind of our call to action for him," Eggers said. Four community leaders spoke at the rally - Quinton Zondervan, a Cambridge city councilor-elect; Marta Marello, project manager of BU's Climate Action Plan; Jake Taber, campus coordinator with Environment America and Bolaji Olagbegi, a DivestBU member and sophomore in the CAS. Marchers chanted in between speakers and along the walk, demanding climate action from BU. "What do we want? Climate action," they cheered. "When do we want it? Now." Taber said before the rally that he wanted to show Environment America's support for BU Bold and explain how BU's commitment to sustainability can create momentum for larger commitments at the city and state level. "[We want to be] able to make sure the universities make these strong commitments," Taber said, "which can be in themselves really strong and powerful examples for the cities and states in which those universities reside." Taber said he is optimistic that the Board of Trustees will pass BU Bold due to BU's history as a leader in sustainability. "BU is in a really good place when it comes to momentum and when it comes to the culture and the commitment it's already made to sustainability," Taber said. "I really think that the trustees are going to see that this is the right thing to do, and they're going to make the right decision." Masha Vernik, the DivestBU activism liaison, said if they have BU's best interest in mind, the trustees will vote to adopt BU Bold. "Feasibly it can definitely be achieved," Vernik said. "The Climate Action Plan has outlined pretty detailed steps about how BU can make pretty concrete changes to its energy sources and the amount of the grid that it owns and where it owns places in different utility grids." Several students who participated in the rally also expressed their support for BU Bold. Alexandra Chin, a CAS senior involved with sustainability@BU, said she thinks it is selfish not to participate in such sustainability movements. "Even if you are in this metropolitan area where people don't think they're going to be affected by climate change, you see how Boston could be 40 percent underwater by 2030," Chin said. "It's something that's so close to home, and it affects so many other people." Wiley Hundertmark, a CAS sophomore and a member of the Environmental Student Organization, said he attended the rally out of concern for his hometown. "I come from a seaside town that potentially will be influenced pretty heavily by rising sea levels," Hundertmark said, "so it's really important to me that my hometown doesn't get completely underwater over the course of not only my lifetime, but [that of] my children in the future." Hundertmark said he hopes the rally will influence the Board of Trustees to adopt BU Bold for the good of the Boston community. "It's all about getting the administration to realize there are a lot of students at BU who are really passionate about this and that really are working toward this because they feel it's the best thing to do," Hundertmark said. Margaret Bywater, a College of Communication freshman and a member of DivestBU, said she thinks climate change is an issue that can easily get lost in the discourse of daily life. "I hope the Board of Trustees and President Brown adopt the BU Bold plan of the Climate Action Plan because I think that it's the best way for BU to become a leader among universities for saying no to climate change," Bywater said. "I think that we could start a chain reaction that could be really powerful." \</doc>

The European Commission issued the following news release: The EU expects this year's UN climate conference ( COP23 ) to reaffirm once again the international community's commitment to stepping up the global response to climate change and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following the entry into force of the historic agreement last year, elaborating its implementing guidelines is now a key focus. President Jean-Claude Juncker clearly said it in his State of the European Union speech at the European Parliament this year: "I want Europe to be the leader when it comes to the fight against climate change. Last year, we set the global rules of the game with the Paris Agreement ratified here, in this very House. Set against the collapse of ambition in the United States, Europe must ensure we make our planet great again. It is the shared heritage of all of humanity." Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: "The Paris Agreement has set the direction of travel for the global transition to a modern low-carbon economy. The increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events we are witnessing across the world are a stark reminder of the urgency of the challenges we face. Now is the time to translate ambition into action and speed up implementation. COP23 will be a key moment to ensure that we are on track to meet our first deadline: completing the Paris work programme by 2018." The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ), presided over by Fiji, is taking place from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany. It will bring together ministers and government officials, as well as a wide range of representatives from civil society and business. The EU expects the conference to demonstrate clear progress on the development of the technical rules and guidelines for implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement, for example on the transparency framework and the 5-year ambition cycle aimed at helping countries make progressively more ambitious contributions. The work programme is due to be adopted at the 2018 UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. The EU is making solid progress on finalising a legislative framework for achieving its Paris target - its collective nationally determined contribution (NDC) - to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. This includes revising the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) post-2020, setting 2030 emissions reduction targets for non-ETS sectors such as transport, buildings and agriculture and integrating land use, land use change and forestry into the EU's legal framework for climate action. In addition the Commission intends to present a Clean Mobility package of proposals on 8 November to further facilitate the EU's transition to low carbon mobility and economy. The EU remains committed to the collective global goal of mobilising USD 100 billion a year by 2020 and through to 2025 to finance climate action in developing countries, from a variety of sources, and continuing to significantly increase financing for adaptation to climate change. In 2016, the EU and its Member States contributed a total EUR 20.2 billion in climate finance, an increase of more than 10% from the EUR 17.6 billion provided in 2015. Alongside the formal COP23 negotiations, the Bonn conference will showcase climate action by a wide range of stakeholders including cities and regions, businesses and civil society groups. The EU is a strong supporter of the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) as an important platform for multi-stakeholder action and will continue to engage actively in this forum. The EU will be represented in Bonn by Miguel Arias Canete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy and Siim Kiisler, Environment Minister of Estonia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of Ministers of the EU. Events during COP23 During the conference, the EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion in Bonn (see link below). These events, organised by a variety of countries and organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition to the role of forests and oceans, climate finance, research and innovation and assessing climate risks.

Gov. Jerry Brown (D) will continue his role leading international efforts to address climate change and promote clean energy during an upcoming 10-day trip to Europe, culminating with serving in his new position as special adviser for states and regions at the United Nations climate conference in Bonn, Germany. Meanwhile, Cal/EPA Secretary Matt Rodriquez will be attending several side events at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, according to an agency spokesman. "While the White House declares war on climate science and retreats from the Paris Agreement, California is doing the opposite and taking action," Brown says in an Oct. 31 press release. "We are joining with our partners from every part of the world to do what needs to be done to prevent irreversible climate change." During his Nov. 4-14 trip to Europe, Brown is scheduled to deliver keynote remarks at a climate summit organized by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Vatican City; discuss clean energy collaboration with European Union leaders in Brussels; address the State Parliament of Baden-W\'fcrttemberg in Stuttgart, Germany; convene top climate scientists from around the world in Oslo, Norway; and serve as special adviser for states and regions at COP23 in Bonn, the release says. Brown was named to the special adviser post in June by the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who will serve as COP23 president. The governor has helped create coalitions of global partners that are committed to curbing carbon emissions in both the United States through the U.S. Climate Alliance and around the globe with the Under2 Coalition, which includes 188 jurisdictions collectively representing more than 1.2 billion people and $28.9 trillion gross domestic product, according to the governor's office. Brown recently joined Michael Bloomberg, the U.N. special envoy for cities and climate change, to launch "America's Pledge" on climate change to help compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the release says. The European trip follows Brown's recent visits to China aimed at building "closer climate ties" with President Xi Jinping; Russia, to call for "deeper trans-pacific collaboration on climate change at the Eastern Economic Forum"; Canada, to officially link California's carbon market with Quebec and Ontario; and New York, to discuss "subnational climate action" with the U.N. secretary-general and open Climate Week NYC, the release adds. Meanwhile, Rodriquez will attend about half a dozen side events at COP23 in Bonn, including two public meetings -- one on Nov. 13 involving "sustainable innovations" that is being hosted by the U.N. Environment Programme; and the other Nov. 15 regarding cooperation between California and Germany on climate change, according to the Cal/EPA spokesman. The conference is the fifth COP Rodriquez has attended on behalf of California, the spokesman says. Alexa Kleysteuber, Cal/EPA's deputy secretary for border and intergovernmental relations, will also participate in COP23 , providing staff services for Rodriquez and attending several other side events, the spokesman adds. \</doc>

CARE International issued the following news release: The international humanitarian and development agency CARE International comments on the closure of the 23nd UN climate change conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Many came to Bonn with expectations that COP23 -- the first to be hosted by a small island developing country, Fiji -- would bring stronger action to address the immediate needs of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. However, this was not the case. There is still a window of opportunity, but there is only a few years left to prevent a rise above 1.5oC. We hope that the Talanoa Dialogue launched at COP23 will play an essential role in bringing countries back to next year's climate summit COP24 with clear plans for increasing ambition. Wolfgang Jamann, Secretary General and CEO of CARE International, said: "At COP23 , political agreements did not sufficiently address the harsh climate reality that millions of poor and vulnerable people already face. CARE welcomes the agreements in areas such as gender and agriculture, as well as the attention to climate impacts. However, as global emissions continue to increase, we need countries to significantly step up their efforts in 2018 to shift away from this dangerous trajectory and to keep within the 1.5oC limit." Vitumbiko Chinoko, CARE's Partnerships and Advocacy Coordinator for Southern Africa, said: "After years of seeing Parties at the UN Climate Change talks struggle to agree, CARE welcomes the positive outcome in agriculture. We are particularly pleased that Parties will focus on food security and social dynamics and move the agriculture agenda to implementation. Countries in Southern Africa are already acting, and the COP decision is a critical opportunity to help scale up approaches that tackle climate change and increase the resilience of food producers and women." Fanny Petitbon, Advocacy Manager of CARE France, said: "The adoption of the first ever Gender Action Plan under the UNFCCC is a big step in the right direction. Governments have demonstrated their willingness to deliver on the Paris Agreement's commitment to undertake gender-equitable climate action and enhance women's contribution to climate decision-making. CARE will closely monitor whether countries will follow through on their commitments and we urge countries to provide finance for the Gender Action Plan activities." Sven Harmeling, Global Lead on Climate Change Advocacy for CARE International Climate Change & Resilience Platform, said: "At COP23 , developed countries stood in the way of agreeing to start serious work on innovative instruments, such as taxing carbon polluters, which would generate additional resources to deal with loss and damage. Due to this inaction, pressure on rich countries is building up: they must address the issue of loss and damage finance and raise support for preventive adaptation measures. We expect the one-day climate summit on 12th December in Paris to address the missed opportunity in Bonn." This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.

The European Investment Bank issued the following news release: The recently launched Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, a joint initiative between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Government of Luxembourg, is investing EUR 5 million in C Shares of the Green for Growth Fund (GGF). This first investment of the platform was announced today by the EIB at COP 23 , the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference. Speaking at COP23 The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform will fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The GGF is an ideal investment partner due to its proven capability to facilitate investments of households, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises into energy efficiency and renewable energy. The GGF also has strong experience in direct financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in low and middle-income countries. Through its innovative public private partnership structure, the GGF is able to leverage public financial resources with private investments High impact is additionally achieved through on-the-ground support and capacity-building activities from the fund's Technical Assistance Facility. LCFP's EUR 5 million investment will focus on climate change mitigation in the MENA region. In 2016, the GGF expanded to the MENA region, where it sees a high demand for the implementation of energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy. Speaking at COP23 Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, said: "For Luxembourg, being an important financial centre, unlocking private finance is a key objective. We are very pleased to partner with the EIB on the Climate Finance Platform." Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg Minister for the Environment, said: "We need innovative solutions to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. This initiative will finance three projects that would otherwise struggle to attract private investment, especially climate adaptation projects in developing countries." Background information: About the GGF The Green for Growth Fund invests in measures designed to cut energy use and CO2 emissions by a minimum of 20% in 19 markets across Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova, the Middle East and North Africa. The Fund provides financing to local partners that on-lend to enterprises and private households, and it invests directly, primarily through the contribution of senior debt, in renewable energy projects. The GGF's Technical Assistance Facility maximizes the fund's investment impact through support for capacity building at local financial institutions and partners. The GGF was initiated as a public-private partnership in December 2009 by Germany's KfW Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, with financial support from the European Commission, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Austrian development bank OeEB. The fund's growing investor base comprises donor agencies, international financial institutions and institutional private investors, including the International Finance Corporation, the Dutch development bank FMO, the German ethical bank GLS, and Church of Sweden. The GGF is advised by Finance in Motion GmbH. MACS Management & Consulting Services GmbH, Frankfurt am Main acts as the technical advisor.

The Center for Biological Diversity issued the following news release: The Center for Biological Diversity submitted Freedom of Information Act requests today seeking public records from three federal agencies to shine a light on the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The request seeks all reports and memoranda that the administration relied upon when it made its decision, as well as related emails, telephone logs and notes from meetings involving President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and other administration officials. As the international community prepares for this November's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, the Center hopes to determine how Trump's Paris decision was influenced by a poor understanding of climate science and lobbying by the fossil fuel industry. The Center also looks to uncover whether any new scientific or economic analysis was used in justifying the withdrawal. "We need to know if Trump put any real thought at all into this profoundly dangerous decision," said Clare Lakewood, a staff attorney at the Center. "Withdrawing from the Paris agreement isolated America by highlighting this administration's reckless contempt for our planet's future. Americans have a right to learn how Trump officials were influenced by scientific ignorance and fossil fuel industry lobbyists." Today's requests were sent to the Department of State, EPA and Office of Management and Budget. On June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris agreement. A recent survey found that 71 percent of Americans support the agreement, which acknowledges the urgent need to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to avoid catastrophic climate change.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia /California Newswire/ - On Wednesday, Calif. Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined leaders from Japan, South Korea, Russia, China and more than a dozen other countries at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia where he pushed businesses and governments to join forces not just on trade and investment but also on the decarbonization of the economy. "The world has never had more power or more danger - or more opportunity if we can work together. And this forum is inviting that coming together of countries in the Pacific region, focusing on trade. But trade, to be sustainable, must be innovative and creative," said Governor Brown in remarks at the opening of the Forum. "Trade will not be sustainable if it attempts to violate forever the rules of nature." In addition to speaking at the opening of the Forum, Governor Brown gave remarks today at the sixth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Conference on Cooperation in Higher Education and later participated on a Forum panel focused on opportunities for cooperation between Russia, China, Japan and the United States. On Thursday, the Governor will lead a discussion on climate change at the Far Eastern Federal University. On the way to Vladivostok, Russia, Governor Brown stopped in Nome, Alaska where he met with researchers and native Alaskans to learn more about the impacts of climate change to arctic ecosystems. The Governor's complete remarks, delivered at the opening of the Forum, are below: Good morning. I first want to express my appreciation for the invitation to represent California at this forum. It's what we call "bottom-up" diplomacy. I come from a mere state or what people like to call a sub-national unit. Nevertheless, we have an impact in the world. Our gross domestic product is about $2.5 trillion. We're a land of innovation: Google, Facebook, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Hollywood. We're a land of disruption, where we never set in and accept a status quo, but we disrupt and create and build a future that works for everyone. California, of course, has a very special relationship with Russia. Russia was in California before America was in California. I refer to Fort Ross and the settlement there that still represents a symbolic place of collaboration and dialogue - the Fort Ross dialogue, something that I attend each year. So, I really have to express again my appreciation for being here, to be a part of this discussion bringing the peoples of the Pacific closer together. The Pacific Ocean, the name of which stands for peace, peaceful cooperation. And through trade, through business, through investment, through cultural exchange, we can create opportunities. And as we create opportunities of collaboration, we minimize those real threats that we all face. The threats of climate change, of terrorism, of nuclear proliferation and danger. The world has never had more power or more danger - or more opportunity if we can work together. And this forum is inviting that coming together of countries in the Pacific region, focusing on trade. But trade, to be sustainable, must be innovative and creative. The world of carbon is very much with us and is the basis of our civilization, even our meeting here. But the future is going to decarbonize. We need a world of elegance and innovation and renewable technology and zero-emission transportation and more efficient ways of building and living together. Trade will not be sustainable if it attempts to violate forever the rules of nature. We are all subject to physics and atmospheric chemistry. And 97 percent of the world's scientists tell us climate change is occurring, that it will have catastrophic impacts. Yes, there will be some positives but the increase in heat will cause migrations of millions, tens of millions of people and widespread suffering if we cannot make the Paris Agreement real. That's why California has joined with 175 other states, provinces and regions to form the Under2 Coalition. This is a coalition of states representing over a billion people that are committed to keeping greenhouse gas emissions under 2 degrees centigrade from the industrial period. But this is not just a coalition of restriction, it's a coalition of innovation. And the future will go to those who look not to the past, but look to the future. And not getting absorbed in the controversies of the moment; the difficulties of today or even next week. But rather standing back, looking out 25 years, 50 years - what is the world that we will all create together? Russia and the United States with China and Vietnam and Japan and India and Korea and other countries. This forum in the Pacific has great significance symbolically, humanly and economically. I am glad to be a small part of it. And I would just say that what rises converges. If we can raise our thinking and lift our eyes to a future that is inclusive, that is innovative and that takes into account the science that we all know, then we will converge and we can look to a very bright future, not only in the Pacific but everywhere in the world. Thank you. California's Climate Leadership In July, Governor Brown signed landmark legislation that extends and improves the state's world-leading cap-and-trade program and establishes a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. In recent years, Governor Brown has signed legislation establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; setting the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; directing cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems; and requiring the state to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings. Later this month, Governor Brown will travel to New York City for events connected to Climate Week NYC and the 72nd Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In November, the Governor is expected to take part in a number of international gatherings in Europe focused on fighting global warming, including a climate symposium organized by the Vatican and this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany. In June, Governor Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of COP 23 by Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama - incoming president of COP 23 . This followed meetings with China's President Xi Jinping during the Governor's week-long trip to China and with Germany's top environmental official, Minister Barbara Hendricks, in San Francisco. Governor Brown continues to build strong coalitions of partners committed to curbing carbon pollution in both the United States through the U.S. Climate Alliance and around the globe with the Under2 Coalition. Governor Brown also launched America's Pledge on climate change with Michael Bloomberg earlier this year to help compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses in the United States to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In September 2018, the State of California will convene the world's climate leaders in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit, where representatives from subnational governments, businesses, investors and civil society will gather with the direct goal of supporting the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Jan 19, 2018( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP23 ), a major annual forum for climate policy dialogue, recently moved transportation into the spotlight, paving the way for more proactive emissions reduction measures. Suzanne Greene, manager of the MIT Sustainable Logistics Initiative (SLI), a new initiative from the MIT Center for Transportation ...gistics, participated in the COP23 , the first CTL representative to join the international event. Closing the gap COP23 was considered a 'technical COP,' establishing how the Paris Accords will be implemented by countries and industry starting in 2020. While 2020 is the line in the sand by policy standards, all actions are driving toward the massive reduction in GHG emissions needed to meet 2050 targets: at the minimum, keeping global temperatures less than 2 degrees Celsius above the levels experienced during pre-industrial times, with proactive measures to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Accords rely on each country to put forth emissions reduction targets\~- known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs)\~- to meet 2050 goals. However, transport-specific targets related to passenger transportation are included in 43 percent of NDCs, and freight transportation is left out of all by 13 percent of NDCs. International modes of transportation, such as maritime and aviation, slip between the cracks and are left out by most countries. COP23 represents a significant step toward reversing this trend. The first ever Transportation Day took place at the November event, which drew attention to the intersection between domestic and international policy and industry efforts. The gap in the NDCs perhaps inadvertently shifts the onus to industry to track and mitigate their freight transport emissions. With freight demand, and thus GHG emissions, on the rise, companies are engaged with climate action at unprecedented levels and with an increasing sense of momentum, as demonstrated by the the COP23 launch of the Transport Decarbonization Alliance. New pathways for reducing emissions The Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is releasing a tool for transportation starting in early 2018, which SLI Manager Suzanne Greene has been involved in developing. The SBTi empowers companies to use their emissions data to set climate targets that are in line with projections for efficiency improvements and new technologies determined by the International Energy Association. The SBTi, however, bases the targets on the company's own emissions calculation, which is a challenge for the many companies with transport emissions in their supply chain and often left out. The forthcoming CDP questionnaire for transportation will require the use of uniform methodologies for calculation and reporting, the GHG Protocol (passengers) and GLEC Framework (freight). This will enable comparable science-based targets, increased transparency between transportation buyer and supplier and new pathways for partnerships around emissions reduction and sustainable decision-making. This growing expertise in corporate carbon accounting is an opportunity to improve existing transportation NDCs and to support the creation of NDCs where transportation is now left out. Ready to act The data companies routinely gather\~- and increasingly share\~- can also be used to close the gap on maritime and aviation emissions, which remain stranded in international waters and airspace. Freight transportation shows a tremendous promise for emissions reduction through both efficiency improvements and technology adoption that will benefit both the climate and human health. Industry is poised and ready to act - let's incorporate logistics into the NDCs and make sure all progress is being tracked and recognized.

CARE International issued the following news release: Leaders must put the needs of those disproportionately affected by climate change impacts - women and girls - firmly at the heart of talks during the 23rd annual UN climate summit ( COP23 ), urges CARE International, the development and humanitarian organisation. With the UN climate talks, presided over by the government of Fiji, set to take place from 6 to 17 November in Bonn, Germany, an estimated 25,000 participants from nearly 200 countries have a chance to ensure that the disproportionate consequences of climate change on women and girls around the world are tackled. Wolfgang Jamann, CEO CARE International, said: Sven Harmeling, Head of the COP23 delegation CARE International, said: "The Parties at COP23 know what is needed to end suffering while tackling the gender gap that widens from climate change impacts. They must adopt a gender-equitable loss and damage work plan that identifies sources to generate finance in the order of USD50bn per year for recovery following loss of homes, farms and land and the means to sustain their families. Governments must also decide to promote alternative farming techniques adapted to changing climate conditions which benefits the poor, as climate change increasingly undermines the food and nutrition security of small-holder women farmers and their communities." Fanny Petitbon, Advocacy Manager CARE France, said: COP23 also marks a crucial meeting on the pathway to finalising further rules required for the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement, and increasing actions to cut emissions, aimed for 2018. Progressive developing and developed countries must stand together and resist any backtracking from the Paris Agreement by unwilling countries. "The actions promised by the most powerful nations to cut harmful emissions from fossil fuels still fall short of the agreed upon goal to limit global warming to 1.5&#61616;C degrees above pre-industrial levels. This is a critical threshold which can still prevent many of the worst impacts on poor populations. COP23 must provide a clear way forward so that countries come back with more ambitious plans to cut emissions," said Sven Harmeling. This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 2, 2017.

Olympia: The State of Washington has issued the following news release: Last June, Gov. Jay Inslee was sitting with nearly 100 other guests in the dining room of California Gov. Jerry Brown\' s home at a lunch event to celebrate Fiji becoming the newest signatory to the Under2 MOU, an international coalition of national and subnational governments committed to ambitious climate action. The lunch had particular significance in the wake of recent events. President Donald Trump had just announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. In response, Brown and Inslee, as well as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, had launched the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance with more than a dozen states committing to achieving their share of the U.S. greenhouse gas reduction target. So while what happened at that lunch was unprecedented, it wasn\' t necessarily surprising. Fiji\' s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama is also the president of COP23 , the 23rd annual convening of nations to talk about next steps in global climate action. Right after signing the Under2 MOU, Bainimarama invited Inslee, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, and Jerry Brown to attend COP23 in Bonn, Germany, and deliver a message to the world that the U.S. was still in for the fight against climate change. All three West Coast governors agreed. They would help a wide collection of U.S. voices stand in as the collective, representative voice of U.S. action on climate. With every nation in the world  save the U.S.  formally committed to the Paris agreement, COP23 drew an estimated 25,000 participants representing nations, subnational governments, businesses, schools, universities, NGOs and faith communities.

The World Bank issued the following news release: The Virtual Reality climate change film project that has shared Fiji's climate change story with the world is set to make its return home to Fiji next week. Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK http://www.ourhomeourpeople.com www.ourhomeourpeople.com COP23 in November. The VR film project was produced in the communities of Vunisavisavi (Cakaudrove, Vanua Levu), Namarai and Nabukadra, as well as Bayly Memorial School, Barotu (Ra Province, Viti Levu), and was a key part of the Fiji Pavilion at COP23 . COP23 , and was recently named as a finalist in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Action Awards. "This is truly a uniquely Fijian story, told through the powerful, moving format of 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR)," said Lasse Melgaard, the World Bank's Resident Representative for the South Pacific. "We are incredibly grateful to the communities of Ra and Vunisavisavi, who shared their lives with our team for this story, and we are so pleased to be able to finally bring their story 'home' to Fiji - to allow thousands more people to experience this powerful, moving story in its true 360-degree format." The 'return tour' will also include a series of community events to be held at the communities whose stories are featured in the film, including Nabukadra and Naramai (Ra Province). The project was funded by the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program, and was launched in partnership with the Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, a report launched by the Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, the Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. The report, prepared in line with Fiji's National Development Plan, examined the economic and social impacts of climate change on Fiji over the coming decades, and provides a set of recommendations as to the most effective investments to adapt and minimize its impacts.

Nov 11, 2017( The Independent View: HYPERLINK http://ipview.blospot.com http://ipview.blospot.com COP23 - The International Political Response to Climate Change began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the 'Rio Convention' included the Adoption of the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This Convention set out a Framework for Action aimed avoiding 'Dangerous Anthropogenic Interference with the Climate System.' The UNFCCC entered into force in 1994 and now has a Near-Universal Membership of 196 Countries. The Main Objective of the annual Conference of Parties (COP) is to Review the Convention's Implementation. COP23 will be held on November 13-14, 2017 in Bonn, Germany. In 2017, COP23 heads to Bonn, the Seat of the UNFCCC Headquarters, and will be Organized by Fiji, a small Pacific island State, particularly Vulnerable to the Consequences of Climate Change like Rising Ocean Levels and Extreme Weather Phenomena.The Sustainable Innovation Forum returns in 2017 with a Stronger than ever Mandate to help Build the Cross Sector Partnerships required to Realize the Paris Agreement's Goals, catalyze the Exchange of Global Knowledge, and provide a Springboard for Action by Global Leaders.Mike joined President ...ime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama at COP23 to discuss U.S. climate action and how nations of all sizes are leading in climate.During COP23 , Mike Bloomberg will Kick-Off a Conversation that aims to Shed Light on this Growing Movement and to Discuss the Future of Transitioning from Coal-Dependence with International and National Experts, including Laurence Tubiana, CEO of European Climate Foundation, former Climate Change Ambassador of the French Government, Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director, Greenpeace International, Lord Adair Turner, Chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, and Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary, German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety.The Battle to End Coal-Burning, backed by Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, is expanding out of the U.S. and around the World in its Bid to Reduce the Global Warming Threat posed by the most Polluting Fossil Fuel.

U.S., May 3 -- Fraport AG is establishing new climate protection targets aimed at further reducing CO2 emissions not only for Frankfurt Airport but also across the entire Group. The goal is to lower CO2 emissions at Fraport's fully-consolidated Group companies by nearly half to about 125,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2030. The corresponding emissions in 2017 amounted to 209,668 metric tons of CO2. Fraport's new target is based on the national reduction rates agreed to at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. Fraport AG's executive board chairman, Dr. Stefan Schulte, said: "Growth and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but belong together. In the spirit of corporate responsibility, we have firmly embedded climate protection in our Group companies to make a positive contribution to this worldwide effort. To achieve our CO2 goals, we will continue to improve the energy efficiency ratings of our buildings, facilities and processes." In the report, Group CO2 emissions were included with the non-financial performance indicators - along with figures on the sickness rate and the ratio for women in management positions (in Germany). Other indicators include global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity at Frankfurt Airport, as well as Group-wide employee satisfaction. Advancements in these key topics and further initiatives with regard to sustainability are presented in the latest Fraport Group report for the 2017 fiscal year. Titled "2017 Compact - Gute Reise! We make it happen", the report also provides information about Fraport's financial performance during the past year.

The following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain: The 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Convention ( COP23 ) is being held in Bonn (Germany) from 7 to 17 November, chaired by Fiji. The adoption, in December 2015, of the Paris Agreement was an historic milestone since it achieved a global response to climate change for the first time. The strong commitment from the international community through this agreement made it possible for it to come into force within a year of its adoption. Spain finalised the ratification process on 2 February 2017. COP23 will allow the necessary bases to be laid to implement the Paris Agreement and make progress on the negotiation of a series of key technical questions to ensure the functioning of the system. Spain decisively supports the Paris Agreement and wishes to take steps towards its development to ensure the application of its guidelines. It is necessary to move forwards in a balanced fashion in all the elements of its work programme (mitigation, adaptation, transparency and financing) in order to guarantee the adoption of decisions on the technical issues pending in 2018. The progress made in Bonn must assure that all countries actively participate in the fight against climate change, taking into account common albeit differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances, and thus achieve a suitable response to this challenge. Lastly, this COP23 -NON OFFICIAL TRANSLATION- \</doc>

The following information was released by United Nations Secretary-General: Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, I thank Prime Minister Bainimarana for his remarks. And I want to congratulate him for his remarkable Presidency of COP23 . My sincere gratitude for the excellent work that Fiji, the Government of Fiji and yourself, Prime Minister, have done. And you are right. We need more ambition. We must go further and faster together. It is fitting that this year's conference is led by Fiji, a nation on the frontlines. Last month I visited other small islands facing the impacts of a warming world: Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica. The hurricanes' damage was beyond belief. The catastrophic effects of climate change are upon us. And the voice of small island State that are on the frontlines of the impact of climate change must the voice of us all. In the battlefield, when the frontline is decimated, the whole army is lost. And the same would happen to the planet with climate change. Floods, fires, extreme storms and drought are growing in intensity and frequency. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they have been for 800,000 years. Climate change is the defining threat of our time. Our duty -- to each other and to future generations -- is to raise ambition. We need to do more on five ambition action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership. First, reducing emissions. The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report shows that current pledges will only deliver a third of what is needed to stay in the safety zones of the Paris Agreement. The Global Carbon Project reported earlier this week that 2017 will see the first increase in CO2 emissions in three years. The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less. And we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees. We need at least a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. Yet there are also encouraging signs of progress. For years, many insisted that lowering emissions would stifle growth, and that high emissions were the unavoidable cost of progress. Today that dogma is dead. We are beginning to de-couple emissions from economic growth. Massive economies such as China and India are on track to surpass their Paris pledges. Carbon markets are growing and merging. The Green Bond market is expanding. It is crucial for all countries to follow through on their Paris commitments. The agreement itself calls for raising ambition -- and so I urge you to use the 2020 revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions to close the 2030 emissions gap. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mitigation is essential, but climate change is already upon us, and will only worsen in the short-term. It is essential that we adapt and that we strengthen resilience. The Green Climate Fund can play a catalytic role on this, and I appeal to its members, especially donor nations, to bring this mechanism fully to life. I have also asked the UN system to promote adaptation and resilience efforts at the country level. I commend the 2015 pledge by G7 nations to provide insurance against extreme weather events for 400 million more vulnerable people by 2020. And I welcome the announcement here in Bonn, led by the Government of Germany, to fast forward this ambition. The insurance industry itself has long sounded the alarm about climate change. The industry is keen to promote coverage for people at risk -- and it is pressing business and governments alike to figure climate shocks into their planning, policies and operations. I will do everything to facilitate these efforts. Third, finance. Greater ambition on emissions, adaptation and resilience is inextricably linked to funding. We need to mobilize the agreed 100-billion-dollars annually for developing countries. Upholding this promise is essential for building confidence and trust. It is crucial for enabling all countries, but especially the most vulnerable, to face inevitable climate impacts and to grow their economies cleanly. In addition, markets can and must play a central role in financing a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. Yet markets need to be re-oriented away from the counter-productive and the short-term. We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future that will place savings and societies at risk. Infrastructure investment will be crucial. The world should adopt a simple rule: if big infrastructure projects are not green, they should not be given the green light. Otherwise we will be locked into bad choices for decades to come. Investing in climate-friendly development is where the smart money is headed. I welcome the initiative of President Macron to convene the "One Planet summit" next month to focus on financing. I will be working to scale up international financing in renewable and energy efficiency projects to reduce at least 1 gigaton or more of carbon emissions by 2020. The formation of a clean energy investment coalition, as proposed by Denmark, is an idea worth pursuing. We should also work with greater determination towards carbon pricing. This is a key instrument for driving down greenhouse gas emissions. More than half of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement cite the need for carbon pricing. Last year, carbon pricing initiatives generated 22 billion dollars. Growing carbon markets in Europe and North America, and China's expected announcement of one of the world's largest emissions trading systems, are a good sign. But to meet the Paris goals we need at least 50 per cent global coverage and a higher price on carbon to drive large-scale climate action. I urge G20 countries to set a strong example. The fourth ambition action [area] is partnerships. Partnership with the private sector, local and regional governments and civil society -- will make or break efforts to implement the Paris Agreement. In particular, the only way to keep below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees is to mobilize the private sector to move on an energy transformation. With government incentives, such as clean energy and transport policies, business can move the markets to promote the green economy we need. We need to engage global technology giants, the oil and gas sector and the automotive industry so their business plans are consistent with the Paris goals. And we need to engage the agricultural and forestry sectors to ensure climate friendly land use. But we must engage all actors -- national, regional and local governments, philanthropists and investors and consumers -- in the transformation to a low-emission economy. Cities and civil society can and must play a crucial role in bringing about this fundamental shift. Next year, the Governor of California and my special envoy Michael Bloomberg, together with Anand Mahindra, will bring together cities, states, businesses and citizens' groups to encourage further commitments from these vital actors. One can see action everywhere, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider landscape of actors and institutions. Let us build on this momentum. Ladies and Gentlemen, Solutions to climate change will enable us to meet many of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I encourage you to be bold in your deliberations and decisions here in Bonn and at home. By embracing low-carbon climate-resilient policy making, you can set the world on the right path. And where you lead, business and civil society will follow. In September 2019, I will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels. More immediately -- in this 20th anniversary year of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Climate Change Convention -- I call on all relevant nations that have not done it so to ratify the Doha Amendment. I also call on world leaders to ratify and implement the Kigali Amendment to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer.. I can think of no greater way to show your people that you care for the well-being of your citizens than to claim the mantle of climate leadership. Show courage in combatting entrenched interests. Show compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children. As a former politician myself, I have no doubt that in today's world, this is the path to progress today and a meaningful legacy for tomorrow. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Ultimately, there is only one ambition that matters to build a secure world of peace, prosperity, dignity and opportunity for all people on a healthy planet: sustainable and inclusive development. The world counts on your wisdom and foresight. \</doc>

The addition of Syria, whose strongman President Bashar Assad became de facto winner of the ongoing civil war in July as Trump ended U.S. support for rebel groups, makes his country look somewhat more stable, and offers a poetic recognition of a cause of the conflict. Beginning in 2006, Syria suffered its worst droughts in roughly 900 years[11], forcing as many as 1.5 million Syrians to move from the countryside to cities. The migration sowed some of the civil strife that boiled over into the pro-democracy protests that started the war. Some have called the conflict a 'climate war[12].'Meanwhile, in the U.S., Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt last month proposed eliminating[13] the Clean Power Plan, the only federal regulations aimed at reducing the country's carbon footprint and bringing it in line with goals set in the Paris agreement. Pruitt also has vowed to host a red team-blue team[14] debate on climate science, essentially giving the tiny minority of researchers who doubt overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is man-made equal standing with scientists who accept the peer-reviewed conclusion.\~Burning fossil fuels, industrial farming and deforestation are rapidly increasing the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm, according to 97 percent of peer-reviewed climate research. A research review[15] published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.Yet the U.S. delegation at this year's COP 23 conference in Germany plans to advocate increased use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, and natural gas  a major source of methane, which traps about 30 times[16] more heat than carbon dioxide.'This discussion is a follow-up to the Administration's success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies,' a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said in a statement to The New York Times[17] last week. 'It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean.

Dec 31, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com We witnessed groundbreaking policy changes and shocking political backward steps. People took on seemingly insurmountable issues - and won - and the corporate world took leaps forward to support sustainable development. The 240km/hour winds of Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico,\~devastating the island, and leaving hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands stranded. It was the height of a hyperactive hurricane season, in which 16 named hurricanes - six of them major - impacted people around the world. The effects of climate change have never been more visible, and organizations like GRI have been working to mitigate climate change by changing the way companies behave. In June, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures released recommendations[2] suggesting how companies could account for their climate-associated risks, helping connect the pressing global issue with the bottom line. GRI organized a workshop at the Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative event run alongside COP23 in November to help stock exchanges follow the recommendations. The main COP23 event, held in Bonn, Germany from 6 to 17 November, faced political challenges before it started: it was the first negotiation since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement[3]. World leaders came together to make progress on the 2015 agreement, but some were already calling for the US delegation to be banned from talks. Despite the setback, COP23 made clear progress. The Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) coalition, including the EU, China and Canada, is a concrete example of how developed and developing countries are working together to fight climate change. And more than 20 countries joined the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance'[4], which was launched at COP23 , to restrict the use of coal. Reporting plays an important role in communicating the progress of companies and countries fighting climate change, and with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards[5], they can report on this and other emerging issues.

Ottawa is taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 million tons per year by 2030, and the oil and gas industry is expected to play a major role in achieving this target. Industry will be required to reduce\~its carbon footprint\~using\~a variety of methods that will apply to all types of fuel -- liquid, solid or gas -- and not just ones used for transportation. The\~yet-to-be-released clean fuels strategy will represent one of the main planks of Ottawa's climate change strategy released a year ago ( OD Dec.15'16 ). The plan will get Canada about one-sixth of the way to meeting its international commitment to\~slash carbon emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The plan helps meet the pledge made by Canada two years ago at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris.\~ The plan will not just apply to direct fuel sales but will instead focus on energy used in transportation, construction and industrial purposes -- meaning the oil and gas industry can reduce carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of their energy supply chains, step up the use of ethanol and natural gas, and increase the number of electric vehicle charging stations. Environment and Climate Change Canada says the plan will be "technology neutral" and will allow industry to reduce emissions along the full life-cycle of an energy product from the wellhead to final use -- including vehicle fuels, diesel, jet fuel, and natural gas for heating and electricity. Coal will be exempt since it will be addressed by other regulations aimed at phasing out coal as a source of electricity. Ottawa says it will introduce draft regulations within the next year and follow up with final regulations in mid-2019. "Without the standard, it would be difficult for Canada to meet its Paris climate commitment -- and Canadian fuels would remain more polluting than necessary," Environment Canada said. Industry has concerns that Canada is increasing the financial burden on oil and gas companies at a time when the US is cutting taxes and reducing regulatory burdens on industry under the watch of US President Donald Trump ( OD Nov.14'17 ).

The Global Environment Facility issued the following news release: Today, the Government of Sweden announced it would provide additional funds of SEK 185 million each to the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the GEF Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). Also, Belgium has decided to make available an additional grant of 7 million EUR to the LDCF, while the Wallonia region of southern Belgium announced 3.25 million EUR to the fund. On the opening day of COP23 , the German government announced EUR 100 million to support developing countries in climate change adaptation, including 50 million each to the LDCF and AF. Italy and Ireland also announced financial contributions to the Adaptation Fund. Welcoming the new financial support for the most vulnerable countries announced here at the UN Climate Conference in Bonn ( COP23 ), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii, said "It's the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities that suffer the most. I want to thank the governments of Germany, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and the region of Wallonia, for their support and commitment to help those most impacted build resilience." Least developed countries (LDCs) are the most vulnerable to climate change, yet the least able to adapt. In many cases, they lack the technical, financial and institutional capacity to identify the best ways to build resilience. That's why the UNFCCC decided to establish the LDCF in 2001. To date, the LDCF has supported more than 250 projects in 51 countries. Naoko Ishii was speaking at the 10th anniversary of the Adaptation Fund being celebrated in Bonn today. Since it was established, the Adaptation Fund has grown to commit USD 462 million to 70 concrete, localized projects that help the most vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change, while serving nearly 5.5 million direct beneficiaries around the world. During COP23 On Monday, the GEF announced USD 1 million in support of a first of its kind climate resilience investment fund. The fund will boost adaptation efforts in some of the world's most vulnerable countries. And, for the first time, private investors will have the opportunity to get their return by investing in a fund that exclusively focuses on resilience-related companies The fund, an initiative developed by US-based investment firm Lightsmith Group, is receiving support from the GEF Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) project called the Climate Resilience and Adaptation Finance and Technology Transfer Facility (CRAFT). Other partners include the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) and Conservation International (CI). For more information on GEF support to adaptation, please see the new publication prepared for COP23 This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 16, 2017.

Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology has issued the following news release: At this year\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 Delivered at various side events, their messages to delegates and other climate stakeholders from around the world converged on several key elements that could enhance chances of successful climate policy implementation, including: empowering people and governments by facilitating access to open-source tools and strategies; integrating fairness and transparency into negotiations; and cultivating a deep understanding of the needs and priorities of the other side, to achieve mutual gains that benefit the climate, environment, and each side\' s economy. Negotiating for mutual gains Michael Mehling, deputy director of MIT\' s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, discussed cross-border climate collaboration for mutual gains at a side event on the role of trade policy in aiding implementation of the Paris Agreement, held by Climate Strategies, a network of researchers, and the German Development Institute. Drawing on his own research, which includes work with Climate Strategies, Mehling pointed out the  growing heterogeneity of climate action, ambition, and differences across countries  the widening gap between the most and least ambitious countries in terms of commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as cause for concern. Mehling and his colleagues have found that border carbon adjustments  measures applied to imports and/or exports  can be effective in evening out climate efforts, but can also be  enormously controversial. Citing a policy report he co-authored, Mehling outlined steps to design a border carbon adjustment policy to ensure fairness and transparency, such as applying any revenues generated toward furthering the country\' s environmental objectives and benefiting developing countries affected by the measure.  To facilitate continued growth of ambition and domestic climate policies in those countries or those jurisdictions that do want to move faster, this may become a useful tool to allow them to do so without domestic political backlash, he said. Negotiation strategies that foster mutual gains are also at the heart of Bruno Verdini\' s research. At side events in Bonn, he shared the importance of implementing steps that facilitate collaboration between stakeholders with different values and priorities to proactively deal with climate risks. Verdini, a lecturer in urban planning and negotiation and the executive director of the MIT-Harvard Mexico Negotiation Program, contrasted moves that are common in disputes in the public arena but are frequently detrimental to implementable outcomes, such as making threats or extreme demands, with techniques that empower both sides to address core concerns and cooperate effectively. He said,  As a negotiator, you owe your organization and the people you represent a significant amount of preparation to test your assumptions, identify blind spots, and account for multiple scenarios. Verdini continued,  You want to foster a dynamic of reciprocity, so that when stakeholders sit at the table, you show that you\' ve done the work to put yourself in their shoes and develop persuasive opportunities that allocate benefits instead of solely costs  and in turn claim your fair share. He has expanded on these ideas in a new book, "Winning Together: The Natural Resource Negotiation Playbook" (MIT Press, 2017). Verdini gave a recent example of joint resource management between the U.S. and Mexico that has yielded positive results. During the current drought affecting much of the Colorado River Basin, the metropolitan water agencies in Nevada, Arizona, and California realized that many of the canals across the Mexican border were not lined with concrete, which meant a significant portion of the water annually delivered to Mexico was being lost to seepage. By financing infrastructure improvements on the Mexican side, the U.S. could, in effect,  create new water, and Mexico could trade a portion of this  excess water back to the U.S. at a less expensive rate than it would cost the U.S. to buy water rights north of the border.  At MIT, we focus on empowering our undergraduates to thrive in any industry through a mutual gains approach to negotiation, Verdini said. In his popular negotiation class, students hone their leadership skills through weekly role-play simulations, several of which center on energy, water, and environmental management. John Sterman, a professor of management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has also long recognized the power of role-play in experiencing another\' s perspective on climate issues. Speaking at a side event, he shared research on the effectiveness of the World Climate role-play, developed with colleagues at the not-for-profit organization Climate Interactive.  Research shows that showing people research doesn\' t work, Sterman said. Instead, World Climate participants experience the challenges faced by developing and developed nations firsthand. Taking on the roles of nations different from their own, they negotiate solutions where all parties commit to keeping global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius by contributing their fair share to greenhouse gas reductions, using a climate modeling tool to test the impacts of their decisions. Preliminary findings indicate that World Climate  which has reached more than 35,000 participants in 75 countries  is more impactful than traditional lectures, and is effective with liberal and conservative participants alike. Sterman noted that the simulation  produces large gains not only in knowledge of climate change, but also in people\' s sense of urgency and the belief that they can make a difference. It\' s the emotional impact of the experience that drives their desire to learn more and their intent to act in the real world. During COP23 Empowering climate action, fostering collaboration At an event organized by a group of U.S. business, nonprofit, and philanthropic leaders, Jessika Trancik, an associate professor in energy systems at MIT\' s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), discussed how research can be used to empower individuals to make economically and environmentally beneficial choices. She gave an example of research her team has conducted that compares popular personal vehicles in terms of their carbon emissions, which the team has released in an app for the public called  Carboncounter.  What you see is that you don\' t actually have to pay more for a low-carbon-emitting vehicle today. You can save money and save emissions by going for an electric car, for example, she said, adding that public policies can spur a  virtuous cycle of technological improvements that in turn lead to cost reductions and increased performance, which in this case could extend vehicle range and meet climate targets. Trancik spoke about the roles researchers can play in continuing to move the U.S. toward emissions reductions and informed climate policy  helping to ensure that in an era of limited federal funding, time and money are invested wisely in policies that research has shown to be effective.  We need to spend time together as researchers, as policymakers, as people in the private sector, in order to identify important questions and make sure that this research is useful to policymakers and also that it reaches them, she said. Magdalena Klemun, a fourth-year PhD student, and postdoc Morgan Edwards SM \' 13, PhD \' 17  both of IDSS  joined Trancik at COP23 . They interviewed policymakers and academics to explore how subnational actors can impact global climate action and help continue progress in clean energy innovation.  We\' re specifically interested in how universities can support this process through academic research and on-campus demonstration projects, said Klemun. Likewise, MIT Climate CoLab researchers work to bring together citizens and governments to develop and evaluate effective climate action solutions,  harnessing the collective intelligence of thousands of people all over the world at a scale and with a degree of collaboration that was never possible before, said Thomas Malone, director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence (CCI), at a side event on how subnational actors in Latin America and the Caribbean could advance climate goals. Malone, who is also a professor of management at MIT Sloan, described a crowd-sourcing initiative under development, the Climate Plan Accelerator:  an online network that can help governments at all levels and other organizations develop detailed, expert-validated plans for how to achieve or exceed their climate action goals. Malone was joined in Bonn by CCI colleagues Laur Hesse Fisher, the Climate CoLab project manager, and Kathleen Kennedy, director of special initiatives. Another side event convened more than 100 developers from around the world for a hackathon to develop blockchain-based climate solutions.  We are working on how blockchain technologies can play an enabling role to resolve the trust problem  one of the core fundamental barriers to how we confront the climate change challenges that the world is facing, said Michael Casey, a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan and senior advisor for the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. Casey, one of the organizers of the Hack for Climate side event, explained how these technologies could aid climate mitigation, adaptation, and finance efforts by allowing storage and sharing of information and data through a secure, trusted mechanism. Two MIT students, Stephen Lee and Erick Pinos, participated in the hackathon.  I\' m here as part of my undergraduate research into how we can use blockchain to make decentralized community solar microgrids in a localized community of the Caribbean islands, said Pinos, who is studying management and computer science and is president of the MIT Bitcoin Club. Lee, a master\' s student in the Technology and Policy Program and in electrical engineering and computer science, is researching energy access planning in the developing world through the Tata Center for Technology and Design\' s Universal Access Lab.  We\' re looking at how blockchain technologies can finance some of these energy projects, he said. John Fern\'e1ndez, a professor of building technology and director of the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, was also in Bonn to explore opportunities for collaboration  especially around nature-based solutions, a major focus of the initiative.  I spent time discussing strategies with a number of organizations focused on protecting and enhancing natural systems and their capacity for mitigating emissions and helping with the consequences of sea level rise, extreme weather, heat waves, and other coming challenges, he said. Other MIT delegation members in Bonn included Tom Kiley, who advises Vice President for Research Maria Zuber on the Institute\' s climate action efforts; Horacio Caperan, who heads external affairs for the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; and Cambridge-MIT Exchange Program alumnus Jonas Knapp.  As countries continue the complicated work of implementing the Paris Agreement, and as cities, regions, businesses, and universities step up their efforts to support the agreement\' s goals, it was heartening to see such an impressive delegation from MIT in Bonn, Kiley said.  By learning from other delegates, and by contributing new tools, ideas, and research insights to the conversations, MIT\' s delegation demonstrated what we mean when we say that we want to take what we\' re learning here and apply it to help make a better world.

Nov 15, 2017( Tablet Magazine: HYPERLINK http://tabletmag.com http://tabletmag.com United Nations Climate Change Conference [1], attendants will hear presentations on everything from global warming to carbon credits. They will also talk about the ways in which mosquitos spread disease, and how recent years have brought about major epidemics spread by the winged pests surreptitiously traveling from one country to another. Like that one Israeli mosquito that, experts now say, may be responsible for bringing West Nile fever to New York. The culprit, said professor Jurgen May of the Bernahrd Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, probably hopped a flight from Tel Aviv to the Big Apple sometime in 1999. 'One can say with a fair degree of certainty that the virus arrived with an infected mosquito aboard a plane from Tel Aviv,' May said[2], adding that scientists have reached this conclusion by analyzing the virus and discovering strong relations to a virus discovered a year earlier in a goose living on an Israeli farm. 'There was a mild winter,' May explained. 'That enabled the infectious mosquitos to survive until the spring. There was a warm and dry early summer, which was good for the mosquitos. They stung migratory birds, which then carried the virus further afield. The late summer was wet and lots of new breeding grounds emerged.' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[3], more than 44,000 cases of the virus have been reported in the 18 years since. That, May added, happened in part because local American mosquitos helped spread the virus rapidly. 'These were mosquitos that sting both humans and birds. And that enabled the virus to spread very far in a short timeframe.'

One year ago, the European Union ratified the Paris Agreement and pledged to reduce its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% relative to 1990. Emissions have already dropped by 23% in 2016 -- on track to meet the 2030 target. Germany, the EU's largest economy, has reduced emissions by 28% and is contributing significantly and above par to the EU's common goal. In 2016, the share of renewables in all electricity produced in Germany reached a new all-time high of almost 32% (vs. 15% in the United States). Solar, wind and biomass have allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint by 160million tons of carbon dioxide, or roughly the annual emissions of the U.S. state of Georgia. Even so, recent estimates also show that German emissions have gone up slightly, by 0.4% last year. What happened and what does this mean? Apart from the wind and sun, Germany's primary domestic source of energy has been coal. In the integrated European electricity market, our coal-fired power plants do not just fill the gap on cloudy days but also export record amounts of excess electricity to our neighbors. But Germany's major political forces agree on a phaseout in the medium term: By law, the first five plants will go offline by 2019. Just as coal was essential for Germany's industrialization in the 19th century, renewables are powering our businesses and jobs in the 21st. For Germany's manufacturers, the digital and the energy transformation are two sides of the same coin: Eventually, coal will go the way of the typewriter. Chancellor Angela Merkel called climate change the "key challenge for humanity" when speaking to delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn last week. An overwhelming majority of Germans agree and support an ambitious energy transition to keep our manufacturing base competitive. The message to the world is clear: Together with our partners, we are not shying away from challenges but working to solve them in the framework of the Paris Agreement. Peter Wittig is Germany's ambassador to the United States. \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Parliament: Political groups discussed the way forward on climate cooperation with the Governor of California, who earlier also met with Environment and EU-US delegation MEPs, on Wednesday. "It is of great importance to have this debate today with the leader of a US state, California, which we consider to be a very important regional state in the US and a key player in US politics", said European Parliament President Antonio Tajani (EPP, IT) opening the debate with the Governor of California Edmund G. Brown. "The risk of rising temperature in irreversible ways, with great destruction exacerbating inequality, poverty and migration, is going to happen soon. I am here going to COP23 to join other states and provinces throughout the world to push a climate action agenda and to get the job done", said Mr Brown. Video summary of this debate Meeting with the Environment Committee and EU-US delegation "Although the US decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement, an impressive number of US states and cities decided to uphold their share in the fight against climate change" said Environment Committee Chair Adina Ioana V\'c4lean (EPP, RO), who will lead a delegation of MEPs to Bonn to attend the COP23 climate conference from Tuesday. "We are all aware that state-level action alone is not enough. We need to bring together governments on all levels, businesses, academia and civil society in a joint and coordinated effort to meet the ambition we set out in Paris two years ago", she said. EU-US Delegation Chair Christian Ehler (EPP, DE) said: "The UN Climate Change Conference started yesterday with strong, unified calls to hold to the path of the Paris Climate Change Agreement". "This takes place against the backdrop of this year's destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice and impacts on agriculture, which threaten food security". "For us, it has become more and more important to engage with US States and their top political representatives, given the particular make-up of the US political system, alongside our regular contacts from Congress and the administration", he added. Governor Brown said: "The nature of the threat from climate change is existential, and the level of commitment is not up to the threat". "Decarbonizing requires a transformation of our whole civilization, fossil fuels are the basis on which we function today. We are fossil fuel people, carbon people!". "Even the 2C goal may not be enough" he added. Quick Facts Governor Edmund G. Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of this year's COP23 COP23 at a ceremony where Fiji became the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition. The coalition includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents, collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP- equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and over 39 percent of the global economy. Governor Brown created the US Climate Alliance, together with Gov. Jay Inslee (Washington) and Andrew Cuomo (New York), in response to the U.S. federal government's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. It currently numbers 15 states, comprising 36% of the US population and USD 7 trillion in GDP. \</doc>

The Forest Products Association of Canada issued the following news release: The Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC) fully supports the Forest Bioeconomy Framework launched today by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM). "The Forest Bioeconomy Framework builds on our sector's world-leading sustainability practices and our focus on finding environmental and economic value for every part of the tree. It will help position Canada's forest sector as a solutions provider in our move to a lower-carbon economy," said FPAC CEO Derek Nighbor. "This framework is a significant move forward to position forestry as a key player in the bioeconomy, will support the creation of new jobs and help us meet Canada's climate change commitments," Nighbor added. The Forest Bioeconomy Framework establishes a path that will result in a forest bioeconomy that identifies sustainable bio-based materials from healthy forests available for high added-value manufacturing. The framework highlights innovation, collaboration, and investment and opens the door to further enhancing the sustainability of the forest sector through research, innovation and strong public policy. "Canada is steward to 10 per cent of the world's forests and Canada's forest products sector manages the most third-party certified and audited forests on the planet," said Nighbor. "By continuing to embrace world-leading environmental standards and strengthening our focus on a growingbio-economy, we have a real opportunity to support jobs - especially in rural and northern communities - and maintain a competitive advantage in the global marketplace through responsible resource management," he added. Canada's forest sector provides 230,000 direct and nearly 700,000 indirect jobs across the country and is also a leader in the fight against climate change. The forest sector was the first major Canadian industry to launch a comprehensive plan to reduce carbon through its 30 X 30 Climate Change Challenge which alone can help the federal government achieve 13 per cent of its carbon reduction goal by 2030 as committed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris.

Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Washington, issued the following news release: Last June, Gov. Jay Inslee was sitting with nearly 100 other guests in the dining room of California Gov. Jerry Brown's home at a lunch event to celebrate Fiji becoming the newest signatory to the Under2 MOU, an international coalition of national and subnational governments committed to ambitious climate action. The lunch had particular significance in the wake of recent events. President Donald Trump had just announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. In response, Brown and Inslee, as well as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, had launched the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance with more than a dozen states committing to achieving their share of the U.S. greenhouse gas reduction target. So while what happened at that lunch was unprecedented, it wasn't necessarily surprising. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama is also the president of COP23 , the 23rd annual convening of nations to talk about next steps in global climate action. Right after signing the Under2 MOU, Bainimarama invited Inslee, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, and Jerry Brown to attend COP23 in Bonn, Germany, and deliver a message to the world that the U.S. was still in for the fight against climate change. All three West Coast governors agreed. They would help a wide collection of U.S. voices stand in as the collective, representative voice of U.S. action on climate. With every nation in the world -- save the U.S. -- formally committed to the Paris agreement, COP23 drew an estimated 25,000 participants representing nations, subnational governments, businesses, schools, universities, NGOs and faith communities.

The following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): At this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), delegates from around the world worked on strategies to accelerate progress toward the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement with or without the continued official involvement of the United States. As negotiators worked to find common ground, MIT researchers from different technology and social science backgrounds shared their ideas for climate action. Delivered at various side events, their messages to delegates and other climate stakeholders from around the world converged on several key elements that could enhance chances of successful climate policy implementation, including: empowering people and governments by facilitating access to open-source tools and strategies; integrating fairness and transparency into negotiations; and cultivating a deep understanding of the needs and priorities of the other side, to achieve mutual gains that benefit the climate, environment, and each side's economy. Negotiating for mutual gains Michael Mehling, deputy director of MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, discussed cross-border climate collaboration for mutual gains at a side event on the role of trade policy in aiding implementation of the Paris Agreement, held by Climate Strategies, a network of researchers, and the German Development Institute. Drawing on his own research, which includes work with Climate Strategies, Mehling pointed out the "growing heterogeneity of climate action, ambition, and differences across countries" the widening gap between the most and least ambitious countries in terms of commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as cause for concern. Mehling and his colleagues have found that border carbon adjustments measures applied to imports and/or exports can be effective in evening out climate efforts, but can also be "enormously controversial." Citing a policy report he co-authored, Mehling outlined steps to design a border carbon adjustment policy to ensure fairness and transparency, such as applying any revenues generated toward furthering the country's environmental objectives and benefiting developing countries affected by the measure. "To facilitate continued growth of ambition and domestic climate policies in those countries or those jurisdictions that do want to move faster, this may become a useful tool to allow them to do so without domestic political backlash," he said. Negotiation strategies that foster mutual gains are also at the heart of Bruno Verdini's research. At side events in Bonn, he shared the importance of implementing steps that facilitate collaboration between stakeholders with different values and priorities to proactively deal with climate risks. Verdini, a lecturer in urban planning and negotiation and the executive director of the MIT-Harvard Mexico Negotiation Program, contrasted moves that are common in disputes in the public arena but are frequently detrimental to implementable outcomes, such as making threats or extreme demands, with techniques that empower both sides to address core concerns and cooperate effectively. He said, "As a negotiator, you owe your organization and the people you represent a significant amount of preparation to test your assumptions, identify blind spots, and account for multiple scenarios." Verdini continued, "You want to foster a dynamic of reciprocity, so that when stakeholders sit at the table, you show that you've done the work to put yourself in their shoes and develop persuasive opportunities that allocate benefits instead of solely costs and in turn claim your fair share." He has expanded on these ideas in a new book, "Winning Together: The Natural Resource Negotiation Playbook" (MIT Press, 2017). Verdini gave a recent example of joint resource management between the U.S. and Mexico that has yielded positive results. During the current drought affecting much of the Colorado River Basin, the metropolitan water agencies in Nevada, Arizona, and California realized that many of the canals across the Mexican border were not lined with concrete, which meant a significant portion of the water annually delivered to Mexico was being lost to seepage. By financing infrastructure improvements on the Mexican side, the U.S. could, in effect, "create new water," and Mexico could trade a portion of this "excess" water back to the U.S. at a less expensive rate than it would cost the U.S. to buy water rights north of the border. "At MIT, we focus on empowering our undergraduates to thrive in any industry through a mutual gains approach to negotiation," Verdini said. In his popular negotiation class, students hone their leadership skills through weekly role-play simulations, several of which center on energy, water, and environmental management. John Sterman, a professor of management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has also long recognized the power of role-play in experiencing another's perspective on climate issues. Speaking at a side event, he shared research on the effectiveness of the World Climate role-play, developed with colleagues at the not-for-profit organization Climate Interactive. "Research shows that showing people research doesn't work," Sterman said. Instead, World Climate participants experience the challenges faced by developing and developed nations firsthand. Taking on the roles of nations different from their own, they negotiate solutions where all parties commit to keeping global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius by contributing their fair share to greenhouse gas reductions, using a climate modeling tool to test the impacts of their decisions. Preliminary findings indicate that World Climate which has reached more than 35,000 participants in 75 countries is more impactful than traditional lectures, and is effective with liberal and conservative participants alike. Sterman noted that the simulation "produces large gains not only in knowledge of climate change, but also in people's sense of urgency and the belief that they can make a difference. It's the emotional impact of the experience that drives their desire to learn more and their intent to act in the real world." During COP23 Empowering climate action, fostering collaboration At an event organized by a group of U.S. business, nonprofit, and philanthropic leaders, Jessika Trancik, an associate professor in energy systems at MIT's Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), discussed how research can be used to empower individuals to make economically and environmentally beneficial choices. She gave an example of research her team has conducted that compares popular personal vehicles in terms of their carbon emissions, which the team has released in an app for the public called "Carboncounter." "What you see is that you don't actually have to pay more for a low-carbon-emitting vehicle today. You can save money and save emissions by going for an electric car, for example," she said, adding that public policies can spur a "virtuous cycle" of technological improvements that in turn lead to cost reductions and increased performance, which in this case could extend vehicle range and meet climate targets. Trancik spoke about the roles researchers can play in continuing to move the U.S. toward emissions reductions and informed climate policy helping to ensure that in an era of limited federal funding, time and money are invested wisely in policies that research has shown to be effective. "We need to spend time together as researchers, as policymakers, as people in the private sector, in order to identify important questions and make sure that this research is useful to policymakers and also that it reaches them," she said. Magdalena Klemun, a fourth-year PhD student, and postdoc Morgan Edwards SM '13, PhD '17 both of IDSS joined Trancik at COP23 . They interviewed policymakers and academics to explore how subnational actors can impact global climate action and help continue progress in clean energy innovation. "We're specifically interested in how universities can support this process through academic research and on-campus demonstration projects," said Klemun. Likewise, MIT Climate CoLab researchers work to bring together citizens and governments to develop and evaluate effective climate action solutions, "harnessing the collective intelligence of thousands of people all over the world at a scale and with a degree of collaboration that was never possible before," said Thomas Malone, director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence (CCI), at a side event on how subnational actors in Latin America and the Caribbean could advance climate goals. Malone, who is also a professor of management at MIT Sloan, described a crowd-sourcing initiative under development, the Climate Plan Accelerator: "an online network that can help governments at all levels and other organizations develop detailed, expert-validated plans for how to achieve or exceed their climate action goals." Malone was joined in Bonn by CCI colleagues Laur Hesse Fisher, the Climate CoLab project manager, and Kathleen Kennedy, director of special initiatives. Another side event convened more than 100 developers from around the world for a hackathon to develop blockchain-based climate solutions. "We are working on how blockchain technologies can play an enabling role to resolve the trust problem one of the core fundamental barriers to how we confront the climate change challenges that the world is facing," said Michael Casey, a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan and senior advisor for the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. Casey, one of the organizers of the Hack for Climate side event, explained how these technologies could aid climate mitigation, adaptation, and finance efforts by allowing storage and sharing of information and data through a secure, trusted mechanism. Two MIT students, Stephen Lee and Erick Pinos, participated in the hackathon. "I'm here as part of my undergraduate research into how we can use blockchain to make decentralized community solar microgrids in a localized community of the Caribbean islands," said Pinos, who is studying management and computer science and is president of the MIT Bitcoin Club. Lee, a master's student in the Technology and Policy Program and in electrical engineering and computer science, is researching energy access planning in the developing world through the Tata Center for Technology and Design's Universal Access Lab. "We're looking at how blockchain technologies can finance some of these energy projects," he said. John Fernandez, a professor of building technology and director of the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, was also in Bonn to explore opportunities for collaboration especially around nature-based solutions, a major focus of the initiative. "I spent time discussing strategies with a number of organizations focused on protecting and enhancing natural systems and their capacity for mitigating emissions and helping with the consequences of sea level rise, extreme weather, heat waves, and other coming challenges," he said. Other MIT delegation members in Bonn included Tom Kiley, who advises Vice President for Research Maria Zuber on the Institute's climate action efforts; Horacio Caperan, who heads external affairs for the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; and Cambridge-MIT Exchange Program alumnus Jonas Knapp. "As countries continue the complicated work of implementing the Paris Agreement, and as cities, regions, businesses, and universities step up their efforts to support the agreement's goals, it was heartening to see such an impressive delegation from MIT in Bonn," Kiley said. "By learning from other delegates, and by contributing new tools, ideas, and research insights to the conversations, MIT's delegation demonstrated what we mean when we say that we want to take what we're learning here and apply it to help make a better world." \</doc>

Washington: National League of Cities has issued the following news release: America\' s city leaders issued a strong condemnation of President Donald J. Trump\' s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The agreement, which was supported by the National League of Cities (NLC) and is signed by nearly 200 nations, was created to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat rising global temperatures. NLC led the largest delegation of city leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where the climate agreement was adopted. Following today\' s announcement, NLC President Matt Zone, councilmember, Cleveland, released the following statement:  President Trump\' s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement is a flagrant disregard for the safety and prosperity of American cities who are already dealing with the devastating effects of climate change.  With or without federal support, local action is being taken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and create a more sustainable future. More than 130 U.S. cities have signed on to the Compact of Mayors, committing to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change and publicly track their progress.  City leaders are on the front lines of the fight against climate change, and are taking actions to reduce greenhouse emissions and prepare our communities for the future. Norfolk, Virginia, is building resilient infrastructure to combat rising sea levels. New York has a public health plan to help residents cope with extreme heat. And cities like Riverbank, California, are adopting smart water meters to help residents conserve water and protect against the effects of drought.  We need the federal government to partner with cities to help us preserve clean air, clean water and clean land. However, the president\' s decision undermines these goals and imperils the health of our citizens and our environment. Cities will continue to advocate for ambitious policies that address this global crisis, and will lead by example at the local level.

The World Bank issued the following news release: Fiji has become the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond, raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or US$50 million, to support climate change mitigation and adaption. Home to over 870,000 people, Fiji's 300 volcanic islands include low-lying atolls that are highly susceptible to cyclones and floods. In 2016, Tropical Cyclone Winston--the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on record--passed directly over Fiji, causing economic losses that amounted to almost one third of the country's GDP. Like all Pacific island states, Fiji is also highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change: close to 20 percent of the region's 10 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments that are used to raise funds dedicated to climate-mitigation, adaptation, and other environment-friendly projects. This provides investors an attractive investment proposition as well as an opportunity to support environmentally sound projects. At the request of Fiji's Reserve Bank, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group focusing on private sector, provided technical assistance to assist the government in issuing a sovereign green bond. This collaboration took place under a broader, three-year Capital Markets Development Project supported by the Australian Government. Through this partnership, Australia and IFC are helping stimulate private sector investment, promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the Pacific. Projects financed from the Fiji green bond will follow the internationally developed Green Bond Principles, and will focus primarily on investments that build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Sustainalytics US (Sustainalytics), a provider of environmental, social and governance research and analysis, evaluated Fiji Sovereign's green bond transaction and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles. Fiji will also use bond proceeds for projects supporting its commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy and reduce its CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 30% by 2030. Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 Frank Bainimarama said: "The Fijian people, along with every Pacific Islander, live on the front lines of climate change. The rising seas, changing weather patterns and severe weather events are threatening our development, our security and the Fijian way of life, along with the very existence of some of our low-lying neighbors. I have made access to climate finance a key pillar of our upcoming COP23 Presidency, and we are proud to set an example to other climate-vulnerable nations by issuing this green bond to fund our work to boost climate resilience across Fiji. By issuing the first emerging country green bond , we are also sending a clear signal to other nations that we can be creative and innovative in mobilizing funds and create win-win outcomes for countries and investors in adapting to the serious effects of climate change." "With this bond, Fiji has demonstrated that green capital markets can be created in emerging economies, and that all countries, big and small, have an important role to play in facilitating climate solutions," World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. "As it takes the helm of COP23 , Fiji is uniquely positioned to inspire other countries to meet their respective targets and build resilience against climate change." The World Bank and IFC are among the pioneers of the green bond market. The World Bank issued the first green bond in 2008. Since then, both institutions have provided leadership by issuing green bonds across a range of currencies, tenors and volumes; helping to define best practice for reporting and standards; and working with countries to facilitate the development of domestic green bond markets. The global green bond market is expected to reach US$134.9 billion in 2017. The Government of Fiji will chair the 23rd Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany from November 6-17, 2017. Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has given high priority to COP23 and aims to continue the momentum for action since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement last year.

The World Wind Energy Association issued the following news release: The World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) has today announced a key strategic partnership with the International Windship Association (IWSA) in order to further promote the uptake of wind technology by the global shipping fleet. WWEA is a not-for-profit organisation with over 600-member organisations across 100 countries. The Association promotes the deployment of wind energy technology around the world, and, as founding member of the REN Alliance and the Global100 percentRE Platform, is working towards full substitution of all polluting and hazardous waste causing energies. IWSA, also a not-for-profit organisation, unites over 30 commercial wind propulsion technology providers and projects supported by numerous universities, research and testing organisations and other associates. Formed in 2014 by an active core of members, the Association has grown quickly in both membership and impact. As part of the joint force for wind energy technology promotion the associations will facilitate an exchange of non-executive board members. The WWEA will contribute decades of experience in driving industry transition and taking advantage of the power of wind energy technology in an effort to urgently trying to plot the commercial course towards full decarbonisation. The IWSA, in parallel, will continue to bring together all parties in the development of a wind-ship sector to shape industry and government attitudes and policies. The Associations' first collaborative steps will be taken during the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) summit in Bonn, Germany next month. Secretary General of IWSA, Gavin Allwright will sit on the opening panel at the Global Renewable Energy Solutions Showcase GRESS, 7 November at the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle of the Federal Republic of Germany (KAH) in Bonn, Germany. Also during UNFCCC COP23 , WWEA will support the 'Ambition 1.5C: Global Shipping's Action Plan' summit on 13 November. This highly impactful shipping decarbonisation event is being co-organised by IWSA along with a number of key stakeholders in the shipping industry. IWSA Secretary General, Gavin Allwright comments: "The WWEA brings a wealth of experience and knowledge about the challenges of scaling renewable technology. Collaborating with the WWEA team on joint projects enables IWSA to accelerate uptake of this abundantly available, free-to-use energy source into the maritime sector. Our members are eager share experiences to promote wind energy around the world. With WWEA support, we see a great future for the development and uptake of wind technology in the commercial fleet." WWEA Secretary General, Stefan Gsanger comments: "We are delighted to form this collaborative relationship with IWSA, whose approach and activities fit squarely with WWEA's objectives to promote wind energy in all sectors. Shipping is certainly an area that will greatly benefit from the uptake of wind power and we look forward to working closely with IWSA to make that happen faster and at scale."

The following information was released by the World Bank: Fiji has become the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond, raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or US$50 million, to support climate change mitigation and adaption. Home to over 870,000 people, Fiji's 300 volcanic islands include low-lying atolls that are highly susceptible to cyclones and floods. In 2016, Tropical Cyclone Winstonthe most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on recordpassed directly over Fiji, causing economic losses that amounted to almost one third of the country's GDP. Like all Pacific island states, Fiji is also highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change: close to 20 percent of the region's 10 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments that are used to raise funds dedicated to climate-mitigation, adaptation, and other environment-friendly projects. This provides investors an attractive investment proposition as well as an opportunity to support environmentally sound projects. At the request of Fiji's Reserve Bank, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group focusing on private sector, provided technical assistance to assist the government in issuing a sovereign green bond. This collaboration took place under a broader, three-year Capital Markets Development Project supported by the Australian Government. Through this partnership, Australia and IFC are helping stimulate private sector investment, promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the Pacific. Projects financed from the Fiji green bond will follow the internationally developed Green Bond Principles, and will focus primarily on investments that build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Sustainalytics US (Sustainalytics), a provider of environmental, social and governance research and analysis, evaluated Fiji Sovereign's green bond transaction and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles. Fiji will also use bond proceeds for projects supporting its commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy and reduce its CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 30% by 2030. Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 Frank Bainimarama said: "The Fijian people, along with every Pacific Islander, live on the front lines of climate change. The rising seas, changing weather patterns and severe weather events are threatening our development, our security and the Fijian way of life, along with the very existence of some of our low-lying neighbors. I have made access to climate finance a key pillar of our upcoming COP23 Presidency, and we are proud to set an example to other climate-vulnerable nations by issuing this green bond to fund our work to boost climate resilience across Fiji. By issuing the first emerging country green bond , we are also sending a clear signal to other nations that we can be creative and innovative in mobilizing funds and create win-win outcomes for countries and investors in adapting to the serious effects of climate change." "With this bond, Fiji has demonstrated that green capital markets can be created in emerging economies, and that all countries, big and small, have an important role to play in facilitating climate solutions," World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. "As it takes the helm of COP23 , Fiji is uniquely positioned to inspire other countries to meet their respective targets and build resilience against climate change." The World Bank and IFC are among the pioneers of the green bond market. The World Bank issued the first green bond in 2008. Since then, both institutions have provided leadership by issuing green bonds across a range of currencies, tenors and volumes; helping to define best practice for reporting and standards; and working with countries to facilitate the development of domestic green bond markets. The global green bond market is expected to reach US$134.9 billion in 2017. The Government of Fiji will chair the 23rd Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany from November 6-17, 2017. Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has given high priority to COP23 and aims to continue the momentum for action since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement last year.

The European Investment Bank issued the following news release: Today in Bonn, Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank - the world's largest financier of climate action - welcomed a new action plan designed to stimulate green finance to tackle global warming. Dr Hoyer was speaking at an event on the margins of the COP23 UN Climate Conference in Bonn. Convened by the United Nations' Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative and hosted by the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the event featured the release of a new SSE action plan on how stock exchanges can grow green finance. President Hoyer said, "It is estimated that 90 trillion dollars of sustainable investment is needed by 2030. The path to a 2 degree world may look long and steep for climate activists. But I firmly believe that green bonds - pioneered by the European Investment Bank 10 years ago - alongside other green financial instruments, can help us reach this target." He added, "Stock exchanges can play a decisive role in triggering the trillions needed to ward off a global tragedy. Therefore, I very much welcome today's release of this important publication by the UN Sustainable Stock Exchange. I hope that actions will soon follow words and that this plan, which highlights two crucial aspects: promoting green products, and greening financial markets, will stimulate supply and the demand for green finance."

It is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020.

The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) issued the following news: A new initiative launched today by UN-Habitat and its partners brings together associations of urban and regional planners from around the world to contribute to the debate and decisions on climate action. While urban areas account for around two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas emissions from global energy use, one of the key communities shaping the way cities grow - planners - have to date been predominantly omitted. The new initiative, Planners for Climate Action, was launched today at the global climate talks, COP23 "Planning is in a bad way," said Dr Clos during the launch. "Urban planning has dramatically decreased from around 80 per cent [of urban land being planned] before 1900 to less than 50 per cent in 2015." He went on to emphasize the importance of planning as one of the key tools to make climate positive cities. A recognised role for cities Cities' contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 per cent and 49 per cent globally - a significant portion of total emissions. Despite the significant challenges that they present, it is increasingly evident that well-planned cities can reduce congestion, pollution and provide energy efficiency, leading to reduced emissions. The Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda all acknowledge the role that cities have to play in combating climate change. Under the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action, Human Settlements Day at COP23 aims to promote the invaluable role of non-state actors in global action towards curbing and mitigating climate change while also emphasizing the nexus between these two key issues. Urban and regional planners have a key role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. Despite this, up to now, planners have not had a comfortable place within existing multi-stakeholder climate initiatives. Planners for Climate Action aims to combat this by bringing global, regional and national associations of planning professionals and planning educators together to ensure their expertise is incorporated into discussions and action. Among other activities, Planners for Climate Action will: Advocate for strengthened and accelerated urban/regional planning Help to monitor implementation of relevant targets Map and share knowledge Jointly develop normative guidance and knowledge products Provide substantive input to ongoing relevant initiatives Find out more on UN-Habitat at COP23 Climate Change Conference here ( HYPERLINK https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-at-cop23/ https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-at- HYPERLINK cop23 / ) Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6074766 MSTRUCK \</doc>

Participants at the World Climate Conference working in front of the depiction of a globe in Bonn, Germany, Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2017. (Oliver Berg/dpa via AP) COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, with attendance from University of Connecticut students. The conference, which lasts until Nov. 17, will be welcoming 14 UConn students this coming Saturday, Nov. 11, to partake in the second week of panels, presentations, and discussions. This opportunity provides an invaluable experience for our university, not just for the students, but for the entire community to learn more about the dangers of climate change and what we can do to prevent them while our government sits idly by. Shortly after the 2016 election, President Trump backed the United States out of the Paris Agreement, angering thousands of people all over the country. However, despite the federal government's decision to withdraw from the accords, many individuals and organizations quickly decided that they were obligated to uphold these guidelines no matter what Trump decided to do. These groups quickly joined forces and started the movement called "We Are Still In," which aims to ensure that the guidelines set by the Paris Accords are upheld anyway. UConn, which joined the group in 2016 when the president was first elected, is hoping to add to its representation at the upcoming UN Conference. In past years, students who have attended the conference have returned with a newfound wealth of knowledge regarding our planet's environment and how other nations around the world are handling the same climate issues as the United States. Students have also been able to use this invaluable opportunity to share the information they learn with administrators at UConn, including President Herbst, in order to find ways to improve the university's overall sustainability and encourage continued vigilance when it comes to working towards a "greener" tomorrow. With the current political climate in America being quite cold in regard to the environment, it is important now more than ever that we send students to this conference. Not only are current students the ones who will be making important environmental decisions in the future, but we are the ones who will be most affected by the decisions made today. By sending these students to Germany to participate in this conference, we are ensuring that we help students become more informed citizens and allowing them to spread that knowledge to others who can potentially help make a change as well. Attending this symposium is not just important, it is imperative as it benefits each individual student, the university, and our generation as a whole, in the struggle against climate change. By sending students and faculty to COP 23 , UConn is showing that not only does our climate continue to matter but so does the future of all of our students. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS): Experts from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) today discussed recent extreme weather eventsboth in the U.S. and abroadintensifying due to climate change, as well as what affected communities are experiencing, and how to limit harm from future disasters to people and the economy. Click here to view video of the event on demand. Below is a statement from Rachel Cleetus, lead economist and climate policy manager at UCS. "Along with other parts of the world, this year, the U.S. experienced some of the worst climate and extreme weather-related events to date. A record-breaking wildfire season in the West caused over 50 deaths, and has resulted in nearly 8.9 million acres burned and over $2.7 billion in federal firefighting costs. Hotter, drier conditionsoften a fingerprint of climate changeare contributing to a longer and more severe western wildfire seasons. Similarly, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were ravaged by intense hurricanes fed by warmer waters, resulting in record-breaking floods, loss of power, damage to homes and infrastructure, and contributing to potentially hundreds of deaths. The final numbers for this year's disasters are not yet in, but experts estimate the damage costs will likely top $300 billion. "Scientific projections show the risks of climate-related disasters like wildfires, droughts and floods will become increasingly severe as the planet warms, and with that we can expect economic costs to also grow exponentially. This makes policies and resources to protect and prepare communities for current and future impacts of climate change all the more paramount." Below is a statement from Kathy Egland, chair of the Environmental and Climate Justice Committee for the NAACP National Board of Directors. "Some communities are hit harder than others when disaster strikes. Historical disenfranchisement often leads to people of color being underprotected during extreme weather emergencies. To help these communities we need a three-pronged approach that aims to minimize damages in areas seeing recurring disasters, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and limit industry efforts to pawn off their harmful product on low-income communities. That's why the NAACP is working to build an energy system that creates quality jobs to grow the economy, and ensures equal access to the benefits offered by renewables." Below is a statement from Saleemul Huq, director of the ICCCAD at Independent University in Bangladesh. "The devastation of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, are not limited to the U.S. Despite being well adapted to annual river flooding during monsoon season, one-third of Bangladesh found itself underwater earlier this year due to unyielding rain. This historic rainfall left the nation reeling leaving more than 1,000 dead, hundreds of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, and a large portion of their crops devastated. Human induced climate change requires nations around the world to redefine a 'new normal' as weather events become more intense and destructive." Additionally, UCS discussed the results of their first-of-its-kind study recently published in Climatic Change, which finds that top fossil fuel producers such as ExxonMobil and Chevron are responsible for as much as half of the global surface temperature increase and roughly 30 percent of global sea level rise. The study examined attribution during two time periodsbefore and after 1980, when investor-owned fossil fuel companies were aware of the threat posed by their products. Below is a statement for Peter Frumhoff, chief climate scientist and director of science and policy at UCS. "Up until this point, governments and taxpayers have shouldered the responsibility on growing climate change costsfor both damages and measures to adapt. The science now enables us to quantify how much specific companies' products have caused the Earth to warm and seas to rise, begging the question of who should pay for their mounting costs moving forward. "Fossil fuel companies could've taken any number of steps, such as investing in clean energy or carbon capture and storage, yet many chose to instead spend millions of dollars to deceive the public on climate science or block sensible limits on carbon emissions for decades. The victims of these companies' irresponsible decisions should not have to continue to foot the bill. This new scientific data can and should help inform juries and judges, as well as governments, who may seek to have fossil fuel producers pay their fair share." The Union of Concerned Scientists puts rigorous, independent science to work to solve our planet's most pressing problems. Joining with people across the country, we combine technical analysis and effective advocacy to create innovative, practical solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future. \</doc>

For the first time ever, the majority of nation's agreed on single goal  to limit global to well below 2 degrees Celsius. That's the threshold scientists say we shouldn't pass if we want to avert dangerous climate disruptions. Decades of research led to that conclusion, so there's no reason to doubt it, unless you are willingly sticking your head in the sand. Say what you want about the global climate deal, it's significant just for the fact that there was agreement among so many countries with so many varied interests, and the U.S. helped lead the way to making the agreement happen. A couple of years later and that heady Paris buzz has turned into a bit of a climate hangover, with the realization that the truly hard work of actually cutting emissions is still ahead. In late November I attended the latest edition of the annual powwow, and it was encouraging to see that, even in the absence of U.S. leadership, the rest of the world is determined to save us from ourselves. If this process works, the U.S. will owe the rest of the world a huge debt of gratitude, because this is truly a case of pulling the bacon out of the fire. I wrote several stories about the COP23 conference, including a story about what, exactly, the negotiators were trying to achieve in Bonn: COP23 : Writing the Paris accord rule book.[1] Germany is supposed to be one of the new global leaders on climate policy, but is that really the case? Here's what I found out: How Germany Can Lead on Climate, Despite Setbacks. [2] Then the was the fossil fuel sideshow put on by the White House: America's Mortifying Performance at the Bonn Climate Talks.[3] The issue of climate financing (who pays for the damage that's already been caused; who helps pay to help poorer, developing countries cope with impacts that rich countries for the most part caused?) was on the table, and it's a question of how to make sure the money is getting to where it's needed. It looks like one of the most promising avenues for climate action is in the courts, as lawsuits will force energy companies and governments to accept liability for failing to avoid actions that hard harmful consequences. The message from environmental attorneys is that, if climate policies fail, 'We'll see you in court.' And in the end, the U.S. negotiators actually didn't try to disrupt the negotiations at all, and didn't try to impede global progress toward the Paris Agreement. In some areas, they actually helped make progress, according to European experts[4].

The Union of Concerned Scientists issued the following news release: At the United Nations climate talks in Bonn, Germany today, Syria announced it will join the Paris Agreement leaving the United States as the only nation to say it will not participate in the global effort to tackle climate change. The announcement happened during a plenary session at the climate talks, also referred to as COP23 , and further solidifies U.S. isolation on climate change issues that began to take hold at the G-7 and G-20 meetings earlier this year. Below is a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and a leading expert on the United Nation's international climate negotiations process, who is currently at COP23 . "Syria's announcement that it will join the Paris Agreement leaves President Trump in not-so-splendid isolation as a result of his irresponsible and ignorant decision to withdraw the United States from the most comprehensive effort ever to confront the mounting climate crisis. Meanwhile, the groundswell of climate action by U.S. governors, mayors, companies and others is providing assurance to the rest of the world that President Trump doesn't speak for most Americans on this issue."

The following information was released by the National League of Cities (NLC): Today, America's city leaders issued a strong condemnation of President Donald J. Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The agreement, which was supported by the National League of Cities (NLC) and is signed by nearly 200 nations, was created to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat rising global temperatures. NLC led the largest delegation of city leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where the climate agreement was adopted. Following today's announcement, NLC President Matt Zone, councilmember, Cleveland, released the following statement: "President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement is a flagrant disregard for the safety and prosperity of American cities who are already dealing with the devastating effects of climate change. "City leaders are on the front lines of the fight against climate change, and are taking actions to reduce greenhouse emissions and prepare our communities for the future. Norfolk, Virginia, is building resilient infrastructure to combat rising sea levels. New York has a public health plan to help residents cope with extreme heat. And cities like Riverbank, California, are adopting smart water meters to help residents conserve water and protect against the effects of drought. "We need the federal government to partner with cities to help us preserve clean air, clean water and clean land. However, the president's decision undermines these goals and imperils the health of our citizens and our environment. Cities will continue to advocate for ambitious policies that address this global crisis, and will lead by example at the local level." More than 70 local leaders have signed onto NLC's climate action letter to President Trump, urging the administration to embrace the principles of the Paris agreement.

The following information was released by the World Bank: BONN, November 10, 2017 By 2050, Fiji's annual losses due to extreme weather events could reach 6.5 percent of GDP because of the impact of climate change, with more than 32,000 people pushed into hardship every year, according to a significant new climate vulnerability study launched today at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. An estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over ten years almost equivalent to 100 percent of the country's GDP for one year is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient , which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum . The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fiji's vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fiji's economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include: An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050. A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages . Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fiji's population currently living in risk-prone areas. Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems. Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy. Michel Kerf , the World Bank's Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience. "This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change," said Kerf. "Yet crucially it also provides an evidence-based resource from which we can best support Fiji, and other island countries, in their drive towards more climate resilient development." The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was launched at COP23 alongside a 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) experience, Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK http://www.ourhomeourpeople.com www.ourhomeourpeople.com COP23 delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to see the impacts of climate change for themselves.

Pernod Ricard, a producer of wines, issued the following news release: Patricia Ricard, President of the Paul Ricard Oceanography Institute, was present at COP23 to Support Ocean Protection Initiatives The 23rd United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ), held in Bonn, Germany, ended last Friday. Less than two years after the Paris Agreement and COP21, negotiators met to implement common climate objectives and underline the current importance of the Ocean cause in the Conference's final declaration. The Paul Ricard Oceanography Institute, as a member of the Ocean & Climate platform, played an active role in the event. Its President Patricia Ricard spoke at the COP on several occasions as part of the initiatives within civil society. In her speech on Thursday, November 16, and as part of the launch of the Ocean Pathway Partnership organized by COP23 's Fijian presidency, Patricia Ricard stated that, "we live on a third of Planet Earth, and we are surrounded by a global ocean. We are all islanders." The Ocean Pathway Partnership is aimed at reinforcing all stakeholders' mobilization and cooperation to integrate the ocean in all UN climate mechanisms. It represents major progress from this COP, gathering the main platforms and partnerships involved in this issue. As explained by Patricia Ricard, "by sharing scientific knowledge and highlighting solutions and specific actions, the Ocean Pathway Partnership represents a 'new deal' for oceans. It should allow us to move further and faster, all together." Today everyone agrees that oceans play a part in climate regulation. However, it was necessary to wait until the 2015 COP21 in Paris for the word "ocean" to be mentioned for the first time in a climate agreement. At COP22 in Marrakech an entire day was devoted to negotiating ocean issues. But the ocean had never been so present in the political agenda as this year, with a special IPCC report on the ocean and the cryosphere expected for 2019. In addition, French President Emmanuel Macron said a One Planet summit will be held in Paris on December 12 to discuss the mobilization of actors and financial means in favor of climate action. Paul Ricard's Oceanography Institute has been working on marine environment protection for over 50 years and contributes to the reinforcement of the ocean's role in climate negotiations. For three years Patricia Ricard, spokesperson of the Ocean and Climate platform, has been speaking at international institutions so that "ocean awareness increases faster than sea levels."

WWF Global issued the following news release: While Brazilian diplomats are in Bonn (Germany) defending the swift implementation of the Paris Agreement, back home the Michel Temer administration published an emergency bill that could endanger the very goal of the climate accord: the piece sent to Congress creates fiscal incentives of up to $ 300 billion to oil companies from all around the world to accelerate offshore oil extraction in the Brazilian pre-salt layer. If it succeeds, Brazil will be subsidizing oil reserves whose development could alone eat up at least 7 percent of humanity's remaining carbon budget. The bill was proposed in August but is only being voted now, at an ominous timing - during COP23 and days after the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) published data indicating that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record. In a moment when all countries in Bonn pledge that reducing carbon emissions is key to a safe climate future and the current NDCs are not enough to deliver it, the known pre-salt oil reserves are a climate time bomb. They are thought to contain 176 billion recoverable barrels, which if burned could release 74,8 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. This is equivalent to 7 per cent of all carbon dioxide humanity can still emit if it wants to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming below 2 degreeC, and to 18 per cent of what we can still dump in the air to meet the more ambitious goal of stabilizing warming at 1.5 degreeC - the only safe temperature limit for island nations like Fiji, host of COP23 . COP23 , in Bonn, is for countries to step up and raise ambition in their NDCs from 2020 onwards. Brazil must scale up renewable energy and keep the pre-salt reserves underground, for the benefit of its people and as its fair share to keep the temperature rise at 1.5oC", says Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, leader of WWF's Climate and Energy Practice. A few days before the beginning of COP23 , new data published by the Brazilian Climate Observatory showed that Brazil's greenhouse-gas emissions rose 8.9 percent in 2016 from the previous year, even though during a deep recession. Brazil, the world's seventh biggest climate polluter, thus became the only major economy in the world to increase pollution without growing income. According to Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, it shows the contradiction between the country's international discourse and national action. "This bill is not only a climate freak, but also an economic liability for a country still mired in recession. By giving big oil a subsidy in the tune of hundreds of billions, President Michel Temer is either dooming the planet or tying his country to stranded fossil assets", says Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. "Since the President was irresponsible enough as to send this bill to Congress, the task of stopping the madness now is in the hands of House speaker Rodrigo Maia." Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, adds that the incentives to accelerate the development of pre-salt have consequences not only to Brazil but the whole planet. "This is a terrible sign, more important than speeches are the practical actions that can drive us to fight climate change. With this bill, Brazil will make the global responsibility to reduce emissions even more difficult than it already is". "The Brazilian government should be honoring the commitments it assumed under the Paris Agreement and completely restructuring its energy matrix, redirecting resources to renewable energies. But instead, they are giving subsidies that strengthen the fossil fuel industry. This bill not only damages public safety, but also will exponentially increase the country's greenhouse gas emissions. This irresponsibility needs to be denounced", says Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, director of 350.org Brazil and Latin America. This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 15, 2017.

Continue reading Climate Change Poses Alarming Threat to Food Security in Pacific Islands By HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/author/razeena-raheem/ Razeena Raheem Pacific leaders gather at FAO before participating in the UN Climate Conference COP23 . in Bonn. Credit: FAO ROME, Nov 12 2017 (IPS) A high-level meeting of political leaders - hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) - sounded an ominous warning: that climate change poses an alarming threat to food systems and food security in the Pacific islands. And for many island nations, the impact of climate change also represents the gravest of threats to their survival and viability , including, for some, through the loss of territory due to sea-level rise and the potential danger of being wiped off the face of the earth. Chaired by FAO Director-General Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, the meeting of leaders from nine small island developing states (SIDS) and representatives of regional development bodies, plus New Zealand and Australia, focused on Improving food security and nutrition, building resilient livelihoods and promoting partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands. The nine participating countries included Kiribati, Vanuatu, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea and French Polynesia, whose inhabitants face a potentially severe food crisis triggered mostly by climate change. Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva. Credit: FAO In his opening remarks on Saturday, Graziano da Silva shared the Pacific leaders' concerns about the negative impact of climate change on food security and nutrition and its role in exacerbating the burden of malnutrition as well as the alarming overweight and obesity levels. You are suffering from things that you didn't cause, from things you are not responsible for the impact of climate change, the FAO Director-General said. This is what FAO offers support so that you can face climate change; scale up growing local products as we see you import more and more food. Obesity is a big problem. It is an epidemic that we need to address. Together with partners such as WHO, we promote the uptake of healthy, fresh food fruits, vegetable and fish instead of processed food. We promote local products bread fruit, for which we have a pilot programme in the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Nauru, and which we want to scale up and multiply, he added In a joint statement, following the meeting Saturday, the Pacific leaders called upon all countries to exceed previous commitments and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C as above pre-industrial levels, to reduce the adverse impacts on food security and nutrition, coastal habitats and the livelihoods of those depending on oceans. The 1.5 degrees limit will allow for a greater change at maintaining resilient livelihoods and promote partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands, the HYPERLINK statement read . Also participating in the meeting were officials from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Director-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and Chief executive officer of the Pan Pacific Power Association. The joint statement was also a call to action to the UN climate change Conference of Parties ( COP 23 The meeting, which concludes November 17, will be presided over by the government of Fiji, a small island developing state in the Pacific. The leaders also raised concerns about the negative impacts of malnutrition evidenced by the growing incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which accounts for 75 percent of adult deaths in the Pacific, and called for more proactive and integrated actions to promote policies to tackle food insecurity challenges, especially on issues related to obesity, stunting, wasting and NCDs. They acknowledged the importance of the FAO and partners' HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7135e.pdf Global Action Programme on Food Security and Nutrition in SIDS , which recommends action at global, regional, national and local level to accelerate food security and nutrition, calling for its endorsement and immediate implementation. With Pacific island states highly dependent on their oceans for their livelihoods and food security, leaders reiterated their anxiety about ecosystem degradation, and called upon the international community to assist in maximizing the sustainable utilization of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for the benefit of small island developing states. According to FAO, the Pacific islands are among the most environmentally vulnerable nations in the world. Drought, extreme high tides, violent winds, and storm surges pose major risks to small island nations, and their efforts to achieve sustainable development. With Oceans Day events taking place at COP23 on Saturday, Graziano da Silva highlighted the importance of the FAO HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/port-state-measures/en/ Port State Measures Agreement Urging all Pacific Island states to adhere to the agreement, he said: You are countries with more water and natural resources to preserve than any other countries. This is why the Port State Measures Agreement is important. He said FAO is committed to support you to implement and monitor your PSMA process. We can provide assistance for your national legislations, training and funding to put the agreement in place. We will not be able to safeguard our ocean environment if we don't combat illegal fishing, he declared. In the joint statement, the leaders also reiterated their anxiety about ecosystem degradation and other challenges encapsulated in the Sustainable Development Goal 14 and called upon the international community to assist in maximizing the sustainable utilization of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for the benefit of the small island developing states. They further recalled the endorsement of the Global Action Programme on Food Security and Nutrition in SIDS and called for immediate implementation. Additionally the leaders also called upon the international community to ensure partnerships are genuine and enduring South-South and triangular cooperation are encouraged and facilitated, and synergies to maximize the use of financial resources for the Pacific Islands are pursued and built The political leaders at the high level meeting included: Taneti Maamau, President, Republic of Kiribati, Baron Waqa, President, Republic of Nauru, Hilda Heine, President, Republic of Marshall Islands, Yosiwo P.

The World Bank issued the following news release: By 2050, Fiji's annual losses due to extreme weather events could reach 6.5 percent of GDP because of the impact of climate change, with more than 32,000 people pushed into hardship every year, according to a significant new climate vulnerability study launched today at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. An estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over ten years - almost equivalent to 100 percent of the country's GDP for one year - is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fiji's vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fiji's economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include: An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050. A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages. Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fiji's population currently living in risk-prone areas. Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems. Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy. Michel Kerf, the World Bank's Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience. "This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change," said Kerf. "Yet crucially it also provides an evidence-based resource from which we can best support Fiji, and other island countries, in their drive towards more climate resilient development."

Nov 11, 2017( Skeptical Science: HYPERLINK http://www.skepticalscience.com When it comes to climate change, US conservatives inhabit a unique position, as part of\~the only major political party in the democratic world[2]\~to reject the legitimacy of climate science and any domestic policy or international agreement meant to address it. Instead, the GOP is\~working actively[3]\~to increase production and consumption of fossil fuels and to slow the transition to renewable energy. How can conservatives be moved on climate change? I recently heard a podcast that helped me order my thoughts on this perennial debate. It was\~Political Research Digest[4], a weekly 15-minute research round-up hosted by Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossman for the\~Niskanen Center[5]. (Grossman is the author of\~Asymmetric Politics[6], a crucial text for understanding American political parties. The podcast is nerdy and good.) In the\~third episode[7], Grossman takes a look at some recent literature on climate change opinion and how, if at all, it can be shifted among conservatives. It begins well, with an excellent lay of the land. But the discussion of how to move forward goes off course, in a very familiar way. It stops short of contemplating the uncomfortable but increasingly likely possibility that persuading conservatives on this subject has become impossible, and what that might mean for those concerned about the looming dangers of climate change. Let's start with a look a few basic facts about public opinion on climate. Conservatives probably can't be persuaded on climate change.

USA, Nov. 16 -- New Airport, adopter of world-class sustainability and environmental policies, is set to save on power and water through innovative and green technologies. Once operationalized, the airport will save power and water corresponding to the annual consumptions of 19,000 households and 5,500 households, respectively. These savings are expected to hit TL 33.2 million annually. The 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties took place November 6-17 in Bonn, Germany. Convened every year since 1995 to evaluate the progress on the fight against climate change, the conference saw participation of representatives and guests from the UN member states. Mehmet Kalyoncu, Board Member at Kalyon Holding and Executive Board Member of IGA, shared his views on the meeting: "Istanbul New Airport is the world's largest airport under one roof and built from scratch. At IGA, we placed faith in our airport's capability of contribution to Turkey's sustainability culture, right from the inception. The airport is globally unprecedented in many aspects. We are in the know of the responsibility we have shouldered. We started off with environmental and social impact assessments of the highest world standards. In an era marked by a rapidly changing technology, the fact that we build the entire infrastructure from scratch, unlike ongoing airport renovation projects in Europe, enables us to bring to life a much more innovative and sustainable airport. With these features, Istanbul New Airport will outperform existing airports in respect of saving and efficiency. We foresee to save power and water amounting to TL 33.2 million annually." Informing that the terminal building will be 20 percent energy-efficient and will save up to 40 percent of water according to well-established standards set by The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Kalyoncu added: "All businesses to operate in the New Airport, designed in accordance with LEED Silver certification requirements, will have the green building certificate. Buildings such as the Air Traffic Control tower, the mosque and the State Guest House were also designed in accordance with LEED certification standards." Mehmet Kalyoncu also remarked that the structures to be utilized by third parties, including office buildings, hangars and cargo facilities, were contracted on the condition to meet the Green Building Certification requirements. Noting that Istanbul New Airport is built to operate as a sustainable and environment-friendly as well as a barrier-free airport, Kalyoncu continued his remarks: "At INA, we have been satisfying the Green Airport requirements all along, starting from the construction phase. Built and set for operation in compliance with IFC standards, INA will also feature third party companies following the highest global environmental and social standards." Mehmet Kalyoncu elaborated on the sustainability-oriented technologies utilized in the design and construction phases: "With the BIM (Building Information Modeling) system, we improve efficiency in design and construction. Basically, we reduce waste in terms of cost, time, and quality, and monitor subcontractors to eliminate unforeseen overspending." "The studies we carried out here as well as the resulting accumulation of knowledge have become a case study for the global aviation industry. We are frequently invited to international conferences, for our studies set an example. We intend to share with everybody the knowledge, know-how and experience we acquired here so as to contribute to the sustainable development of the aviation sector," said Kalyoncu, emphasizing that detailed and technical investigation into environmental and sustainability aspects of Istanbul New Airport set a high-profile role model for world aviation. Mehmet Kalyoncu also pointed out that they launched the IGA Social Investment Program on January 1st, 2016, in a bid to contribute to the socio-economic development of the local communities in neighborhoods close to the project site and manage in the best way possible the current and potential effects of the project; adding that they were nominated for three global awards in their social management projects to date. Istanbul New Airport to minimize impacts of climate change! Ulku Ozeren, IGA Director of Environment and Sustainability, who delivered a presentation titled "Istanbul New Airport Climate Change Action Plan" as part of the UN COP23 forum "Adaptation to Climate Change and Sustainable Practices in Aviation", described environment and sustainability as their first priorities. Ozeren continued as follows: "In fact, climate change is one of the most critical factors that affect and shape the future operations of airports and other stakeholders such as airlines. At IGA, we have been striving since day one to develop global benchmarks in an effort to minimize the impacts of climate change, and we make use of these benchmarks." Rainwater and recycled water to meet terminal building's needs Pointing out that the terminal building will be significantly water-efficient, Ozeren went on as follows: "Rainwater, recycled water, and greywater will be used in responding to the terminal building's own needs. This means saving 1.5 million m3 of water in a year, which equals the annual water consumption of 5,500 households. With regard to energy efficiency, we expect our efforts to culminate in saving on power corresponding to the annual consumption of 19,000 households and 30,700 tons of CO2 (eq) per year. Another fact is that these terminals are more efficient than the existing airports built in the past, which help reduce the need for fuel use and respective carbon gas emissions. In a time marked by smart cities, buildings and phones, we are proudly building the smartest and the most digitized airport." Fewer flight delays hence fewer emissions at INA 'Green' Istanbul New Airport The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment run at the beginning phase of the project, more specifically between 2013 and 2015, helped in the identification of the impacts and the preparation of an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan. This plan contains numerous items ranging from water monitoring, ecology and land management to a local health and safety plan. The INA project comprises a social investment program, which involved Rambol Environ conducting a world-class environmental and social impact assessment. The program carried out more than 150 projects that reached out to 16,000 people, who are directly or indirectly affected by the works. This year only saw the implementation of a spate of projects on the development of beekeeping, promotion of plant production, improvement of animal husbandry amongst others, as part of nine strategic areas of the Sustainable Rural Development Program.

The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: Commissioner Arias Canete reaffirms EU leadership for upcoming UN climate talks as local governments adopt position on climate finance One month ahead of the COP23 , cities and regions call Europe to keep up leadership in the fight against global warming with upgraded ambition and new financing initiatives for local climate action. In a push to deliver the Paris Agreement, members of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) - the EU's assembly of local and regional governments - called for adequate mechanisms for climate finance, reiterated the importance of involving all levels of government and said they would continue to strengthen relations with cities and regions outside Europe's borders to push the climate agenda forward. Speaking in Brussels, the president of the European Committee of the Regions Karl-Heinz Lambertz said: "the CoR is committed to strengthening relations with local and regional governments across the world. Having recently formalised cooperation agreements with ICLEI and Climate Alliance , the CoR is now hoping to reach out to the US Conference of Mayors and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. President Lambertz added: "climate change is a threat to all of us, which will only be overcome through cooperation. Across the globe, local and regional governments are showing a level of conviction on climate change that often surpasses national ambition. Europe's local and regional governments stand ready to build ties with cities and regions across the Atlantic and beyond to share experiences, work together and ensure global temperatures are kept well below the 2 degree threshold set in Paris." The EU Commissioner for Energy and Climate, Miguel Arias Canete said: "we must make good progress on the implementation of the Paris agreement and reach a consensus on its work programme by the 2018 deadline. The world can continue to count on Europe for global leadership. We will work with all our partners to ensure COP23 is a success, including the many cities, regions and businesses that continue with ambitious climate action." Commissioner Arias Canete referred to America's Pledge, a coalition of 227 cities and counties, nine states and about 1,650 businesses and investors from the US that are "moving to uphold the United States' commitments under the Paris deal." Members of EU's assembly of cities and regions adopted its official COP23 position on Climate finance. Rapporteur Marco Dus (IT/PES) said: "It is not political will that European cities and regions are lacking but tailored financing mechanisms and the technical capacity to access them". Marco Dus calls for creating new ways - for example green bonds and collective guarantees - to finance climate action locally. The member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council in Treviso added: "Along with the need for additional financial mechanisms tailored to local governments, it is essential that subsidies to economic activities with high environmental impact are gradually phased out and disappear completely by 2035." Andrew Cooper (UK/EA), rapporteur of the opinion on how to better implement environmental law in Europe, said: "the reduction of CO2 emissions achieved by local governments needs to be measured, valued and encouraged. A system of Locally Determined Contributions (LDC) needs to be established in addition to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to help bridge the emissions gap." The Kirklees Councilor says "Locally Determined Contributions" will help limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. It would also allow us to set up higher yet remaining achievable targets." Andrew Cooper's LDC's initiative is in line and has the support of the adopted opinion by Marco Dus (IT/PES) on climate finance. UN's COP23 While the CoR continues to champion the Global Covenant of Mayors initiative within and beyond EU borders, it applauds the America's Pledge initiative whereby an unprecedented number of U.S. states, cities, businesses, and colleges and universities reaffirmed their support for the Paris Agreement. The CoR signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Conference of Mayors US in 2010 and is exploring ways to work with Canadian municipalities to forge a new transatlantic coalition on climate.

The Union of Concerned Scientists issued the following news release: Experts from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) today discussed recent extreme weather events--both in the U.S. and abroad--intensifying due to climate change, as well as what affected communities are experiencing, and how to limit harm from future disasters to people and the economy. Click here to view video of the event on demand. Below is a statement from Rachel Cleetus, lead economist and climate policy manager at UCS. "Along with other parts of the world, this year, the U.S. experienced some of the worst climate and extreme weather-related events to date. A record-breaking wildfire season in the West caused over 50 deaths, and has resulted in nearly 8.9 million acres burned and over $2.7 billion in federal firefighting costs. Hotter, drier conditions--often a fingerprint of climate change--are contributing to a longer and more severe western wildfire seasons. Similarly, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were ravaged by intense hurricanes fed by warmer waters, resulting in record-breaking floods, loss of power, damage to homes and infrastructure, and contributing to potentially hundreds of deaths. The final numbers for this year's disasters are not yet in, but experts estimate the damage costs will likely top $300 billion. "Scientific projections show the risks of climate-related disasters like wildfires, droughts and floods will become increasingly severe as the planet warms, and with that we can expect economic costs to also grow exponentially. This makes policies and resources to protect and prepare communities for current and future impacts of climate change all the more paramount." Below is a statement from Kathy Egland, chair of the Environmental and Climate Justice Committee for the NAACP National Board of Directors. "Some communities are hit harder than others when disaster strikes. Historical disenfranchisement often leads to people of color being underprotected during extreme weather emergencies. To help these communities we need a three-pronged approach that aims to minimize damages in areas seeing recurring disasters, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and limit industry efforts to pawn off their harmful product on low-income communities. That's why the NAACP is working to build an energy system that creates quality jobs to grow the economy, and ensures equal access to the benefits offered by renewables." Below is a statement from Saleemul Huq, director of the ICCCAD at Independent University in Bangladesh. "The devastation of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, are not limited to the U.S. Despite being well adapted to annual river flooding during monsoon season, one-third of Bangladesh found itself underwater earlier this year due to unyielding rain. This historic rainfall left the nation reeling leaving more than 1,000 dead, hundreds of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, and a large portion of their crops devastated. Human induced climate change requires nations around the world to redefine a 'new normal' as weather events become more intense and destructive." Additionally, UCS discussed the results of their first-of-its-kind study recently published in Climatic Change, which finds that top fossil fuel producers such as ExxonMobil and Chevron are responsible for as much as half of the global surface temperature increase and roughly 30 percent of global sea level rise. The study examined attribution during two time periods--before and after 1980, when investor-owned fossil fuel companies were aware of the threat posed by their products. Below is a statement for Peter Frumhoff, chief climate scientist and director of science and policy at UCS. "Up until this point, governments and taxpayers have shouldered the responsibility on growing climate change costs--for both damages and measures to adapt. The science now enables us to quantify how much specific companies' products have caused the Earth to warm and seas to rise, begging the question of who should pay for their mounting costs moving forward. "Fossil fuel companies could've taken any number of steps, such as investing in clean energy or carbon capture and storage, yet many chose to instead spend millions of dollars to deceive the public on climate science or block sensible limits on carbon emissions for decades. The victims of these companies' irresponsible decisions should not have to continue to foot the bill. This new scientific data can and should help inform juries and judges, as well as governments, who may seek to have fossil fuel producers pay their fair share."

International Atomic Energy Agency issued the following news release: The IAEA will lead side events on energy policy, sustainable development, nuclear power and climate change, and the future of the oceans at the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which kicks off today in the western German city. The 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides a platform for countries to present their strategies for mitigating the effects of a warming planet, including their next steps for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conference, presided over by the Government of Fiji, runs through 17 November. "The IAEA will seek to raise awareness among participants and country delegates of the role of nuclear science and technology in addressing climate change, including the resources available at the IAEA to meet their needs," said David Shropshire, Head of the IAEA's Planning and Economic Studies Section and of the Agency's delegation at COP23 . The IAEA will lead two other events. On 8 November, Connecting Roadmaps for Innovative Nuclear Energy to the NDC Timeline will focus on how nuclear energy innovation can be coupled with the timelines of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made by countries in committing to the Paris Agreement. Another side event on 15 November will discuss how nuclear power, which accounts for one third of global low carbon energy production, can further contribute to climate change mitigation. "To meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, nuclear power capacity will need to be substantially increased by 2050," said IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov, Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy. At the 8 November side event, "panellists will discuss innovations in nuclear energy technologies - the progress, challenges, and enabling conditions to accelerate their development and hopefully, early deployment," he added. "The five-year NDC reporting period and time horizons of innovative nuclear power technologies, could be incorporated into energy plans to support carbon reductions." In addition, the IAEA is the focal point of another joint UN side event on 11 November, Ocean and Climate: A Resilient Ocean for Future Generations. The IAEA will explain how policymakers can make informed decisions on climate change through the use of nuclear science, including in measuring and monitoring ocean acidification, which is profoundly changing seawater chemistry, threatening marine ecosystems and coastal communities. As the focal point for the UN exhibit on Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, focused on SDGs 7 and 9, IAEA staff will also interact with participants on the Agency's work on climate change during the two-week-long COP23 .

Washington: Competitive Enterprise Institute has issued the following news release: Under the United States Constitution, all treaties must be ratified by two thirds of the Senate. On April 22, 2016, President Obama signed what is called the  Paris Climate Agreement. He took the position that this was not a treaty and therefore was not subject to the constitutional requirement of Senate advice and consent. But the question of whether something is a treaty or not cannot be determined solely by the president. In fact, the Paris Agreement actually was a treaty by its terms, custom, and practice. Despite this, the Obama State Department pushed the line, not only via its own spokesmen but through outsiders and certain media contacts, that this agreement was not a treaty and didn\' t need to be ratified the Senate. The State Department called these third parties  validators. We have requested more information about these  validators through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The State Department operated a vast network of these so-called  validators. One well-placed  validator State recruited promised to  write a \' good news\' op-ed to follow up on his gloomy one in the WSJ from [August 2015]. In CEI\' s FOIA litigation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over former Administrator Lisa Jackson\' s infamous  Richard Windsor account, the EPA produced piles of emails discussing its various  validators for the Waters of the United States, Clean Power Plan, and other controversial rules now facing rollback. They didn\' t pretend there is a personal privacy interest in being a possible, let alone an agreed, pre-arranged promoter of an agency or administration. More information on the communication with these people will provide clarity to the public as to why some media organizations and other individuals were opposing requiring Senate ratification of this treaty. We have also learned that State Department employees were using the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp during the United Nations Climate Change Conference to communicate with each other. The Federal Records Act requires preserving all such records for historical purposes and regardless of the application used. We wish to confirm that such records were properly preserved and know what the State Department was talking about in such secret communications. The State Department has not responded to these and related FOIA requests as required by the deadlines imposed under the Freedom of Information Act. As such, yesterday we filed a lawsuit to compel production of these records. These records cannot stay hidden just by ignoring our requests. \</doc>

Nov 07, 2017( The Keyword: Google: https://blog.google Delivered by Newstex) Most air pollution is measured at a city level, but air quality can change block by block, hour by hour and day to day. To better understand air quality on a more local level, we began[1] working with our partner Aclima[2]  to map air pollution across California using Google Street View cars equipped with air quality sensors. Earlier this year, we shared the the first results[3] of this effort with pollution levels throughout the city of Oakland. We're just beginning to understand what's possible with this hyperlocal information and today, we're releasing data[4] for three additional California regions, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and California's Central Valley (the Street View cars drove 100,000 miles, over the course of 4,000 hours to collect this data!). Scientists and air quality specialists can use this information to assist local organizations, governments, and regulators in identifying opportunities to achieve greater air quality improvements and solutions. Over 195 nations will gather in Bonn for the COP23 UN Climate Climate Change conference[5] this week. Rising to the climate challenge will involve a mix of policy, technology and international cooperation and we believe that insights about air quality at the community level can help support both local and global action on climate. Below we've highlighted some of our findings for these regions.\~Below we've highlighted some of our findings for these regions.

RPMI Railpen ""manager of the U.K.'s \£328 billion ($38.6 billion) Railways Pension Scheme "" has written to more than 200 companies in which it invests, asking them for deeper disclosures of their climate policies. Railpen plans to center its 2018 shareholder activism on climate issues, having joined the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures last year. The TCFD promotes the use of standardized financial risk disclosures in investing. "We believe that companies with robust corporate governance structures are more likely to achieve better long-term financial performance, and more effectively manage all of their risks and opportunities," Leo George, Railpen's head of sustainable ownership, said in a statement Tuesday. "This helps us to achieve our mission to pay members' pensions securely, affordably, and sustainably." Railpen's move comes months after 12 U.K. investment consultants made a public agreement to remind schemes of their duty to account for environmental, social, and governance factors in making investment decisions, as per guidance from the Pensions Regulator. [II Deep Dive: ESG or Else, Consultants Warn Pension Clients] According to Jessica Ground, global head of stewardship at Schroders, asset owners increasingly recognize that climate change may impact investment returns. But, she said, the largest pension funds are the most focused. "Signaling an intention to vote against boards who appear not to be taking the issue seriously enough is a relatively new development," Ground said. "The past 12 months have seen climate change rise up the agenda of asset managers and owners, helped by COP 21" "" the United Nations Climate Change Conference "" "and the TCFD." Schroders has been dealing with more specific requests from clients wanting climate change risks reflected explicitly in their portfolios. "There isn't a single right answer," she said. "Some clients are opting for an exclusory approach, but far more are interested in our work integrating analysis of the issue into our fundamental investment processes and engaging." Schroders' competitors are fielding similar requests. "The largest asset owners in the world now require quite detailed information, for them to process themselves, rather than just headline numbers," Hermes Investment Management's lead investor Eoin Murray told Institutional Investor. "That is pushing our industry to produce a swathe of more granular information. When we are looking at ESG issues "" like climate "" we are now drilling through to the underlying factors." Murray added, "It is a huge amount of work.""\ \</doc>

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: The Government of Canada continues to take a leadership role in tackling climate change and helping our countryand the worldcreate a cleaner global economy. Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, announced that the Government of Canada will invest $1.6 million to help the four Pacific Alliance countries address climate change. Established in 2011, the Pacific Alliance is a regional initiative by Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Minister McKenna highlighted the Government of Canada's commitment at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. The $1.6-million project will help the Pacific Alliance reduce climate pollutants, attract investment supporting climate actions, and help create a cleaner environment for Pacific Alliance countries, Canadaand the rest of the world. The project will also support the implementation of the Paris Agreement by strengthening Pacific Alliance nations' climate actions and helping them develop measurable, reportable, and verifiable data. The non-profit organization International Emissions Trading Association, in partnership with Canadian company ClimateCHECK, will manage the funds on behalf of Canada. Through this investment, Canada continues to play a leadership role as a strategic partner of the Pacific Alliance, of which Colombia is the current chair. Quotes "Climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. We must work together and help each other. Through this project, we are helping the Pacific Alliance nations improve their capacity to carry on the great work they're doing." Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change "The challenge of facing climate change is a task of all governments. Canada is a strong ally of Colombia in this purpose. Through this project developed within the framework of the Pacific Alliance, we will continue strengthening our institutional capacity to respond to the effects of climate change with the support of Canada." Luis Gilberto Murillo Urrutia, Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Colombia Quick Facts This investment is part of Canada's pledge of $2.65 billion to support developing countries transition to low-carbon economies that are both greener and more climate resilient. In 2012, Canada became the first non-Latin American observer, and, in 2016, Canada signed a joint declaration for partnership with the Pacific Alliance. Over the past decade, Canada has seen a 72 percent increase in trade with the Pacific Alliance, worth approximately $48 billion in 2016. The project will use blockchaina technology with the potential to reduce costs, strengthen emissions data collection, and thus improve access to finance emission-reduction initiatives.

VATICAN CITY -- Religious leaders need to tell congregations that global warming can affect not just the environment, but also the spread of diseases and other threats to human health, participants said at a Vatican conference on Saturday on climate change, an issue that has been a priority of Pope Francis. Persuasion ''starts with the tenets of faith'' more than with scientific data, said the Rev. Leith Anderson, president of the United States-based National Association of Evangelicals, noting that most of the world's population has some religious affiliation. ''Environmental catastrophes'' like recent storms, flooding and droughts, he said, ''create opportunities to persuade.'' The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox, president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, said he had given hundreds of talks on the issue. ''Many evangelicals believe in climate change or understand the science in climate change, but they still see it as a future event,'' he said. ''It's not something they have to worry about, and that is what we have to change.'' Mr. Hescox added: ''The way to move conservatives around the world is to talk about how it impacts or affects their children, their own lives.'' The three-day conference on public health and the planet, which ended Saturday, was hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The conference reviewed studies and data that have emerged since Francis issued a forceful 2015 encyclical that highlighted the social and ethical issues caused by climate change, including mass migration and famine. The participants shared ''the most recent solid science on how climate change and air pollution undermines health, increases chronic diseases and the early results on how it impacts the brain,'' said Joachim von Braun, the president of the Pontifical Academy. ''Science is not just pointing at the environmental consequences of climate change, but also human health consequences'' that affect both the poor and the wealthy. Jerry Brown, the governor of California, who also spoke at the conference, underlined the importance of religious leaders' involvement. ''Until religious leaders from every part of the world and every denomination are engaged, we will not be able to move aside the huge rock of indifference, complacency and inertia,'' he said. ''The American people in the majority are very much in support of serious climate action,'' said Mr. Brown, who will head to the United Nations ' climate change conference this coming week in Bonn, Germany. While governments have responsibility to enact change, he said, individuals also have an obligation. Unless people reorient their habits and way of life, he said, it will be difficult to reverse the changes affecting the planet. \</doc>

U.S. President Donald Trump's promised pullout from the Paris Agreement on climate change has backfired, placing the issue "much more at the forefront of the American people," Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown argued at a Vatican City climate symposium on Nov. 4, exactly one year after the accord entered into force just days before Trump was elected. "I would say over time, given the commitments in this room today, and what we are seeing around the world, the Trump factor is very small, very small indeed in comparison." Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown poses for a photo in Rome on Nov. 3, 2017, ahead of climate talks at COP23 . Source: AP Photo/ Alessandra Tarantino While Brown said Americans "are very much in support of serious climate action," he waved off applause from leading scientists, religious leaders and politicians assembled at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. "If Trump was our only problem, we'd have it solved ... The problem is us. It's our whole way of life. It's our comfort. It's the greed. It's the indulgence it is a challenge of transformation, and a transformation in the profoundest way possible." The governor's comments came on the first leg of a two-week trip through Europe in which the leader of the world's sixth-largest economy is acting as the de facto U.S. point man in a series of international climate talks at the Vatican, the European Union in Brussels, a German state government, a meeting of scientific academies in Norway and at this year's 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23 , in Bonn, Germany. In June, Brown was appointed as COP23 special envoy for states and regions. Brown, a Roman Catholic, called for leaders of all faiths to participate at secular climate talks, citing a need for "a clear prophetic voice" on the imperative of climate change instead of a language that is "too opaque, too bureaucratic," including in the Paris accord itself. "There's no way in hell that's going to motivate people," he said. A "religious" and "prophetic spirit" must accompany political, scientific and technological solutions, he added. Preaching cap and trade to a skeptical pope In his 184-page encyclical in 2015, Pope Francis called on the world to transition to renewable energy from fossil fuels to address social and ethical inequities linked to climate change. In it, he criticized market mechanisms, such as California's cap and trade program, referring to carbon trading a possible "new form of speculation" that would not help reduce global emissions. However, Brown and Kevin de Le\'f3n, California's state Senate president pro-tempore, who has co-authored several landmark energy and climate laws, defended cap and trade as a key part of the state's bid to slash greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% by mid-century. Kevin de Le\'f3n speaking to supporters as he launched his run for U.S. Senate on Oct. 18, 2017. Source: AP Photo / Jae C. Hong "I understand the deep skepticism of market mechanisms articulated by Pope Francis," de Le\'f3n, a 2018 U.S. Senate candidate running against Senator Dianne Feinstein, said. "We are not relying on market mechanisms alone It complements a host of direct measures we have taken in recent years." Among those measures, California requires utilities to reach 50% nonhydroelectric renewable electricity by 2030, he said, adding that he will continue to press the case for 100% carbon-free power for 2045 despite the recent failure of his legislative proposal to set that target. Moreover, through cap-and-trade auctions, "we are taking billions of dollars from polluters to put solar panels on rooftops in poor neighborhoods" and to "take dirty diesel engines off the road and replace them with electric vehicles" in the areas most severely impacted by local air pollution. Under a 2012 law authored by de Le\'f3n, at least a quarter of auction revenues flow to the state's poorest, most polluted areas. "As I like to say: We are teaching electric vehicles to speak Spanish," the state senator said. California's combination of market-based policies and mandates is "a model to governments around the world" on equitable renewable energy and environmental policies, he added. "America may not have the leadership at this time. But I submit to each and every one of you: California does." \</doc>

Today, America's city leaders issued a strong condemnation of President Donald J. Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The agreement, which wassupported by the National League of Cities (NLC)and is signed by nearly 200 nations, was created to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat rising global temperatures. NLCled the largest delegationof city leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where the climate agreement was adopted. Following today's announcement,NLC President Matt Zone, councilmember, Cleveland, released the following statement: "President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement is a flagrant disregard for the safety and prosperity of American cities who are already dealing with the devastating effects of climate change. "City leaders are on the front lines of the fight against climate change, and are taking actions to reduce greenhouse emissions and prepare our communities for the future. Norfolk, Virginia, is building resilient infrastructure to combat rising sea levels. New York has a public health plan to help residents cope with extreme heat. And cities like Riverbank, California, are adopting smart water meters to help residents conserve water and protect against the effects of drought.\~\~ "We need the federal government to partner with cities to help us preserve clean air, clean water and clean land. However, the president's decision undermines these goals and imperils the health of our citizens and our environment. Cities will continue to advocate for ambitious policies that address this global crisis, and will lead by example at the local level." More than 70 local leaders have signed onto NLC'sclimate action letterto President Trump, urging the administration to embrace the principles of the Paris agreement. Join city leaders responding on social media by using the hashtag#Cities4Climate. The National League of Cities (NLC) is dedicated to helping city leaders build better communities. NLC is a resource and advocate for 19,000 cities, towns and villages, representing more than 218 million Americans.

The following information was released by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme: Bonn, 13 November 2017 At a day dedicated to cities and climate change, UN-Habitat's Deputy Executive Director highlighted the importance of engaging women in climate action. The first high-level day of the UN's COP23 climate change summit focused on Sustainable Development Goal 11, an opportunity to promote the linkage between cities and climate change. Chairing the Women Leaders in Climate Change meeting at the Bonn summit, Aisa Kirabo Kacyira, who is also a UN Assistant Secretary-General, said well-managed urbanization was key to achieving the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. "If we proactively plan and lead cities to get us where we want, [urbanization] will be probably the most affordable tool to get us there," said Mrs Kacyira. She went on to talk about the climate development nexus and to emphasise the importance of making sure women leaders are at the centre of climate action. #WeAreClimateChange Mrs Kacyira also presented the prize for UN-Habitat's #WeAreClimateChange competition; a social media competition that challenged young people to show what their city was doing to mitigate or adapt to climate change. Hanna Pintusava, an urbanist from Belarus, was awarded the prize above several hundred contestants or her image of floating gardens in the Netherlands. On receiving the certificate from the organization's Deputy Executive Director, Ms Pintusava said that she was honoured to receive the accolade and delighted to be able to attend the world famous meeting which had been an educational experience. As the prize for first place in the competition, Ms Pintsuva was awarded a trip to the COP23 meeting and her photo was displayed, along with those of the other finalists, in the hall of the main high-level meeting to promote the importance of urban issues in climate action. \</doc>

As the summit of governments known as COP23 reached its conclusion in Bonn, Germany this week, two clear alliances have emerged in the global energy landscape. One of them, the International Solar Alliance, was launched in Paris and is all set to become a legal entity. The other, an alliance to phase out coal, was announced on Dec. 16 in one of the biggest developments at COP23 . Jointly launched by Britain and Canada - both developed countries - the alliance already has 20 members, including Italy, France, Mexico, Norway, El Salvador and several U.S. states. The International Solar Alliance, on the other hand, is led by India - an emerging economy. Forty-four countries have already joined this alliance, of which 16 have also ratified it. As a result, the alliance will come into force on Dec. 6. New Emissions Data, New Alliances The launch of the Global Alliance to Power Past Coal comes at a time when global carbon emissions are rising. Earlier in the week, the University of East Anglia and Global Carbon Project global emissions report showed a significant rise in global carbon emissions in 2017. The rise was observed after three years during which emissions figures were static. The biggest increase in carbon emissions occurred in China and India. According to the report, Global CO2 emissions from all human activities are set to reach 41 billion tons (41 Gt CO2) by the end of 2017. Meanwhile emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach 37 Gt CO2 - a record high. China's emissions are projected to grow by 3.5 percent while India's emissions are projected to grow by 2 percent. Launching the new alliance to phase out coal, Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said, "Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities with close to a million dying every year from coal pollution. I am thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy - and this is only the beginning." The members of the new alliance, which aims to grow to 50 by the next COP in 2018, would not only phase out coal in their own countries by 2030 but also stop investing in coal-fired electricity both within and outside of their countries. In sharp contrast, the members of the other alliance - the ISA - are reluctant to make any commitment to end coal energy before 2030. India, the leader of the alliance and a major coal producer, argues that coal is needed to end poverty and provide its poor citizens access to electricity. The country plans to produce 1.5 billion tons of coal by 2020 - double the amount it produces now. "From the Indian perspective, let me make it very clear: there are development imperatives which as a country we need to fulfill. If you look at the total emissions, our contribution is miniscule. The point is, while this factor is spoken of, what is not spoken [about] is India's extreme effort at trying to get energy much better," said India's Environment Secretary in a definite statement to the press. "Today we are talking of producing 175 gigawatt of energy from renewable sources by 2022. Of that 120 GW will be from solar and the rest from biomass and others. Coal will continue to be used for some time, but we are continuously looking at alternative sources of energy." Anand Kumar, secretary at India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said that IAS's core goal is to bring 121 countries on a single platform to explore ways to utilize and promote solar energy. Besides production, the alliance would also focus on making solar energy cheaper and more accessible by garnering investment, bringing down the cost of solar cells, solar modules and solar storage. The other prominent members of the alliance - China, Australia and New Zealand - still heavily invest in coal, even as they're trying to produce more energy from renewable sources. At the COP, soon after the emissions report was presented by the University of East Anglia, Brazil, India, South Africa and China - known as the BASIC countries - released a joint statement reiterating their right to grow and asking the world to look at their emissions from the perspective of equity. No coal vs no unabated coal However, even as the new Global Alliance to Power Past Coal was announced, some of the statements raised doubts over whether the alliance only wanted to end unabated coal or coal in general. Unabated coal refers to plants that are not fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which captures the harmful emissions that cause global warming. According to Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry in the UK and one of the alliance's leaders, unabated coal was "the dirtiest" and her country would try to end using it. "The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2015 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit." Perry did not elaborate if the UK or the new alliance would still support use of abated or partially abated coal. India, which otherwise refuses to end its use of coal, is also in favor of using partially abated or so-called "clean coal." Says C K Mishra, "We are also looking at making use of better quality coals." Sitting on the Fence: Germany's non-partisan status COP 23 - has not announced its intention to join either of these alliances. This has been severely criticized by anti-coal activists who have accused Germany of having a double standard by organizing the climate conference while not taking a strong step on either ending coal or shifting to renewable energy. On Nov. 15, as Angela Merkel reached the COP to address the parties, the activists laid out a red banner that read "keep it in the ground" for the chancellor to walk on. "We want no coal. We want no dirty power," said one of the activists who was not allowed inside the conference. \</doc>

Canada and the United Kingdom have agreed to spearhead a push for the elimination of emissions from coal-fired electricity generation at an upcoming climate-change summit. Canada's minister of environment and climate change, Catherine McKenna, met with her U.K. counterpart, Claire Perry, Oct. 11 to discuss ways to mitigate coal-plant emissions. The two discussed cooperation in advancing carbon capture, utilization and storage, according to a Canadian government statement. The meeting comes ahead of the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties, or COP23 , summit planned for November in Bonn, Germany. Canada's government has legislated the end to coal-plant emissions by 2030, while the U.K. plans to phase out traditional coal-fired generation by 2025. Canada has already granted exemptions to its plan to isolated provinces without access to natural gas sources that would back up renewables. While other countries participating in COP23 have agreed to cut emissions, host country Germany and China are both expanding their coal-fired generating fleets. "Canada and the United Kingdom will champion a global alliance on the transition from unabated coal-fired electricity at next month's United Nations climate change meetings in Bonn, Germany," the ministers said in a joint statement. "Phasing unabated coal power out of the energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of our communities, and benefit generations to come. We are doing our part, but we recognize the need to accelerate the international transition from burning coal to using cleaner power sources." Canada already has two industrial-scale carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, projects in operation, Royal Dutch Shell plc's Quest CCS project and SaskPower's Boundary Dam project. Those facilities were both built with provincial government aid prior to the election of McKenna's government. \</doc>

The European Investment Bank issued the following news release: The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH are stepping up their cooperation. EIB President Werner Hoyer and Tanja Gonner, Chair of the GIZ Management Board, underscored their commitment in an agreement signed in Bonn. Although climate change mitigation and renewable energy projects take centre stage, the two organisations also plan to support projects in several other sectors, including agriculture, infrastructure development and employment promotion in emerging economies and developing countries. GIZ and EIB have already launched their first cooperative project - FELICITY, which stands for Financing Energy for Low-carbon Investment - Cities Advisory Facility. Cities and municipalities have to embrace green climate ideas and invest in sustainable infrastructure, for example in buildings, public transport, wastewater management or district heating. FELICITY helps them identify and plan suitable projects and then draft applications that make international banks want to invest. FELICITY is being implemented on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) as part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). "EIB is an international player in the field of climate finance and has many years of experience in financing sustainable infrastructure projects. That's why the bank is an important partner for us,' emphasised Tanja Gonner. 'I am therefore extremely pleased that we will be pooling our expertise in future and, as a first step, supporting cities and local authorities in responding to the challenges of climate change." "In our joint efforts, we will be building on GIZ's experience in managing change processes, in transferring know-how and in creating enabling environments in order to promote sustainable investment in developing countries and emerging economies," said Werner Hoyer. "The pressure on cities and municipalities to respond to climate change is greater than ever. With FELICITY, we are demonstrating that we - together with GIZ - can direct our support to where it is most needed. What better way to cement a partnership." As the financing arm of the European Union, EIB works closely with EU bodies. It uses its financing instruments and expertise in sustainable investment projects to put EU policy into practice. FELICITY is the first project to be implemented in partnership by EIB and GIZ. The Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is a federal enterprise with worldwide operations. We support the German Government in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development and in international education work. GIZ assists people and societies in shaping their own future and improving living conditions. Background information: The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, is committed to supporting implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and backing climate related investment around the world. The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate-related investment in the five years up to 2020.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - As the United Nations 23rd Conference of the Parties wraps up in Bonn, Germany, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a Senate Resolution, led by Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. "There is no doubt that global climate change poses a growing threat to our planet, our country, our Great Lakes and Wisconsin," said Senator Baldwin. "Turning our back on the world and backing out of the Paris Agreement is bad for our environment and bad for our economy in Wisconsin. The U.S. must show strong leadership on climate change, reaffirm our commitment to future generations and take action to address this challenge." The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector. A copy of the Senate resolution can be found here HYPERLINK https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Paris%20Climate%20Accord%20resolution%2011.17.17.pdf https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Paris%20Climate%20Accord%20resolution%2011.17.17.pdf . In addition to Senator Baldwin, other Senators co-sponsoring the resolution include Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Jack Reed (D-RI).

Washington: R Street Institute Organization has issued the following news release: Senior U.S. climate officials arrived Monday in Bonn, Germany, a week into the latest meeting of the United Nations-sponsored climate change project known as the Conference of Parties-23 ( COP-23 ). To no one\' s surprise, the  rest of the world (which is to say, Europe and the American political left, mostly) remains unhappy about the United States\' decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord in June. Nonetheless, they are committed to find a way to persuade the country (which is to say, the red states) to see the error of its ways. Over the weekend, four Democratic governors from states with active environmental movements Jay Inslee of Washington, Jerry Brown of California, Kate Brown of Oregon and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia verbally thrashed the Trump administration, although Brown was taken aback when even he was booed and heckled by  climate justice protestors. But to no avail. On Monday, as several of Trump\' s most senior climate negotiators took part in a panel talk on  clean fossil fuels, attendees started singing a clever protest song to the tune of Lee Greenwood\' s  God Bless the U.S.A. But the Trump administration still plans to exit the Paris Agreement. What gives? Suffice it to say, taking moral umbrage at the United States doesn\' t have the same coercive power over American policy as the Pentagon\' s nuclear umbrella over Europe or the U.S. Navy and its 11 aircraft carriers keeping the world\' s trade routes has had on global policy. Hence, the distinction between  hard power and  soft power made many years ago by Harvard\' s Joseph Nye. The top-down approach to climate change the United Nations prefers was never going to work. Major climate meetings have been taking place for 23 years hence the name COP23  but have never succeeded in creating a workable international scheme. On two separate occasions, the United States has signed up and then removed itself from a global climate agreement, first in 2001 under George W. Bush and now in 2017 under Trump. Thankfully, a more decentralized approach to carbon policy is quietly gaining steam, as states and cities band together to pursue their own goals. Speaking during a panel discussion in Bonn, McAuliffe celebrated the recent election wins in Virginia, which ushered in a new swath of Democrats who will enjoy something like parity with Republicans in the Legislature\' s lower house, not to mention a new Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. This means Virginia will likely become a member of the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which has had some success cutting emissions from the power sector. Carbon markets are less economically efficient than a carbon price, but since its creation in 2005, RGGI state carbon emissions have fallen 40 percent, thanks in large part to the development of natural gas reserves from hydraulic fracturing. While RGGI is not an ideal vehicle to place a market price on carbon, this type of compulsory, cost-sharing system is the longest-lasting successful carbon market still in existence. Along with Virginia, the election of a Democrat to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey also means that state may rejoin RGGI, after leaving the group in 2011. In other words, the growth of regional carbon markets is still a going concern. It even could force real U.S. emissions reductions in the coming years, even as the sound and fury of U.N. meetings along the Rhine continue to signify nothing. \</doc>

Greenpeace International issued the following news release: With the UN climate talks underway in Bonn, and as the Philippines is preparing for the visit of President Trump for the upcoming ASEAN Summit, Filipinos are gathering to commemorate the fourth anniversary of super typhoon Haiyan, the most devastating storm to ever make landfall in history. "This year's spate of extreme weather events are a clear signal to governments and corporations that they must step up action on climate change," said Yeb Sano, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, whose family is from Eastern Visayas, the region hit hardest by Haiyan. "Fossil fuels must stay in the ground. Government delegations meeting in Bonn must stand up and propel climate action forward or be held accountable for their inaction." President Trump's current tour of Asia, coincides both with the Haiyan anniversary and the COP 23 UN climate talks. President Trump will be in the Philippines on 12-13 November. "While Trump seems to deny climate change and apparently defends fossil fuel interests, Filipinos have learned the hard way that climate change is real and happening now. Greenpeace stands with typhoon survivors and all those impacted by climate change, and especially with the brave activists fighting for climate justice through the courts," said Sano. Typhoon Haiyan (or Yolanda in the Philippines), packed 300km/h winds and a 7.5m storm surge that locals say claimed many more lives than the official toll of 6,329, and displaced millions of people who are still rebuilding their lives. The Haiyan commemoration honours those lost and celebrates the second lease on life that survivors feel they've been given, as well as the fighting spirit that the local Waray-Waray people are famous for. In 2015, Filipino typhoon survivors, other communities suffering the impacts of climate change, and civil society organisations, including Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines), filed a petition with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in the Philippines to investigate the responsibility of big fossil fuel companies for climate-related human rights harms (2). The Commission has called on 47 carbon producers, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, BHP Billiton, Suncor, and ConocoPhillips, to show up at the first meeting with the petitioners on 11 December, as part of its investigation. As part of the Haiyan commemoration, over 500 students and local community members sent a strong visual message to Bonn, calling for climate justice in a world where those least responsible for climate change suffer the worst consequences. Commemoration activities also include art exhibits and storytelling events, culminating in a memorial walk and candlelight vigil on 8 November to mark the anniversary. Yeb and his brother, AG Sano, a visual artist, activist, and Haiyan survivor, are among the CHR signatories. AG is currently in Bonn to call for climate justice on behalf of the other petitioners. On 6 November, AG Sano delivered a message during the COP23 opening plenary: "You might remember when an emotional Philippine negotiator spoke about Typhoon Haiyan at COP19 in Warsaw (3), and his despair for his own brother in the eye of the storm. I'm that brother. I speak on behalf of the people who have suffered, and will continue to suffer because of climate change. We will not be sacrificed to a warming climate and demand that those responsible for driving climate change are held responsible." This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 7, 2017.

The news from the recent 23rd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP23 , is disturbing. The meeting, which took place in Bonn, Germany, is the first set of international climate talks since Donald Trump announced his plans in June to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. At the meeting the Trump administration used its only public forum to promote dirty energy sources like fossil fuels and nuclear power. The Trump administration ignores its own science about the health and climate dangers of fossil fuels. It is well known combustion of fossil fuels emits volumes of pollutants, which can cause a variety of illnesses. As the father of a childhood cancer survivor, I am particularly concerned about these negative effects on the health of my children and other Virginians' children. While I am extremely disappointed in the government's position on the Paris climate agreement and its inaction, it is encouraging that U.S. business leaders, activists, and state legislators have used the COP 23 climate talks to show other countries that many Americans are still committed to fighting climate change. Twenty states, more than 50 cities, and 1,400 businesses have signed America's Pledge - an initiative to mobilize states, cities, and companies to comply with the U.S. commitment in the Paris agreement to cut carbon-dioxide emissions. Virginia looks poised to join in this effort by linking to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a collaborative of nine Northeastern states working together to reduce carbon emissions. Governor McAuliffe earlier this year issued Executive Directive 11 - also known as the Clean Energy Virginia initiative - which directed the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to draft proposed regulations to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Last Thursday, the Air Pollution Control Board voted to move this effort forward for public comment as a proposed standard. This common-sense standard will not only reduce carbon pollution in the commonwealth, it will incentivize the development of renewable energy, creating jobs and improving the quality of our air and water. Virginians should be vocal in their support of ED 11, and also urge Governor McAuliffe, along with their representatives in the General Assembly and in Washington, to protect climate action and fight back against Trump's reckless stance on global fossil fuel consumption. Energy monopolies like Dominion Energy are fighting for a massive buildout of Trump-supported fracked gas infrastructure in Virginia, including the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines. Just last week, the Keystone XL pipeline spewed over 200,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota, threatening public health and safety. While cities and states are banding together to move forward on climate change issues, what they can muster to keep the climate crisis in check still may not be enough. The Global Carbon Project released a report on Monday showing that greenhouse gas emissions are on track to rise this year - the first increase in four years. While a global effort is needed, state and local action is imperative. While the Trump administration states its plans to withdraw from the Paris Accords, and the rest of the country moves ahead, it is essential to consider the comments this week of Daniel Firger, who is leading the America's Pledge effort: "The question isn't so much what happens to the rest of the world if the U.S. walks away; the question is what happens to us." Each of us should be concerned about what happens to our planet, our environment, and our children's health and our future. Virginia's new common-sense safeguards, put in place by Executive Directive 11, will allow our children to breathe easier. Steven D. Goodwin is a Richmond-based attorney.

In 2009, President Trump and members of his family signed a full-page ad in The New York Times urging then-President Obama to push a global climate change pact negotiated in Copenhagen, Denmark. In a recent interview, climate hawk Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Trump's flexible stance on climate change combined with his increasing frustration with Republican leadership in Congress could pave the way for a carbon fee. "There's the prospect of his 2009 persona combining with his impatience with being led down blind alleys," Whitehouse said, "and here is a really big deal that can do something huge and also reduce taxes significantly." Since Trump launched his bid to hold presidential office, he has openly questioned mainstream climate science and called it a hoax. He also pulled out of the Paris Agreement and is pursuing policies friendly to coal, natural gas and oil interests. The 2009 ad harks back to a time when the real estate mogul was a Democrat. Whitehouse said the public tends to forget Trump's leftist era because Democrats have failed to publicize it and his inconsistent views on global warming. "Because we're idiots on our side and don't know how to take advantage of openings like this," he said. "I've probably given eight speeches about it on the floor; we even have a big blown-up version of [the ad] to show." The ad appeared a day before leaders from 192 countries gathered at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark to "determine the fate of our planet," the ad reads. "As business leaders we are optimistic that President Obama is attending Copenhagen with emissions targets," it states. "Please don't postpone the earth. It we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet," the ad continues. Trump along with Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump signed on to the advertisement. In the wake of recent hurricanes and wildfires, the Trump administration has been avoiding the subject of climate change. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last month sidestepped answering about whether Trump believes the mainstream scientific finding that humans are driving greenhouse gas emissions higher (Climatewire, Sept. 12). "The president has addressed this already. I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks," she said. Still, the president has been known to change his mind and shift his policy stances. Whitehouse said he wouldn't rule this out when it comes to a carbon fee. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina recently said he would work with Whitehouse on a carbon fee, though the administration said it was "off the table" for the upcoming GOP tax overhaul (E&E Daily, Sept. 28). \</doc>

The European Commission issued the following news release: This year's climate conference, COP23 , concluded today with steps forward to ensure global climate action through implementation of the Paris Agreement. Nearly 200 countries gathered at COP23 , held in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. The parties made concrete progress on turning the historic 2015 agreement into action on the ground across the world, ahead of next year's UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland. The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework for climate action and the necessary transition to a low-carbon future in order to limit global warming to well below 2degreeC. Under the Paris Agreement the EU has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% till 2030 (1990 level). As stated by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his 2017 State of the Union address, the EU wants to remain the global leader in the fight against climate change. To re-affirm this commitment to ambitious climate action, President Juncker will lead the Commission delegation at the 'One Planet Summit' to be hosted by the French President Emanuel Macron, the United Nations and the World Bank in Paris on 12 December. Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: "The spirit of Paris is very much alive. We achieved progress in Bonn on the issues that were important to the EU, such as the Paris Work Program. But we must continue to build on this momentum in the coming months, because there is still a lot of work ahead of us before we meet in Katowice next year. The main objective must be to keep the world firmly on the path towards what was agreed two years ago in Paris." The EU again had a central role in brokering agreements during the two-week climate negotiations. As a sign of climate leadership the EU announced on Thursday that it intends to deposit the ratification instruments of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of this year. The Doha Amendment concerns the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires parties to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 targets in 2016 by having decreased emissions by 23%. The decision to swiftly ratify the Doha Amendment demonstrates our commitment to the international climate action and shows that the EU makes good on its promises. Concrete steps forward were also taken on the work program for implementing the Paris Agreement. Clarity on the design of the so called 'Talanoa Dialogue' (Facilitative Dialogue) has been achieved looking at how global climate action can be accelerated in the years to come. The Facilitative Dialogue next year will be the opportunity for political stock-taking for the parties on progress made on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. COP23 also brought outcomes on a number of other key issues: Facilitative (Talanoa)Dialogue The design of the Talanoa Dialogue has been agreed here in Bonn to set a firm base for ambitiously accelerating global efforts to tackle climate change. The Dialogue will provide a space to showcase progress and share best practice in tackling climate change, with contributions from every corner of society. Pre-2020 ambition The discussions on pre-2020 ambition concluded with an agreement on a decision text which foresees two stocktaking exercises on pre-2020 implementation and ambition to take place at COP24 and COP25. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 target by having decreased emissions by 23% in 2016. Furthermore, the EU and its Member States remain the biggest donors of climate finance to developing countries with a contribution of Euros20.2 billion in 2016. Loss and damage The parties agreed on a substantive decision text. They worked out a compromise proposal that takes into account asks from the vulnerable and small islands while keeping a balance with what had been already agreed. An expert dialogue will be organised in May 2018 to enhance the support for Loss and Damage. Gender Action Plan The COP23 The Parties agreed on the functioning of the local communities and indigenous peoples' platform, which was established at COP21 in Paris. Again the EU played an important role in securing the outcome. Next steps Ahead of the next UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, the EU will play an active role in a number of key high-level climate events, starting with the 'One Planet Summit' in Paris next month. Next year, the EU will also host the second Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) together with Canada and China, in Brussels, and takes part in the 2018 Petersberg Climate Dialogue, as well as preparatory UN climate meetings in Bonn and Katowice ahead of COP24. The release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5 celsius ahead of Katowice will be an important source of information for discussions under the Talanoa Dialogue.

The following information was released by the UN Economic Commission for Africa: During the recently concluded African Union Summit, the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) partnered with the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) in hosting an event on Low-Carbon, Climate-Resilient Development. The event attracted more than 100 participants drawn from the civil society, the climate research community, practitioners and international organizations. Deliberations over the three days of the event were structured into three themes: i) African regional post- COP23 review and dialogue; ii) agriculture in negotiations and trends in a divided world; and iii) sustaining conversations on renewable energy and energy transition: what's the progress on flagship renewable energy initiatives in Africa? As an opportunity to enrich the discourse around low-carbon, climate-resilient, green development pathways, the Summit presented a defining moment to share perspectives and emerging developments particularly after the UNFCCC- COP23 in Bonn, Germany. At the opening ceremony, James Murombedzi, ACPC's Officer in Charge, outlined the ACPC's mandate since its inception in 2011 and underscored the centre's commitment and role in the side event, in pursuit of the objectives of Goal 13 of the SDGs - taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. On his part, Mithika Mwenda, PACJA Secretary General, reiterated that climate change is a development issue in that it impacts sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, health and transport. In recent years, climate change has acquired major political attention among other pressing priorities of top African leadership. It is essential that the gains so far achieved be safeguarded through continuous engagement at the Summit, along other platforms such as African Ministerial Conference on the Environment and ClimDev-Africa Programme. In this respect, the Committee of Heads of State and Governments on Climate Change (CAHOSCC), mandated at the highest level and currently coordinated by the Gabonese President, becomes the central political lever for coordination during the Summit, to ensure that decisions of the leaders embrace an inclusive paradigm. As the first Pan-African convergence after the COP23 , and based on the cross-section of stakeholders present during the Summit, the event provided an opportunity to exchange ideas and reflections on Africa's victories during the Bonn Climate Change Conference, with a view to charting a collective path towards subsequent global dialogue processes on the subject. Indeed, this was urgent in view of the highly-anticipated global stock-take exercise on the Paris Agreement, which will be at the centre-stage of all climate change discourses across the globe in 2018. Highlights of the side event included i) Modalities for financing smallholder and women farmers; ii) Addressing agriculture, food security, and climate change under the UNFCCC; iii) Christian Aid's big shift campaign Africa (which seeks to catalyze development of clean energy) and Africa Women Energy Entrepreneurs Framework- AWEEF. The event culminated in the following recommendations which were sent for consideration by the Heads of States Summit: Deeply concerned about the challenge on access to information on governments' work and engagement in the climate change discourse including the climate change negotiations at the decision-making levels, the Pan African Parliament consider designing and facilitating through appropriate mechanisms easy access to information by stakeholders in Africa. Call upon African leaders and the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) to consider a shift in climate change negotiation processes that ensures active and effective involvement of African parliamentarians in such processes at various global and regional negotiation fronts. Call upon the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) to engage key stakeholders in Africa as parties define critical issues within the Paris Rulebook this year and deeply internalize and maintain common position within the purview of the Talanoa dialogue process.

Normally, a visit from Fiji's head of state would not generate an outpouring of interest in California's state capital. But when Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of the island nation, stepped up to the podium at the governor's mansion in Sacramento on June 13, the house was packed with state lawmakers and regulators, governors, reporters, and, of course, the host himself, Gov. Jerry Brown. Bainimarama, the incoming president of this year's 23rd Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23 , came to California to enlist Brown as special envoy for states and regions at the meeting, which convenes in Bonn, Germany, in November. As leader of the world's sixth-largest economy, Brown will join COP23 talks on the next steps to avoid a potential climate catastrophe by slashing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global average temperatures from rising 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Gov. Jerry Brown speaks to the media June 13 in Sacramento. Source: Garrett Hering, S&P Global Market Intelligence After President Donald Trump earlier in June bowed out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Brown teamed up with the governors of New York and Washington to launch the U.S. Climate Alliance. The group of now 13 states remains committed to reducing emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, as the Obama administration agreed to do when it helped hash out the Paris pact. Brown has also signed several clean energy development agreements with the People's Republic of China and two Chinese provinces. "It there's one thing we have learned over the past two weeks, it's that for every action there is a reaction," Bainimarama said. "People of all walks of life all across America have spoken very loudly, telling the world that America will continue to tackle climate change, continue the clean energy revolution, continue to create jobs and grow its economy so that it can thrive in the 21st century." As COP president, Fiji's prime minister committed to working with California and other sub-national jurisdictions on actions to limit climate change and mitigate its impacts. "There is a home for you in the international climate process," he said. In addition to appointing Brown as COP23 special adviser, Bainimarama committed Fiji to becoming the latest member of the Under2 Coalition. The group now includes 176 cities, states and countries that have pledged to slash emissions 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. California and the German state of Baden-W\'fcrttemberg co-founded the group, which includes 18 U.S. jurisdictions. Like the Paris agreement and the U.S. Climate Alliance, the Under2 Coalition has nonbinding targets. 'The beauty of state action' Asked during a press conference whether states would have a formal seat at the table at COP23 , Brown said, "We're gonna be there. We have a very important role. How the particular formalities actually work out in practice, that's something to be determined. But the nations of the world are convening in Bonn to follow up on their individual commitments at the Paris conference. The states in the Under2 Coalition group, we're gonna be there, too, and we are going to do our part." "Donald Trump cannot stop the states from making this progress. That's an important fact to understand," Washington Gov. Jay Inslee added. "Think of it this way: Tweets can't stop the heat, and they also can't stop our progress on this issue. Our ability to move forward with our renewable portfolio standards, our cap on carbon, our research and development ... there's so much we can do and the federal government doesn't have the ability to stop. That's the beauty of state action." Even if their ability to influence federal policy, in turn, is limited, states still committed to the Paris accord aspire to project power beyond their own borders, Inslee and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown acknowledged at the press conference. "This is a circumstance when the federal government is failing to lead. The states can move forward and we can pilot progressive policies that can be replicated by other states," Brown said. Inslee pointed to the regional grid proposal led by the California ISO as a platform for Western states to share their renewable energy resources. "We can work on integration of our electrical grids so that we can move solar and wind energy from where it is to where it isn't much more efficiently." The proposal first requires the approval of California lawmakers, who are considering a two-year regional grid bill in the Assembly. \</doc>

Dec 04, 2017( The ASPI Strategist: HYPERLINK http://www.aspistrategist.org.au http://www.aspistrategist.org.au How to create successful WPS policy Miki Jacevic and Olivia Holt-Ivry reflect[9] on what they have learned about implementing effective policy under UN Resolution 1325. Jacevic and Holt-Irvy unpack what they believe are the three steps to successful policy: engaging civil society; setting realistic, high-impact targets; and developing effective ways to monitor and evaluate progress. They believe that evaluating programs and resources will lead to great funding for projects that promote gender equality. 'Women in Security' podcasts The Center for New American Security interviewed Alina Polyakova[10], the David Ruvenstein Fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, as part of its 'Women in National Security' series. The discussion touches on the challenges facing women in the national security field. Ms Polyakova talks about her experiences moving from academia to policy and dealing with rooms of men who £ssume you're going to be getting them coffee'. WPS in the Middle East Female returnees from ISIS-occupied territories[11] are presenting a significant problem to the states they go back to. Although few of the women actually fought in battles in Syria and Iraq, ISIS leaders have ordered that they conduct attacks in their home countries as part of the new incarnation of the organisation. Four women have been appointed[12] to Qatar's Shura Council. The women are the first female councillors on the 45-person consultative body, which is one of the most important in Qatar. The continuing crisis in the Gulf has prompted several policy changes from Doha, and the ascension of women to the council is an important step in having women's voices heard in the dispute. Increasing female representation in positions of power Politico has released its 2017 list of 'women who shape Brussels[13]', which recognises 20 women who are driving debate and influencing policy in the EU. Included in the list is Daphne Caruana Galizia[14], a Maltese anti-corruption journalist who was murdered in October. The initiative aims to highlight women who are changing their industry or organisation and stimulate debate about gender equality in European institutions, most of which are still controlled by men. The successful election[15] of two female candidates in Tonga has renewed hope of a future that includes more women in leadership positions. Tonga has a poor record of female representation in power, with only five women elected to parliament since 1951. One of the recently elected candidates, academic Losaline Ma£si[16], brings a wealth of knowledge that will benefit Tonga's agricultural sector. Peace huts drive change in Liberia This article[17] from The Conversation details the important role that peace huts have played in furthering gender equality in Liberia. The peace huts are run by the women who helped put Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in power, Africa's first elected female head of state. While Liberia has made some progress under Sirleaf, who was able to stabilise the country after a bloody civil war, many have attributed the lack of female representation in the latest election (just 16% of candidates were women) to a failure of her leadership. Sirleaf will finish up her second term in January, but her successor is yet to be confirmed[18]. Climate change is a women's issue UN Women has released an interactive website[19] sharing the experiences of women around the world affected by climate change. Challenges with climate resilience and gender equality often go hand in hand. The first-ever gender action plan to support gender-responsive climate action was adopted[20] on 14 November by the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ). The president of COP 23 , Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama, stated that the plan 'recognized the role of women in climate action'.

Oxfam International issued the following news release: With the United Nations' climate conference drawing to a close, it's clear there's been very little progress on how to help people affected by climate change, despite record-breaking hurricanes and catastrophic floods dominating headlines this year. The biggest disappointment was the successful push by rich countries against negotiating financial support for poor countries to deal with "loss and damage," instead pushing the issue to a one-off workshop next year. The Paris Agreement doesn't mandate finance for loss and damage in the same way it does for emission reductions and climate adaptation; many hoped that the first COP chaired by a small island nation would make progress on this glaring gap. A recent Oxfam report highlighted the ruthless inequality of climate change: poor communities are five times more likely to be displaced by extreme weather than rich ones. "For the most part, rich countries showed up to Bonn empty-handed," said Nicole. "Instead, we got a tepid agreement that they'll report back next year on progress towards their $100 billion promise. President Macron's international climate summit next month in Paris will offer another moment for countries to unveil new financial pledges." The summit launched next year's "Talanoa Dialogue." This will be the first opportunity since the Paris Agreement was adopted two years ago for countries to increase their emission cuts. Without drastic reductions, the world is on course for a catastrophic 3 degrees Celsius of warming. "We now have a process in place, but this process will only work if governments come to the table next year in true 'talanoa' spirit--with respect, honesty, and good faith," said Nicole. "Governments must be ready to show how they'll clean up their emissions. No excuses." There were some glimmers of hope. Negotiators broke a five-year long stalemate around agriculture, opening the door to actual action on this vital area, especially at a time when hunger is again rising. The COP also took long-overdue steps to boost the voices of women and indigenous people and make the negotiations more inclusive. "These are tangible accomplishments that the Fijian leadership of the COP and the civil society that pushed for them can be proud of," said Nicole. Finally, the summit showed that the Trump administration's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement is almost universally reviled and has left them completely isolated. "From activists to governors and business leaders, we saw the real face of American climate activism here in Bonn. The world has left Trump behind, sitting alone on a throne of coal," said Nicole.

Climate change is proceeding to be an issue that is affecting the world. The Trump administration recently announced a plan to\~withdraw the nomination of Kathleen Hartnett White, a climate change skeptic, to lead the Council on Environmental Quality. Withdrawing White's nomination contrasts previous actions by the administration that show\~disbelief in climate change. In 2015,\~195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, committing to lowering planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to help combat climate change." On Wednesday, Nov. 15 the United Nations came together in Bonn, Germany to have the United Nations Climate Change Conference . At the conference, M. Wadah Katmawki, Syria's deputy minister of local administration and environment, announced that Syria would join the Paris deal. The United Nation Climate Change conference in Bonn, Germany. Photo from New York Times. According to the United Nations, "The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius." Syria agreeing to become part of the Paris climate accord leaves the United States the only country not on board. Trump announced an intent to withdraw from the Paris climate accord last summer. White was selected to be the White House senior environmental adviser. Withdrawing her nomination may signal a change in the U.S.'s policy on climate change. Forty-eight percent of Americans say climate change is due to human activity. Graphic from Pew Research Center. Pew Research Center conducted a survey in 2016 and reported that 48 percent of Americans say Earth is warming due to human activity and the other 51 percent say it is because of natural patterns or there is no solid evidence. "I don't believe in climate change. History has shown us over and over again the heating and cooling of our earth. The Ice Age and the melting of it. There were no man-made hazardous gasses way back then," Katie Toff,\~ owner at KT Medical Billing LLC, said. "I am baffled that people do not believe in climate change. I think they do not believe in it because they do not have the need to learn about," Fernando Cornejo, sophomore psychology major, said. Since the 19th century, the planet's average surface temperature has risen two degrees centigrade. According to NASA, this rise has been driven by an increase in carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. According to Pew Research Center, one-in-five Americans try to act on their concern for the environment all the time. "When I am home, I use my bike instead of my car. I only drive if I really have to," Cornejo said. "I am from Ecuador and our climate has changed over the past couple years. Farms are not as productive as they used to be and the farmers are facing a lot of challenges," graduate student Aide Cuenca said. \</doc>

The following information was released by Transparency International: In a report published today that analyses progress made by four key multilateral climate funds, Transparency International warns that although progress has been made to increase transparency, accountability and integrity policies, there is still more to be done to ensure climate finance is not jeopardised because of corruption. A Tale of Four Funds, which was published to coincide with COP23 climate change summit in Bonn, assesses the Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds, the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund. These funds are vital in helping some of the worlds poorest communities adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change. Climate financing was highlighted in the Paris Climate Agreement as one of the key measures needed to help countries, particularly in the developing world, adapt and adjust to climate change. Transparency is now an ingrained requirement under the Paris Agreement, with discussions about a new Transparency Framework taking place at COP23 . The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its funding mechanisms should learn from the best practices. It should also learn from the failures of more established multilateral funds to increase the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement and ensure that climate finance benefits those that truly need it. The progress made by multilateral climate funds on anti-corruption measures is a testament to their willingness to listen to civil society and the needs of affected communities, said Patricia Moreira, managing director of Transparency International. However, good policies require proper implementation, so the task now is for climate funds to make sure that the people they are supposed to help can engage with the decision making processes around how this money is spent. With more and more funds flowing into climate change adaptation and mitigation projects it is more important than ever that the UNFCCC, multilateral funds like the Green Climate Fund, and the other funds assessed take responsibility for their own transparency, integrity, and accountability. Transparency International has long advocated for strong anti-corruption measures within these funds: it is now time to demonstrate the implementation and efficiency of these policies. This is particularly true when it comes to complaints mechanism, sanctions, and whistleblowing protection. The report, A Tale of Four Funds, can be found here.

Annapolis: Comptroller of Maryland, The state of Maryland has issued the following news release: The Maryland Department of Environment today announced that Secretary Ben Grumbles will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Secretary Grumbles will discuss Maryland\' s work to fight climate change and gather insights into how other jurisdictions around the world are addressing challenges involving climate change, the environment, energy, and economic matters.  Maryland is a leader in fighting climate change, and this is a great opportunity to share our approaches and learn from others, Secretary Grumbles said.  The conference is also a chance to tell the world that Maryland is open for business on environmental, energy, and climate change solutions. The 2017 U.N. Climate Change Conference kicked off Monday and runs through Nov. 17. The conference\' s stated aims include the fueling of momentum among cities, states, regions, and territories in support of climate action plans. Secretary Grumbles, who is chairman of the independent, bipartisan Maryland Commission on Climate Change, is to participate in over a dozen presentations and meetings with government leaders, businesses and environmental, and scientific and academic organizations starting Saturday and ending next week. He is expected to discuss the actions Maryland is taking to make the state a national leader in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resiliency and preparedness throughout the state and region. When the federal administration withdrew from the Paris Climate Change Agreement earlier this year, the Hogan administration immediately stated its opposition and reaffirmed Maryland\' s commitment to stringent clean air standards. In 2015, in partnership with members of the Maryland General Assembly, Governor Larry Hogan signed legislation to strengthen and expand the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. The governor signed into law the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2016, which requires reductions of greenhouse gases in Maryland by 40 percent by 2030 \- one of the most aggressive requirements in the country \- while continuing to have a net positive effect on both the economy and job creation in Maryland. Governor Hogan also proposed and passed the Clean Cars Act of 2017 to boost the state\' s efforts to encourage the use of electric vehicles. Maryland is a member of the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In August, Governor Hogan announced that Maryland and the eight other states in RGGI had agreed to reduce the program\' s carbon pollution cap by 30 percent from 2020 to 2030, finding consensus for a stronger and sustainable program that will also grow Maryland\' s economy through innovation and collaboration. Maryland is also encouraging other states to join the bipartisan initiative and for regions around the world to learn about RGGI\' s impressive track record and new tools for clean energy progress. Secretary Grumbles is expected to be one of 10 American state officials to attend meetings and briefings at the conference.

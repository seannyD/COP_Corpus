\~\~Global warming can be kept to about 2C if all nations honour the promises they made at the Glasgow climate summit but 1.5C is looking increasingly out of reach, a new study suggests. \~\~ Australian experts including University of Melbourne climate scientistMalte Meinshausen were part of the study, along with European scientists from the International Energy Agency. \~\~ Associate Professor Meinshausen says it's a sobering mix of good and bad. \~\~ The good news is that for the first time, modelling has shown the world has an articulated pathway to keep climate change under 2C - but only just. \~\~ Everything will rest on all countries achieving - in full, and on time - stronger emissions reduction targets set at last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. \~\~ If that happens, it's possible to keep warming to 1.9C to 2C, the study found. \~\~ The bad news is that's well beyond the primary objective of theParis climate agreement to limit warming to well below 2C, preferably 1.5C. \~\~ Half of one degree might not sound like much, but theUN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the difference will be profound for almost every ecosystem on earth. \~\~ The study found that even with the stronger targets, there was only asix per cent to 10 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5C andsubstantially more action was needed this decade to achieve that. \~\~ "There is some positive news because five years ago, we would never have thought that the pledges on the table would bring us to around 2C,"Associate Professor Meinshausen said. \~\~ "Is it also a bad story? Yes, because thewindow for 1.5C is very rapidly closing, and the world will look very different at 2C." \~\~ He said the Australian government, which refused to take a stronger 2030 emissions reduction target to the Glasgow summit, had chosen not to join the push for accelerated action, despite what was on the line. \~\~ "Unfortunately for the Great Barrier Reef it's too late. There will be some remnant corals around, but it won't be the same beauty." \~\~ He said Australia's position was a great irony, given the impacts of climate change are already so visible, and that there was so much for the nation to gain economically from its bountiful renewable power sources. \~\~ He also said it was stillpossible to keep the 1.5C goal alive but fossil fuel reliance had to end and the pace of transition to renewables needed to triple. \~\~ Mr Morrison has promised to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 under a plan that relies on a technology-led economic evolution to cut emissions, capture and store them, or offset them, while allowing coal and gas exports to continue as long as there is demand. \~\~ The study is published in the journal Nature.

Sherlock Holmes: Don't forget the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. Inspector Gregory: The dog did nothing in the night-time. Sherlock Holmes: That was the curious incident. COP26 in Glasgow. Attention has been lavished on the new commitments - or, in the case of Australia, old non-commitments - of leading carbon-emitting countries. The final communiqu&#xE9; underscored the need for a global approach. Ambitious promises were made to increase the finance available for adaptation measures, especially in developing countries. But COP26 We know what we need to do, and we know how to do it, too. The problem is how to pay for it. The global transition to a low-carbon economy will not come cheap. Who will finance the technological innovations? Who will fund the transition to agricultural sustainability? Who will pay for the retraining of old industries and the development of new ones? Who will support the developing countries who are the least responsible, but the most vulnerable? Who will pay for the rainforests and the reefs and the cultures now on the brink of collapse? COP26 recognised that the climate emergency was essentially an economic emergency. But it stopped short of asking where the money was going to come from. The most powerful lever of social and collective action we have is taxation. A progressive taxation system can reduce social inequality and support policies that reflect our collective needs and aspirations rather than just our individual wants and desires. But not everyone is paying their fair share. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their affiliates are now responsible for one-third of global output, half of global exports, one-third of all GDP and one-quarter of all employment. But the levers that might have controlled these vast enterprises - local unions, environmental regulations, and national laws - are increasingly impotent. At the drop of a hat or an unwelcome legislative change, MNEs can threaten to move their operations elsewhere. Profit shifting, forum shopping, regulatory capture, and tax havens are in their DNA. In the words of Drahos and Braithwaite, two Australian scholars who have studied the complexities of global regulation for decades, it has become a race to the bottom. As a result, MNEs pay significantly lower taxes than other corporations - let alone the rest of us. A financial shortfall of billions of dollars ends up in the pockets of Facebook, Amazon, Exxon, Nestl&#xE9; and the rest. Earlier this year, the G7 reached an agreement to ensure MNEs pay a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent - still no more than half the average corporate figure. And this was nothing more than an in-principle agreement among seven countries (not including Australia). READ MORE: Doug Dingwall: The biggest problem with the government's climate change programs Richard Mathews: Why diplomats are worried about climate change COP26 is over. What now for the planet, Australia and Canberra? The issue is that changing how we tax highly mobile entities like MNEs is what is known as a collective action problem. The whole world has to act as one, otherwise money will simply slip through the net like water. At best, a global treaty is a long way off; at worst, it's a pipe dream. Which is where COP26 dropped the ball. At the most momentous global conference for years, it could have sheeted home responsibility for climate change not just to individual nations, but to the corporate fiefdoms whose independence from state control is akin to that of feudal lords. MNEs are responsible for around 20 per cent of global emissions. Increasingly these are produced in developing countries, which bear the brunt of the damage while reaping few of the benefits. If the conduct of MNEs poses a major challenge, environmentally and legally, to a successful climate transition, then reorganising the global tax system might be a crucial way of addressing it. Linking global taxation to the global climate emergency would make a big difference. It would place at the very top of the global agenda taxation reforms on which experts have been struggling to gain traction for years. It would justify progressive economic transformation in the context of the greatest collective action problem in world history. The influx of tax revenues could be specifically earmarked for the global costs of financing adaptation and mitigation strategies, supporting workers, communities, industries and ecosystems around the world. COP26 presented a perfect opportunity to look beyond the language of the nation-state and identify the role of MNEs in climate change. At the same time, it could have secured the financial resources that in years to come will prove the real stumbling block. Coupling the environmental responsibility of MNEs with its own economic solution - call it "mnemonics"! - would have killed two giant birds with one stone. It would have been the wake-up call we so desperately need. But, like the dog in the night-time, COP26 did not bark.

Disastrous global warming of more than 2 degrees could still be avoided if all nations honoured their Paris Agreement pledges to reduce carbon emissions, but research has found major new commitments to deep cuts will be needed to limit increases to a still-dangerous 1.5 degrees. The first study to rigorously quantify the climate impact of emissions reduction pledges made before and during the global COP26 conference in November last year concluded there was a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 1.9 or 2 degrees by the end of the century. The research is published today in the journal Nature. When scientists added up nations' climate pledges a year ago, before COP26 in Glasgow, they did not believe 2 degrees of warming was still in reach, said lead author Associate Professor Malte Meinshausen, from the University of Melbourne. But with the additional pledges, this has changed. "Is our study a good news story? Yes and no," Meinshausen said. "Yes, because for the first time we can possibly keep warming below the symbolic 2 degrees with the promises on the table." The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming is stark, climate scientists say. REPORT Page 1 \</doc>

ABSTRACT After two weeks of intense climate negotiations, here's where progress was made - and where negotiations fell short. FULL TEXT The latest United Nations climate summit, or COP26 , officially concluded Saturday, bringing an end to two long weeks of gruelling negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, among almost 200 countries. Deliberations HYPERLINK dragged on a day later than scheduled, and the final deal that was struck -- the HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/glasgow-climate-pact-full-text-cop26/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5 Glasgow Climate Pact So, what came out of Glasgow, really? Scientists and many policymakers stress that action on climate change now is urgently needed, especially as the dire impacts of warming have thrown entire countries into disarray. Just this summer, HYPERLINK https://www.npr.org/2021/08/03/1024205144/china-flooding-higher-death-toll heavy flooding ravaged central China, killing more than 300 people; across the western US, a searing heatwave HYPERLINK https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/12/american-west-heatwave-drought-climate-change/ strained power grids HYPERLINK unprecedented levels of warming This is a "defining decade," said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "If we don't have large success this decade in bending the carbon curve ... we will be producing an earth that looks very different in a few decades from now." As with previous climate confabs, the reviews of COP26 's achievements are mixed. While US climate envoy John Kerry declared that the world was now the closest it had ever been to "avoiding climate chaos," others have been less optimistic, with activist Greta Thunberg criticizing its promises as " HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions blah, blah, blah ." Foreign Policy looked into where progress was made -- and where negotiations fell short. More action is needed to keep temperatures from rising much further Experts have long agreed that it's crucial for levels of warming to stay below the HYPERLINK pivotal threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a key objective of the HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/14/climate-deal-reaction-cop26-world/ 2015 Paris Agreement In Glasgow, some countries did make strides in this direction. More than 100 countries agreed to slash their https://www.politico.eu/article/cop26-100-countries-reducing-methane-emissions/ methane emissions by 30%, relative to output in 2020 -- and that matters because methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas. Another 100-plus nations -- holding more than HYPERLINK https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/world/cop26-climate-deforestation-deal-intl/index.html 85% of the world's forests https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/15/cop26-climate-change-un-conference-takeaways/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921#:~:text=pledged%20to%20reach-,net-zero%20emissions,-by%202070%2C%20meaning net-zero emissions by 2070, meaning that it will no longer add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by that point. But the final pact failed to outline a HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-un-agreement-analysis-idAFKBN2HZ0EY clear pathway to stop the world from breaching the 1.5 degree mark -- or adequately answer how countries HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/climate/cop26-glasgow-climate-agreement.html?name=styln-cop26&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Interactive&variant=show&is_new=false must share the responsibility of curbing emissions. "Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread," U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in a video address. "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. It is time to go into emergency mode." According to the HYPERLINK Climate Action Tracker HYPERLINK next year with greater cuts and new targets, accelerating, in theory, their efforts to bend the curve. Fossil fuels were singled out -- but coal is still king COP26 produced the HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59277788 first-ever international climate pact to explicitly reference HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/13/cop26-countries-strike-climate-deal-at-un-summit-to-limit-heating.html fossil fuels , one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions, or to broach limits on the use of coal. Widely regarded as the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal is estimated to be responsible for almost HYPERLINK https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/26/coal-mining-electricity-climate-change/ one-third of warming But any excitement was quickly dampened after language in the final agreement was watered down in the eleventh hour. In an extremely last-minute change, India, backed by China, insisted on a final tweak, agreeing only to "phase-down," not "phase-out," coal use. Earlier in the summit, language in initial commitments to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels was also HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/five-big-takeaways-cop26/ modified to specify "unabated" coal and "inefficient" subsidies. National pledges are voluntary, with no enforcement mechanisms, making the last-minute change especially disappointing, Swain said. Before, "even if it was very strong language, it's still going to be voluntary language," Swain said. "But now it's also relatively weak and voluntary." The push was widely met with dismay. COP26 President Alok Sharma apologized for the change, while Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga expressed her "profound disappointment" in the tweak. "This will not bring us closer to 1.5 but make it more difficult to reach it," she said. But as in any big climate summit gathering all the world's nations together, the lowest common denominator sets the bar. "If we hadn't done that, we wouldn't have had an agreement," Kerry said afterwards. A surprising show of US-China climate cooperation HYPERLINK work together to curb emissions and limit warming over the next decade, after Beijing previously insisted that any sort of HYPERLINK https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/03/us-china-climate-change-kerry-cooperation-competition/ climate cooperation COP26 , analysts questioned whether cooperation or competition between the US and China would spur the most action on climate. The move was significant, although the joint HYPERLINK announcement was vague and neglected to include important, or almost any, details. China and the US are the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, jointly accounting for an HYPERLINK https://www.npr.org/2021/11/11/1054648598/u-s-and-china-announce-surprise-climate-agreement-at-cop26-summit estimated 40% of global annual carbon output. China is the HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57018837 world's top emitter The disparity between rich and poor nations is clearer than ever COP26 highlighted the stark divide between rich and poor nations, both in terms of who bears the brunt of the climate crisis -- and what their responses could feasibly look like. Many developing countries, such as India, still rely on coal-fired power, even as the US and Europe -- responsible for the bulk of historical emissions -- urge a rapid shift to cleaner fuels. At COP26 , one key issue was HYPERLINK funding . More than a decade ago, at the U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen, wealthy countries pledged to give poorer nations $100 billion per year by 2020 to support climate adaptation efforts. But this target was never met. At Glasgow, HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/14/climate-deal-reaction-cop26-world/ donors promised to meet their original $100 billion promise -- by 2023. There was also the question of compensation. Although the global south is responsible for just 10% of cumulative global emissions, it is often on the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/ohrlls/news/frontline-climate-crisis-worlds-most-vulnerable-nations-suffer-disproportionately front lines of the climate crisis HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/12/cop26-climate-deal-negotiations/ said Tuvalu's climate minister HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-un-agreement-analysis-idAFKBN2HZ0EY loss and damage " at Glasgow -- but to no avail. After forceful resistance from the US and European Union, the final pact did not include funding to compensate developing countries for the losses they are already incurring and that they will continue to incur. Ultimately, whether COP26 is, as Kerry said, the closest the world has come to progress or whether it's just another lost year remains to be seen. Combating climate change hinges on whether world leaders stick to their promises, especially when there are HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/climate/cop26-glasgow-climate-agreement.html?name=styln-cop26&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Interactive&variant=show&is_new=false no formal mechanisms in place COP26 "moved the needle in the right direction but only by a very small increment," Swain said.

London | The 197 countries gathered at COP26 backed a "Glasgow Climate Pact" late on Saturday (Sunday AEDT), shelving difficult, emotive talks on cash for climate-related damage until next year, and swallowing a last-minute push by India and China to dilute a pledge on phasing out coal. COP26 host Britain held the line on much of its ambitious text, as it tried to kill off coal, rev up funding for developing countries to tackle climate change, and get countries to scale up their emissions-cutting targets on a yearly basis. But India and China ambushed the final hours of the conference on Saturday evening to shift the pledge on coal from a "phase-out" to a "phase-down", prompting dismay from other countries - although they allowed the change to stand so that the overall pact could go through. Britain's COP26 US climate envoy John Kerry urged the 197 countries in the room: "You can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good." Green groups were encouraged that coal had become such a target at this COP26 , but still said the conference had not done enough to keep global warming below a potentially catastrophic 1.5 degrees, down from a projected 2.7 degrees under pre-Glasgow policy settings. "It's meek, it's weak and the 1.5-degree goal is only just alive," said Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan. "Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5-degree and that didn't happen, but in 2022 nations will now have to come back with stronger targets." From coal \' phase-out' to \' phase-down' India's Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav, said Western countries had grown rich on fossil fuels, so allowing developing countries to continue using them represented "climate justice". In the plenary's final wrap-up session, China and India successfully shifted the wording from a "phase-out" of coal to a "phase-down", which other climate envoys described as "a bitter pill to swallow" and an "immense disappointment". Mr Sharma was forced to apologise to the conference for having allowed India and China to smuggle in the last-minute change, with the connivance of the US and EU, but apparently to the surprise of many other envoys. Australia's climate ambassador, Jamie Isbister, said the Morrison government was ready to accept the third draft of the COP26 agreement, presented on Saturday morning in Glasgow - even before the "phase-down" amendment was introduced. Australia also accepted a reference to countries being required to next year produce scaled-up 2030 emissions-cut targets, which Saudi Arabia had successfully watered down from an "urging" to a "request". That was weaker than Britain wanted, but potentially enough to exert moral suasion on reluctant countries. Australian campaign groups said that would put pressure on Australia to raise its 2030 target in time for COP27 next November. Funding truce Mr Isbister also said Australia supported vulnerable countries' demand for a greater focus on getting help to meet loss and damage from climate change, which now looks set to become a major focus of next year's COP in Egypt. "Loss and damage was a high-profile issue at this COP, but the dialogues called for over the next few years provide no assurance that the vulnerable countries and communities facing devastating climate impacts will get the help they need," said Alden Meyer, of the environmental think tank E3G. "The US, EU and other developed countries will need to come to these dialogues prepared to put real solutions on the table." Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege described the potential support for vulnerable countries as "a step". "It does not have everything that everyone wants, but it has important elements that do serve the planet," she said. "It's not perfect, it is not without fault, we have much work to do. But it does represent real progress. We cannot afford to give up on the promise this package offers us." Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg said COP26 was a failure. "Beware of a tsunami of greenwashing and media spin to somehow frame the outcome as \' good', \' progress', \' hopeful' or \' a step in the right direction'," she tweeted. Now as # COP26 is coming to an end, beware of a tsunami of greenwashing and media spin to somehow frame the outcome as "good", "progress", "hopeful" or "a step in the right direction".  Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) November 13, 2021 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres gave qualified backing to Thunberg, saying COP26 had made "important steps" that were nonetheless insufficient to tackle the threat. "The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today," he said. "They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions." Other green groups were taking wins where they could find them. Britain held the line on text describing global warming as a source of "alarm and utmost concern", which some countries had sought to excise. The document also instils a greater sense of urgency and purpose into adaptation, which has been an often-ignored "pillar" of the COP tripod of mitigation, adaptation and finance. "Pledges made at COP26 still leave the world on track for over 2 degrees of warming, and so success depends on these commitments and actions being rapidly scaled up in the wake of Glasgow," said Simon Bradshaw, head of research at Australia's Climate Council. COP26 has settled the outstanding Paris Agreement wrangle over how to set up a market for governments to trade carbon offsets or credits with each other, known as Article 6.2. Initial analysis from green groups suggested that the deal on carbon trading had not guaranteed the system would have total integrity. "The agreement closes down some of the outrageous loopholes that had been considered, but the language remains unclear in some areas, and we have much to do to stop companies and countries gaming the system," said Rachel Kyte, dean of Tufts Fletcher School in Massachusetts. \</doc>

CANBERRA, ACT, Oct. 28 -- The Prime Minister of Australia issued the following media release: I will travel to Rome for the G20 Leaders' Summit on 30-31 October and to Glasgow for the World Leaders' Summit at COP26 on 1-2 November. I will be accompanied by the Hon Angus Taylor MP, Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction. These important international meetings come as the world has reached a critical point in our health response and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and our collective effort to address the challenges of climate change. In Rome, G20 leaders will discuss action to ensure equitable access to safe and effective vaccines and to strengthen global health governance to prevent future pandemics. We will also discuss how to achieve a sustainable and resilient recovery, including advancing the G20 agenda on debt sustainability, high quality infrastructure investment, gender equality, and women's workforce participation. The G20 also has a key role in ensuring we can fully harness the benefits of increased digitalisation during the recovery. I look forward to raising how we can enhance confidence in the digital environment, including by ensuring it is safe and secure for users. COP26 will be crucial in the global effort to address the challenges of climate change. I look forward to supporting Prime Minister Johnson, as host of COP26 , to achieve our Paris Agreement objectives and collaborate to collectively deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, I will use this opportunity to meet bilaterally with key partners. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce will be Acting Prime Minister during the period of October 28 to November 4.

THE second week of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow will begin with an Australian bushfire survivor telling of her ordeal to the world's media. She'll be joined by Hannah Parris, an Australian living in the UK whose parents' house burnt down in the fires, as well as community representatives from California and British Columbia - two US regions that experienced horrendous wildfire seasons in 2021. On June 29, five different locations in Canada broke a national temperature record that had stood since 1937, with Lytton, northeast of Vancouver, hitting 49.6C - smashing the previous record by more than 4.5C. It also revealed that an average of 480 Australians die each year just from the smoke pollution they caused. COP26 's second week will turn to negotiations over emissions reporting and international trade in carbon credits. Delegates will debate a proposal from the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) - a groups of nations from the Pacific, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America - that all countries will need to revise and strengthen their climate action plans every year until 2025. Under the Paris Agreement, nations agreed to every five years. COP26 negotiators will also this week attempt to thrash out the so-called Article 6 - the rules governing the international trade in carbon credits. Currently, some nations sell carbon credits to other countries but count those same cuts towards their own emissions tallies - a "double- counting" loophole. The issue of Kyoto carry-over credits may also be discussed this week, Dr Simon Bradshaw from the Climate Council said. Dr Bradshaw said Australia was "universally panned" at COP25 for insisting on counting its Kyoto units in its emissions reductions. He said it would "come under fire" if it tried to stall the question of Kyoto carry-over" \</doc>

The 26th United Nations climate change conference, COP26 , recently came to an end, having aimed to get countries united in the fight against climate change. Climate change issues are likely to hit African countries the hardest though the continent is the least responsible for driving climate change. We asked Mouhamadou Bamba Sylla the AIMS-Canada Research Chair in Climate Change Science at AIMS-Rwanda, who is a lead author to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 for Working Group 1, what the conference meant for African countries. What was the agenda that African countries took to COP26 ? According to the HYPERLINK https://africangroupofnegotiators.org/ African Group of Negotiators Climate responsibility: Developed nations have to take their responsibilities and lead the way to reaching zero net emissions by 2050. Climate finance and adaptation: Developed nations have to mobilise enough funds to finance adaptation in developing countries that are adversely affected by climate change. Finance architecture and transparency mechanisms should be put in place. Transfer of technologies and capacity building: Developed nations must transfer sound environmental technologies to African countries for effective climate adaptation, mitigation and transition. Which of their agenda items did they get through? It's hard to say. There were a lot of announcements. For example many nations agreed to "phase down" fossil fuels in general. These are just promises and they will remain so unless they are included in their https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs Nationally Determined Contributions COP26 . We are very far from net-zero emissions, which is a carbon neutral world, by 2050. The recently released HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ IPCC working group 1 report Therefore, the level of commitments made at COP26 is a total failure. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310475 Glasgow climate pact Developed countries refuse to take any historical responsibility for the cost of losses and damages from the impacts of climate change, such as hurricanes and sea level rise. Therefore, the financial outcome of COP26 is a glass half full, but it's not far from a failure. Whose agenda did African countries come back with? It's hard to determine, as there were a lot of compromises. But they certainly did not come back with their own agenda fulfilled. Many obstacles due to the high costs, the pandemic, the travel restrictions and other logistical challenges meant that African voices were marginalised. How much damage or good will somebody else's agenda cause to African countries? A lot of damage. Africa is home for most of the least developed countries. These countries are not well equipped in terms of funds and infrastructure to face the adverse impacts of climate change. The recently HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/ released IPCC report The report also states that every fraction of degree matters as it leads to discernible changes in these hazards. Right now after Glasgow, the HYPERLINK best estimate is that the world is on course to reach 2.4?C of global warming. This is very far from 1.5?C. Africa needs to raise its voice in such a way it will be put at the centre of the negotiation process. Is there room for improvement and where? The contributions and national commitments at COP26 are purely voluntary. The agreement is not binding. There are a lot of improvements to make if COP wants a stronger agreement. Africa needs more coordination and more science. I think the African Union commission and other continental political bodies have to be more involved in the process. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The continent also needs to fund climate change science. For example, it's hard to tell what would be the impact of 1.5?C, 2?C, 3?C, 4?C of global warming on sectors such as energy, water resources, agriculture, infrastructure and health. How these sectors are going to respond to these global warming levels is yet to be understood.

\~\~Australia remains stuck in a polluting past while other nations rise to the challenge posed by rising temperatures, according to climate action campaigners analysing the outcome of Glasgow's UN summit. \~\~ COP26 \~\~ Dr Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Climate Council, says 140 countries lifted their game at COP26 but Australia wasn't one of them. \~\~ Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier told the conference Australia would stick to its six-year-old pledge to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, noting a 35 per cent drop is expected by then. \~\~ "The federal government showed up empty-handed to a pivotal moment in the fight for our future," Dr Bradshaw said on Sunday. \~\~ "As our allies and trading partners rise to the climate challenge, we?re stuck in a polluting past with a handful of countries including Russia and Saudi Arabia." \~\~ The UN agreement has called on all countries to return to the negotiation table in 2022 to set stronger 2030 targets. \~\~ "The government?s own net zero modelling, released two days ago, predicts Australia will still be a major coal and gas exporter in 2050," Dr Bradshaw said. \~\~ "It?s time to slash carbon pollution this decade, as if our futures depended on it - because they do." \~\~ Federal cabinet minister Greg Hunt has refused to be drawn on whether the government, which has committed to a net zero by 2050 goal, would update its 2030 target. \~\~ Neville Nicholls, professor at Monash University's School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment, said COP26 talks showed the world is serious about dealing with climate change. \~\~ "This has left Australia in a challenging position," he said. \~\~ "We are vulnerable to climate change, dependent on fossil fuels, seen as recalcitrant by the rest of the world. \~\~ Chief executive of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, Kylie Walker, said the federal government needs to invest in existing mature low-carbon technology \~\~\~\~"It?s time for a credible and robust plan which maximises Australia?s global leadership position in ... technologies like solar, wind and energy storage (batteries and pumped hydro), combined with electrification of transport and sustainably designed buildings." \~\~ Wording of the COP26 agreement around the use of coal power was changed at the last minute at the insistence of India, with "phase out" replaced with "phase down". \~\~ Greenpeace Australia Pacific chief executive David Ritter said while the final agreement was far from perfect, momentum was in the "right direction". \</doc>

After a massive two weeks of discussions and negotiations, the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow wrapped up earlier this month. There was a huge build up to the event, with Prince Charles calling it "the last chance saloon" for climate action, and Boris Johnson saying "if Glasgow fails, the Paris Agreement fails". I was fortunate enough to represent the alternative government - and the Hunter region - at COP26 . In my opinion, the conference had elements of the good, bad, and ugly. pat conroy The good news was that 140 nations increased their 2030 emissions reduction commitments. If these are implemented, global warming would be kept to about 1.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The bad news is that under Mr Morrison, Australia was the only developed country not to increase its 2030 commitment. Despite this being the main goal of COP26 , Scott Morrison ruled out doing that before the conference even began. Which brings me to the ugly. The Prime Minister's inaction has not only exposed the Liberal-National government as climate laggards, it is having real-world economic consequences in our region. Australia now faces the risk of carbon border tariffs for our minerals, farm and manufactured exports, including from the Hunter. This will make our exports more expensive and hence less competitive against other nations. This means less exports and less jobs. COP26 made it clear that the Hunter region needs a Federal Government with a real plan to develop new industries as the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Coal exports are a major source of economic opportunity and jobs in our region and will remain so for decades to come. However, COP26 saw over 190 countries and organisations pledging to phase out coal-fired power generation. This will have significant impacts on demand for thermal coal, which dominates Hunter coal production. With 80 per cent of global GDP decarbonising, it is a shift being driven by the boardrooms of Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul and in Japan, South Korea and India, not by decisions in Canberra. While Mr Morrison likes to brag about his 'don't-do government' it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that regions like ours are not hung out to dry as the global economy changes. We need a government with a clear plan to drive investment in the new industries that can provide thousands of well-paid, secure new jobs in the Hunter. Our region has the skills, the talent, the trained workforce, the transport links and the infrastructure to build entire new industries like hydrogen, green steel, green ammonia and battery manufacturing. We have done it before after the shutdown of local steelmaking two decades ago. And we can do it again, but we desperately need a federal government with the plans, the policies, the funding and the commitment to our region to make it happen. Scott Morrison treats the Hunter as a backdrop for his latest fly-in, fly-out fluorovested photo opportunity. Those of us who live and work here know his marketing slogans, political rhetoric, and broken promises won't build a strong future for our region. I am proud to represent a coal mining region in the Australian Parliament. I am grateful for the sacrifices coal miners have made and the wealth their hard work has provided and continues to provide for our region and the nation. They deserve better than a Prime Minister who treats them as pawns in his political games. The key question for the Hunter is not whether this change is coming. The question is what will the federal government do to support the regions that have powered our country for generations, and build the new industries that will ensure future prosperity for the Hunter? The Morrison-Joyce government can't be trusted to manage economic change they deny will happen. If Mr Morrison really cared about coal miners he would do three things: be honest with them about what is coming; develop a real plan for our region; and ensure coal mining jobs in the meantime are good paying and secure tackling the scourge of labour hire and sham casuals. Under Anthony Albanese and Labor's $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund and $20 billion Rewiring the Nation plan, the Hunter has a strong future as the world moves to tackle climate change. COP26 proved to me we desperately need a new government in Canberra to ensure the Hunter grows and thrives as the world moves to a low-carbon future.

COP26 Around 30,000 attendees to the United Nation's Conference of the Parties world leaders' climate summit for a fortnight of talks from Sunday, October 31 face an expensive and logistic nightmare. Glaswegians are moving out of the city to rent their apartments for more than \£31500 ($2800) a night to well-heeled government representatives. Most of the 120 world leaders and their entourages attending have found rooms in Glasgow or Edinburgh, although there are reports some delegations are staying nearly 150km away. But everyone else has been scrambling. Glasgow has had the house-full sign out for more than a year and for months Edinburgh has also been full, with the only rooms available in that city - a 45 minute train commute - around $600 a night. But climate activists and others on more modest budgets, have been securing rooms in towns a 100 kilometres away, relying on train and bus transport to attend official events. However, those plans have been thrown into disarray after the RMT union, which represents train drivers at ScotRail, have voted 86 per cent for strike action during COP26 over pay and conditions. Garbage collectors are also preparing a strike during the COP26 fortnight, which could leave the city, controlled by the Scottish Nationalists, looking like a rubbish dump. The Labour politician Neil Bibby told the Daily Record the situation facing COP26 was an embarrassment. " COP26 is falling into sheer chaos as the SNP's industrial relations collapse,'' he said. "It is an embarrassment to Scotland that the SNP can't even keep the trains running when the world's eyes are upon us. "This conference is supposed to be about preventing environmental catastrophe - and the SNP are setting the stage by letting trains grind to a halt and litter fill the streets. "Rail workers were on the front line right through the pandemic and the way they have been treated in return is disgraceful. "The SNP must intervene to deliver a fair pay deal before their contempt for workers brings COP26 to its knees." Glasgow residents have been bracing for transport gridlock for months, as officials begin to close off major arterial roads, pedestrian routes and bicycle lanes all around the city this week. Major tourist attractions in the city are also closing. But organisers are concerned that the traffic situation will become utterly unworkable if the many thousands of delegates staying in Edinburgh cannot arrive by train. One collective called The Human Hotel network has set up a home stay, couch-surfing style web site for activists to source a cheap bed during the summit. While they have helped find beds for around 700 people, they say another 3000 people are still trying to find rooms. \</doc>

COP26 in Glasgow has been spun into something it could never be. Prince Charles called it "the last chance saloon" for climate action, while Boris Johnson declared: "If Glasgow fails, the Paris Agreement fails." The UN Secretary-General, US President Joe Biden and a host of other world leaders sang from a similar hymn sheet. Part of this hype is the UK, as host, pressing for success. But COP26 has undeniably added import as it marks the effective beginning of the Paris Agreement as the new framework for global climate action. It also occurs in the context of mounting evidence for urgent climate action this decade, and growing expectations worldwide for serious climate ambition. As hard as Britain and others have tried to confect a new "deal" in the offing at COP26 that secures commitments from countries to steer the world on a path to reach the 1.5 degree temperature goal that will ensure we avoid the worst impacts of climate change, such an outcome was never really in prospect. Blind Freddy could see that wishing and willing an end to coal use by 2030 was not achievable, certainly not without heroic diplomatic and financial efforts. The problem with over-hyping is you set yourself up to fail. As leaders and ministers have departed, there is a narrative of disappointment emerging from Glasgow. Unfortunately, this undercuts what has been achieved and undermines the historic Paris Agreement, just as it begins in earnest. The 2015 Paris deal compelled countries to progressively ratchet up their climate action and ambition, with reviews every five years. To kick-start the agreement, in 2020 (pushed back to this year because of COVID-19) parties agreed to see whether they could put more ambition on the table than what they committed to in 2015. They did not agree to come back five years later with commitments at a scale that would have everything done and dusted in year one of the agreement. The significance of Paris is that action will beget further ambition over time as learning, co-operation and confidence grows. In this context, the results leading up to and at COP26 are remarkable and were, frankly, unimaginable even three years ago as I was leading Paris Agreement negotiations for Australia. More than 120 countries have now committed to net zero emissions by 2050 with many setting ambitious targets for 2030. The International Energy Agency has just estimated the additional commitments for COP26 - including the agreement on methane reductions by 2030 - put the world on track for a 1.8 degree temperature rise. While not 1.5 degrees, the achievement needs to be celebrated. Without COP26 With this threshold crossed, the Prime Minister - to his credit - has ended the major domestic climate wars and created the pathway for further and earlier ambition and stronger policies. I am confident we will see more conspicuous action sooner - witness the new EV policy - than many think, and certainly over this critical decade. Without COP26 Equally remarkable at this COP is the growing commitment by business. The standout announcement is the commitment by more than 220 asset managers - representing $130 trillion under management - to align their investments with net zero by 2050. This world of opportunity will drive climate action, which again is something to celebrate. Furthermore, the $100 billion climate finance commitment from developed countries to developing countries in support of their climate action and ambition will likely be fulfilled at Glasgow. This is a big deal for developing countries and will further spur their commitment to the Paris Agreement. Far from failing, Glasgow has given life to the Paris Agreement. Without losing sight of the need to turn words into deeds and to keep striving for more and sooner global action given the urgency of the climate challenge, this should fill us with hope.

Australia, Nov. 14 -- Minister for Foreign Affairs & Minister for Women Marise Payne issued the following media release: The Morrison Government welcomes the finalisation of the Paris Rulebook at COP26 in Glasgow. The Morrison Government will always stand up for and make decisions in Australia's national interest, and we will do what's right for rural and regional communities. Australia's economy is almost unique amongst developed countries, with an economy specialised in the production of energy- and emissions-intensive commodities. We are the world's fourth largest energy exporter, after Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Since 2005, we have reduced emissions faster than any other major commodity exporting nation in the world. Our emissions are now more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels and have fallen faster than many similar developed countries, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, and faster than the OECD average. Ahead of and during COP26 , Australia worked closely with our Pacific family to raise the important role of our oceans in addressing the impacts of climate change, to secure outcomes on climate financing and support for building climate resilience, particularly for vulnerable countries in our Pacific region, and to ensure they have access to low emissions technologies to support their development and future prosperity. At COP26 Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets. The Government particularly welcomes outcomes on international carbon markets (Article 6) and a standardised transparency framework, which was a major focus for Australia. Transparency is the key to accountability and to translating ambition into achievement. This goes to the heart of the Paris Agreement, which relies on all countries delivering on their commitments to achieve a global net zero outcome. Australia's emissions reporting and transparency is the gold standard and we expect all major emitters to display similar levels of transparency. Through the $104 million Indo-Pacific Carbon Offsets Scheme, we are working with our regional partners to build the capability of their emissions accounting and reporting capabilities. Strong transparency and integrity standards are vital to ensuring carbon markets deliver real and verifiable emissions reductions. Australia has doubled its climate finance commitment to $2 billion over the next five years. More than 70 per cent of our support is focused on climate resilience and adaptation. At COP26 Australia joined the Glasgow Breakthroughs Initiative, which sets global goals to make clean technologies the most affordable and accessible option before 2030. This initiative is a strong international endorsement of our practical, technology-led approach. A focus on reducing the cost of low emissions technologies to parity with existing approaches is the only way to make net zero practically achievable for all countries. To that end, the Australian Government will invest more than $21 billion in the next generation of low emissions technologies, to drive up to $120 billion of total public and private investment in Australia by 2030. Under our Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we will act in a practical, responsible way to reduce emissions and build on our track record of achievement - reducing emissions while growing our economy, maintaining affordable, reliable energy and ensuring our regions remain strong. That's the Australian way.

As the COP26 climate talks wind up in Glasgow, Australia has again proved itself a climate laggard on the world stage. Prime Minister Scott Morrison might be a marketing supremo, but he can't spin his way out of his government's failures.

This was also the message he took to the world stage at COP26 , where he described his policy of " HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/scott-morrison-is-hiding-behind-future-technologies-when-we-should-just-deploy-what-already-exists-169016 technology not taxes Most countries have a HYPERLINK https://climatalk.org/2021/03/27/what-are-the-cop-pavilions pavilion at the climate negotiations, where they host events and showcase their efforts to negotiators and observers.

Aside from the Trump administration, since 2018 Australia is also the only developed country to refuse to channel its climate finance through the multilateral Green Climate Fund. According to HYPERLINK https://donortracker.org/australia/climate Donor Tracker , in recent years, Australia's climate-related aid has had "cross-cutting objectives" and none of it went to projects that address climate change as a "principal goal". 'Aiming low' The annual climate COPs are, among other things, a global "show and tell". The problem for Australia is that it had nothing to show, and no amount of telling can cover this lack. As Lord John Deben, the UK's chief climate advisor HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-08/scott-morrison-cop26-doesnt-understand-urgency-climate-change/100602228 told the ABC this week, "it was just a whole series of words", with no understanding of "the urgency of what we have to do". Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama tried a different tactic. At COP26 , after urging Morrison to halve Australia's emissions by 2030, https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/cop26-fiji-calls-on-australia-to-halve-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030/news-story/202085f8ffef4cb8a17f5f8fca457717 he handed him a copy of Fiji's Climate Change Act "as a guide - it is our uniquely Fijian way of following the science to keep faith with future generations". The rise of " HYPERLINK https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/scorecard-diplomacy/5642AECAAC1546FB17BBDA3CFC94FAE9 scorecard diplomacy Key examples include HYPERLINK Climate Action Tracker HYPERLINK https://ccpi.org Climate Performance Index COP26 this week. The " HYPERLINK https://climatenetwork.org/resource_type/fossil-of-the-day/ Fossil of the Day " awards go to those parties "doing the most to achieve the least" at the annual climate negotiations. Organised by Climate Action Network International, made up of over 1,500 environmental groups from around 140 countries, they are a talking point among negotiators. So far at COP26 , Australia has won five fossil awards, more than any other country. This includes the HYPERLINK https://climatenetwork.org/resource/fossil-of-the-day-for-monday-1-november-2021/ award for "aiming low" on the first day of COP26 . Flying in the face of Paris The Morrison government's stubbornness on its 2030 target flies in the face of not only the goals and rules but also the HYPERLINK https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/fairness-equity-and-justice-in-the-paris-agreement-terms-and-operationalization-of-differentiation/4AD4C512175ECFC80F14083BDAB4CA1A core equity principles These principles require developed countries to take the lead in climate mitigation in line with their greater historical responsibility and economic capabilities. They are also required to mobilise climate finance to support to mitigation and adaptation in countries with minimal responsibility for emissions, high vulnerability and weak capacity. The Morrison government lives in a parallel universe to the Paris Agreement in its defence of the "Australian way". This signalling can only mean one of two things. The first is that the rest of the world, including poor countries, must compensate by carrying most of Australia's burden if we are to hold warming to the necessary 1.5? this century. The second is that the government has no interest in " HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/dead-or-alive-cop26-climate-talks-strive-save-15c-warming-goal-2021-11-09/ keeping 1.5? alive ," on the assumption Australia can adapt to a hotter world and never mind the enormous suffering elsewhere. Commitments and performance (not branding) In international climate politics, a country's reputation is determined by the credibility of commitments and performance over time in relation to the collective goals, principles and rules negotiated by the parties. It is not a brand or image that can be created in Canberra and then marketed to the world like Vegemite. Australia's COP26 diplomacy is damaging its reputation further. There is rising anger from developing countries, which constitute the majority of world's states. There is also deep anxiety in our regions, among Pacific nations, where Australia is an increasingly awkward partner. Tuvalu's foreign minister Simon Kofe filmed his HYPERLINK COP26 speech standing thigh-deep in the ocean.

COP26 , which is taking place in Glasgow, is the latest in a series of meetings through which the world's governments attempt to deal with climate change. COP stands for "Conference of the Parties": these 197 parties are the United Nations member countries, plus a few small non-UN member countries and the European Union, all of whom support the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This was set up in 1992 to organise a global response to what most people then called the "greenhouse effect". It's COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting. The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP in 2020 due to COVID-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement agreed to "limit global warming to well below 2?, preferably to 1.5?, compared to pre-industrial levels". It's possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognised a HYPERLINK https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide close relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature. In order to achieve the target of "well below 2?, preferably 1.5?" the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement committed to "reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century". The main task for COP26 is to follow through on this commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5? as possible. As you can imagine, getting 197 different countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn't exactly straightforward: after all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden's election. So there is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be. The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: these are individual countries' climate action plans. For example, the UK's HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfccc most recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren't enough to meet the 1.5? target of the Paris agreement. If you combine all the current plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4? by the year 2100 and if you look at actual emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/ of 2.9? by 2100. So there is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries actually cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide https://theconversation.com/wheres-the-money-climate-fight-podcast-part-1-transcript-169287 financial support to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn't been fully acted on yet. Why this matters COP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement's 1.5? target: if emissions don't fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Current emissions need to be HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ halved by 2030 to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5?. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether. The Paris Agreement matters because a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/what-will-the-world-actually-look-like-at-1-5-c-of-warming-68763 1.5? world is safer than a 2? world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times higher at 2? compared to 1.5?. The reduction in maize harvests in the tropical regions is over twice as great at 2? and HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15c-and-2c-warming coral reefs would be largely eliminated .

In the wake of the United Nations-sponsored Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) - now you know what it stands for - in Glasgow it is time to air some thoughtful disagreement again. Today, the discussion revolves around environmental, social, and governance, green energy, decarbonisation and fossil fuels. You may ask, 'why go there'? Because I sniff an opportunity. While coal is seen as the demon, other fossil fuels including crude oil and liquefied natural gas are also in the sights of those actively demanding net zero emissions targets. I am no expert, but then again neither were most of the negotiators at COP26 . Their backgrounds are mostly political and very few would have had any experience in running a commercial business. The costs associated with attaining zero emissions targets for CO2, which is less than 0.05 per cent of the Earth's atmosphere, will be too large to be absorbed by companies. They will be passed on to consumers one way or another and become deeply embedded into operating cost structures with longer-term inflationary implications. Shareholders will also share some of the burden. Investors are abandoning the fossil fuel energy sector, spurred on by climate change euphoria and the urge to participate in the flavour of the month - ESG investment and "green" energy. All the while they are being egged on by the opportunistic exchange-traded fund industry. Oil and gas and thermal coal stocks have endured consistent and persistent selling for months, which will ultimately dry up when portfolios are rebalanced. When all those not wishing to invest in the sector have achieved their goal, the opportunity will present. Today's situation reminds me of what happened to the tobacco industry some 30 to 40 years ago. In the post anti-tobacco campaign era, Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, was founded in Virginia in the US in 1985 and was one of the most successful stocks listed in the US over the next 30 years. It spun off the successful Philip Morris International business in 2008. The tobacco industry was in decline in the mid-1980s but had been so for the previous 20 years. Statistics reveal US cigarette consumption peaked in 1981 at 640 billion and by 2007 had declined to 360 billion. Because tobacco companies cannot advertise, and innovation is not necessary, they avoid meaningful associated costs. Where would Apple be if it did not advertise or, more importantly, innovate? Apple needs to reinvent its products every few years. Can it continue to do so for the next 20 years at the past rate? Currently, the market thinks so. The disdain for fossil fuels is anti-tobacco revisited. Pension funds and other large investors abandoned tobacco stocks en masse and lighting up did become less popular. But smoking continues, tobacco companies are profitable and long-term total returns have been well above average. Many investors are repeating that earlier behaviour with fossil fuel stocks. Oil, natural gas and LNG along with thermal coal will still be in demand in 2050, albeit in lesser volumes, just like tobacco. Just as was the case with tobacco, no advertising or innovation is required to market fossil fuels. They are what they are. Remember, total return has two components, capital and income and the percentages from each can vary over time. -----QUOTE---- I am no expert, but then again neither were most of the negotiators at COP26 . \</doc>

The British Labour Party has called for the UK-Australia free trade deal to be tied to tighter environmental standards, accusing Boris Johnson of "providing cover" to coal-reliant nations at the COP26 conference. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the House of Commons overnight (AEDT) that Mr Johnson's "guileless boosterism" had enabled major emitters to "gut the main deal wording on coal", leaving the UK with little chance of exerting influence to secure better environmental outcomes. "The prime minister praised inadequate net zero plans. Australia was called heroic, even though their plan was so slow that it was in line with 4 degrees of global warming," Mr Starmer said. "With no public pressure, the big emitters were emboldened and they clubbed together to gut the main deal's wording on coal. Only someone who thinks words are meaningless could now argue that an agreement to phase down coal is the same as an agreement to phase it out.'' Shadow trade minister Bill Esterson referred to the UK-Australia trade deal - which has been agreed but is yet to be formally signed - by tweeting: "Will Boris Johnson correct the mistake of a trade deal with Australia which drops the commitment to a maximum temperature of 1.5 degrees?" In negotiations over the free trade deal, the UK had initially sought to link the trade with carbon emission plans, but those provisions were removed after push-back from Australia. In the Commons, Labour MP Darren Jones - who chairs the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial strategy committee - raised the same issue, asking Mr Johnson would revisit the free trade deal to pressure Australia on emissions reductions. But Mr Johnson said Australia had made its first ever commitment to net zero and that COP26 was a considerable success. Last weekend, Australia signed the COP26 main statement, called the Glasgow Climate Pact, to phase down coal and return to the next COP27 in Egypt in 12 months' time with another plan to reduce emissions in this decade. Australian ministers hailed the wording of "phasing out" coal to mean that no Australian mines would close and that coal would remain a key export for years to come. Energy Minister Angus Taylor also said he would not update the target to reduce emissions by more than 26-28 per cent, even though Australia was on track to exceed it up to 35 per cent. "We have set our target, we don't reset our targets," Mr Taylor said. European energy think tank E3G told the Foreign Press Association on Monday that Australia was heading into an economic cul-de-sac with its current pro-coal plans. \</doc>

Few climate conference delegates travel by private jet these days, as Bill Gates did in 2015. Yet big environmental meetings usually have big carbon footprints. The United Nations' COP26 , which started in Glasgow on Sunday, will be no exception. In the past three UN climate conferences, emissions from long-distance travel averaged 85 per cent of the total. Inevitably, travelling back and forth to the venue also creates emissions. Some of the 30,000 or more visitors will have to commute tens of kilometres every day, though cruise ships have been hired to ease the shortage of hotel rooms. Accommodation is, after flights, likely to be the biggest cause of carbon emissions for COP26 . It usually accounts for about half the domestic total, though a homestay program should reduce the total. Heating is a significant factor here. Moreover, some meeting venues have low ratings for energy efficiency. Historically, the need to heat temporary structures - often with diesel generators - racks up emissions. Britain intends to use waste oils, like old chip fat, as a green alternative. Summit organisers often prefer to exclude some embarrassingly large categories of carbon costs when they talk about an event's footprint. In 2016, France boasted that its carbon footprint for COP21 amounted to 9600 tonnes of carbon dioxide "on national territory" - equal to the annual emissions of just 800 French people. This excluded international flights. Leaders negotiate important deals most effectively face-to-face. And a virtual preparatory meeting in June suffered from time-zone mismatches and tech hitches. But there is a good argument for restricting numbers tightly. Many COP26 attendees will be bag carriers, professional lobbyists and other inessential tag-alongs. Better for them to attend digitally. Switching a big academic conference online resulted in a carbon footprint at least 97 times smaller. The Glasgow conference, like its predecessors, will claim to be carbon-neutral. The UK government will invest in a spread of projects. The value of offsets is debatable. The carbon reductions promised by providers rarely bear close scrutiny. It would be much better to generate fewer emissions in the first place. \</doc>

PRIME Minister Scott Morrison has been thanked for being a "dear friend" to India on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pictured, on Tuesday morning took to Twitter to declare there is never "a dull moment" when he's with his friend Mr Morrison. It came just hours after he praised the Australian medical regulator's decision to recognise India's locally produced Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin. Mr Morrison later tweeted it was "wonderful" to see his friend at COP26 . As the G20 leaders' summit kicked off last week, Australia and India were joined only by China to resist a global bid to phase out coal-fired power and mining. In his address to the COP26 summit, Mr Modi committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2070 - two decades later than the rest of the world. The announcement falls short of a key goal of the climate summit, which is for nations to agree to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. India is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU. It is the fifth largest export market for Australian coal, and imports into the country have risen off the back of Australian trade woes with China. Coal currently powers 70 per cent of India's electricity generation. However, Mr Modi has promised his nation would transition to generating 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030. The Indian leader made the most of his time at the UN leaders' summit, whizzing around to meet with several of his international counterparts. Earlier, the Indian Prime Minister was pictured with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince Charles. He thanked the royal for his commitment to sustainable development and climate change. That growth is driving a voracious appetite for energy. In the next two decades it has to add a power system the size of Europe's to meet demand for its swelling population, according to the International Energy Agency, but it also has to tackle toxic air quality in its big cities. Mr Modi made it clear that meeting emissions-cutting pledges would require finance from rich, historic emitters. "India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest," he said. \</doc>

Glasgow: Australia and other countries are working to water down a key proposal from the Glasgow climate summit which would pressure the Morrison government to overturn its opposition to a more ambitious 2030 emissions reductions target. The behind-the-scenes negotiations during the dying days of COP26 took place as its host, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, condemned world leaders for "sitting on their hands" and conceded the core goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees was now at grave risk. Johnson declined repeated opportunities to name which countries were blocking progress. "The world knows what a mess our planet is in. The world has heard leaders from every country, every continent, stand here and acknowledge the need for action. And the world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that. "The backlash from people will be immense and long-lasting, and frankly we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium." The joint declaration issued by China and the US later Wednesday evening local time (Thursday AEDT) stating that the two superpowers will put aside their own geopolitical rivalries to tackle climate change has raised hopes that the roadblock to a strong 2030 commitment has been removed. Addressing a press conference at the COP26 summit, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua unveiled a joint-declaration designed to "enhance climate action in the 2020s" and said the two nations were determined to tackle global warming with "concrete and pragmatic" co-operation. While Australia has committed to reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the Morrison government declined to lift its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent due to strong opposition from Coalition MPs. The terms of a draft Glasgow accord released on Wednesday morning local-time would give nations that have not submitted "new or updated" 2030 targets another 12 months to "revisit and strengthen" their emissions reduction effort. The Australian government and other countries are working to have that element altered or removed. Australia is also unhappy with another proposal which "calls upon" nations to speed up the phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. There is a strong expectation that the final language will be softened or removed by the time a deal is completed on Friday. Asked whether watering down the draft text would imperil the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, Johnson replied: "The risk of sliding back I think would be an absolute disaster for the planet. "As we go into the final furlong, that's where the horses change places. That's the most difficult moment." Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia was an "active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26 ". One Australian government official noted the COP26 agreements are usually formed on a consensus basis, suggesting opposition to the draft text will likely lead to it being changed. Simonetta Sommaruga, a Swiss politician in charge of settling the issue, conceded views "still differ widely". In one sign of the extent of the disagreement, Sommaruga revealed some countries had even asked for the time between updated targets to be expanded to 10 years instead of the existing five. Elsewhere, Glasgow negotiators are having difficulty striking agreement on financing, adaption and compensation for loss and damage. There is also unease over a proposal for the United Nations to convene another summit of world leaders in 2023. Warning of a tense final two days of negotiations, COP26 President Alok Sharma said some countries would have to reverse their positions to reach consensus. "My big, big ask is to come armed with the currency of compromise," he said. "What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren. I know we will not want to fail them." He also stuck to the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, reminding negotiators of a recent speech by Mia Mottley, the Barbados Prime Minister, who said 2 degrees of warming would be a "death sentence" for her country. Johnson condemned countries which had "spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back" for signing the Paris Agreement only to "edge toward default now that vulnerable nations and future generations are demanding payment, here now, in Glasgow".

India, Brazil, China and Russia -appear to have scuppered the chances of major progress at this week's Glasgow climate change conference, after they forced Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron to water down emissions reduction pledges at the G20 summit in Rome. Leaders of developing and -resource-heavy nations have pushed back against the 2050 net-zero emissions target, a UK ambition to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2030 and the US-led plan to implement a global methane pledge in the lead-up to the COP26 summit. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out adopting a net-zero target while Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro - representing three of the biggest emitters and fossil-fuel producers - have all snubbed COP26 . COP26 despite the setbacks at the G20 summit. The Prime Minister said: "The destination, I think, is understood and agreed. The world will move to a new-energy economy. It will move to a decarbonised net-zero economy. And the pace of that and the way that journey \'e2\€ \£6 is travelled by countries will be different. In different countries they've got different challenges and they will find their different ways to that same destination. "And to think that aspiring to that goal means that every single country has to get there the same way. I don't think that's realistic. And frankly, I think it's a bit naive." The British Prime Minister said on Sunday night that while reasonable progress had been achieved at the G20, "there is a huge way still to go". "If Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails," Mr Johnson said. "Right now the Paris Agreement, and the hope that came with it, is just a piece of paper. We need to fill that piece of paper to populate it with real progress." The US President, facing increasing domestic pressure over his climate change agenda, said it was "disappointing" Mr Xi and Mr Putin had not attended the G20 and COP26 summits in-person. "(They) basically didn't show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change," he said. "And there's a reason why people should be disappointed in that. I found it disappointing myself. "The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I think you're going to see we've made significant progress and more has to be done. But it's going to require us to continue to focus on what China is not doing, what Russia is not doing, and what Saudi Arabia is not doing." Mr Morrison, who arrived in Glasgow on Sunday night (Monday AEDT), will join more than 100 leaders at a two-day summit in setting the COP26 agenda and -delivering national statements outlining their climate change policies and targets. He was due to use his speech overnight to explain Australia's plan to reach net zero by 2050 and updated emissions projections showing the country was on track to beat its Paris commitment. Before travelling to Glasgow, Mr Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor ruled out Australia supporting higher methane -emissions-reduction targets or agreeing to a phasing out of coal-fired power generation by the end of the decade. G20 countries including India, Australia, Russia, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and South Africa were understood to have reservations about some of the climate agenda being pushed by the US, Britain and the European Union. More than 20,000 people have assembled in the Scottish city for the COP26 summit, where Mr Johnson had hoped to usher in a new era of global co-operation on emissions reduction and climate change. Mr Morrison was due to hold a roundtable with South Pacific leaders overnight, his first -opportunity to hold in-person talks with island leaders since the pandemic struck. He was also due to meet Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Vietnam Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh - both relatively new leaders in key strategic countries - after visiting the BAE Systems shipyard to inspect British Hunter-class frigates, the same model that will be built in Adelaide. As expected, G20 leaders broadly agreed meaningful action was required to limit -global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, "also as a means to enable the achievement of the 2030 agenda". But a standoff pitting the US, Britain, France and the EU against China, Russia, Brazil and India led to a substantial rewriting of the G20 communique's climate change section. The final communique, released late on Sunday, revealed a softening in language around targets for net-zero emissions by 2050, with carbon-neutrality goals watered down to say "by or around mid-century". Despite calls to end coal-fired power generation by 2030, G20 leaders could only agree that countries "commit to phasing out investment in new unabated coal power generation capacity as soon as possible". A vague reference was -included on ending inter-national public finance for new coal generation abroad by the end of the year. Mr Biden's Global Methane Pledge, which he will officially launch at COP26 , also fell flat with G20 leaders. It said the world's leading economies would "acknowledge -methane emissions represent a significant contribution to climate change, and recognise, according to national circumstances, that its reduction can be one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost-effective ways to limit climate change and its impacts". Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the G20 summit, said: "Why do you believe 2050 is some magic figure. If it is an ambition of the -European Union, it is the right of other countries also to have -ambitions \'e2\€ \£6 No one has proven to us or anybody else that 2050 is something everyone must subscribe to." In Australia, Anthony Albanese said Mr Morrison would be exposed at Glasgow for a lack of policy on his own net-zero target by 2050. "You can't have an Australian Prime Minister just saying, 'It's the vibe', when the rest of the world wants to see concrete steps towards net zero by 2050," the Opposition Leader said. \</doc>

Climate change was described as a "doomsday" scenario that required a "James Bond victory" at the UN's COP26 conference in Glasgow last week, and 200 countries have now walked away with a new deal. "It's one minute to midnight on the doomsday clock, and we need to act now," Mr Johnson said in his opening speech. The two-week climate change summit discussed limiting the effects of global warming and addressed how countries planned to cut their emissions by 2030.\~ Here is what happened\~ The UK had\~asked at\~the start of the conference for all HYPERLINK industrialised countries to adopt more ambitious mid-century targets \~to halve their emissions by 2030.\~ At the end of the event, Mr Johnson\~said the deal agreed at the COP26 climate talks sounds the "death knell for coal power". So, what was achieved at COP26 ?\~ More than 100 countries agreed to slash methane emissions and signed a pact to end\~deforestation 140 countries agreed to strength their 2030 targets\~ 190 countries agreed to phase out coal power and end public funding For the first time, COP's agreement directly mentioned fossil fuels The "Paris Rulebook" was finalised, paving the way for global emissions reductions through carbon trading What is COP26 ?\~ COP stands for "Conference of the Parties", and this was its 26th annual meeting. The first COP was held in\~Berlin, Germany, in\~1995. COP\~is the main decision-making body of the\~United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\~and includes representatives from all the countries\~that are parties to the convention.\~ World leaders who attended the COP26 summit included the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, United State's President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\~ Notably missing from the summit was\~Russia's President Vladimir Putin,\~China's leader\~\~Xi Jinping and\~Queen Elizabeth II. The next conference, COP27, is expected to take place in Egypt\~in late\~2022.\~ Nations reach climate deal after language was watered down https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-14/cop26-climate-deal-reached-with-coal-compromise/100618866 water down the language on cutting emissions from coal . The change India proposed replaced the phrase "phase out" with "phase down". Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change put forward by India. The deal aims to keep alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the effects of catastrophic climate change. In other developments at the talks, the world's two biggest carbon-polluting countries, China and the United States, HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-11/china-and-us-vow-to-tackle-climate-change-in-joint-statement/100611400 agreed to work together to increase efforts to fight climate change. The agreement vowed to\~cut methane emissions, phase out coal consumption and protect\~forests. "Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris agreement," China's chief negotiator Xie Zhenhua said. US climate envoy John Kerry said the agreement was a statement of support for a successful\~climate summit, with both countries taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. "Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us," he said.\~ Australia labelled as a 'great disappointment' The United Kingdom's top government advisor on climate change, Lord Deben,\~ HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-08/scott-morrison-cop26-doesnt-understand-urgency-climate-change/100602228 labelled Australia's contribution as a "great disappointment \~for failing to understand the urgency of reducing emissions.\~ Prime Minister Scott Morrison formally confirmed at the summit that Australia would commit to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. He also announced $500 million in new funding to help Pacific and South-East Asian countries deal with the effects of climate change, bringing Australia's total commitment to $2 billion. Resources Minister Keith Pitt said Australia had outlined how it would meet its 2050 climate target and that demand for Australian coal was expected to keep increasing out to 2030. "Australia produces just four\~per cent of the world's thermal coal. It's some of the world's highest quality, and that's why we'll continue to have markets for decades into the future," he said.\~ Island nations wanted more ambitious agreements At\~the last\~talks of the summit, representatives from the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kenya, Ghana and the US all pleaded for greater ambition\~agreements.\~ Earlier in the week, Foreign Minister Simon Kofe delivered a HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-10/tuvalu-minister-makes-cop26-speech-from-sea/100608344 video address to the summit while standing knee-deep in seawater \~to show how low-lying Pacific nations were at the front line of climate change. "The statement juxtaposes the COP26 setting with the real-life situations faced in Tuvalu due to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise," Mr Kofe said.\~ "Tuvalu is literally sinking." Big crowds rallied for bolder action\~ While outside the wall of the conference, tens of thousands of protesters marched in Glasgow and worldwide, demanding bolder action at the UN climate conference. The crowd in Glasgow marched streets away from the summit, chanting, "what do we want, climate justice." Colourful banners displayed slogans ranging from earnest calls for "Climate Justice Now", to the more comical: "No planet = no beer". Teenage activist Greta Thunberg led the HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-06/greta-thunberg-leads-cop26-protests-climate-change-glasgow-youth/100599934 "Fridays for Future" protest in Glasgow.

Climate change conferences, such as today's COP26 , were once the domain of scientists and bureaucrats. Now, they are\~increasingly attended by big business delegations eyeing off the "green dollar"\~ former climate negotiator for Australia, Richie Merzian, calls it a "trade show" for climate change. It's a sign that climate change is as much an economic challenge as it is a scientific one. In fact, one of the four goals of Glasgow is "mobilising finance"; $90 trillion is needed for infrastructure to assist the economy to decarbonise by 2030, according to the World Bank. One of Australia's biggest investors in renewables, Mike Cannon-Brookes, said\~"$90 trillion is probably an understatement". "The challenge with Australia's commitments and the promises we are taking to COP26 in Glasgow is that they don't give our economy any stability," he told 7.30.\~ "There's no legislation, there's no planned interim targets, which means as an investor, you can't be sure what environment you're investing in, which means you're going to need a higher return because the risk is higher, which means the cost of doing business in Australia is going to go up." COP26 will see an unprecedented showing of corporations, bringing the quality of their commitments  and motives  into sharp focus. Polluters tackling\~emissions Australia's largest independent fossil fuel supplier, Ampol, is switching some of their petrol stations to fast-charging electric vehicle stations, according to CEO Matt Halliday. "We do view ourselves as a distributor of energy. Over time, we'll be distributing different forms of energy," Mr Halliday told 7.30. "We're rolling out 121 stations across our network initially, in partnership with ARENA." Despite Ampol's 1\~million tonnes of carbon emissions each year, it is part of a business delegation called the Climate Leaders Coalition  which includes BHP, CBA and Coles\~ \~and has sent representatives to Glasgow. "I don't think it's appropriate to rely on any one group, government or organisation. It's about a coalition working across value chains, working together on policy settings," he said. The rise of 'greenwashing' Critically,\~Ampol's plan will not deal with "scope 3" emissions\~ \~the emissions from customers burning their fuels\~ according to Richie Merzian. "Companies will try and greenwash their way into only offsetting the emissions from scope 1 and 2, their domestic emissions," Mr Merzian told 7.30. "And if you're a major fossil fuel producer, the majority of your emissions are when your goods are burnt. "We're seeing a rise of greenwashing. We're seeing more junk credits being put on the market and purchased up by big polluters. We're seeing a lot more marketing, and not a lot of action. And that's the real risk."\~ \~ the Australian Conservation Foundation. However, COP26 will see new commitments from some of the industries hardest to abate. World's largest cement maker tackles scope 3 Holcim is the world's largest cement and building material producer. It's also a member of US climate envoy John Kerry's First Movers Coalition,\~a group of emissions intensive industries attending COP26 . Holcim's chief sustainability and innovation officer, Magali Anderson, told 7.30 that the new targets they were taking to COP26 meant they would\~now reduce their scope 3 emissions  emissions created down their supply chain by customers using their building products  by 90 per cent, a goal endorsed by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). "Scope 3 emissions represent 20 per cent\~of our total footprint," Ms Anderson said.\~ "[For] some companies, it represents 80 to 90 per cent. "Which means 80 per cent of our emissions are actually under our control. "Steel and cement are part of this famous 'hard to abate' sector. Myself, I hate this nomination;\~I love to call it [a] 'full of opportunities' sector, because whenever we reduce, the type of reduction we're going to make will have an enormous impact." Mr Cannon-Brookes, whose software\~firm Atlassian also has endorsement from SBTi, said COP26 would bring new promises\~from the corporate sector, but transparency and governance was required. "We need to call out and be clear about what people are actually committing to, whether it's an individual, whether it's a business or whether it's a government," he told 7.30. "When people are making a net zero pledge, we should ask things like, is it legislated? As a government, that's laws, as a business, that's in some sort of actual policies, penalties, incentives, that sort of thing. "None of Australia's policies involve scope 3. Very few of those large, generally fossil fuel-based businesses involves scope 3.\~That's a really important point." Attempting to address the authenticity of green investments, the Climate Bonds Initiative is a not-for-profit that developed an accreditation system now adopted by the EU and China  and investors are hungry for ways to 'green up' their portfolios, according to CEO Sean Kidney. "There is money pouring out of our ears looking for green," he told 7.30.\~ "In the recent auction, when the European Commission went to market seeking money for its green bond, they were 11 times oversubscribed. "That means that they placed 12 billion euros a bond. They got 11 times the orders. "This COP26 will be replete with corporations, with investors, with ministries of finance, not just ministers of climate change. \</doc>

THE coal industry has absorbed the impact of Glasgow, with the short-term concerns of a global energy shortage outweighing longer-term concerns about climate. Although the traded price of Newcastle export thermal coal has fallen by more than 30 per cent in a month, at $US152 ($210) a tonne for top-quality product the industry is still in a much stronger position than its critics hoped it would be coming out of COP26 . Newcastle's other export is semi-soft coking coal for steelmaking, but with power stations prepared to pay more than steelmakers, exporters have switched markets, where possible, to their financial advantage. As the graph above shows, shares in Gunnedah-based Whitehaven Coal have settled in recent days, having peaked in early October, almost a month before COP26 . Yancoal and New Hope (Bengalla) also peaked in early October, and have followed very similar patterns to Whitehaven all year. Although BHP refuses to comment on market speculation, reports are circulating that BHP is having second thoughts about selling its Mount Arthur mine, given the strong prices for its product. BHP chairman Ken MacKenzie told the company's annual general meeting earlier this month that "all options" were on the table, which was interpreted as including retaining the mine. With climate activists angry that the Glasgow meeting ended with a pledge to "phase down" rather than "phase out" coal - as evidenced by the Blockade Australia protests in Newcastle - the Times of India is reporting that China and the United States, not India, were responsible for the change in language. The Times quoted a government source who said: "It was the chair of the COP 26, Alok Sharma, who had asked India to introduce the new text on the floor. However, we did not introduce the term 'phasing down'. It came from the US and China. India is being blamed only because it read out the statement." The Hunter coal industry has also attracted the attention of the Washington Post, which ran a feature on the region earlier this month. \</doc>

Glasgow | The COP26 summit in Glasgow has exposed the global policy divide on climate change, with calls by Western leaders for urgent action failing to shift the big-polluting developing economies and Russia. US President Joe Biden called climate change an existential threat and UN General-Secretary Antonio Guterres warned "we are digging our own graves", but the world's biggest emitter, China, offered nothing new, the leaders of Brazil and Russia did not show up, while India HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/india-s-2070-climate-pledge-divides-opinion-in-glasgow-20211102-p5957e promised some action There was also a HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/fight-over-climate-cash-boils-over-at-glasgow-summit-20211102-p5953w concerted push by developing countries , led by China, Brazil and India, for the wealthier countries to honour their commitment to provide $US100 billion ($133 billion) a year to fund the climate change transition costs of poorer nations. Seeking to salvage his summit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to at least think about the children and the world they were being bequeathed. "We are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster - record outputs and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2," he said. "All those promises will be nothing but blah blah blah - to coin a phrase - and the anger and impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change." Mr Biden acknowledged he had talked a big game in the lead-up to Glasgow but arrived with little after Congress refused to pass a massive spending bill that contained measures to reduce emissions. He apologised for Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris accord and said the US remained committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent to 52 per cent by 2030 over 2005 levels, and he remained committed to getting something through Congress. This, he said, would "demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table, but hopefully leading by the power of our example". No concrete targets "I know it hasn't been the case and that's why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words." The COP26 Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend Glasgow but issued the conference a written statement devoid of any new commitment. "Ancient Chinese believe that successful governance relies on solid action," it said. "I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all." Mr Johnson and his allies want COP26 to agree on ambitious 2050 and 2030 emissions reductions targets because the consensus is that only this level of commitment can restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - the now-agreed threshold above which climate change becomes catastrophic. French President Emmanuel Macron said "the largest emitters whose national strategies do not match our strategy of 1.5 ... must scale up". But key polluters Russia and Brazil were among the absentees - although Brazil issued a press statement saying it had boosted its 2030 emissions reduction target from 43 per cent to 50 per cent, from an unclear baseline, and would aim for "carbon neutrality" by 2050. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose nation faces significant challenges reducing emissions, outlined a series of pledges that he called "five elixirs". There were net zero emissions by 2070, the generation of 500 gigawatts of power using non-fossil fuels by 2030, reducing carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2030, reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, and having 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Mr Modi put the onus back on the individual consumer, calling for a new mass movement towards more sustainable lifestyles, backed by "an institutional framework". "Today, instead of mindless and destructive consumption we need mindful and deliberate utilisation," he said. He said lifestyle changes should range across areas including diet, fashion, housing, packaging, energy and water management. Madhura Joshi, an analyst at the think tank E3G, said India's commitments were encouraging. "They can deliver net zero by 2070, and India can hopefully achieve this much earlier," she said. "India often does better than its set targets. The stage is now set for a step change in clean investment." HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/pm-makes-his-technology-sales-pitch-to-the-world-20211102-p5953x Prime Minister Scott Morrison used his contribution to formally commit to net zero emission by 2050 and plug his technology-based approach as the solution to the policy gap between developed and developing nations that is stopping universal global action on global warming. Mr Morrison said developing affordable and scalable low-emissions technology was the only realistic mechanism for major emitters such as India and China to come on board. "We can't control the costs of carbon-based fuels in China or in India or in Indonesia. But what we can do is work with those countries to ensure the technologies that they're adopting for their industrial growth and their strength and their jobs is low emissions and low costs," he said. A dominant feature of the summit was a row over money between the rich West and the developing world, as leaders of poor countries excoriated their wealthy peers for failing to open their wallets. About 60 leaders took the podium on Monday, and many laid bare the divisions over rich countries' failure to meet a target of stumping up $US100 billion a year that would help fund developing countries' climate transition costs. The issue is critical to COP26 's success because many poorer countries are reluctant to take major climate action without rich-country support. They say the already-developed world wants them to sacrifice their development to meet West-imposed targets. Mr Guterres tried to stir global action by telling leaders "we are digging our own graves". "It's time to say \' enough'," he said. "Enough of brutalising biodiversity, enough of killing ourselves with carbon, enough of treating nature like a toilet, enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper." \</doc>

The Glasgow climate deal requiring all nations to annually "revisit and strengthen" their climate targets means the global pressure on Scott Morrison to commit to taking faster action on climate change will intensify as a result of COP26 . In principle, this would mean formally scaling up Australia's 2030 targets ahead of next year's federal election. While reinforcing global support for a net zero world, COP26 has also shown that achieving a global consensus about the pace of decarbonisation remains challenging, given the wide range of interests and costs involved for different nations. Hence the last-minute watering down of the Glasgow Climate Pact text, with a "phase-out" of coal being replaced with a "phase-down". India and China's determination to continue to emulate the Western model of cheap fossil-fuelled development has scuppered Boris Johnson's ambitious pursuit of a global deal that would make coal-fired power history. The government now says it will simply update Australia's emissions projections without setting new benchmarks. The aim here is to turn the pressure back on Labor to set out its position on 2030, as it promised to do after COP26 . This underscores how the government's climate agenda is operating to a political timetable and purpose, as shown by the decision to release its politically managed net zero modelling late last Friday afternoon. A government serious about the policies needed to reach net zero by 2050 should have treated the modelling's publication as a major announcement and an opportunity to verify the credibility of its "technology, not taxes" road map. Instead, Energy Minister Angus Taylor tried to turn the modelling into an election billboard. What the modelling supposedly shows is that without the government's technology-driven approach, consumers and companies would be hit with a carbon tax of about $400 a tonne in the 2040s to reach net zero by 2050. This is the apparent trap for a scare campaign against Labor for wanting to bring back the carbon tax, or perhaps widen the emissions safeguards mechanism that the government says is a proxy carbon tax. Mr Morrison has stressed that Australia had to commit to net zero so as not to be left behind in the lower carbon future. But this has not been backed with a genuine policy framework or mechanism - such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax or price. Australia's outsized net zero challenge is to decarbonise its fossil fuel-based economy and seize the emerging clean energy opportunities. Glasgow shows there will not be one pathway to net zero for all nations. The government's technology-led approach has managed to get a majority of the Nationals inside the 2050 tent and avoided the risk of blowing up the Coalition. But the scale of the transition Australia must make compared with much of the rest of the world means the least-cost and most efficient policy options for carbon-neutrality should not be ruled out for political reasons. Carbon pricing, like nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage, needs to be on the table. Alas, the government is more interested in turning climate policy into an election wedge, perpetuating the culture war politics that have held Australia back from adequately tackling the challenge. \</doc>

T he world got a glimpse this week of some of the problems faced by people who have mobility issues. Israel's energy minister Karine Elharrar arrived to take part in the world's largest climate summit, the UN Climate Change Conference - known as COP26 - in Glasgow on Monday, but was unable to get into the venue. Ms Elharrar, who uses a wheelchair, waited outside the venue for two hours, hoping to enter before giving up and returning to her hotel 80km away. It was highly embarrassing for the organisers of COP26 , whose website states that "the venue, events and exhibits are wheelchair accessible". "It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021 does not provide accessibility to its events," Ms Elharrar tweeted. "Hopefully the lessons will be learned so that tomorrow green energy promotion, removal of barriers and energy efficiency will be the things I will deal with." Fortunately she attended the conference without any problem on Tuesday, with a personal apology from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I don't claim to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities on a daily basis, but I've recently experienced some of them with my partner currently using a wheelchair. It has been an eye-opener. Australia is no doubt more accessible than many places thankfully, but even in a modern city like Perth there are avoidable problems. Like the lack of a dropped kerb near an ACROD parking spot, forcing people to wheel down the street to get on to the pavement. Or the cafe that decides to use its accessible toilet as a storeroom. Experience has shown it's a good idea to recce places beforehand or stick to where you know. But of course people shouldn't have to do that in order to feel comfortable, included and to go about their everyday life. It applauded the progress made to date in Australia, such as the introduction of minimum accessibility standards for all new housing builds. But PwDWA said: "Despite the progress that has been made, people with a disability continue to experience barriers to inclusion in all aspects of their life course". It recommended, among other things, that the government co-design universal access standards which must be applied to all public and private spaces. After Ms Elharrar's predicament at COP26 made headlines worldwide, she asked via Twitter on Wednesday that the accessibility story be left behind to talk about the climate crisis that she came to Glasgow to try to help address. Her desire to move on is completely understandable. But hopefully her unfortunate experience has helped open the world's eyes to the continuing struggle for accessibility and inclusion. \</doc>

What did the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit actually achieve? In this episode of HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/the-conversation-weekly-98901 The Conversation Weekly As he finally brought the gavel down on the Glasgow COP26 climate summit on November 13, Alok Sharma, a British minister and president of COP26 , HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2021/nov/14/i-am-deeply-sorry-alok-sharma-fights-back-tears-as-watered-down-cop26-deal-agreed-video became emotional . "I apologise for the way this process has unfolded, and I am deeply sorry," Sharma said, adding: "I also understand the deep disappointment." Headlines focused on a last-minute change to language around fossil fuels in the final Glasgow Climate Pact. A call on countries to "phase out" coal power was changed to "phase down of unabated coal power" - that's coal power that doesn't include the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions. The blame for the change was laid, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/coal-why-china-and-india-arent-the-climate-villains-of-cop26-171879 some say unfairly , on India and China. So what does the final agreement mean for different parts of the world? In this episode, we're joined by Jack Marley, UK energy and environment editor for The Conversation, who was in Glasgow for COP26 and spoke to experts from around the world about what was going on. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate and Development at the Independent University Bangladesh, tells us (at 3m00s) that despite some promising announcements in the first week, such as on cutting HYPERLINK methane emissions and HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/deforestation-why-cop26-agreement-will-struggle-to-reverse-global-forest-loss-by-2030-170902 halting deforestation In the closing stages of the summit, the HYPERLINK US and China announced a bilateral deal to work together on cutting emissions. Richard Beardsworth, professor of international relations at the University of Leeds in England, explains the wider political significance of the move (at 18m45s). And Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US (at7m40s), gives us a run through of what needs to happen now to make sure countries implement the pledges made in Glasgow. Read more: After COP26 , the hard work begins on making climate promises real: 5 things to watch in 2022 Anna Malos, country lead for Australia at ClimateWorks, part of Monash University in Australia, says while there are always going to be big problems with what's agreed at COP summits, what she really saw was a "big step up in momentum". Malos explains (at 24m10s) what the final agreement means for Australia - a significant exporter of fossil fuels. And we hear from Indonesian ocean and climate expert, Intan Suchi Nurhati, a senior scientist at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, for her view of what was agreed in Glasgow. "With every COP, we have hopes and of course disappointments," Nurhati says (at 36m10s). Those disappointments, she adds, were "not because the achievements are not great", but because with so much scientific information available to the delegates, the results of their negotiations could better match the urgency of the situation.

It was "our last chance to avoid the worst effects of climate change",\~according to COP26 president Alok Sharma and "the most important international meeting of the century", according to climate councillor Lesley Hughes. Some were so quick as to declare it a failure before it even started, but as the meeting got going, serious progress was made. So HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-14/cop26-climate-deal-reached-with-coal-compromise/100618866 now that COP26 has wrapped , was it a success? Views from those involved vary widely, but\~here's what's clear: Not enough has been done to stop warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, or even the catastrophic 2C threshold. But more importantly, the world is moving faster to reduce emissions now than it was a couple of weeks ago. And those actions are now set to accelerate. So the big question is this: Did COP26 keep the chance of stopping warming at 1.5C alive? Before the Paris Agreement was signed, the world was on a trajectory to about 4C of warming by 2100. Such a world would be literally unlivable for billions of people around the world. It was a path towards planetary collapse. Through commitments made under the Paris Agreement, the world came to COP26 with 2030 commitments that would see the world warm by about 2.7C by the end of the century. Still catastrophic, but it was a pathway that bought us time to take stronger action. Through the COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-01/australia-climate-change-reputation-ahead-of-cop26-warming-talks/100579386 although Australia was not one of them . If nations come good on those commitments, then warming may only reach about 2.4C by the end of the century, according to leading analysts, Climate Analytics. Still not enough, but there are other reasons for optimism, and maybe even some relief. "Glasgow has not closed the emissions gap in 2030, which is vital to keeping 1.5C alive, but it has set up an urgent process to address this gap, inviting countries to submit more ambitious national climate targets by the end of 2022," Bill Hare, senior scientist\~and chief executive at Climate Analytics, said. That "urgent process" is one of the most important outcomes of the meeting. Acceleration of the Paris Agreement Another piece of analysis during COP26 gave people around the world a rare shot of hope: Assuming nations' less concrete longer-term commitments, including Australia's net-zero by 2050 target and India's similar target for 2070, warming could peak at 1.9C and drop to about 1.8C at the end of the century, according to researchers at The University of Melbourne. "We would have to do more in 2030 to limit warming to 1.5C," said the University of Melbourne's Malte Meinshausen, who led the research. But finally there's a projection that sees warming stay under 2C. However, that assumes a lot of work will be done to implement those long-term targets, which for some countries so far seem barely consistent with their plans for 2030. That won't happen without a lot more work on increasing and then implementing 2030 targets. So\~that's where one crucial aspect of the Glasgow Climate Pact comes to life. The Glasgow Climate Pact, agreed to by every nation including Australia, requests countries strengthen their 2030 targets to align with the 1.5C goal next year. "There is now clearly a consensus that this is not something that can be left. That\~it's an urgent tissue," Howard Bamsey, who was previously Australia's chief climate negotiator, said. The pact also sets up working groups and work programs to drive ambition in those targets. There is no question now that there is global consensus to drive ambition forward this decade to keep 1.5C alive. "It keeps the hope alive, which is the important thing," Professor Hughes from the Climate Council said. According to Kaveh Guilanpour, from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in the US, the test of whether COP26 was a success will be how promises are turned into reality. "We need to move from a conversation only about 'how much?' toward one that is also about 'how?'.\~ COP26 Breakthrough language and side-agreements lay groundwork for real action International climate diplomacy is an incremental game. And some incremental gains here have many excited about what they will achieve in the coming years  possibly turning "how much" into "how". For the first time, this COP's decision singles out coal and fossil fuels. It might seem strange, but fossil fuels were not mentioned in the Paris Agreement. It calls for nations to both phase down unabated coal power, and "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies". "Post-Glasgow, we can rid ourselves of the pretence that fossil fuels can be part of the solution to the climate crisis," said Richie Merzian, a former climate negotiator for Australia, now at The Australia Institute. Domestically, that has big implications, says Howard Bamsey, and will be the basis for stronger international agreements in coming years. "You've got Australia agreeing to an outcome that uses the term 'phase down'\~of coal. It legitimises a discussion of that topic which has been taboo until now," he said. "This will provide the groundwork for some progress on the Australian domestic scene which has been a total mess." Media commentary has focused on the fact that HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-14/cop26-climate-deal-reached-with-coal-compromise/100618866 this wording has been weakened from a draft of "phase out" to "phase down", but Mr Bamsey and Professor Hughes both said having either form of words in there is a big deal. "Regardless of whether you say 'down' or 'out', moving beyond coal and removing fossil fuel subsidies  \~It's another part of the pact that puts considerable pressure on the Morrison government  on all politicians before the next election  that transitioning out of fossil fuels has to be part of any credible policy," Professor Hughes said. "We all wanted more than that,\~but at least coal has been identified as the toxic substance that it is." Outside the official negotiating stream at Glasgow, a range of strong and promising commitments were made, which could help make promises a reality. More than 100 countries, not including Australia, agreed to slash methane emissions. And 190 countries, again not including Australia, agreed to phase out coal power and end public funding. And more than 100 countries, including Australia, signed a pact to end deforestation. The last positive outcome, which many thought was unlikely to be achieved, was the so-called "Paris rule book" was finalised, paving the way for global emissions reductions through carbon trading. And according to early analysis, it looks like it has avoided the issue of "double counting", where countries can sell carbon credits as well as counting them as part of their own achievement. "That's a very good outcome," Mr Bamsey said. The UK will see the meeting as a success, with COP26 clearly contributing to the fight to halt the climate crisis. But not everyone is so pleased. The developing world needs global emissions to be reined in, but they also need money to pay for their own reductions (called "climate finance"), and they have demanded compensation for the damage they're seeing caused by climate change (called "loss and damage"), which has been caused by rich nations. There was progress made on climate finance, but the overdue goal of reaching US$100 billion\~a year by 2020 has still not been met. And little progress was made on loss and damage. " COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global south countries  abandoned to the climate crisis with no money for the energy transition, adaptation or loss and damage," Sara Shaw from Friends of the Earth International said. Jagan Chapagain from the International Federation of Red Cross had a similar view. "We are particularly disappointed that COP26 did not deliver the finance needed to support communities at the frontlines of the climate crisis," he said. \</doc>

ABSTRACT Marise Payne and Angus Taylor stressed the latest emissions projections are that Australia would achieve up to a 35% reduction by 2030. FULL TEXT The Australian government has declared its 2030 emissions target is fixed -- although it is committed to beating it -- as COP26 concludes with a pact for countries to make a more ambitious 2030 target next year.\~ The Glasgow-based climate conference also finished with a successful push from nations including India and China to water down a draft resolution for coal to be "phased down" not "phased out".\~ Australia did not disagree with the original wording in the draft document on coal.\~ COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised and said he was "deeply sorry" for the way the process unfolded with last-minute changes to the pact.\~ "I also understand the deep disappointment. But I think as you have noted it's also vital that we protect this package," a visibly emotional Sharma told the conference.\~ Sharma said overall the conference had kept the credibility of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees "alive" but the ambition's "pulse is weak".\~ "It will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action," he said.\~ The pact calls for countries to return to the next United Nations climate change conference in Egypt next year with bigger ambitions for their 2030 targets.\~ Greenpeace Australia Pacific's COP26 Pacific delegate, Shiva Gounden, HYPERLINK said the deal offered the Pacific Islands a glimmer of hope but the world would need to honour its commitments.\~ "Pacific peoples on the climate frontline need stronger and more meaningful commitments. Our very survival as countries depends upon it, and world leaders must go even further at COP27," she said.\~ "It's disappointing that the reference to phasing out coal was weakened."\~ Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and energy minister Angus Taylor said in a joint statement that "Australia's 2030 target is fixed" of cutting emissions between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\~ But Payne and Taylor highlighted the government was "committed to meeting and beating" the target and the latest emissions projections were that Australia would achieve up to a 35% reduction by 2030.\~ They said the government was committed to achieving its 2030 and 2050 targets through a "technology not taxes strategy".\~ "The Morrison government will always stand up for and make decisions in Australia's national interest, and we will do what's right for rural and regional communities," the ministers said.\~ They said they had worked closely with Pacific neighbours to raise the role of oceans in addressing climate change, to secure outcomes on climate financing and support for building climate resilience,\~ "Through the $104 million Indo-Pacific Carbon Offsets Scheme, we are working with our regional partners to build the capability of their emissions accounting and reporting capabilities," Payne and Taylor said.

Amid an all-important gathering of world leaders at COP26 , there is much speculation on the likelihood of success or failure of these discussions and what this means for action on arresting the dangers of runaway climate change. But so what whether COP26 succeeds or fails? Maybe this time round it doesn't matter whether world leaders grandstand, cut ribbons, give flowery and sanctimonious speeches. Maybe this time, the haggling over the text of the agreement or communique matters little to whether we make progress or not. Yes, governments are important, but maybe they are not the be all and end all of solving this wicked problem of climate change. The reason for why all this may be so is that the private market, financiers and investors in particular have crossed the threshold on climate and will force the pace of change, irrespective of COP26 and laggard global players. You see, while governments, the world over, have pandered to a form of nationalism and short-term politics, markets care about the future - the risks and opportunities - and have a view that climate change is a structural problem to be solved and that new opportunities await in the act of solving this problem. New opportunities such as completely new energy systems - a more disaggregated, interactive, and localised one, not the current aggregative oligopolistic type. New opportunities such as completely new forms of energy - such as hydrogen (from dirty to blue to green), sustainable aviation fuels, and other renewables. New opportunities such as completely new transport systems, dominated by electric vehicles, batteries on wheels, all epitomising new modes of engines, power generation, storage, sharing and analytics. New opportunities such as mining critical minerals, of which Australia has an abundance, to drive decarbonisation across industries at home and abroad. New opportunities such as entirely new markets for carbon offsets which give new meaning to the use of our natural assets in Australia, and which re-imagine value in and an ability to monetise our natural capital. While governments have postured, and activists have protested, behind the scenes central banks and regulators around the world have been meeting and devising the architecture for driving sustainable finance which is going to be the mainstay of capital raisings, refinance, and investment across all industries. And you can see this reflected in the comments from Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle's comments 10 days ago and from the chair of APRA, Wayne Byres, in his appearance before Senate Estimates last week. Indeed, as survey after survey is now revealing, climate and sustainability are among the most raised topics in discussions on finance and investment. Increasingly, it is also a topic being raised by customers and the employees of major corporations. The real question for those gathering at COP26 should not be whether they should commit to net zero or not; but rather how they can play their part in driving orderly change, rather than allowing it to proceed in an unco-ordinated manner. The question is whether the costs of transition are higher than they should be. This is why interim targets and supporting frameworks matter - because, just like commitments to technology and other programs, they affect hurdles rates for investment and the cost of capital. Interim targets signal whether the proverbial can (and cost) is kicked down the road - back ending change comes with higher costs for business, our regions and taxpayers. No question, the private sector will gallop ahead because the economics and commercials make sense. We have seen this recently from both the BCA and the Climate Leaders Coalition, a group of 33 CEOs of major Australian companies. This is what looms over the deliberations at COP26 . Governments may find this hard to swallow, but the climate genie is out of the bottle and their role is now to accelerate orderly change because reluctance will simply increase the transition costs for the economy. Without co-ordination and planning, the country will be less prosperous than would be the case if with a clear framework to allow the most efficient transition. The real risks for business and net zero now lie less with governments but with the speed with which finance is moving.

Glasgow: The failure of the world's richest nations to come to agreement on a timeline to phase out fossil fuels during G20 talks in Rome on Sunday cast a pall over the formal opening of United Nations climate talks in Glasgow, with Australia attracting particular criticism from some observers. "The G20 has not provided the clear signal of leadership coming into the COP that we needed," Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan told the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age during an interview at the COP26 talks. "Developed countries like Australia are historically responsible for the trouble we are in, having exploited fossil fuel resources for a long time, and in Australia's case have not taken any significant action to reduce their emissions," she said. In a statement she added that the G20 communique was "weak, lacking both ambition and vision" and that if the Glasgow climate talks were to succeed, "the likes of Australia and Saudi Arabia need to be marginalised". "We created .00005 per cent of global emission, but we will go underwater at 1.7 degrees. It is outrageous they have not done more," she said. Mohamed Adow, director of the think tank Power Shift Africa said that the "weak" G20 statement was "what happens when developing countries who are bearing the full force of the climate crisis are shut out of the room." COP26 in Glasgow. "At least the UN process is open to all countries and allows the voice of the climate vulnerable to be heard. The exclusive club of the G20 is clearly not fit for purpose. "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a stain on global efforts to achieve a clean, sustainable future." Addressing the opening session of COP26 executive director of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinoza said that in the talks the world faced stark but simple choices. "We either choose to achieve rapid and large-scale reductions of emissions to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees  or we accept that humanity faces a bleak future on this planet. "We either choose to recognise that business as usual isn't worth the devastating price we're paying and make the necessary transition to a more sustainable future  or we accept that we're investing in our own extinction." She said the world needed more ambition from G20 nations, which were responsible for around 80 per cent of global emissions. Though there was disappointment that the G20 talks did not provide the momentum for COP26 that many hoped for, others welcomed some of its outcomes. "It is impressive that 90 per cent of G20 countries have now indicated some intention to reach net-zero, which would have been unfathomable just a few years ago," said Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute. Greenpeace's Jennifer Morgan said she was worried about the potential for success of the COP26 talks, because the stakes are so high. "But my experience of these meetings is that things can happen over two weeks that you do not expect," she said. "Countries are pushed beyond their comfort zones, beyond the brief that they came in with because of the pressure from other countries, particularly vulnerable countries like the island nations of the Pacific. "You just can't look them in the eyes at a negotiating table and damn them to not exist any more. That is what is on the table here in Glasgow."

Success in keeping the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius may not only head off the worst impacts of climate change, but also benefit the retirement savings of Australians. With the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) kicking off this week, many commentators are saying that this is the last, best chance to seriously limit global warming. A new analysis of climate-change scenarios puts a dollar amount on how tackling the climate crisis with a sense of urgency now improves retirement savings, in addition to being good for the planet. Research conducted on behalf of the industry superannuation fund giant Rest shows mitigating climate-change risk opens up a host of new investment opportunities, as the world transitions to a lower-carbon economy. Asset consultant JANA, which conducted the analysis, applied differing climate-change scenarios to a typical member - a 48-year-old with a balance of $67,000 in the fund's default Core Strategy investment option, on a retail sector wage of $48,000. The data show the member could be as much as $50,000 better off when they retire at age 67 in 2040 - if the global temperature rise tracks in a way where the rise is limited to 1.8 degrees by 2100, rather than the dire predictions now that see a much larger increase. Andrew Lill, Rest's chief investment officer, says: "Climate change poses a material financial risk to our members' retirement savings." "It is critical that the global community takes collective action [at COP26 ] to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement." The super fund, which manages more than $66 billion in retirement savings on behalf of 1.8 million members, has a road map so that by 2050 it will hold investments that collectively have a net-zero carbon footprint. David Sheasby, head of governance and sustainability at Martin Currie, a global equity manager and part of US investment giant Franklin Templeton, says COP26 is the last chance to deliver meaningful climate-change action. "We need more specific action and a greater sense of urgency, not just from governments, but also from companies and investors," he says. "As investors, we are extremely concerned that action at COP26 will not be significant enough to put the world on the pathway to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,"Sheasby says. Asset managers must use their collective weight to encourage companies to improve carbon disclosure, set meaningful targets and build climate action into their strategic planning, he says. Australian Ethical, which oversees more than $6.5 billion in assets invested in managed funds and superannuation, believes Australia is at risk of getting left behind if its targets are not ambitious enough. John McMurdo, Australian Ethical's chief executive, says COP26 is "huge" and he is hoping to see the "narrative change" in Australia, where climate change mitigation is often seen as coming at the cost of jobs. "Aussies want to associate with good companies and brands that reflect their values... and to put their money to work for good," he says. They expect those managing their retirement savings to do the same, he says. In the three months to the end of September, the wealth manager received $290 million of new cash, an increase of 80 per cent on the same period a year earlier. "What I find fascinating is that we had new members from all age demographics, and from every state and territory," McMurdo says. \</doc>

Glasgow | The failure of leaders from the world's 20 biggest economies to bolster their climate ambitions has cast a pall over hopes that the COP26 summit in Glasgow can deliver a result this week. Speaking after the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday (Monday AEDT) issued a communiqu\'e9 that watered down language on key climate goals, including removing any 2030 or 2050 deadlines, US President Joe Biden branded the outcome "disappointing". "Russia and China didn't show up in terms of any commitments to do with climate change," he said, also name-checking Saudi Arabia as a holdout against US, British and European aspirations. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will host the COP26 gathering of 120-plus leaders in Glasgow over the next few days, warned that this year was at risk of being "the moment we flinched and turned away". "Just 12 G20 member have committed to reach net zero by 2050 or earlier. Barely half of us have submitted improved plans for how we will cut carbon emissions since the Paris summit of 2015," Mr Johnson said. "The countries most responsible for historic and present-day emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work. If we are going to prevent COP26 from being a failure, that must change." Australia, Brazil, India and China scuttled the G20's attempts to put a deadline on phasing out coal-fired power and coal production, and leaders also baulked at any "substantial" reductions in methane emissions by 2030. Fund falls short Mr Johnson further conceded that COP26 would also miss a target of raising $US100 billion ($133 billion) a year in finance for developing countries' climate mitigation and adaptation needs. The fundraising drive, crucial to shore up poorer countries' confidence in the UN emissions reduction process, is still $US20 billion short. The new deadline to hit the target is 2023. Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Franca said: "We cannot accept the failure of developed countries to meet the target to which they are committed: mobilising $US100 billion annually to counter the effects of climate change. "Our main effort at COP26 will aim to ensure that the financial flows needed to combat climate change are accessible, predictable and adequate to the needs of the most vulnerable countries." Britain's effort has been directed at getting all leaders to pledge to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to take significant steps towards taking coal out of the world's energy systems. Neither campaign made great strides at the G20. Mr Johnson nevertheless described the G20's efforts as "reasonable"; and the G20 host, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, said "something has changed", as the group had accepted for the first time that net-zero was an important mid-century goal. Environmental groups unimpressed United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: "I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled, but at least they are not buried." But such emollience was not shared by environmental groups. "If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26 , then world leaders fluffed their lines," said Greenpeace International chief executive Jennifer Morgan. Mohamed Nasheed, the speaker of the parliament of the Maldives - one of the most high-profile delegations in Glasgow, given the immediate and existential threat to the islands - said the G20's pledge to stop financing coal projects overseas was "a welcome start". "But it won't stop the climate from heating more than 1.5 degrees and devastating large parts of the world, including the Maldives. So clearly, this isn't nearly enough," he said. The executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body overseeing the COP process, opened the conference in Glasgow on Sunday (Monday AEDT) by saying the focus had to be on implementation, not just commitments. "Every day that goes by without being able to implement the Paris Agreement in full is a wasted day," she said. "I call upon all parties to recapture the spirit of multilateralism that resulted in the adoption of the Paris Agreement, and fulfil their commitments under it." \</doc>

World leaders are preparing to issue a final text from the COP26 climate change conference without mentioning fossil fuels, with activists blaming Australia and other countries with dominant fossil fuel industries. It came as former United States president Barack Obama told COP26 delegates on Monday that world leaders and US Republicans were all playing politics with climate change. Mr Obama blasted Russia and China for being absent from the climate summit. "I have to confess it was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world's largest emitters, China and Russia, declined to even attend the proceedings," Mr Obama said to a packed audience, before adding: "Their national plans so far reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency or willingness to maintain the status quo on the part of those governments and that's a shame." Mr Obama said international co-operation on global warming had atrophied: in part because of the pandemic, in part because of the rise of nationalism and tribal impulses around the world but also "in part because of a lack of leadership on America's part for four years on a host of multilateral issues". Mr Obama also called on climate protesters to build coalitions for "bold action" to persuade people who did not agree or were indifferent. Activists said the COP26 final text, which is still to be thrashed out in the coming days before being released on Friday, initially showed that powerful countries - including Australia - may have succeeded in blocking any reference to the oil, gas or coal industries. This was despite major pledges being made by various countries to end coal financing and reduce carbon emissions by embracing renewable energy sources and hydrogen at the expense of fossil fuel industries. The aim before the summit was to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and to obtain funding promises of $US100bn a year to help poorer countries deal with the impacts of climate change. Greenpeace, which has obtained the draft copy of the final text that was written after the first week of the summit, said it was just 850 words long and failed to acknowledge that fossil fuels were driving the climate crisis. Nor did the final text make any commitment to tangible actions to end global reliance on coal, oil and gas. Greenpeace said negotiators had to stand up to fossil fuel-producing countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia, saying the two countries "have blocked fossil fuel reduction even being mentioned in the last 25 COP texts and are crippling ambition in the negotiations at Glasgow". Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said every time fossil fuels were mentioned, it had been blocked by the same countries. "What's very concerning here in Glasgow is that the first draft of the climate pact text is already exceptionally weak. Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down," she said. "To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added - 'fossil fuels phase out' - and countries must come back next year to close the gap." \</doc>

The world got a taste of how Australia will be treated at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow when Macquarie Group this week hosted a two-day green energy conference. This was a high-powered conference, and keynote speakers included Alok Sharma, the president for COP26 At no stage during the two-day virtual conference was there any mention of the Australian government and its lack of ambition on 2030 carbon reduction targets or its failure to make a pledge to hit net zero by 2050. COP26 action plan is being greeted with an agglomeration of global disinterest. Nobody really seems to care what the Australian government isn't doing because of the overwhelming amount of decarbonisation activity in the private sector and the recognition that formidable progress will be made without Australia being part of the conversation. The other clear message from the Macquarie conference is that the void left by Morrison, who is unlikely to attend the Glasgow meeting, will be filled by Macquarie chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake, who is attending COP26 . She has strategically positioned Macquarie to be at the centre of the COP26 initiative to find $US100 billion ($137 billion) a year in financing from governments, multi-lateral development banks and private sector institutions to pay for the decarbonisation of emerging countries over the next 10 years. An eye on India While Canberra has been blowing hot and cold - mostly cold - on policies for dealing with climate change over the past few years, Wikramanayake has been engaged with the powerful forces seeking creative ways to finance lower carbon emissions. In April, Macquarie became a foundation member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which includes more than 160 companies with more than $US90 trillion in assets under management. They want to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. Wikramanayake is leading the GFANZ work stream to mobilise private capital for critical climate solutions in emerging markets. As well, she has an eye to building Macquarie's franchise in India through her involvement in the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative. This project is using India as a pilot study for bringing together local and international financial institutions and corporates to identify climate finance priorities. Wikramanayake, who usually has a cameo role at Macquarie conferences, this week interviewed Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of the Board at Tata Sons, which, as a steelmaker and power supplier, is at the forefront of decarbonising Indian heavy industry and boosting renewable power. \' I know how passionate you are' Chandrasekaran was full of praise for Wikramanayake's work in helping formulate strategies for achieving lower carbon emissions and her passion for working to shape policies. "I want to tell you how pleased I am to be able to come together with you," he said. "Having known you now for some time and having had a number of interactions, I know how passionate you are about this particular theme and initiative, not only at the policy level but working together at the operating level to make things happen. "Both of us share the passion of not only making this movement, but also wanting to see a number of actions on the ground." But the strongest praise for Wikramanayake came from Sharma, who is a former British energy minister, and the man appointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to make COP26 a success. He said her work with the CFLI and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who is the COP26 finance adviser, were critical to mobilising money to finance lower carbon emissions in emerging markets. "That's why I think the work that you are leading as one of the strands of GFANZ to get that money mobilised in developing countries is going to be really important. "I would argue that actually it is one of the most important pieces of the delivery from GFANZ to get that money mobilised in developing countries." \</doc>

The political leaders who meet at the upcoming COP26 climate change summit must give "concrete hope" to future generations that they are taking action to effectively tackle climate change, Pope Francis has said. "It is essential that each of us be committed to this urgent change of direction," Pope Francis said in a message broadcast on BBC Radio.\~ "The political decision makers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations."\~ The pandemic and climate change offered a "real chance for change,"\~he said. The pontiff is scheduled to meet US President Joe Biden at the Vatican on Friday (local time), where they are expected to discuss COVID-19, climate change and poverty. White House press secretary Jen Psaki\~said she expected\~a "warm and constructive dialogue" between the two leaders. "Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed our deep vulnerability and raised numerous doubts and concerns about our economic systems and the way we organise our societies," Pope Francis said in the message. "These crises present us with the need to take radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities that we must not waste." Francis warned against "isolationism, protectionism and exploitation", urging leaders to "build together". HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-26/government-commits-to-net-zero-by-2050-climate-deal/100565254 Prime Minister Scott Morrison has committed Australia to become carbon-neutral by 2050 , a target already adopted by most nations heading to COP26 . British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the summit was unbelievably important, but the outcome was in the balance as talks would\~be difficult. Ahead of the last UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, Pope Francis released the first-ever ecological encyclical, in which he said the world's prevailing economic model had exploited the poor, ravaged Earth's resources, and turned the planet into an "immense pile of filth". The Vatican is sending a delegation to the summit, but the 84-year-old pope will not be going following surgery earlier this year. ABC/wires \</doc>

\~\~Representatives from almost 200 countries will gather in Scotland from Sunday to confront the threat posed by climate change. \~\~ The United Nations says Glasgow's COP26 summit is ?the world?s best last chance to get runaway climate change under control?. \~\~ There's still a window of opportunity to avoid chaos but it's narrow. \~\~ What is or isn't achieved by about 2030 is considered crucial to success or failure. \~\~ Here's an overview of the summit, what's riding on it, andAustralia's position. \~\~ WHAT IS COP26 ? \~\~ It's shorthand for the 26th annual Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \~\~ It begins on Sunday and will be attended by thousands of delegates from most countries, including 120 world leaders.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will be among them. \~\~ Thesummit is essentially a global stocktake on climateaction. \~\~ Have countries kept thepromises they made under the 2015 Paris pact to limit warming to well below 2C and preferably to 1.5C?And what will they do next? \~\~ A key requirement of the Paris pact is that countries recommit every five years to increasingly ambitious climate action including the critical task of slashing greenhouse gas emissions. \~\~ This will happen for the first time at COP26 . \~\~ WHAT'S ON THE LINE? \~\~ Everything, according to the world?s top climate scientists. \~\~ In August, theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sixth assessment report on climate action. \~\~ The planet has already warmed about 1.1C since the Industrial Revolution and the IPCC said it's likely to hit or exceed the 1.5C limit in about a decade from now. \~\~ It said nations must present much stronger plans to reduceemissions. Otherwise the planet is on track for "catastrophic" warming of at least 2.7C this century. \~\~ However, under a scenario of very low emissions, Earth is still likely to reach 1.5C but the IPCC believes it will still be possible to drop back below that after a few decades. \~\~ WHY HALF OF ONE DEGREE MATTERS? \~\~ Australia is already feeling climate change in the form of higher temperatures and more extreme weather. \~\~ Fractional degree increases have been linked to more frequent and severe bushfires, droughts, cyclones and storms, coastal inundation. \~\~ Globally, 2C would expose 37 per cent of the world's population to severe heatwaves at least once every five years, compared to 14 per cent at 1.5C. \~\~ It would expose 61 million additional urban dwellers to drought.And small island states and low-lying countries would sink further into the rising sea, among many other devastating effects. \~\~ THE OBJECTIVES OF COP26 : \~\~ Countries have been urged to present ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets by phasing out coal, rapidly switching to electric vehicles, limiting deforestation and investing heavily in renewable energy. \~\~ Another key objective is for developed countries including Australia to honour a decade-old pledge to provide $100 billion annually to help developing countries deal with climate change and decarbonise. \~\~ WHAT WILL AUSTRALIA OFFER? \~\~ Mr Morrison will go to COP26 with a new promise that Australia will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, apledge matching those offered by some other countries several years ago. \~\~ Australia's position is short of what international allies wanted - a much stronger formal commitment to cut emissions by 2030. \~\~ Mr Morrison will provide "updated projections" showingAustralia is on track for a 30 to 35 per cent reduction by the end of the decade. \~\~ That's below what the IPCC says the nations of the world must achieve - an overall45 per cent cut in order to keep warming to 1.5C. \~\~ Mr Morrison's plan to achieve net zero was released on Tuesday.It said Australia wouldcontinue exporting coal and gas "through to 2050 and beyond", for as long as demand continues. \~\~ Emissions will be reduced through a focus on clean hydrogen and a $20 billion investment in low-emissions technologies to build a greener economy that willcreate 62,000 new regional jobs while saving existing industries. \~\~ Mr Morrison has ruled out new taxes and mandates, and the net zero commitment will not be enshrined in law. \~\~ The modelling that underpins emissions abatement strategies, including carbon capture and storage, has not yet been released. \~\~ Australia is the world?s largest coal exporter and second-largest gas exporter. \</doc>

A quiet murmur, simmering with both anxiety and excitement, fills the room. The air is thick withanticipation. I'm inside a plenary overflow room, where observers are watching the final COP session take place. In just moments, the gavel will fall on the Glasgow Climate Pact, and COP26 will be over. Right next door, negotiators have just pulled an all-nighter trying to finalise the text for COP26 , and the last several hours trying to push it through. They have succeeded. The sun has only just risen in Australia, but many of my colleagues sitting next to me are still reporting back constant updates to their team at home. We hoped to be sharing good news, but instead the outcomes are sub-par. The pact is not the monumental achievement many around the world begged for just two weeks ago - rather it just takes minor steps to push countries lagging behind in the right direction but fails to push for meaningful action to reduce emissions in line with what the science demands. In a last-minute change, after lobbying from India, the pact was changed to phase down, not phase out coal, a huge loss. The Glasgow Climate Pact does have some good outcomes. Loss and damage finance, which is vital financial support for developing countries that did the least to contribute to the climate crisis but are seeing the worst impacts of it today, was strengthened and increased, even if there is not the new dedicated damages fund that those on the frontlines were asking for, and justly deserve. And above all, the outcome keeps the fight for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees alive. That said, the gap between policy and science still is as clear as day - we are not on track. Over the last two weeks, we've seen a parade of greenwashing and empty words play out in front of us. Activists are exhausted and disappointed. We've been loud, and we have done everything we can. We were promised so much by leaders in the opening days, but in the end, the outcome is just as we predicted. While many may say that COP26 was a step in the right direction, a small step in the right direction is not enough. COP26 was not enough. COP26 was a betrayal to the millions of people who are suffering around the world today. Sitting in the plenary, waiting while country negotiators argue and argue, made me feel sick. I'm watching leaders argue whether my future and present is worth the political hassle. This is not a debate, it is an execution. The negotiations are simply deciding how much destruction developed countries can inflict on those on the frontlines today, and on the future of this planet. My future. In the informal stocktaking session before the gavel was sounded, the Tuvaluan negotiator pulled up a picture of his grandchildren. He looks to be on the verge of tears as he begs politicians to think beyond politics. He asks them to think of the Earth they're leaving behind. He, and many other negotiators from countries at the frontlines of ecological breakdown, are no longer trying to make the pact better. They're trying to save it from other countries attempting to make it less and less impactful. Even in the face of what is excruciatingly clear climate science detailing what will happen if we don't keep warming below 1.5 degrees, leaders still feel the need to prioritise economic gain and continue to greenwash. We don't just need climate action, we need climate justice, and right now we're getting neither. I watch in admiration as activists from communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis keep fighting a battle we must win, even as their homes are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. As youth climate activists, we're at a major crossroads. We need to ramp up our pressure on the Australian government, world leaders, and industry players to take action now. Waiting for the next COP, then the next, then the next to be the silver bullet for solving climate change is fruitless. We need to push for strong climate leaders and incite change, especially in the lead up to the federal election next year. We will continue to hold politicians accountable for their actions and efforts to uphold the fossil fuel industry, with ever-increasing intensity. As the world watches on, the fight for climate justice must not falter. The future of our planet hangs by a thread. The final pact, while weak, puts strong pressure on Australia to switch paths and step up our efforts, or risk permanently destroying our sunburnt country for the generations to come. We need strong and decisive climate action, or the government not only will hold the burden of responsibility for those people who have already died in climate-related disasters, but also the responsibility for those who will die in the coming fires and floods.

Glasgow | British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged world leaders to "grasp the opportunity" as the UN's COP26 climate conference grinds into its final days, after dashing to Glasgow by train to try to secure a deal. China is corralling developing countries to demand more climate cash from the rich world as the price of reaching political agreement by Friday (Saturday AEDT) on an ambitious COP26 declaration proposed by London. Mr Johnson may try to get other major world leaders to intervene on his side, as he tries to inject momentum into a process that has inevitably succumbed to painstaking textual negotiations. "As we enter the last hours of COP, will you [world leaders] help us grasp that opportunity ... or will you stand in the way?" he said late on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT). Observers have pointed to China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia as countries resisting some of the more ambitious asks on 2030 targets and fossil fuels. Mr Johnson refused to single out particular countries, and he rang Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the journey north. Saudi Arabia and China are among countries reportedly accusing the UK and its allies of proposing goals and actions that go beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement. On Thursday (AEDT), US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/us-china-spring-surprise-with-wide-ranging-climate-tie-up-20211111-p597wp unveiled a joint initiative to co-operate in all areas of tackling climate change, which might help shake up the negotiations. Energy Minister Angus Taylor rejected perceptions that Australia was among the big emitters resisting progress, after news reports suggested Canberra would feel pressure from a proposal that countries would have to set new 2030 emissions-cutting targets next year. "Australia is an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26 ," he said. "While ambition is important, action and outcomes are what matters." The Beijing-led resistance was described by Jennifer Tollmann, an analyst at think tank E3G, as "process shenanigans" that could lead to some parts of the communiqu\'e9 being too "soft and fluffy". COP26 president Alok Sharma, a British cabinet minister, said the UK was not trying to reopen the Paris Agreement, an accord that had "clearly set out" that the COP process should keep global warming below 2 degrees, and should "pursue efforts" towards a 1.5 degree cap. Some countries argue the Paris Agreement does not permit the UN to demand countries step up their emissions-cutting targets. But a final summit declaration that only encouraged countries to revisit their targets next year, rather than requiring them to do so, would anger the green movement. Greenpeace International chief Jennifer Morgan, for example, tweeted that a "polite request" was "not good enough", and would amount to "an agreement that we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best". The talks were taking place in "a spirit of co-operation and consensus" but reaching a meaningful deal would be "challenging", Mr Sharma said. If Britain and the US are to prise poorer countries away from any blocking effort by Beijing, they will need to provide more money to help nations adapt to climate change, and to comply with reporting requirements on emissions cuts. "The scale of financial support is in the trillions [of dollars] for countries' needs across mitigation and adaptation," said E3G analyst Iskander Erzini Vernoit. "The ability of developed countries to step up the financial offer will be key to getting other countries back to the table in a more committed sense." Mr Sharma said he had "asked developed countries to be flexible" on questions of finance. He noted new pledges of $US350 million ($473 million) to the UN's adaptation fund and $US413 million to the least-developed countries' fund. "I hope this supports a good atmosphere in negotiations," he told reporters. Mr Johnson said the 197 countries represented at COP26 were now "in a rolling maul" towards the try line, and needed to "power through the blockages". He said world leaders should call their ministers and diplomats in Glasgow and "give them the negotiating margin, give them the space they need in which to manoeuvre and to get this done". If they failed, "the backlash would be immense and long-lasting ... and we will deserve the criticism and the opprobrium". \</doc>

COP26 continues to press for global actions that will hold the Earth's rise in temperature to 1.5 or 2 degrees, beyond which lies catastrophic, likely unstoppable consequences on all living things. And here we are thinking that agreement to net zero emissions by 2050 is what the doctor ordered. This is like suggesting that in response to COVID-19, doctors had said we must all be vaccinated by the end of 2022, and our governments agreed to that but had no requirements to get there. We would have been free to wander about saying we had a target and a long time to get there, with some desultory token action, wondering why things got worse. What the "doctors" say about the climate risk is that the targets for stopping emissions must be met in the next 10 years, starting with strong action now, or it's over - just can't get there. What a pity that the consequences of failure here cannot be seen in the same way as the impact of COVID-19. It simply doesn't feel real, and our government is not saying the equivalent of get vaccinated or there will be consequences. Our 2050 agreed target is a pyrrhic victory. Carolyn Ingvarson, Canterbury Cementing our reputation as a climate action blocker How dare Scott Morrison claim that his government is acting on climate change "the Australian way". Shirking one's responsibilities might be Mr Morrison's way but it's certainly not the way the Australian people react to an emergency. The Coalition is blocking global collaboration on climate action, promoting the extension and expansion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, and refusing to step up and set stronger, bolder climate goals this decade. It's not only totally inadequate, it's pitiful and embarrassing; Mr Morrison's actions so far at COP26 have only cemented our global reputation as a climate action blocker. John Charles, Mount Waverley Move to end deforestation uplifting How wonderful that "more than 100 world leaders" are about to agree with ending global deforestation by 2030 ("Move to save the planet's forests", The Age, 3/11). This is such a relief after so much emissions reduction disagreement at COP26 . In a contrast, protecting and restoring forests is a common cause uniting countries including Brazil, Indonesia, Canada, Russia and Australia. This success is so uplifting and also fits perfectly with naturalist Sir David Attenborough's fundamental call for rewilding our planet. Barbara Fraser, Burwood Coalition in a trap of its own making Making economic decisions purely based on political motives might seem clever at the time but can be fraught with peril. Decisions of the past to dump carbon pricing have caught the Coalition government in a trap of its own making. It is left with a meandering approach to climate change, relying on tenuous measures such as "banking on the private sector to voluntarily move to low-emissions alternatives" ("PM spruiks green tech fix to leaders in Glasgow", The Age, 3/11), instead of applying direct market signalling - pricing carbon. Unable to provide leadership over a pivotal issue that undeniably affects our future health and prosperity, Australia's representatives have not only been sidelined at the COP26 summit, but diminished our standing and influence on the world stage. Jane Robins, Moonee Ponds Well past time for a carbon price From what we are hearing from COP26 , carbon pricing is the best mechanism to decarbonise the economy. The ghost of "axe the tax" Tony Abbott and his climate deniers must not be allowed to sabotage attempts to take real action on climate. We have already lost a decade to Abbott's politically motivated madness. We cannot lose another to Morrison's fraudulent "do nothing, she'll be right" non-plan to reach net zero by 2050. Put a price on carbon and use the funds to help fossil fuel workers transition to new industries in a decarbonised economy. Nick Toovey, Beaumaris \</doc>

ABSTRACT A draft COP26 decision urges countries to step up their greenhouse gas emission targets by the end of 2022 and accelerate the phasing out of coal. FULL TEXT A draft decision from COP26 is urging countries to step up their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and accelerate the phasing out of coal. The document was published by the UK as hosts of the conference on Wednesday in a pivotal day that also saw the world's two biggest emitters -- the US and China -- release a joint statement committing to more cooperation on climate change.\~ The draft COP decision would have immediate implications for Australia as it encourages countries to "revisit and strengthen" goals for 2030 in the next 12 months.\~ Australia committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 days before the conference but did not take a revised 2030 target to the conference.\~ It committed in 2015 for emissions to drop 26% to 28% by 2030, but the government has said Australia is HYPERLINK https://www.themandarin.com.au/173274-plan-for-net-zero-by-2050-focuses-on-reducing-costs-of-new-technologies/ on track to deliver a 35% reduction The draft COP26 document calls on parties to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel".\~ Australia's plan ahead of the conference was based upon drawing down costs of new technologies rather than phasing out traditional energy sources.\~ The COP26 draft decision lays out that to keep global warming to 1.5 \'b0C by 2100 "requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions" in emissions, such as slashing carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels.\~ The document "notes with serious concern" that the current commitments of climate finance are insufficient to respond to worsening impacts in developing countries.\~ Alliance of Small Island States chair Aubrey Webson said the draft provided a basis for moving forward but lacked strength in key areas.\~ "We won't get the ambition on emissions we need for 1.5C if we don't scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long-overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage," he said.\~ The US and China statement states both nations will phase out coal but does not list time frames and commits China to addressing emissions from methane and deforestation. Both countries agreed to share technology and expertise to address climate change.\~ The conference is due to finish on Friday but can run overtime as governments debate the finer points of new commitments.\~ READ MORE: HYPERLINK https://www.themandarin.com.au/157773-worlds-richest-nations-pledge-to-end-investment-in-overseas-coal-projects/ World's richest nations pledge to end investment in overseas coal projects \</doc>

Hours before the COP26 climate talks are to begin in Glasgow Australia has "placed a spotlight on itself" by siding with China and India in resisting a push to put a timeline on the abandonment of coal-fired power, says a senior British environmental adviser. In the months leading up to the talks, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that along with formal United Nations climate negotiations, for Glasgow to succeed the world must use the moment to address "coal, cars, cash and trees". By this he means leaders must agree to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate the process of decarbonising transport and industry, provide more finance to developing nations to help them shift their economies and help create carbon sinks by protecting and replanting forests. It had been hoped that progress on decarbonisation would be made at this weekend's G20 meeting in Rome. In siding with China and India in resisting putting a timeline on the coal phaseout, Australia is signalling that is not in step with Britain and other major Western economies on the need to phase out fossil fuels, says Chris Littlecott, a director with the policy institute E3G, which has been advising on the international transition from coal. "[The position on coal] is revealing Australia is tending to come in with an oppositional approach rather than a constructive approach. It is setting red lines but not saying what it might agree to. "The feeling I get speaking with diplomats is that they're getting frustrated with Australia's approach," he said. In the hours before the talks begin there is a growing sense of unease in Glasgow that they may fail to deliver the outcomes needed to keep the world on track to holding warming to well below 2degrees and as close to 1.5degrees as possible. The decision by Chinese President Xi Jinping not to attend and not to commit to a significant increase in reduction ambitions late last week has added to concerns, as has the failure of United States President Joe Biden's failure to drive sweeping climate-related economic reforms through Congress before the talks began. Speaking at the G20 talks, scheduled to act as a COP curtain-raiser, UN General-Secretary Antonio Guterres said: "On the eve of COP26 in Glasgow, all roads to success go through Rome. But let's be clear - there is a serious risk that Glasgow will not deliver." He said current formal emission reductions commitments would see the world warm a "calamitous" 2.7 degrees. Under the best-case scenario, temperatures will still rise well above two degrees. That is a disaster." On Wednesday, the focus will be on efforts to provide finance to developing nations, which is considered crucial to keeping the Paris Agreement functioning, and on Thursday the focus will return to global efforts to phase out coal, oil and gas.

The nation is doing its fair share but, sensibly, is not going beyond it From Australia's perspective, a pragmatic, 11th-hour move by India resulted in a better-than-expected outcome of the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Close to the end of the negotiations, India insisted it would only agree to the main conference document - the Glasgow Climate Pact - if the wording to phase out unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies of fossil fuels was scaled down to a "phase-down" of unabated coal power. The modification was a defeat for those who had pushed for the summit to agree to a phase-out of coal, such as Boris Johnson and John Kerry, and activists such as Greenpeace, which claimed the 1.5C goal is "only just alive". The reference to "unabated" coal power underlines the value of the Morrison government's including carbon capture and storage in its climate modelling, released on Friday. Australia now has time to improve that technology. And the agreement affords mining communities in the Hunter in NSW and in central Queensland breathing space as they transition to cleaner industries, as Australia moves towards net-zero emissions by 2050. The climate modelling forecasts the value of coal exported will halve by 2050. Markets will determine opportunities for Australian coal and at the moment those markets are strong, Resources Minister Keith Pitt said on Sunday. Queensland's coal communities were celebrating the last-minute COP26 change on Sunday. Anne Baker, Mayor of Isaac Regional Council, one of Australia's largest coal-producing regions, said the revised wording "validates what we have been saying about the need for transformation in the mining industry rather than transitioning away from the industry". In the Hunter region north of Sydney, as Tom Dusevic wrote on Saturday, workers and their families know there is an end date to coal-fired power, but it won't be next week or next year, and that coal exports will continue for as long as foreigners keep buying it to make electricity and steel. Being practical and resilient, such communities are looking to how their communities will prosper in decarbonisation's new economy. As Newcastle electrical fitter Nathan Clements, a delegate of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union said, the task for government, business and unions was to re-skill fossil fuel workers for sustainable industries. That may -include green hydrogen, pumped hydro or battery storage. India's initiative in Glasgow will facilitate its own economic progress and that of other developing nations. Seventy per cent of India's electricity is powered by coal. And, while virtually all Indian villages are now linked to the power grid, millions of people still lack electricity in their own homes. For Australia and other developed nations, it was clear from COP26 that plenty of difficult challenges are looming in the next few years. High among them is the existing pledge by developed nations to provide climate finance of $US100bn a year to developing nations, which was supposed to happen from 2020. Debate was raging in Glasgow about how to catch up. Beyond that, Graham Lloyd wrote on Saturday, is the annual $US1.3 trillion, which a group of 24 "developing" nations - which include China (the world's second-largest economy), as well as India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam - expect the developed world to fork out to cover the cost of cutting carbon dioxide emissions in developing nations from 2030 onwards. The promise of major support has already been adopted. Thrashing out the details will be high on the agenda for COP27 in Egypt next year and COP28 in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. Following the summit, the government has opened up a wedge with the opposition by sticking to its 2030 emissions reduction target of 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 emissions levels. Anthony Albanese, who is yet to announce Labor's 2030 emissions target, said Australia's report card from the conference was a "definite fail" after COP26 urged nations such as Australia, which had not increased their 2030 targets, to do so in time for next year's summit in Egypt. But Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor and Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia's 2030 target was fixed "and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets". Australia's latest emissions projections to 2030 suggest the nation will achieve up to a 35 per cent reduction by 2030. That was after cutting emissions faster than many similar developed countries, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the US, and faster than the OECD average. For the sake of primary production, the government, sensibly, did not back a pledge, led by the European Union and the US to cut methane emissions 30 per cent by 2030. And the opposition agreed. The meaningless "colossal fossil" award from activist green groups in Glasgow shows Australia stood its ground. For some green fanatics, the most extreme overreach would never be enough. In looking to net zero by 2050, its modelling relies heavily on improving existing technologies and technologies yet to be developed. The conservative right of the Coalition's base, especially in the National Party, is fractious about that commitment. But the modelling provided economic data that should take heat out of the issue. It revealed that businesses and households would have faced interest rate hikes of up to 1.5 per cent under penalties imposed by global financiers if the government had failed to adopt the target. Households would have paid an extra $25bn a year on home loans, and business and credit card debts. The penalties would also have triggered a 17 per cent investment collapse by the middle of the next decade, cutting 0.9 per cent from gross domestic product and leaving each Australian more than $650 poorer. After years of emotion and moralising over climate change, on both sides of the debate, COP26 has brought the economics of emissions reduction into sharper focus. Australia is co-operating with the rest of the world in doing our share, but not going beyond it. That is vital. We should also avoid heavy handouts to developing nations. While the process of cutting emissions will be difficult for much of the economy, the current road map, relying heavily on technology, offers the best way forward. \</doc>

One surprise from COP26 - the latest UN climate change conference in Glasgow - was an agreement between world leaders on a new set of rules for regulating carbon markets. This would allow countries to trade the right to emit greenhouse gases. Carbon trading is part of how countries intend to meet their obligations for reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, the manner in which countries agreed these rules may hobble the Agreement in its goal of averting catastrophic warming. Carbon markets were central to the design of the Paris Agreement's predecessor, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created three different mechanisms for trading carbon. Developing countries had become accustomed to attracting investment via one called the "Clean Development Mechanism" (CDM) which allowed industrialised countries to invest in projects to reduce emissions in developing countries and count them against their own targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Many industrialised countries wanted to retain this sort of flexibility in how they met their own treaty obligations. As a result, most governments were keen to keep carbon markets as part of the Paris Agreement. In Paris in 2015, the bare bones of mechanisms similar to those in the Kyoto Protocol were agreed, but without the details needed to put them into practice. Why then did it take six years to agree the rules which would govern these markets? This was more than the four years it took countries to do the same in the Kyoto Protocol and, in effect, they were recreating the same mechanisms. The problems in reaching an agreement this time were three-fold, and they weren't satisfactorily resolved in Glasgow. Going backwards from Kyoto Various states, and many environmental campaign groups, suspect that carbon markets weaken the overall effort to reduce emissions. As climate change has accelerated over the past decade these concerns have become more acute. Why trade emissions if everyone is trying to get them to zero? There is HYPERLINK https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abdae9/meta considerable evidence HYPERLINK 85% of projects funded by the CDM hadn't reduced emissions. There are also fundamental design issues in the Paris Agreement that make setting up carbon markets under it much more difficult. The Kyoto Protocol expressed the obligations of industrialised states to reduce their emissions as targets. These could be translated into a fixed number of emissions allowances that provided carbon markets with a clear set of accounting rules and indicators of market demand. No such set of rules exists in the Paris Agreement. Instead, all states submit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - national plans for reducing emissions. They may or may not have an emissions target and they vary in how they account for emissions or which sources of emissions they include in their plans. How can a market function if there is no clear way of measuring what is being traded? And how should a country trading with another adjust its own NDC to avoid double-counting, when the design of each country's NDC varies so much? And what should countries do with all the credits created in the Kyoto Protocol's system? Should they just be rolled over to be used in the new markets? Should they be simply abandoned? Or is there some way of allowing them in but controlling their use? A lot of CDM credits in particular remain, and they could flood the new markets and undermine the integrity of the NDCs. A cop out In the first week of COP26 , it looked like these issues would continue to dog the negotiations. India supported unrestricted use of CDM credits in the new mechanism while the Solomon Islands (representing the Least Developed Countries group) opposed using them at all. In week two, these issues were either fudged or hastily agreed. The HYPERLINK https://www.ieta.org/page-18192/12124951 carbon traders were happy COP26 The Glasgow decisions on both Article HYPERLINK 6.2 and HYPERLINK 6.4 of the Paris Agreement are extraordinarily unclear compared with the equivalent ones for the Kyoto Protocol. Specialists in this field are still decoding precisely what they mean in practical terms. It's likely that states will be able to use this opacity to double-count and claim credit for the same emissions-reducing activities. Countries are supposed to set new NDCs regularly. At the same time, countries will be negotiating individual emission trades. The possibility for a country to game its NDC - making it appear more ambitious than it really is by counting already agreed trades within them - is impossible to avoid. It's hard to see how this doesn't fundamentally weaken the ambition of countries when updating their NDCs. Monitoring how these mechanisms work in practice and whether they have the desired effect will be important over the coming years. While heralded at the time as a breakthrough in implementing significant tracts of the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow pact on carbon markets might instead be remembered as its undoing.

If you were following the proceedings at COP26 in Glasgow over the past few weeks, you might have noticed a conspicuous absence - that of First Nations people. The exclusion of First Nations people from decision-making at the conference denied us the platform we needed to fight the existential threat many of our communities face from climate change, and keep warming under 1.5 degrees. First Nations activists and community leaders were "on the outside looking in, trying to carve out space for their people". Many First Nations groups struggled with obstacles to access the summit, including accreditation, visas, and a myriad of COVID-related rules. Many of these groups came from areas hardest-hit by our changing climate across the Global South, with droughts, bushfires, storms, and rising sea levels impacting not only First Nations land, but our way of life. When it came to Australia, First Nations interests here were represented not by our government, but by activists in the non-governmental space. The lack of powerful representation led to Australia helping water down the final summit commitments, something directly opposed to our interests. This lack of presence and voice from First Nations people was despite our protection of 80 per cent of the world's biodiversity, while representing only 6 per cent of the global population. We are "not mere victims"; our traditional knowledges and work to combat climate change have much to offer in tackling a problem of this scale. Yet our voices remained on the sidelines of COP26 . As long as we have no place in the international community in climate change discussions, such summits will remain what Ita Mendoza, an indigenous land defender from southern Mexico, called "a continuation of colonialism, where people come not to listen to us, but to make money from our land and natural resources". This should not be of much surprise to anyone. First Nations people have long faced exclusion within foreign policy. We are not seen as genuine actors in the international system, and thus not eligible for a seat at the table. Especially within Australia, First Nations peoples are seen as a mainly domestic constituency who are unaffected by external affairs, and therefore have little to contribute to issues within foreign and defence policy. The international system was designed around the exclusion of First Nations peoples, even with our unique and unceded sovereignties, and the practice of foreign policy within states such as Australia has continued this exclusion. This is a fundamental aspect of settler-state colonialism, and is well-practised by Australia at every level. First Nations people from this country have made great contributions within the international arena. We were heavily involved in the formation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, and have been active in both the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; with UNSW Professor Megan Davis having served as chair of both bodies in the last six years. We also have unique relational ways of being when it comes to understanding the world, and have perspectives on foreign policy issues, including climate change, that are ignored by the mainstream. To quote a First Nations delegate from COP26 : "We're here offering sustainable solutions to the rest of the world that require an ideological shift, not a green industry built on colonialism and repression. It's up to them if they listen or not." It does not appear the world is ready to listen or engage with us on our own terms, and this is especially true in Australia. Australia has had less than half a dozen First Nations ambassadors in our history, the first of these having been appointed only in 2013, with 3.2 per cent of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff being First Nations. READ MORE: Michael Jacobs: Is Glasgow finally the end of the line for fossil fuels? Australia 'stuck in the past' while other nations rise to challenge, climate watchers say COP26 produces agreement after watering-down of coal phase-out language The department launched its first Indigenous Peoples Strategy in 2015, and revamped this as an Indigenous Diplomacy Agenda in May this year. Neither of these policies involved strong consultation with First Nations people or communities, and neither of them engages with us on our own terms; the department has set its agenda, regardless of what we might want, or what contributions we might have to make. Both are outside its scope. It has been six months since this last agenda became public, and in that time, we have seen very little update on its direction or implementation. While I wrote back in May that the agenda was a step in the right direction, this was premised on the department actioning its agenda, and taking steps to ensure it was developed properly with community input. Neither of these things have occurred, and there is no indication that minister Marise Payne or secretary Kathryn Campbell have shown any commitment to them, unlike Campbell's predecessor Frances Adamson. This lack of support for a truly inclusive First Nations agenda within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does more than just exclude us from the business of government - it also causes actual harm. An agenda that First Nations communities have not exercised self-determination and leadership in developing excludes us from policy decisions that severely impact on our people, communities, and lands, and relegates us to the international sidelines. The policies set at COP26 , and efforts to keep warming below 1.5 degrees, will have an outsized effect on First Nations people; for us not to have a representative presence is active harm. On other issues, such as our global rights, exploitative mineral extraction, and even Australia's engagement within its region, our lack of voice in these policy areas has the same effect. The government needs to do better when it comes to First Nations people and climate change, as does the international community. We lack a true voice both at home and overseas on climate change, and this lack of voice will kill us.

Glasgow: The COP26 climate summit is facing deadlock on its final day as countries clash over the future of fossil fuels, a mammoth financial compensation scheme and the depth of emissions cuts this decade. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared the core goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees was "on life support" due to the rising tensions, while Pope Francis warned world leaders would face "God's judgement" if they fail before the Glasgow talks are scheduled to conclude on Friday local-time. In one surprise development, a group of nearly two dozen developing countries - thought to include major emitters such as China and India - on Thursday demanded the removal of a vast slab of the summit's draft declaration, angering others who either want the document tweaked or significantly strengthened. The chapter targeted for deletion makes explicit reference to the 1.5 degree goal, the need to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, and the aim of net zero emissions by mid-century. It also calls on the world to "accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". Removing those references would render the Glasgow summit a disaster, particularly given the chapter was already criticised for being too weak. "That gives you a sense that there is not yet, at this conference, a consensus that we need to collectively ramp up our ambition," said Archie Young, the COP26 lead negotiator. Concerns about countries, including China, watering down the final language come only a day after the industrial giant surprised the summit by agreeing to a set of actions with rival US to counter climate change. The nations pushing for the deletion, known as the Like-Minded Developing Countries, argue the chapter is unfair to poor countries. Bolivia's chief negotiator and the LMDC's spokesperson, Diego Pacheco, accused rich nations of trying to "transfer" responsibility for historic pollution to those with less responsibility. "History matters and history is very important to understand and to put in the context of the discussion on ambition," Pacheco said. Asked whether a summit declaration that did not explicitly commit to phasing out fossil fuels was meaningless, COP26 President Alok Sharma told reporters to "wait and see" what the updated document looks like when released on Friday morning, local time. Sharma warned the summit was entering its final day with a huge gulf between countries on key issues such as how much financial support the developed world should offer developing nations to deal with climate change. "There is still a lot more work to be done and COP26 is scheduled to close at the end of tomorrow. So time is running out." So far, the talks have not come close to achieving any of the United Nations' key priorities of cutting carbon emissions by about half by 2030 to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Nor have they come close to getting rich countries to fulfil a 12-year-old pledge of providing $100 billion a year in financial climate aid to poor nations. Guterres said the Glasgow talks "are in a crucial moment" and need to accomplish more than securing a weak deal that participating nations agree to support. "The worst thing would be to reach an agreement at all costs by a minimum common denominator that would not respond to the huge challenges we face," he told AP in an interview. The overarching goal of limiting warming since pre-industrial times to 1.5 degrees "is still in reach but on life support," Guterres added. Less than 36 hours from the scheduled close of the negotiations, Guterres said that if negotiators can't reach ambitious carbon-cutting goals - "and very probably it will not happen" - then national leaders would need to come up with new pledges next year and in 2023 during high-level meetings. UN climate summits are notorious for running over time and there is a growing expectation the Glasgow summit may be extended into Saturday and even Sunday. Tina Stege, a climate envoy from the Marshall Islands midway between Australia and Hawaii, said low-lying nations were desperate for a positive outcome at COP26 . Stege said she "can't underestimate" the importance of the Glasgow summit resolving to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and coal, or "how hard we will need to fight" to keep those references in the final document.

Glasgow | At the halfway mark of the two-week COP26 climate summit, the messy, sprawling marathon is uncertainly poised. The jury is out on whether Glasgow can deliver enough substance to warrant hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees. Greta Thunberg is leading the pessimists' chorus. At large streets protests in Scotland on the weekend, she branded COP26 a "failure" and "a PR event". The summit was "a two-week-long celebration of businesses as usual and blah, blah, blah", she said, in which "our naked emperors ... create loopholes to benefit themselves". Her Twitter feed called it "a Global North greenwash festival". Inside the COP26 Tim Flannery, the Australian scientist, author and Climate Council spokesman, told The Australian Financial Review in Glasgow that the COP process was "a long game", and people shouldn't expect to see "one single moment that solves this". At the Paris COP six years ago, he said, the world had agreed to "hold a horse race to solve the problem". This time, the job was to "get everyone in a starting box and pointing the same way". "So we'll go out of this meeting, we'll press the trigger, and we'll have that race to emissions reductions," he said. The Australian Conservation Foundation's climate manager Gavan McFadzean said the clutch of announcements on coal and emissions reductions in COP26 's first week meant that "keeping the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees is now within reach for the first time". The Thunberg view reflects a hunger among many activists to see more categorical pledges, rather than the bewildering blizzard of piecemeal, vague and sometimes caveated announcements, which have made the overall shape of COP26 very hard to discern. On coal, for example, there was a multitude of overlapping agreements, involving different sets of countries and different deadlines. With China, the US and Australia missing from most of them, it initially felt like a shift measured in inches. But after South Africa won cash to exit coal, and Korea, Vietnam and Poland joined the ranks of the converts - again, in somewhat caveated fashion - it seemed legitimate for Britain and some green groups to claim a significant tilt against coal was underway. Many of the pledges bore that hallmark: not too much concrete, but just heavy enough to create a sense that the political and economic scales are now rebalancing away from the status quo. Still time for a coherent result With a week still to go before any final communiqu\'e9, there is still time for Britain and its allies to draw all this together into a coherent picture, to add new signatories to some pledges, to shore up some countries' net-zero commitments, to top up the financial promises - and, ultimately, to tip the ledger yet further. The wrangle over money will be central to this, as developing countries - corralled by China and India - continue to demand more from the rich world to help them make the adjustment. "The magic dust at these COPs is often trust. It's what can unlock the talks," Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said in her daily update on Saturday (AEDT). "The way to build trust in week two is to make breakthroughs on the promised $US100 billion a year of finance, on adaptation, and on loss and damage. As the Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said, the countries here in Glasgow need to \' try harder, try harder'." Negotiators will also spend this week grinding through the unfinished parts of the Paris Agreement rule book. The unfinished business includes: rules for inter-country trading of carbon credits (the Article 6 negotiations); how often targets are reviewed and scaled up; and the transparency requirements on countries' documentation of their net-zero journeys. Before leaving Glasgow on Friday, Energy Minister Angus Taylor told the Financial Review he was keen to see the Article 6 talks make progress, having invested a lot into them at the Madrid COP in 2019. But he named transparency as one of Australia's biggest priorities. "Achievement is what counts, and that means you've got to have transparency and accountability," he said. "We only have a very small group of countries who are even close to this kind of accountability. There are many countries for whom it is very difficult to find any record of outcomes in recent years." But even if Britain draws all these threads together, it won't be enough to satisfy the sense of urgency that drives the likes of Thunberg. She is after systemic upheaval. For Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, trying to move at Thunberg's pace risks leaving other people behind, particularly those whose livelihoods are at risk from the revolution. "The challenge of reaching net zero is not just about decarbonisation, it's also about delivering a managed transition that avoids damaging disruption to communities," she said. This meant "strong and well-supported decarbonisation pathways for our carbon-intensive industries", which would keep the lights on and deliver the next generation of jobs. "It's vital we get that balance right, to protect the strong community support for climate action needed to see through the whole-economy transition to net-zero that we must achieve." It seems that, rather like a Glasgow haggis, COP26 will never be a dish that satisfies everyone. But Boris Johnson will be hoping he can make it as digestible as possible. \</doc>

The Glasgow climate pact is sealed and COP26 is fading into memory. The UK's presidency of the 26th UN climate change summit yielded mixed results, from the first mention of fossil fuels in a UN climate declaration and an agreement on rules for trading emissions credits internationally, to the blocking of a funding facility which would compensate developing countries for loss and damage caused by climate change. While delegates have left Glasgow, the UK's responsibilities as COP president are far from over. Before handing over to Egypt for COP27 in November 2022, a series of high-level decisions are needed to ensure the UK keeps the electric vehicle pedal held firmly to the floor. I'm a scientist on the Climate Change Committee - independent advisers to the UK government on net zero policy. We advised the UK to bolster its domestic targets and policies for reducing emissions to set an example going into COP26 . This included a recommendation in December 2020 to revise the UK's nationally determined contribution (or NDC) to emissions reductions by 2030. Now we've published HYPERLINK https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/cop26-key-outcomes-and-next-steps-for-the-uk/ further advice on what the UK government must do over the coming year to ensure that momentum from COP26 is not lost. This includes working with other nations on a number of fronts from improving flows of financial aid to developing countries, strengthening commitments to cut emissions by 2030 and building international cooperation on compensation for loss and damage. Glasgow to Sharm El-Sheikh One thing the UK hosts did well at COP26 was to HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-cop26-finally-recognised-the-latest-ipcc-climate-science acknowledge the stark reality of the latest climate science. While COP26 affirmed the importance of keeping the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C alive, current policies mean the world is set to pass it in the next decade, reaching 2.7\'b0C by the end of the century. To move the dial, the UK must pressure G20 nations to set stronger commitments in 2022 to cut emissions by 2030, and develop policies which could deliver them. The country's HYPERLINK own pledge is to cut emissions by 68% on 1990 levels by 2030. This is already about as ambitious as the Committee on Climate Change thinks it can realistically be while remaining credible. But it can be strengthened in other ways. For instance, this NDC could be made legally-binding. The government could also rule out meeting its target with the use of offsets, like promises to plant trees elsewhere to compensate for keeping oil and gas fields open. It could count contributions from actually reducing emissions, and removing CO? from the atmosphere with trees or carbon capture and storage technology, separately. The NDC could also include targets for individual sectors of the economy, using the government's own HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy net zero strategy . Rich countries should look beyond cutting emissions domestically to consider targets for reducing emissions from the goods and services they import. In the UK, these consumption emissions are larger and falling slower than emissions generated domestically. Quantifiable targets for adapting to the effects of climate change within the country would also be useful. The UK could put half of its climate finance contributions to developing countries towards projects which help countries adapt - something which has been HYPERLINK neglected for too long The government can also accelerate its own cuts to emissions by phasing out the "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" mentioned in the Glasgow Climate Pact text. By maintaining a low price for carbon in the UK's emissions trading scheme, the government is effectively subsidising the continued burning of fossil fuels. No fossil fuel subsidy should be considered efficient and therefore worth keeping. Boris Johnson's administration could HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/skills-shortage-could-undo-uk-governments-net-zero-plans-170806 boost skills training It could also supplement its current plans by helping people make changes to their diets, implementing measures to reduce aviation demand by improving rail travel, for instance, and axing road building projects that are not compatible with net zero emissions. Independent, evidence-based committees like ours can track the delivery of commitments by governments and report on their policies and progress. We recently launched the International Climate Councils Network to coordinate action worldwide. We hope this can help build strong and enduring international partnerships that tell governments what they need to do and how to do it.

Glasgow | Efforts to rid the world of coal, oil and gas will return to centre stage at the COP26 summit in Glasgow late on Thursday (AEDT), putting pressure on Energy Minster Angus Taylor during his last full day at the summit. More than 40 countries will back a pledge to phase out coal-fired power. Richer countries such as Canada and coal-dependent Poland will promise to do so in the 2030s, with caveats, and poorer ones like Vietnam and Chile in the 2040s. Prime Minister Scott Morrison HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-won-t-be-pushed-on-coal-deadline-pm-20211030-p594j3 said at the weekend About 20 governments have signed up to a separate pact to stop funding fossil-fuel projects overseas within a year, building on almost the only concrete action agreed to at the G20 summit last weekend. The deal covers oil and gas, whereas the G20 communique covered only coal. The summit host, Britain, claimed that altogether there were 190 countries, organisations and major companies backing at least one of the commitments under its "global coal to clean power transition statement". COP26 goal of "consigning coal to history". His ministers will put the squeeze on other governments in Glasgow on Thursday to sign one of the overlapping plethora of anti-coal pledges and funding programs. \' Energy day' The British government said the announcements due on day four of the COP26 summit - dubbed "energy day" - could eliminate more than 40 gigawatts of coal-fired power across 20 countries. In a statement released late on Wednesday, the British government said there had been a 76 per cent cut in the number of new coal plants planned worldwide over the past six years, cancelling 1000 GW of coal-fired power since the Paris Agreement. Several side-deals on coal have also been signed. The most eye-catching was the $US8.5 billion ($11.4 billion) partnership in which the US, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union will help South Africa speed its exit from coal dependence. This is seen as a demonstration project for how to support developing countries with their coal phase-out. Indonesia and the Philippines have both inked agreements with the Asian Development Bank to retire their coal plants ahead of schedule, with more individual deals expected on Thursday. Money to switch Britain is deploying \£3200 million ($365 million) under a new climate investment fund to help India, South Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines accelerate their coal transition, while a group of rich countries will use another CIF program to bolster renewables in Ukraine, Fiji, Colombia, Kenya and Mali. Environmentalists were positive about the announcements, seizing on the pledges to try to up the pressure on more reluctant nations. "The tranche of country commitments has been enabled by serious donor money, combined with new mechanisms and tools to help the world's coal-burning countries turn their back on the most polluting fossil fuel," said Leo Roberts, a research manager at think tank E3G. "The breadth and depth of announcements and initiatives being announced on Thursday are an indication of how rapidly the shift away from coal is gathering pace. ... Conditions are ripe for a global coal exit." The International Energy Agency, whose boss Fatih Birol met Mr Morrison on the margins of COP26 this week, has said that investment in coal, oil and gas must end if the world is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, which is required to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. The only difficulty for Britain is that its government is still considering opening a new metallurgical coal mine in Cumbria, where Mr Johnson's Conservative Party holds a marginal seat. The \£3165 million mine is backed by Melbourne-based EMR Capital, a private equity group set up and run by Oxiana founder and former Rio Tinto executive Owen Hegarty. A final HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/europe/uk-opens-probe-into-307m-australian-backed-mine-20210907-p58pov public inquiry into the mine began in September, and will not report until well after COP26 . Mr Johnson broke his long silence on the project at the weekend, saying he personally was "not in favour of more coal" - but that approval was "a decision for the planning authorities". \</doc>

ABSTRACT COP26 ended with a fizzle, not a bang. FULL TEXT The COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-15/cop26-phase-down-coal-agreement-not-end-of-industry-says-pm/100621242 for decades to come Yes Prime Minister episode, only real and nowhere near as entertaining". "Global warming is not a problem that will be fixed with the tools that caused it," he tells SmartCompany . Ilea Buffier, director of Evalua8 Sustainability, a tech company that helps businesses reduce their carbon footprint, says she didn't have huge expectations from the conference. However she remains "eternally optimistic", pointing out some considerable wins that came from the event. For example, the international financial standards board set up an international sustainability standards board, which will bring in financial-style accounting standards to carbon accounting. That will bring greater accountability and stronger benchmarks, meaning businesses can no longer get away with 'greenwashing', or claiming to be more environmentally sound than they actually are. It also means larger businesses will have to report on the HYPERLINK https://www.smartcompany.com.au/sustainability/three-ways-businesses-sustainable-beyond-net-zero/ credentials of their SME suppliers, putting pressure on small businesses to clean up their own act, and meaning those already doing their bit will be more likely to secure contracts. "That's really going to filter down and affect everybody, including small businesses," Buffier says. But perhaps more importantly, COP26 brought the conversation about climate change to the front pages of the papers and to the forefront of everyone's minds. "When world leaders come together to discuss an issue, everyone is compelled to listen," Cicada Innovations chief executive Sally-Ann Williams tells SmartCompany . It got individuals and business owners thinking about what their role is in tackling climate change, she adds. That is momentum we can build upon to continue to influence politicians and large carbon-emitting companies. "We just need governments to follow suit," Heuzenroeder says. The role of startups and SMEs In many ways, for the tech companies and SMEs that have been working on tackling climate change, much of what happened at COP26 doesn't change a thing. Heuzenroeder says it's not the government that will move the needle here, but small businesses and the consumers that use their purchasing power to back those doing the right thing. [related-story id="220903"] On a practical level, SMEs are more adaptable to change than larger organisations, and it's much easier for them to conduct a CO2 audit or offset their carbon footprint. "Reaching net-zero is a relatively simple process for them to undertake." As Buffier points out, businesses also have their own consumer power. They can take climate impact into account when choosing their own suppliers, big or small, opting for green energy providers for example. Williams notes that many businesses have been doing their bit in one way or another since way before this conference, and they will continue to. SMEs are collectively the biggest employers in Australia. They may not have the individual power of larger corporations, but together they have some clout. The tech and business communities are super-conscious of their role and their influence in shaping the future, "despite the government's ambivalence," Williams says. Equally, neither business owners nor individuals need the permission of a bunch of pollies in Glasgow to act, she adds. "The question is will we choose to do so? We don't need permission, just conviction." \</doc>

China and the United States have announced a joint initiative at COP26 to deliver enhanced climate action in the coming decade, with a surprise show of cooperation between the rivals and the world's two biggest greenhouse-gas emitters. The plan is light on concrete targets but heavy on political symbolism at a conference that began with the US and China seemingly at loggerheads. The announcement came as the crunch COP26 summit in Glasgow entered its pivotal final days, with negotiators wrestling over ways to limit global warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. "Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action," Xie Zhenhua, Beijing's longtime climate envoy told the summit. Xie said the plan would involve "concrete plans" for enhanced action this decade and that both the US and China were ready "to work on the finalisation of the Paris Agreement rulebook" at the UN climate summit in Glasgow. A wording of the declaration that appeared online shortly after the announcement said both countries "recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis". "They are committed to tackling it through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s," the document said. It said the US and China considered work to slash their emissions of methane - a potent greenhouse gas - this decade "a necessity". The 2015 Paris accord commits nations to work towards limiting global temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C through sweeping emissions cuts. Xie said that China and the US had carried out 30 virtual meetings over the course of the last 10 months to come up with the initiative. "As the two major powers in the world, China and the United States have to take on the responsibility to work together with other parties to address climate change," he said. Joe Biden's climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, told reporters the countries had committed to a series of "important actions" which would pave the way for future generations. "The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade," Mr Kerry said "Our teams have worked together for months, and we have worked in good faith. We have found common ground. "The steps we're taking, we believe, can answer questions about the pace at which China is going and help China and the US and others be able to accelerate their efforts." The China-US joint action has suddenly put immense pressure on the Scott Morrison government to accelerate Australia's carbon emission reductions this decade. During the Glasgow summit Australia has been missing from the pledges to reduce export and use of coal, pointing out that the United States has also bypassed that particular pledge. Australia was also missing from signing up to reducing methane gas. But with the US sending such a clear signal, along with China, about the fresh urgency of the next few years in reducing global warming, Australia is looking increasingly isolated among its closest of allies. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres tweeted that the US-China accord was "an important step in the right direction". Last week US President Joe Biden said President Xi had "walked away" from the climate crisis for skipping the COP26 summit. China hit back at the time, but ties appear to have thawed ahead of long awaited bilateral talks next week. "The release of this joint declaration shows that cooperation is the only choice for China and the US," said Xie. Delegates in Glasgow are negotiating how to implement the Paris Agreement temperature goals, in addition to how vulnerable nations can be helped to fight climate change. The United Nations said that all countries emissions cutting plans, taken together, were currently set to warm Earth 2.7C by 2100. The US-China deal comes as Boris Johnson told world leaders to "pick up the phone and give negotiators the space to manoeuvre'' and agree to the most ambitious COP26 statement possible. In a veiled criticism of Australia, as well as other nations like China, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia who have been less than forthcoming in agreeing to urgent new 2030 targets, the British Prime Minister said some countries were "conspicuously patting themselves on the back" for signing up to the Paris climate accord but doing too little at Glasgow to improve their offer. Negotiators from 197 countries are currently debating the wording and emphasis of the "cover statement' to be delivered at the end of COP26 , possibly on Friday evening or over the weekend. In the first draft, the seven-page document urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". The request for new targets are aimed at countries like Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh short term plans on the table by the end of next year, which for Australia, falls after the general election. The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fiercely try and keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set any time frames or specific targets on this point. Australia, like the United States, has refused to sign up to a pledge to phase out coal mining. With AFP \</doc>

At COP26 in Glasgow, the announcements came so fast there was barely time to give each proper scrutiny before the next arrived. I've attended many United Nations climate change conferences, but this fortnight felt different. The feeling of momentum was palpable. Countries that in past years fought tooth-and-nail against stronger action stepped up with new commitments. Many of them joined an array of new partnerships and alliances struck in the first week. As I write, negotiators are locked in tense talks to try and land the final COP26 agreement. But whether the summit succeeds or fails doesn't depend solely on the decisions reached this week. From the outset, COP26 was seen not as an end point, but a kickstart to a decade of truly transformative action. Only in coming years will we know if the event was a real game-changer for the planet, or just empty promises and spin. COP26 : a journey, not a destination The UK government, as the conference hosts, knew early on that most countries would bring new climate ambition - known in COP-speak as "nationally determined contributions". But it also knew these pledges would never be be enough. For COP26 First were a series of side deals to kick things along. These came in the form of a new global pledge to reduce emissions of methane - a highly potent greenhouse gas - as well as deals on coal phase-out, deforestation, climate finance and more. Second, countries would have to further ratchet up their commitments in coming years. That means the final negotiated outcome of COP26 , due on Friday Glasgow time, must require nations to make immediate further increases in emission-reduction ambition. As I write, that outcome is uncertain at best. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3.pdf first draft of the final agreement urges countries that didn't bring a new and stronger 2030 target to Glasgow - such as Australia - to do so within a year. Read more: Take heart at what's unfolded at COP26 in Glasgow - the world can still hold global heating to 1.5? Perhaps unsurprisingly, Australia is among a group of nations working to have that part of the text softened, or removed from the final agreement entirely. That is a worrying sign, though there will be many other countries fighting hard to ensure it stays in. Negotiators have spent countless hours arguing over the minutiae of the final text, and there's still a way to go yet. But if the final agreement is too weak, the 1.5? goal is at serious risk. The draft wording is weaker than that sought by a group of 50 of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-fate-of-our-planet-depends-on-the-next-few-days-of-complex-diplomacy-in-glasgow-heres-what-needs-to-go-right-171501 which want national commitments to be reviewed and strengthened each year between now and 2025. However, the wording is still stronger than many observers anticipated. And while COP26 Australia outdid itself Being an Australian at international climate talks is rarely a comfortable experience. Australia long ago cemented its reputation as a drag on global climate cooperation - known for its weak targets, obstructive approach and demands for special treatment. However, even seasoned observers have been taken aback by Australia's actions before and during COP26 Australia went to Glasgow as just about the only developed country without a new and significantly stronger 2030 emissions reduction target. The Morrison government then proceeded to use the Australia pavilion inside the COP venue to promote the interests of fossil fuel companies such as Santos. Australia also refused to sign up to two signature deals at COP26 - the global pledge to cut methane emissions, and one to HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/end-of-coal-in-sight-at-cop26/ phase out coal-fired power. Read more: The fate of our planet depends on the next few days of complex diplomacy in Glasgow. Here's what needs to go right Despite Australia's recalcitrance, the coal pledge, in particular, is a big step forward in global terms. In years past, nations HYPERLINK https://www.poweringpastcoal.org/ agreeing to a coal phase-out were not particularly reliant on coal. This time, signatories included big coal-using nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland, the Ukraine and South Korea. One energy-related announcement in Glasgow was particularly important for Australia. Japan and South Korea, the second and third biggest buyers of Australian liquified natural gas (LNG) both signalled their desire to HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/korea-japan-signal-rush-to-exit-lng-but-woodside-boss-still-upbeat-20211109-p5974f shift to hydrogen and renewables. This development, among others, makes one thing abundantly clear: the world is moving fast while Australia stands still. Sooner rather than later, Australia will feel the cost of its inaction - not just in the hit to our international reputation, but in foregone economic opportunities in the clean industries of the future. 'Try harder. Try harder' International climate talks can feel far removed from the urgent reality of the climate crisis. But at every COP, someone invariably manages to cut through the noise with a brutally honest and rousing contribution. This year it was Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, who at the outset of the conference HYPERLINK https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/barbados-pm-mia-mottley-climate-change-speech-glasgow-cop26-biden-modi-johnson-4402184.html excoriated leaders for failing on the promises of the Paris Agreement. Mottley's commanding eight-minute speech was a show-stopping moment. As world leaders including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looked on, Mottley declared a 2? increase in global temperatures would be a "death sentence" for small developing island nations. She went on: For those who have eyes to see. For those who have ears to listen. And for those who have a heart to feel ... We do not want that dreaded death sentence, and we have come here today to say 'Try harder. Try harder'. HYPERLINK surprise pact between the US and China - in which the two nations recognised climate change as an "existential threat" - is a case in point. But the summit's final outcome is still likely to fall massively short of what the science demands. The real test of COP26 is whether pledges are honoured, and if the talks have triggered a virtuous cycle of increased ambition and action over the next decade.

Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest has taken aim at the fossil fuel industry over its promotion of "blue hydrogen", saying it is just an excuse to keep coal and gas projects in the energy grid for longer. Dr Forrest, who has toured the east coast this week spruiking the hydrogen industry and his company, Fortescue Future Industries, said "green hydrogen" powered by renewable energy was the only way to go to reduce Australia's carbon emissions. It comes as Australia's second-richest person said it would be a "copout" if Prime Minister Scott Morrison didn't attend the COP26 summit in Glasgow next month. Mr Morrison has yet to commit to flying to the Scotland summit with other world leaders, as he attempts to navigate an updated climate policy through the Coalition party room. Dr Forrest, who accused Nationals MPs of "scaremongering" about the impact on rural Australia of the nation adopting a target of net zero emissions by 2050, said it was a no-brainer for the PM to be in Glasgow. COP26 , for all parties - Matt [Canavan], Scott [Morrison], Barnaby [Joyce], everybody, the Labor Party, come on in, Greens, get with us - to show unity and give Australians the choices they want and that they deserve," he told the National Press Club yesterday. "And our Prime Minister, please, sir, be at COP26 . We need our leadership to be selling Australia's massive green energy potential at COP26 , not be a copout at home." Dr Forrest, whose personal fortune was valued at $27.2 billion in the AFR Rich List this year, acknowledged there were critics of his new green energy evangelism given he made his billions by exporting iron ore to the world while emitting millions of tonnes of carbon in the process. However, he said it was better for emission-intensive industries, such as Fortescue Metals Group, to lead from the front in cutting carbon emissions. The company had pledged to be net zero by 2030. "Now I'm making my company, if you like, the one out the front, with the arrows in the back. People like you can shoot them," he said. Last Sunday, Dr Forrest announced Fortescue Future Industries would build a $1 billion electrolyser factory in Gladstone for hydrogen projects in Australia and for exports, with a $114 million commitment for the first phase. Dr Forrest was also by the side of NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet and Energy Minister Matt Kean on Wednesday to announce the government's $3 billion hydrogen strategy, including financial incentives for companies, which he says might tempt Fortescue Future Industries to build a green hydrogen plant in the state. The Fortescue boss said "blue hydrogen" projects - powered by coal or gas - might still be hydrogen, "but it's got carbon all through it". "Like clean coal or cancer-free cigarettes, these are misleading sound bites by industries wanting to keep their social licence to operate," he said. "Let's keep fossil fuels going, but only as long as we need to." Dr Forrest said he was "enormously concerned" that Australia had not yet formally committed to a net zero emissions target by 2050, saying investors will steer clear of the nation. "I'm delighted all states and territories in Australia have a net zero target ... every state and territory, by 2050. But Australia as a nation still does not. And that, for me, is an enormous concern. \</doc>

ABSTRACT Australia has made a joint statement to address climate change with Vietnam, while also agreeing to an economic strategy. FULL TEXT Australia has made a joint statement to address climate change with Vietnam, on the sidelines of the UN climate conference in Glasgow, while also agreeing to an economic strategy.\~ Prime minister Scott Morrison and Vietnamese prime minister Pham Minh Chinh met this week to discuss "a pragmatic approach to climate change action" in line with each country's "unique situation", Morrison said.\~ "The joint statement reflects our nations' results-oriented approach to COP26 and our focus on practical efforts to achieve climate targets, including areas for cooperation as we transition to a low emissions future," Morrison said.\~ Both countries are committed to the rapid take-up of renewables, the leaders said, and to meeting ambitions for net-zero.\~ "We reaffirmed our common energy and climate challenges, which included the need to achieve climate targets while supporting energy security," Morrison said of the meeting.\~ Alongside Australia's joint statement with Vietnam, the two countries also finalised an Australia-Vietnam Enhance Economic Engagement Strategy.\~ Morrison said the strategy "sets out a detailed roadmap to deliver our joint ambition to become top 10 trading partners and double two-way investment".\~ The strategy will be released in the coming weeks. Australia last week HYPERLINK secured an agreement Meanwhile at the conference, Australia has also bowed out of an international pledge to reduce methane emissions, as more than 100 other countries agree to cut the greenhouse gas by 30% by 2030. Energy minister Angus Taylor told the COP26 conference that Australia's focus was on reaching net-zero overall rather than setting targets for specific sectors.\~ "It's the entirety of gases that matters," Taylor said.\~ READ MORE: https://www.themandarin.com.au/161828-asean-australia-taskforce-seize-19m-illegal-cigarettes/ ASEAN-Australia taskforce seize 19m illegal cigarettes \</doc>

The world's two biggest carbon-polluting countries, China and the United States, have agreed to work together to redouble efforts to fight climate change. In a surprise joint statement issued at the COP26 climate talks in Scotland, the two countries said the deal called for\~for "enhanced climate action in the 2020s" using the 2015 Paris climate deal's guidelines,\~including a new stronger emission cuts target in 2025. The agreement calls for "concrete and pragmatic'' regulations in decarbonisation, reducing methane emissions and fighting deforestation. "Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris agreement," China's chief negotiator Xie Zhenhua said. "So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations. "We both see that the challenge of climate change is an existential and severe one,'' Mr Xie added. "We will take our due responsibilities and work together.'' US climate envoy John Kerry said the agreement was a statement of support for a successful\~climate summit, with both countries taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. The surprise joint announcement from the geopolitical rivals could put further pressure on Australia to strengthen its targets in the medium term. HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-11/draft-cop26-agreement-calls-on-countries-to-boost-2030-targets/100611260 The first draft of the HYPERLINK COP26 agreement released by host nation the United Kingdom \~urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". Australia committed to net zero by 2050 coming into COP26 , but its formal target of reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 remained the same as when it was set in Paris in 2015, when Tony Abbott was prime minister. Australia's contributions at the major Glasgow talks HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-08/scott-morrison-cop26-doesnt-understand-urgency-climate-change/100602228 have been labelled "disappointing" by a top UK advisor , and HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-05/australia-morrison-criticised-cop26-coal-macron-stoush-qa/100596086 the country has been called a "pariah" by climate justice lawyers .

After two hard-fought weeks of negotiations, the Glasgow climate change summit is, at last, over. All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from "phasing out" coal to "phasing down". In an emotional final speech, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised for this last-minute change. His apology goes to the heart of the goals of COP26 in Glasgow: the hope it would deliver outcomes matching the urgent "code red" action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/un-secretary-general-cop26-must-keep-15-degrees-celsius-goal-alive urged countries to "keep the goal of 1.5? alive", to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, and to phase out coal. So, was COP26 HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/ stated goals , the answer is yes, it fell short. Two big ticket items weren't realised: renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5?, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal. But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let's take a look at the summit's defining issues. Weak 2030 targets The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2? this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5?. Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters. But HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1? - or 2.4? if only 2030 targets are met. Read more: COP26 HYPERLINK announcements , this nation's 2030 target HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx. remains the same as in 2015. If all countries HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/targets/ adopted such meagre near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3?. Technically, the 1.5? limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year's time. However, as Sharma said, "the pulse of 1.5 is weak". And as Australia's experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022. Phase down, not out India's intervention to change the final wording to "phase down" coal rather than "phase out" dampens the urgency to shift away from coal. India is the world's HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-india third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2019 grow by 4.6% each year to 2024. India was the most prominent objector to the "phase out" wording, but also had support from China. Read more: COP26 And US climate envoy https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/climate/john-kerry-fossil-fuel-subsidies.html John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further, to trap emissions at the source and store them underground. Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and https://bv.fapesp.br/en/publicacao/157440/an-assessment-of-ccs-costs-barriers-and-potential/ we don't yet know if captured emissions stored underground will eventually return to the atmosphere. And around the world, HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01175-7 relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist. And it's hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with HYPERLINK https://blog.csiro.au/2020-gencost cheap renewable energy. In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalised rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement. However under the rules, the fossil fuel industry HYPERLINK will be allowed to "offset" its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the "phasing down" change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue. It wasn't all bad Despite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf 45% by 2030 , relative to 2010 levels. What's more, Article 21 of the Glasgow Climate Pact nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030. The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. It also HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf emphasises the importance HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/enhanced-transparency-framework#eq-9 of transparency in implementing the pledges. Nations are also invited to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022. In support of this, it was HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf agreed to hold a high-level ministerial roundtable meeting each year focused on raising ambition out to 2030. The HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/12/us-china-cop26-climate-carbon-superpower US and China climate agreement Despite the world not being on track for the 1.5? goal, momentum is headed in the right direction. And the mere fact that a reduction in coal use was directly addressed in the final text signals change may be possible. But whether it comes in the small window we have left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.

\~\~ New technology aircraft and jet fuel made from waste: the global air transport industry has outlined how to meet its new long-term climate goal during Transport Day events at the UN COP26 in Glasgow. This confirms the commitment of the world's airlines, airports, air traffic management and the makers of aircraft and engines [ HYPERLINK http://www.aviationbenefits.org/FlyNetZero http://www.aviationbenefits.org/FlyNetZero ] to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in support of the Paris Agreement. Aviation is one of the only sectors to have made such a global commitment. \~\~ Analysis detailed in the Waypoint 2050 [ HYPERLINK http://www.aviationbenefits.org/W2050 http://www.aviationbenefits.org/W2050 ]report outlines credible paths for the air transport sector to reach net-zero carbon. The industry says a mix of new technology including potentially shifting to electricity and hydrogen for some shorter services; improvements in operations and infrastructure; and a transition to sustainable aviation fuel by mid-century would provide a majority of the carbon reductions. Remaining emissions could be captured using carbon removals measures. \~\~ Speaking at a COP26 event with the UK Government today, Haldane Dodd, Acting Executive Director of the Air Transport Action Group said: "Aviation has increased its ambition in line with the need for all sectors of the economy to pursue rigorous climate action. Despite having endured the greatest crisis in aviation history, this net-zero 2050 goal shows that our sector has placed climate action as one of its highest priorities." \~\~ A complete shift away from fossil fuels for air transport around mid-century would be possible, with sustainable aviation fuels made from waste resources and rotational cover crops gradually transitioning towards fuels generated from low-carbon electricity. Importantly, the shift to sustainable fuels will enable green energy industry opportunities in nearly every country, sustaining up to 14 million jobs worldwide. \~\~ "Our analysis shows several scenarios, with new technology options such as electric and hydrogen aircraft for the short-haul fleet, to a complete shift to sustainable aviation fuel for medium- and long-haul operations. We have identified the building blocks needed and the scale of the challenge is substantial, but with supportive government policy and the backing of the energy sector, it can be done." \~\~ "National government policy measures focused on innovation and energy transition are vital. We also urge the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to support adoption of a long-term climate goal at the 41st ICAO Assembly in 2022, in line with industry commitments."

Glasgow: China and the United States have made a shock joint statement at the Glasgow climate talks, declaring climate change to be an existential crisis demanding co-operation between the superpowers. Addressing a press conference at the COP26 summit, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua unveiled a joint-declaration designed to "enhance climate action in the 2020s" and said the two nations were determined to tackle global warming with "concrete and pragmatic" co-operation. "Co-operation is the only choice for both China and the United States," Xie told reporters via a translator. "By working together, our two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries, but to the world as a whole. As two major powers in the world, China and the US shoulders special international responsibilities and obligations. "We need to think big and feel responsible. We need to work hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world." The announcement is a huge boost to the United Nations talks and is a sharp contrast to US President Joe Biden's blunt criticism of China over climate change only last week. Xie said Beijing and Washington would work together on emissions reductions, and share technology and expertise on clean energy, decarbonisation and electrification to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. The climate envoy described climate change as an "existential crisis" and said agreement between the US and China on how to deal with global warming far outweighed their differences on the issue. Biden's own climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, framed the surprise agreement as a major milestone which would give the COP26 talks much-needed momentum. "The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade," Kerry told reporters in Glasgow. "Our teams have worked together for months, and we have worked in good faith. We have found common ground." Kerry described the joint-declaration was a "roadmap for our present and future collaboration" on climate change. "It declares specifically and identifies the need to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy," Kerry said. "Secondly, it commits to a series of important actions, not out in the long-term but now, in this decade where it's needed." Releasing the joint declaration, Xie said the statement was the result of the "spirit and instructions of our two presidents" and the product 30 virtual meetings between teams of Chinese and American officials, as well as meetings in Shanghai, London and Washington, before finally reaching an agreement in Glasgow on Wednesday afternoon local-time. "To ensure a successful COP26 and to facilitate an outcome that is both ambitious and balanced, we will stick to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and take into consideration the respective national circumstances," he said. "We have reached a consensus regarding either the Paris framework and also the Paris temperature control goals as well as climate finance. We are committed to work jointly and with other parties, facilitating the finalisation of Paris Agreement rulebook in order to build global carbon markets also and also enhance transparency." He added that China and America had reached consensus over 2030 targets, Paris climate control goals and the contentious area of finance for developing nations. He noted that the US states had developed a plan to reduce methane emissions and said the China will follow suit. "We also encourage joint research in this regard." "Climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity. It bears on the wellbeing of future generations. "Climate change is becoming increasingly urgent and severe."

The latest draft of the COP26 UN climate talks features a proposal to make sure rich countries deliver climate finance to the world's poorest nations in future years, after past promises remain unfulfilled. The new draft agreement also maintained a core demand for countries to set more ambitious plans to tackle global warming and asked them to phase out inefficient subsidies for the fossil fuels heating the planet. Rich nations, whose emissions are responsible for the majority of human-caused climate change, failed to meet a long-held promise to deliver US$100 billion (A$137bn) a year by 2020 to support poorer countries' efforts to cope with the effects of global warming. That has cast a shadow over the summit, making other negotiations on carbon markets and strengthening climate targets harder to unblock, with some poorer nations saying they cannot cut emissions faster unless they get more financial help. The draft proposal, one of many drawn up by Britain to be published at the end of COP26 , asks a UN committee to report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion, and proposes government ministers meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. The regular check-ins would attempt to keep up pressure on rich countries to fulfil promises to mobilise the cash. The British proposal also asks countries to increase their contributions to deliver the $100 billion. Rich countries expect to deliver the US$100 billion in 2023, although some have suggested it could be met next year. A second draft document published on Saturday morning local time would kick off talks among countries to set a post-2025 target on climate finance. The US$100 billion target should be delivered each year from 2020 to 2025, after which a new one is supposed to kick in. The second proposal asks countries, civil society groups and the private sector to weigh in next year on the new goal, and would launch a work programme to develop the post-2025 target, led by a developed country and a developing country, from 2022-2024. African countries have said the new goal should reach US$1.3 trillion (A$1.7tn) by 2030 to reflect the spiralling costs of worsening droughts, floods and other climate-related disasters in the world's poorest nations. That is aside from potential economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters. ABC/Reuters \</doc>

As the UN climate summit in Glasgow kicks off on Sunday, it marks the deadline for countries to make more ambitious pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ COP26 ) to the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/ UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and is being heralded as the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/uk-presidency/what-is-a-cop/ last best chance to avoid devastating temperature rise that would endanger billions of people and disrupt the planet's life-support systems. New Zealand will be represented by the climate minister and Green Party co-leader, James Shaw, along with a https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/451996/shaw-says-cop26-conference-most-important-since-paris-agreement slimmed-down team of diplomats HYPERLINK global net zero , protecting communities and natural habitats and mobilising finance to adequately respond to the climate crisis. This is the time for New Zealand to commit to delivering on its fair share of what is necessary to avoid runaway global warming. To understand why COP26 is so important we need to look back to a previous summit, COP21 in 2015, which resulted in the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement . Countries agreed to work together to keep global warming well below 2? and to aim for no more than 1.5?. They also agreed to publish plans to show how much they would reduce emissions and to update these pledges every five years - which is what should be happening at the Glasgow summit. Collectively, current climate pledges (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs NDCs ) continue to fall a long way short of limiting global warming to 1.5?. Many countries have HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/ failed to keep pace Read more: COP26 : 4 ways rich nations can keep promises to curb emissions and fund climate adaptation Time to raise climate ambition On our current trajectory, global temperature is likely to increase well above the 2? upper limit of the Paris Agreement. New Zealand has agreed to take ambitious action to meet the 1.5? target. But its current pledge (to bring emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030) will not achieve this. If all countries followed New Zealand's present commitments, global warming would HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/new-zealand/ reach up to 3? . The government has committed to increase New Zealand's NDC - after receiving advice from the Climate Change Commission that its current pledge is not consistent with the 1.5? goal - but has not yet outlined a figure.

The HYPERLINK Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act , enacted in 2019, requires greenhouse gas emissions (other than biogenic methane) to reach net zero by 2050. Only a handful of other countries have enshrined such a goal in law. The act also established the HYPERLINK https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/ Climate Change Commission HYPERLINK https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/our-work/advice-to-government-topic/inaia-tonu-nei-a-low-emissions-future-for-aotearoa/ independent advice to the government on emissions budgets and an emissions reduction plan for 2022-2025. But much more needs to be done, and quickly, if we are to meet our international commitments and fulfil our domestic targets. Climate Change Commission recommendations around the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, reduction in animal stocking rates and changing land use towards forestry and horticulture provide some key places to focus on. COP26 begins, New Zealand should announce a more ambitious climate pledge, one stringent enough to meet the 1.5? target. Announcing a sufficiently bold NDC at COP26 will provide much-needed leadership and encouragement for other countries to follow suit. It will also act as a clear signpost for what our domestic emissions policies are aiming for, by when and why. But, no matter what New Zealand's revised NDC says, much work will remain to ensure we make good on our commitments and give the climate crisis the attention it demands.

The absence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the upcoming COP26 climate talks would be significant, even though Australian leaders do not attend each of the annual summits. "We haven't made any final decisions about [attending COP26 ]. I mean it is another trip overseas and I've been on several this year and spent a lot of time in quarantine," Morrison told The West Australian newspaper. "I have to focus on things here and with COVID. Australia will be opening up around that time, there will be a lot of issues to manage and I have to manage those competing demands." Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor has confirmed he will attend, but not Foreign Minister Marise Payne. "It's not a no-show at the conference. Australia will be strongly represented at the conference, no matter by which senior Australian representative," she told ABC Radio. "One thing we are absolutely committed to is setting out our long-term emissions reduction plan prior to the COP and that is what we are focused on as a government." This is true, but the importance of COP26 to the world, and to Australia's key allies cannot be overstated. The talks are seen as the last chance for the world to come to an agreement on emission reductions that may put it on track to hold warming to 1.5 degrees, after which scientists fear tipping points may be triggered that could lead to the climate spiralling out of control. At present about 100 world leaders are expected to attend the talks, and the schedule has been structured specifically to make it easier for leaders of major economies to do so. COP26 co-hosts Italy have scheduled G20 talks to be held in Rome on October 30 and 31 specifically so that leaders can fly directly to Glasgow for the start of the conference. In Glasgow, the British government is hosting leaders' meetings on November 1 and 2 to bookend the Rome talks. Britain and the United States, Australia's allies in the new AUKUS security pact, have both made it clear that they consider success at COP26 to be a top priority. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week to urge world leaders to make it a success. "In just 40 days' time, we need the world to come to Glasgow to make the commitments [to keep warming to 1.5 degrees]," he said. He has personally invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to attend. COP meetings - the acronym stands for Conference of Parties, referring to signatories of the UN's climate treaty - are held annually and are not normally attended by the majority of world leaders. But leaders do normally attend those meetings at which key negotiations over national emissions targets are to take place. Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd attended talks in Bali in 2007 to recommit Australia to the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen summit in December 2009 where a new level of global ambition was agreed upon. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull travelled to France in 2015 to commit Australia to a climate treaty that became the Paris Agreement and to lock in Australia's goal of reductions fo 26 to 28 per cent of emissions.

Just hours after the Queen made it clear she was unamused by the number of world leaders yet to confirm their attendance at the Glasgow climate talks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced he would attend. But the identities of around 120 other leaders that the UK organisers of COP26 say will attend are still mostly unknown. US President Joe Biden has said he will be there, but it so far appears unlikely that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will, as he has not left China since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Without the commitment of these two nations - respectively the largest historical greenhouse gas emitter and the current one - it is believed the talks cannot succeed in curbing warming. It is also not yet known if the leaders of a handful of other high-emitting nations, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro will attend the conference, which typically attracts over 20,000 dignitaries, diplomats, negotiators, scientists and activists. In his final major speech before the talks begin, the incoming COP president, UK cabinet minister Alok Sharma, appealed directly to world leaders to attend. " COP26 is not a photo op, nor a talking shop," he said on Tuesday. "It must be the forum where we put the world on track to deliver on climate and that is down to leaders. It is the leaders who made a promise to the world in Paris six years ago, and it is leaders who must honour it." Some leaders have been distracted by pressing domestic issues, but it is telling that many lead countries widely viewed as climate laggards, said Dr Wesley Morgan, researcher at the Climate Council and research fellow at Griffith Asia Institute. Others had travel disrupted by pandemic travel restrictions, particularly small Pacific island nations most vulnerable to climate change. To ensure they have a presence, some Pacific island nations will be represented by a delegation of five Political Climate Champions, who include Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown, Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum and Tuvalu's Minister for Finance and Climate Change Seve Paeniu. The five were selected by the Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific. Pacific Islands Forum secretary general Henry Puna said earlier this month there was no meeting greater for the region than COP26 . "The stakes are high because climate change is an existential threat to our people, and we know this COP is the final opportunity to keep the 1.5 degrees threshold within reach and avoid a tipping point of no return," he said. "That's why COP26 is critical. World leaders, like our Pacific leaders, must affirm climate change as the single greatest threat facing all humanity and act with urgency to implement the Paris Agreement." \</doc>

Whether we are consciously aware of it or not, we negotiate in every aspect of our daily lives - whether it be persuading a child to eat its vegetables, haggling over a property price, or discussing the terms of a job offer. Negotiation can be viewed as "back-and-forth communication designed to reach an agreement when you and the other side have some interests that are shared and others that are opposed". Although we negotiate every day, doing so successfully is often challenging because the context is always different: what you stand to gain or lose, the people involved and their chosen tactics will all differ from one situation to another. Multi-lateral negotiations which involve a large and diverse group of countries - especially those covering such complex issues as COP26 - are particularly challenging. Psychological factors must be taken into account for this type of negotiating scenario, where the outcome is so important to the future of the entire global community. Previously, negotiation research has mainly focused on HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001985011730130X?via%3Dihub strategies and tactics One HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103119304524 recent study showed how a co-operative tone of conversation increases the chance of a favourable deal and improve relationships. It does not have to be a choice between maximising your own success or having a satisfied opponent. A conversational strategy can help negotiators achieve both. Managing emotions is also key to negotiation tactics. Anger HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927059 can often harm negotiations HYPERLINK zero-sum bias , where some parties see negotiations in purely competitive rather than co-operative terms. This way of thinking causes people to believe that for one person to gain something, someone else must lose something equivalent, which can lead to an antagonistic negotiation. Successful negotiators usually recognise the importance of psychological factors, and are able to tailor their tactics to the various obstacles. It is crucial to build rapport with other parties, and establish more co-operative approaches so that both sides can achieve a win-win solution. This is borne out through long-term relationships rather than one-off wins, as most negotiations occur within ongoing relationships. The challenge of COP26 negotiations There are HYPERLINK https://sdgacademy.org/ several obstacles that make international negotiations on climate change extremely challenging - but there are still clear reasons to play the game. Although climate action is a long-term process - and we are unlikely to see improvements for decades - global leaders know that short-term inaction, while easier, may be a very costly gamble. This is delayed gratification - resisting the temptation of a smaller but more immediate pleasure to obtain a larger, valuable and long-lasting reward later on. A series of HYPERLINK classical studies revealed that overcoming such resistance is far from easy for most people. There will always be the temptation to give up on climate action, given the enormous uncertainties of the associated costs and gains, and the huge challenges involved. Other issues also influence the tactics of the negotiators from each nation. HYPERLINK http://wer.worldeconomicsassociation.org/files/WEA-WER-5-Erturk-Whittle.pdf While some countries are extremely rich, others are desperately poor. Developing nations may claim that climate change was "caused" by rich developed nations and so the onus is on them to find a solution. Some countries, especially small island states, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and quite reasonably fear that they will disappear under rising oceans in just a few decades. Other countries face severe and repeated droughts, while tropical areas suffer unprecedented rainfalls. In parallel, countries sitting on large reserves of fossil fuels claim the right to use and profit from their own resources, but others argue for an equal share of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions or simply insist on renewable alternatives. These multiple asymmetries can lead to very HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2017.1341372?journalCode=tcpo20 different points of view But psychology can potentially help leaders to forge an effective plan which is so crucial for the future of our planet. Negotiators from each country should try to understand what is at stake for their counterparts to facilitate negotiation. They can look to provide alternatives as part of a problem-solving process instead of simply competing over an agreement. As climate co-operation is not a zero-sum game in which one's own interests conflict directly with counterparts, negotiators need to frame the negotiation co-operatively to seek pragmatic solutions to "stretch the pie" - increasing the value that all sides can claim from the negotiation. Most important of all is the issue of trust. Delegates at the table will be expected to commit to a series of agreements that they cannot be sure that other nations will uphold. This relates to a social game theory such as the HYPERLINK https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/short-term-solution-to-tackle-climate-change prisoner's dilemma where rational players might not co-operate even though it would be in their combined best interest to do so. But they should not see climate negotiation in this way. Global leaders need to find a solution where the agreed international climate co-operation agenda can be monitored, remain transparent and be verified as part of negotiations. COP is an opportunity for a collective, cooperative, non-zero-sum psychological game that can achieve the dual goal of ensuring leaders meet their international obligations to our planet - and to each other - which in turn can also help to guard against the rise in nationalism which could harm future international co-operation in numerous key areas. Since COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/uk-given-fossil-of-the-day-cop26-award-for-hindering-climate-talks chaotic nature of the situation in Glasgow, especially relating to issues of non-inclusivity. Numerous criticisms have been levelled at organisers due to a lack of attendees from regions such as Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia, and the exclusion of people with HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/opinion/karine-elharrar-cop26-disability-access-eustice-b1949780.html disabilities . A co-operative approach is imperative for successful negotiation. So as COP26 enters week two, we must hope that any anger has subsided and a fully inclusive and co-operative atmosphere will prevail.

London | Prince Charles has backed the British government's call on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other world leaders to come to the "last-chance saloon" COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow and "take the decisions that are vital now". In a wide-ranging BBC interview on the grounds of the royal family's Balmoral estate in Scotland, Australia's future head of state was asked whether he had a message on climate policy for what the British journalist called a "reluctant" Morrison government. "You gently try to suggest there may be other ways of doing things," he said, before immediately voicing concern about being accused by the media of "interfering and meddling". Told that Mr Morrison's attendance at COP26 in early November was uncertain because of quarantine rules on his return to Australia, Prince Charles paused before saying: "Is that what he says, is it?" He said his message for all world leaders was that "this is a last chance-saloon, literally. Because if we don't really take the decisions that are vital now, it's going to be almost impossible to catch up". Britain's COP26 minister Alok Sharma last week said more than 100 leaders had confirmed they would attend, but Mr Morrison joins Chinese President Xi Jinping as an unconfirmed starter. Prince Charles worried, though, that the leaders who did go to COP26 would "just talk", when "the problem is to get action on the ground". The government is planning to deploy the royal family en masse at COP26 , including not only Prince Charles - with his decades-long track record of environmental activism - but also the Queen, and Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen will attend a diplomatic reception, while the two princes will address the gathering and hold personal meetings with world leaders. Speaking from his arboretum, Prince Charles used the interview to reveal his personal commitment to the cause, saying he now ran his 51-year-old Aston Martin on "surplus white wine and converted whey from the cheese-making process". He also said he refrained from eating meat and fish two days a week, and dairy once a week, lambasting the "endless perverse subsidy regimes" for intensive agriculture. Asked whether he would get on planes less often, he said he hoped "flying will become easier and more sustainable, rapidly". Prince Charles revealed strong sympathy with the frustration of activists like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion. "These young [people] feel nothing is ever happening, so of course they're going to get frustrated. I totally understand because nobody would listen, and they see their future being totally destroyed," he said. But he urged protesters not to "do it in a way that alienates people". "I totally understand the frustration; the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive than disruptive. The point is that people should notice how despairing young people really are." He praised the business community for running ahead of government on the energy transition, but said public support was needed to "unlock the vast amount of money and investment opportunity" from the private sector. Prince Charles said it was gratifying but not satisfying to now find himself on the right side of the green argument, after many years of satire. "Having been rubbished and ridiculed for so long, they suddenly want me to help them," he said. "I haven't got an axe to grind. I only want to get the whole damn thing sorted." \</doc>

Ray's reasoning As I write this, the COP26 climate conference is not yet over. I will save my commentary until it concludes, but my early misgivings about it succeeding to save the world from climate catastrophe were not allayed by the recent G20 meeting in Rome, which was billed as being about the world's climate and health. Though it did offer some meagre help to the global south in the form of increased COVID19 vaccine supplies, it failed to agree on climate goals. As many of us had hoped it would be the harbinger of pre-Glasgow good news, its failure will be my topic this week. The G20 was planned to lay the groundwork ahead of the COP26 UN summit in Glasgow, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. However, the official statement released afterwards didn't even mention net zero by 2050. Nor was there any target set for phasing out coal. The ABC noted that this was a "clear nod" to big carbon polluters China and India. Even British PM Boris Johnson said the G20 meeting didn't bode well for COP26 . He said that promises were "starting to sound hollow" and that the commitments were "drops in a rapidly warming ocean". To make the G20 outcome even gloomier, Prime Minister Scott Morrison used his final G20 remarks to defend our climate policy amid tense international scrutiny, the Guardian Australia said. His final remarks at the summit argued against the abolition of fossil fuels, for example, The Saturday Paper reported. He also pushed back against mandating action by other countries; the SMH noted, and stressed technology would solve climate change, comparing the mostly as-yet uninvented tech variously to smartphones, silicon chips, and COVID-19 vaccines. He rejected calls to set the date on ending coal-fired power stations. In more detail, the G20 summit wound up with a communique that did not include a firm commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and had only a vague commitment to "phasing out investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity ... as soon as possible". To our shame, Morrison pushed back at co-ordinated global efforts to phase out fossil fuels. In his final remarks at the G20, Morrison defended his government's climate policies in the face of sustained domestic and international criticism. While several G20 countries, including the US and UK, have pushed Australia to step up its ambition for 2030, Morrison told his peers: "Australia has already reduced its emissions by more than 20 per cent on 2005 levels, which is more than most of the countries sitting around this table." He said Australia was investing heavily in the development of new technologies "to achieve the goals that our own modelling shows will move the dial and make a net zero economy achievable, not just in Australia, but in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brazil and South Africa". Morrison also told his G20 peers that Australian investments in technology are focused on storage, sequestration, industrial processes and climate adaptation. He said many of the technologies existed now, but he acknowledged that some of the methods preferred by Australia in its net zero strategy were not yet in existence, the Guardian Australia reported. While experts say the transition to carbon neutrality requires not only technological solutions to lower emissions but also clear targets, policies and mechanisms that allow price signals facilitating efficient investment during the transition, Morrison declared in Rome that "technology at cost and scale is the answer". A number of countries, including Australia, resisted firm pledges to phase out coal. The draft communique only committed nations to "phase out and rationalise" fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and curb coal power. But this was far less than hoped. Indeed, Morrison signalled that Australia would have a significant problem with communique language hastening the demise of the coal industry. China and India were also among the countries opposed to specific commitments. While the government's political mantra for its climate policies is "technology not taxes", its preferred approach to managing the transition is bankrolled by significant taxpayer-funded expenditure. How the media fails to use this to point out that the "technology not taxes" mantra is built on such a massive lie is quite beyond me. Let's hope the voting public wakes up before the next federal election. \</doc>

\~\~In just over a week, 197 countries will gather in Glasgow, Scotland to confront the existential threat posed by climate change. \~\~ The United Nations says the COP26 summit is ?the world?s best last chance to get runaway climate change under control?. \~\~ There's still a window of opportunity to avoid chaos but it's narrow. \~\~ What is or isn't achieved by about 2030 is considered crucial to success or failure. \~\~ Here?s what is what is essential to know about the summit, what's riding on it and Australia's position. \~\~ WHAT IS COP26 : \~\~ It's short-hand for the 26th annual Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \~\~ It begins on October 31 and will be attended by thousands of delegates from most countries, including 120 world leaders.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will be among them. \~\~ Thesummit is essentially a global stocktake on climateaction. \~\~ Have countries kept thepromises they made under the 2015 Paris pact to limit warming to well below 2C and preferably to 1.5C?And what will they do next? \~\~ A key requirement of the Paris pact is that countries recommit every five years to increasingly ambitious climate action including the critical task of slashing greenhouse gas emissions. \~\~ This will happen for the first time at COP26 . \~\~ WHAT'S ON THE LINE: \~\~ Everything, according to the world?s top climate scientists. \~\~ In August, theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sixth assessment report on climate action. \~\~ The planet has already warmed about 1.1C since the Industrial Revolution and the IPCC said it's likely to hit or exceed the 1.5C limit in about a decade from now. \~\~ Under a scenario of very low emissions, Earth is still likely to reach 1.5C but the IPCC believes it will still be possible to drop back below that after a few decades. \~\~ WHY HALF OF ONE DEGREE MATTERS: \~\~ Scientific modelling shows every fraction of a degree will have an exponential effect on the health and livability of the planet. \~\~ Australia is already feeling climate change in the form of higher temperatures and more extreme weather. \~\~ Every additional fraction of a degree will increase its risk of more frequent and severe bushfires, droughts, cyclones and storms, coastal inundation and, if warming hits 2C, the loss of the Great Barrier Reef. \~\~ It would expose 61 million additional urban dwellers to drought.And small island states and low-lying countries would sink further into the rising sea, among many other devastating effects. \~\~ THE OBJECTIVES OF COP26 : \~\~ The headline objectives of the Glasgow summit are to ensure the world achieves net zero emissions by 2050 and between now and then take enough action to keep 1.5C "within reach". \~\~ Countries have been urged to present ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets by phasing out coal, rapidly switching to electric vehicles, limiting deforestation and investing heavily in renewable energy. \~\~ Another key objective is for developed countries including Australia to honour a decade-old pledge to provide $100 billion annually to help developing countries deal with climate change and decarbonise. \~\~ WHAT AUSTRALIA WILL OFFER: \~\~ Prime Minister Scott Morrison is yet to say what new climate policy commitments he will take to Glasgow. \~\~ For weeks he's been locked in a stand-off with junior coalition partner the Nationals trying to secure their support for a 2050 target of net zero emissions. \~\~ Observers believe he will get that across the line if he grantsa National Party wishlist for regional communities dependent on fossil fuel industries. \~\~ But the prime minister has ruled out what allies and neighbours have been demanding of Australia - a formal and ambitious increase to its existing pledge to cut emissions by26-28 per cent by 2030. \~\~ Mr Morrison isexpected to offer an update on projections in Glasgow showing Australia willachieve cuts of 32 per cent or higher. \~\~ But that's well short of what other developed economies have pledged for 2030 who've roughly promised to cut their emissions by about half by then. That's true of the US and EU, with the UK promising a reduction of at least68 per cent by 2030. \~\~ UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says countries need to cut carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 to be carbon neutral by the middle of the century. \~\~ UN climate envoy Selwin Hart who advises Gutteres had a blunt message for Australia earlier this year:?If G20 countries including Australia choose business-as-usual, climate change will soon send Australia?s high living standards up in flames." \~\~ Australia is the world?s largest coal exporter and second-largest gas exporter. \</doc>

The Glasgow Climate Pact urges countries to "accelerate efforts towards phasing down ", rather than " phasing out ", coal power that isn't mitigated by carbon capture and storage. This subtle change to the text surfaced at the end of COP26 , the latest UN climate change conference, at the insistence of India and China. So are these two countries to blame for the summit's disappointing outcome, HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59280241 as many are suggesting Largely formed from plants and animals buried in the Carboniferous period 359 to 299 million years ago, fossil fuels like coal and natural gas are found on every continent. But their global distribution is not even - India and China have HYPERLINK https://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-the-worlds-biggest-coal-reserves-by-country/ significant coal resources HYPERLINK https://www.worldometers.info/gas/gas-reserves-by-country/ comparatively little natural gas HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/coal Providing 37% of the world's energy, coal is the single largest source of electricity generation globally. It is projected to remain the leading energy source HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2019/coal into the 2030s , particularly because its use in India in China is HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0144598717741031 still growing . The UK has reduced its carbon emissions by switching from coal power to natural gas. Coal generated 41% of the country's electricity in 2012, while natural gas made up 25%. A decade later, coal is HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/britains-electricity-since-2010-wind-surges-to-second-place-coal-collapses-and-fossil-fuel-use-nearly-halves-129346 almost non-existent HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/britains-electricity-use-is-at-its-lowest-for-decades-but-will-never-be-this-low-again-152360 largest source . Over half of the 30% reduction in the UK's carbon emissions during the past decade were due to this switch from https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994 coal to gas , with the rest driven by HYPERLINK https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1032260/UK_Energy_in_Brief_2021.pdf rapid increases in renewable generation . Why natural gas burns cleaner than coal is due to a quirk of chemistry. The amount of CO? produced when a given fuel is burned is largely a function of the elements it's comprised of. Natural gas is mostly carbon and hydrogen. This combination has a very high energy content relative to other fuels, and so, it produces relatively less CO? emissions for each unit of energy burning it generates. Impurities such as sulphur, which are common in coal, increase how much CO? is generated for each unit of heat. This means even the highest quality coal produces double the CO? emissions of natural gas per unit of energy. Energy demand is closely linked with productivity. As economies like China and India rapidly grow and develop, their energy demand is expected to HYPERLINK rise in tandem . But their ability to follow the UK in switching from coal to natural gas as a primary source of electricity generation is limited because they have comparatively less natural gas. The UK produces over half its natural gas from the North Sea and has made a lot of progress in ditching coal. No mitigation without aid Per person, emissions in both China and India are still substantially lower than HYPERLINK almost all developed countries HYPERLINK quarter of all carbon emissions HYPERLINK over 4% of global emissions Labelling India and China as the chief villains of COP26 is a convenient narrative. The financial aid which rich countries promised yet failed to deliver as part of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 was supposed to help developing countries dump coal for cleaner sources of energy. And while the world berated India and China for weakening the Glasgow Climate Pact's coal resolution, few questioned the fossil fuel projects being floated in developed nations, like the UK's HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57762927 Cambo oilfield and the HYPERLINK https://abcnews.go.com/US/opponents-line-pipeline-project-threatens-bidens-climate-legacy/story?id=80844864 Line 3 oil pipeline Switching from coal to gas offers a quick and partial win for reducing CO? emissions, but doing it depends on geology and geography. A rapid switch to renewable energy sources is easier when energy demand isn't growing as fast, like it is in rapidly developing countries. These countries need financial assistance from richer countries to make that leap. Until that is delivered, developed countries have no right to lay the disappointment of COP26 at the feet of China and India.

We asked experts from around the world for their reaction to the outcomes of this year's UN climate summit, COP26 , including the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed by all 197 countries attending the talks. Here's what they had to say about the deals that were made. (This page will be updated as reactions come in.) Deals and targets A starting point for future action. The Glasgow Climate Pact is not perfect, but still strengthens the Paris agreement in several ways. Acknowledging that there is no safe limit for global warming, the Pact resolves to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, instead of the Paris text of "well below 2\'b0C". Crucially it also delivers a strong framework for tracking commitments against real-world progress. The summit was pitched as the last chance to "keep 1.5\'b0C alive" - holding temperatures to less than 1.5\'b0C above their pre-industrial levels. 2020 was also supposed be the year when developed countries would provide at least US$100 billion a year of financial aid to help developing countries adapt to mounting storms and droughts - a pledge that still has not been met - and the transition to clean energy was supposed to start being rolled out. Perhaps concerned that national targets collectively were nowhere near good enough to keep 1.5\'b0C alive - we were heading for HYPERLINK more like 2.4\'b0C at best HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/claims-of-cop26s-success-have-been-unpicked-but-political-journalists-have-repeated-the-spin-171619 press-friendly announcements These were further supplemented by the "race to zero" initiatives, a series of announcements by states, cities and businesses on a range of decarbonisation approaches. While these are genuine attempts at climate action, success hinges on whether these developments can swiftly make into raised national commitments within the next year. The pact now explicitly "requests parties to revisit and strengthen" their 2030 goals, meaning 1.5\'b0C is down but not out. Piers Forster, Professor of Physical Climate Change & Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate University of Leeds Greenhouse gas emissions Progress on cutting emissions, but nowhere near enough. The Glasgow Climate Pact is incremental progress and not the breakthrough moment needed to curb the worst impacts of climate change. The UK government as host and therefore president of COP26 wanted to " HYPERLINK keep 1.5\'b0C alive Before COP26 , the world was HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021 on track for 2.7\'b0C of warming COP26 , including new pledges to cut emissions this decade, by some key countries, have reduced this to a HYPERLINK best estimate of 2.4\'b0C More countries also announced long-term net zero goals. One of the most important was HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-59125143 India's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Critically, the country said it would get off to a quick start with a massive expansion of renewable energy in the next ten years so that it accounts for 50% of its total usage, reducing its emissions in 2030 by 1 billion tonnes (from a current total of around 2.5 billion). A world warming by 2.4\'b0C is still clearly HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-what-would-the-world-be-like-at-3-c-of-warming-and-how-would-it-be-different-from-1-5-c-171030 very far from 1.5\'b0C Simon Lewis, Professor of Global Change Science at University College London and University of Leeds, and Mark Maslin, Professor of Earth System Science, University College London. Read more: Five things you need to know about the Glasgow Climate Pact Fossil fuel finance Some progress on ending subsidies, but the final deal fell short. The most important outcomes from COP26 will be directly related to two "F-words": finance and fossil fuels. Close attention should be paid to pledges for new finance for mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. But we must remember the other side of the equation - the urgent need to cut off funding for fossil fuel projects. As the HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050 International Energy Agency made clear earlier this year , there is no room in the 1.5? carbon budget for any new investments in fossil fuels. HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/statement-on-international-public-support-for-the-clean-energy-transition/ The commitment from more than 25 countries to shut off new international finance for fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022 is one of the biggest successes to come out of Glasgow. This could shift more than HYPERLINK http://priceofoil.org/2021/11/12/france-joins-commitment-to-end-international-oil-gas-and-coal-finance-by-2022/ US$24 billion a year There was also short-lived hope that the COP decision would call on parties to " HYPERLINK accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels ." According to the HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2018 United Nations , eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies would reduce global carbon emissions up to 10% by 2030. Sadly before the pact was agreed, the text on coal was HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/12/second-cop26-draft-criticised-for-weakened-language-on-fossil-fuels watered down , the phrase "phasing out" was replaced with "phasing down", and the weasel word " HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02847-2 inefficient " was inserted before "subsidies for fossil fuels." The fact that not even a weak reference to fossil fuels can survive in the decision text speaks volumes about how divorced the COP process is from the realities of the climate crisis. And this is unlikely to change as long as HYPERLINK fossil fuel lobbyists Kyla Tienhaara, Canada Research Chair in Economy and Environment, Queen's University, Ontario Read more: COP26 leaves too many loopholes for the fossil fuel industry.

Away from the formal agenda, the biggest tension was the debate between technology and consumption. Lots of industry groups at COP26 were talking about decarbonising steel and concrete production with new, and as yet unproven, technologies. We do need that, but more importantly HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/we-cant-afford-to-just-build-greener-we-must-build-less-170570 we need to change the way we design buildings so they use materials that are intrinsically low-carbon, such as timber, and to consume less resources in general. But without doubt, the biggest win is the specific reference to energy efficiency in the adopted text of the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf Glasgow Climate Pact Article 36 calls on governments to "accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination" of actions including "rapidly scaling up" energy efficiency measures.

COP26 featured hundreds of commitments to power past coal and natural gas and offer just transitions to workers and communities, mostly with a focus on renewable energy transitions. However, one concern I have coming out of COP26 is that discussions are often promoting technologies that are not currently market ready or scalable, especially nuclear small modular reactors, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. According to the International Energy Agency, HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/articles/etp-clean-energy-technology-guide 38 technologies are ready for deployment right now , including solar photovoltaic, geothermal and wind power.

As global emissions are now 35 billion tonnes a year, this project aims to prolong fossil fuel use by capturing only a token, tiny fraction.

Australia's coastline could soon be opened up to more oil and gas drilling even as the United Nations declares the world cannot afford to increase fossil fuel production if it wants to avoid catastrophic global warming and 80 nations pledge to cut methane emissions. The federal government is preparing to begin community consultations on potential exploration activities spanning new parts of Western Australia's Bonaparte, Browse and North Carnarvon basins and Victoria's Gippsland Basin, which oil and gas companies have identified as areas of interest. The launch of the annual process for releasing offshore acreage comes as Australia declined to join a pledge by 80 nations at the COP26 climate summit this week to cut methane emissions, much of which are generated from oil and gas production. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, accounts for about half of the 1 degree net rise in global average temperature since the Industrial Revolution. The methane agreement - spearheaded by the United States and European Union - covers six of the world's 10 largest methane emitters and is among the most substantial achievements from this week's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to date. "One of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade - to keep 1.5 degrees in reach - is reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible," US President Joe Biden said. Environmental advocates on Wednesday described the push for new fossil fuel exploration along Australia's coastline as "callous and cynical". "This is an attempt to broaden the footprint of fossil fuels, while Scott Morrison and Angus Taylor attempt to make friends in Glasgow," Wilderness Society WA campaigns manager Patrick Gardner said. "The mindless creep of fossil fuel expansion is being pushed onto communities that do not want it." The launch of community consultations - after which exploration companies must bid for a release and be assessed as a deserving applicant - comes amid growing warnings against ramping up production of planet-heating fossil fuels. In the lead-up to COP26 , United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the dramatic effect of human-induced climate change "must sound a death knell" for fossil fuels "before they destroy our planet". The International Energy Agency has calculated that no new oil and gas fields can be developed in order to keep the planet's heating within 1.5 degrees. Supporters of gas, including the Morrison government, describe it as a necessary "transition fuel" in the green power shift, as a comparatively less-emitting alternative to coal that can keep energy reliable and affordable in periods when weather conditions for wind and solar generation are unfavourable. Gas is also used as a raw material in a range of manufacturing processes. But the fossil fuel's future is increasingly under question, with scientists and climate advocates arguing gas remains a heavy source of emissions and its role must be urgently reduced not expanded. The IEA said methane, an odourless, invisible gas, is the largest component of energy sector emissions. Some of the biggest emitters of it joined the pact to reduce methane emissions including Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Iraq, Vietnam and Canada. But heavy methane polluters including China and Russia have not signed up. Prime Minister Scott Morrison HYPERLINK said last week he had "made it very clear" Australia would not sign the 2030 pledge, ahead of COP26 . There is no case to provide greater focus on methane from livestock," Mr Mahar said. "Australian agriculture has the runs on the board. The red meat sector alone has cut emissions by 56 per cent since 2005." Climate Council head of research Simon Bradshaw criticised the move and said "Australia is coming dead last in the most important race humanity has ever faced". "Limiting methane emissions is one of the most important things we can do right now to slow the rate of warming over the coming decades," Dr Bradshaw said. Another major achievement at Glasgow came with the agreement from 40 nations including Australia, which together generate 40 per cent of global GDP, committing to collaborate on clean technology to replace carbon-intensive industries like steelmaking and power generation.

As COP26 wound down, there were flood warnings out for NSW's Lachlan River, providing even further proof - if any was needed - that the global warmists' catastrophic predictions are unscientific humbug. The heavy rainfalls recorded in areas of South Australia, Victoria and NSW over the past fortnight totally undermine former Australian of the Year and Climate Council chief Tim Flannery's 2005 predictions that drought conditions would become "permanent in eastern Australia" and that "the rain that comes won't fill our dams". On Saturday, WaterNSW's website showed Sydney's main dam, Warragamba, was filled to 97.8 per cent of capacity and the dams in the greater Sydney catchment were at 94.6 per cent. The palaeontologist is still regarded as something of a guru by the unthinking, fully paid-up members of the climate cult however, and he and the left-wing Climate Council are go-to commentators on the COP talks for the ABC and the Nine media. Last month, Peter FitzSimons asked Flannery whether he felt "tragically vindicated". "Most sensible people will now concede you were right on warning of the dangers of climate change and the denialists were wrong" said the author, best known for the red bandana he used to wear to distinguish himself from the rest of the bizarrely garbed activists. In reality, Flannery's doomsday predictions about climate change have missed the mark. Glasgow's COP26 brought out the false prophets by the thousands and the Nine media and "our" ABC couldn't get enough of them. Promoting the notion that Tuvalu is sinking because of global warming has been a constant theme of the Pacific nations' attempts to influence the West to send more cash to their leaders, even though the ABC's own (rarely used) fact-check department found in December 2018 that Tuvalu's total land area grew by 2.9 per cent in the four decades to 2014. Kelly didn't mention her own organisation's findings during her sharing-caring luvvy discussion. Instead, she focused on how much money would be needed to bail out Tuvalu in the (unlikely) event its islands sank. Like Flannery, Kelly is long on doom and the default position of both and all in the global warming activists' camp is to demand that Western nations suspend the powerhouses of their economies - the coal and gas-fired plants - and inflict brutally high prices for unreliable solar and wind energy on their citizens. China, meanwhile, is building more coal-fired plants to power manufacturing, outsourced from the West because energy prices have made it too expensive, to build things in nations that have drunk the green Kool-Aid. Humans, whom the Extinction Rebellion mob would like to see become extinct, are responsible for about 0.0016 per cent. If anyone at COP26 Australia gets thrashed by the ignoramuses, even though it not only meets but beats its targets without extra taxes or mandates. Not only was COP26 a flop like the previous 25 COPs, even the "big" story such as the soft US-China accord was not much more than a recycling of the Obama-Xi deal to ratify the Paris Agreement five years ago. But what the heck, COP27 will be held at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort next year, an altogether more pleasant place than Glasgow and COP28 is scheduled to take place in the UAE (not such a great place). So, fuel up the private jets, ramp up the rhetoric and strap yourselves in for more crap from the world masters - the global warming catastrophists. \</doc>

Australia, Oct. 28 -- Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction - Angus Taylor issued the following media release: Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor will attend the opening week of COP26 Minister Taylor will also meet with counterparts to advance Australia's low emissions technology partnerships and to strengthen cooperation with countries in our region. Australia is committed to a successful outcome at the global COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said ahead of his departure for the summit. " COP26 "Our approach is focused on developing solutions that will make net zero practically achievable for all countries. "The most important legacy this summit could have is a genuine, global commitment to a step up in collaboration on the technology solutions needed to achieve net zero. "Accelerating the development and deployment of new and emerging low emissions technologies is a way forward that all countries can unite behind. "This week the Morrison Government released our Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. "We are backing this target with practical, responsible action and a clear plan to convert ambition into achievement." Today, the Government will communicate an updated and enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat. The updated NDC will affirm Australia's net zero emissions by 2050 target, the seven low emissions technology stretch goals set out in our Plan, and our commitment to meeting and beating our 2030 Paris target. New forecasts released this week show Australia is on track to reduce emissions by up to 35 per cent by 2030 (expressed in budget accounting terms consistent with our 2030 Paris target), or up to a 38 per cent point-in-time reduction in 2030. Between 2005 and 2021, Australia's emissions fell by 20.8 per cent, outpacing the reductions of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and every other major commodity exporting nation in the world. Australia's long-term emissions reduction plan will achieve net zero by 2050 while growing Australia's economy, and providing the low-emission technologies and solutions that other countries need to achieve their own net zero ambitions. "Our Plan will help position Australia as a new energy economy leader in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific," Minister Taylor said. "Our Technology Investment Roadmap will guide more than $80 billion of total public and private investment over the next decade to accelerate low-emissions technology deployment. "Australia is play a leading role in helping to develop low-emissions technologies, such as clean hydrogen, ultra low cost solar, carbon capture and storage, low emissions materials like steel and aluminium, energy storage and soil carbon measurement. "Our focus is on getting new low-emissions technologies to parity with existing approaches - or preferably even cheaper - as soon as possible. "This is the only way to make net zero emissions achievable for all countries."

The conference concluded with 197 countries agreeing to a new climate deal, the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf Glasgow Climate Pact Countries had made varying commitments to limit emissions by 2030, known as " HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs nationally determined contributions COP26 . Many then added long-term net zero statements to their NDCs during the conference - such as the UK's HYPERLINK https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/10/19/uk-sets-economy-wide-strategy-meet-2050-net-zero-goal/ net zero by 2050 pledge - as well as other, non-binding statements relating to issue such as renewable energy. That leaves three different sources of emissions claims to assess to take stock of HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c where we now stand .

But these aren't binding agreements among all 197 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/about-us/about-the-secretariat UNFCCC ) who take part in COP. They are statements of intention which, unfortunately, are not always fulfilled. And although HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement climate targets set by the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Climate Agreement HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021?utm_term=emissions%20gap&utm_campaign=Search_Global_Climate_Action&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=1970971754&hsa_cam=15139102696&hsa_grp=128680613505&hsa_ad=558137628912&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1461853465132&hsa_kw=emissions%20gap&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsL_t04GR9AIVi9d3Ch01SQLpEAAYASAAEgLl6_D_BwE current emissions pledges HYPERLINK https://greens.scot/news/cop26-credibility-gap-as-over-2-degrees-warming-predicted over 2\'b0C .

But an analysis by award-winning climate analysis site HYPERLINK https://j.mp/3072SUw Carbon Brief found that current climate policies will lead to surface warming of around 2.7\'b0C by 2100. If countries manage to fulfil all their NDCs for 2030 and deliver on HYPERLINK https://t.co/RZlSaC3CjX statements made at COP26 , projected warming falls to around 2.4\'b0C. If countries also meet their targets for reaching net zero, this could still mean 1.8\'b0C of warming. Questions The final hours of a COP are when various clauses become strengthened and weakened, from HYPERLINK https://t.co/rJyRyZ4ZRJ?amp=1 first to HYPERLINK https://t.co/ise6dDfcWB?amp=1 second to HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/311096 third to HYPERLINK final draft . These hours were mainly spent debating three questions: NDCs: Would the Glasgow Climate Pact commit countries to reducing emissions as fast as possible by bringing them back each year to submit more ambitious NDCs? Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres previously suggested that countries strengthen their NDCs for 2030 in 2022, rather than in 2025. In its final version, the pact requests - not compels - countries to do this. It remains to be seen how countries will respond, however - in the hours after COP, the US and Australia had already HYPERLINK https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/11/15/laggards-reject-glasgow-pacts-2022-call-new-climate-plans/ declined requests to improve their NDCs next year. Fossil fuels: Would the pact include firm commitments for winding down fossil fuel production and finalise rules for HYPERLINK https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/how-do-emissions-trading-systems-work/ emissions trading and HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/we-cant-stabilise-the-climate-without-carbon-offsets-so-how-do-we-make-them-work-169355 offsetting carbon pollution? For the first time in a UN climate agreement, all four drafts of the Pact - including the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf final version - contained a statement on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, this final statement was heavily watered down. Although the draft HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CP-26.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0B7hnh9mG41FnQK_n2vDNqqYJwu5nXD88j0XgZ3CwEF6WHQbKowHDTvCo initially called for countries to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels", this phrasing was HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310987 changed to request that countries "accelerate the phasing out of unabated coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". It was hoped this critical statement would be strengthened by the recently announced HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/11/us-china-deal-on-emissions-welcomed-by-global-figures-and-climate-experts collaborative commitment In the end, it was this alliance that weakened the HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/471c7db9-925f-479e-ad57-09162310a21a wording on coal . Consensus was only reached when parties agreed, with HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-glasgow-news-latest-draft-b1957044.html visible sorrow , to accept a late intervention to change the "phasing out" of coal to "phasing down ". It is unsurprising that the greatest pushback was on fossil fuels, an industry that received HYPERLINK https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuels-received-5-9-trillion-in-subsidies-in-2020-report-finds US$5.9tn (\£34.4tn) of subsidies worldwide in 2020. Finance: Would the agreement provide adequate levels of financial aid to help developing countries adapt to and survive climate change? Other critical elements of the pact revolve around financial elements of climate change, including setting prices for carbon trading, funding climate adaptation and paying for loss and damage caused by extreme weather. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310987 A statement in an early draft sought to establish financial support to "avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries".

Moving forwards Views on the pact's success are deeply HYPERLINK https://unclimatesummit.org/the-glasgow-pact-what-do-the-experts-say-about-the-outcome/ polarised . The COP presidency got the pact over the line only by asking for some to make sacrifices and others to accept smaller wins, in what COP president HYPERLINK https://inews.co.uk/news/environment/cop26-president-alok-sharma-urges-leaders-last-minute-talks-continue-climate-agreement-1299493 Alok Sharma argued was overall a balanced agreement. The entire problem with climate change, however, is that it is the result of profound historical and ongoing imbalance. The call to move beyond coal and fossil fuels subsidies, and to " HYPERLINK https://www.energy-transitions.org/publications/keeping-1-5-alive/ keep 1.5 alive ", survived - albeit it in a critical condition. But those hailing COP26 as a success owe profound gratitude to the developing world nations who accepted the pact and chose not to ask for the balance on climate change to be paid in full - yet.

As the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ COP26 climate summit draws to a close, debate continues on one key issue in particular: a new rule book for global carbon trading to allow countries to purchase emissions reductions from overseas to count towards their own climate action. The world has generally welcomed headline-grabbing HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/07/so-what-has-cop26-achieved-so-far agreements on halting deforestation and tackling methane and HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/end-of-coal-in-sight-at-cop26/ coal . Likewise ambitious commitments from some large polluters, most notably HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/07/so-what-has-cop26-achieved-so-far India's pledge to reach net zero carbon by 2070. But the devil is in the detail and there is serious concern that some of these commitments are only voluntary, while others look unachievable. Defining the rules for international carbon trading is a contentious agenda item - but one that will partly determine whether countries can meet their pledges and collectively limit global warming to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/05/president-of-paris-summit-says-18c-commitment-is-only-hypothetical as close to 1.5? as possible The new rules, known as HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-q-and-a-how-article-6-carbon-markets-could-make-or-break-the-paris-agreement Article 6 under the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement , will be important for New Zealand.

In fact, two thirds of the promised emissions reductions will have to come through overseas arrangements, especially with nations in the Asia-Pacific region.

This would allow one country to buy credits from another country that has exceeded its NDC, or to carry out activities that reduce emissions in another (host) country and count those towards its own NDC. It also supports non-market approaches to climate cooperation between countries around technology transfer, finance and capacity building. But these provisions have proved contentious, not least because they could result in double counting of emissions reductions, unless clear and robust operational rules are agreed. The COP26 summit has made some progress on this, but many finer details are yet to be resolved. Cutting emissions at home versus elsewhere Uncertainty about carbon market rules will be particularly problematic for New Zealand, given its reliance on overseas activities to meet its new NDC. There are also practical questions around how much of these activities will count towards New Zealand's NDC, and how ready potential partners in the Pacific are for such carbon market trading mechanisms. Pacific Island nations are not currently trading or part of established carbon markets. They may not be able to develop the necessary technical expertise to ensure fairness, compliance and transparency well in advance of 2030.

ABSTRACT NSW, ACT and SA invite all layers of government to join their Net Zero Emissions Policy Forum, to work on practical solutions for drawing down emissions. FULL TEXT Three Australian governments have forged a commitment to work together on solutions to achieve net-zero emissions at COP26 , in a new forum they hope subnational governments in other countries will join.\~ Through a Net Zero Emissions Policy Forum, initiated by the NSW, ACT and South Australian governments, governments across the political spectrum will work on practical solutions for drawing down emissions and growing economies. They hope to do this while preventing the risk of reinventing the wheel.\~ The forum -- open to subnational governments nationally -- will provide a repository of policies and resources; facilitate collaboration between governments to design policies; and create a space for problem-solving to address policy challenges and speed up the net-zero transition.\~ NSW will chair a ministerial group leading the forum for its first 12 months, but it is expected that it will be co-chaired by a leading subnational government from overseas as the forum grows. NSW treasurer and energy minister Matt Kean said greenhouse gas emissions did not recognise borders, and the forum would help tackle climate change with a globally collaborative approach.\~\~ Andrew Barr, ACT's chief minister, said the forum would help provide subnational governments with shared tools to address the policy challenges of achieving net-zero emissions.\~ "We have some of the most important levers such as transport, buildings and energy," Barr said.\~ "As we approach the cities and regions day at COP26 in Glasgow, we call on all our colleagues in state and regional governments to work together to take decisive and practical action on climate change." South Australian environment minister David Speirs encouraged subnational governments around the world to join the forum to help create low-carbon jobs and leave a better planet behind.

HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/sir-david-attenborough-named-cop26-peoples-advocate/ People's Advocate \~Sir David Attenborough told the forum of world leaders that the climate emergency came down to a single number: the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, which 'greatly determines global temperature'. "Our burning of fossil fuels, our destruction of nature, our approach to industry, construction and farming are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at an unprecedented pace and scale.\~We are already in trouble, the stability we all depend on is breaking," Attenborough said. "We must halve carbon emissions this decade. We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air. We must fix our sights on keeping 1.5 degrees within reach," he said.\~ Attenborough said that the world's motivation for change should not be fear but hope, describing the need to recover the natural world as a 'new industrial revolution'. "In my lifetime, I have witnessed a terrible decline," Attenborough said. "In yours, you could, and should witness a wonderful recovery." During his own address, the Australian PM underscored recent technology partnerships Australia has announced, with Singapore, Germany, the UK, Japan, Indonesia, and\~ HYPERLINK https://www.themandarin.com.au/173757-south-korea-backs-morrisons-technology-ambitions-to-help-solve-climate-change-crisis/ South Korea . Another deal with India was close to being finalised, he said. "We are also working to establish high-integrity offsets internationally. Working with our close friends and neighbours in the Indo-pacific," Morrison said.\~ Morrison also boasted that Australia was £head of the pack' in terms of efforts to reduce carbon emissions, claiming that the nation has simultaneously been able to reside emissions by 20% since 2005 and also grow the economy by 45%. This proved that\~economic growth was not at odds with emissions reduction, he said.\~ "By 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes that our emissions in Australia will fall by 35% by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment. Australia meets and beats on its commitments," Morrison said.\~ The PM also used the opportunity to announce that Australia would\~double its initial climate finance commitment for nations in the Pacific and Southeast Asia to $2 billion to be spent over five years.

ABSTRACT OECD participants will end export credit support for unabated coal-fired power plants, in support of the goals of the upcoming COP26 . Participants of the international Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) will end export credit support for unabated coal-fired power plants in support of the goals of the upcoming https://ukcop26.org/ UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow next month .\~ A statement from the OECD said it expected HYPERLINK the ban would come into effect by the end of October 2021.\~ "The ban will come into effect once participants complete their formal internal decision-making processes, which are expected by the end of October 2021."\~ Participants include Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the US.\~ The OECD announced that an agreement had been reached on Tuesday with the effect of banning supported export credits, and tied aid to new coal-fired power plants that do not have operational carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) facilities.\~ The new ban will also apply to existing coal-\£dfired power plants, the announcement said, unless the purpose of the infrastructure is pollution or CO2 abatement and does not extend the lifetime of the plant. An exception will apply to equipment in existing plants where it is being retrofitted to install CCUS.

"Our OECD analysis of donor information indicates that 2023 is the year when the USD $100 billion climate finance goal is likely to be met," Cormann said. "This level of finance must then be sustained throughout 2024 and 2025."\~ The OECD has been preparing a delivery plan for the USD $100 billion climate finance goal in the lead up to the HYPERLINK https://www.themandarin.com.au/173179-pm-vows-2050-net-zero-emissions-plan-wont-turn-australias-lights-off/ November COP26 event in Glasgow , with developing countries also requesting the group analyse future levels of climate finance from individual countries and multilateral development banks.\~ The figures capture four components of climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries: bilateral public climate finance, multilateral public climate finance attributed to developed countries, climate-related officially supported export credits, and private finance mobilised by bilateral and multilateral public climate finance, attributed to developed countries. "While a number of factors, such as the capacity to get relevant projects underway within the intended time frames, will influence exactly when the USD $100 billion goal is achieved, it is vital for developing countries to have a good understanding of developed countries' intentions in advance of COP26 in Glasgow starting next week," Cormann said. HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/export-credits/arrangement-and-sector-understandings/ The arrangement for officially supported export credits came into existence in 1978, when a small number of OECD countries wanted to establish a framework that would create a level playing field, and encourage competition among exporters based on quality and prices of exported goods and services. As a result, limitations have been created on the financing terms and conditions when participants provide officially supported export credits or tied aid. Some of the rules of the arrangement are sector-specific but, generally speaking, the arrangement applies to all officially supported export credits with a repayment term of two years or more. It does not apply to military equipment or to agricultural commodities. Five years ago annex VI was introduced to the OECD arrangement, creating stricter terms and conditions for the officially supported export credits relating to coal-fired electricity generation projects. It intended to encourage both exporters and buyers to move towards high-efficiency technologies by placing a limit on credit support for coal-fired power plants.

Glasgow | The COP26 summit looks set to offer Australia some critical HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-will-have-a-coal-and-gas-economy-beyond-2050-20211112-p598j5 loopholes on fossil fuels Glasgow summit host Britain looks to have HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/cop26-summit-puts-oil-and-gas-in-the-crosshairs-20211112-p5989t abandoned its bid for the COP26 communique to include a strong and unprecedented commitment to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel". Instead, after opposition from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia, backed by the US, the communique's revised text released late on Friday (AEDT) commits the 197 signatories only to "accelerate the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels". This offers wide latitude to countries to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon offsets while continuing to produce coal, oil and gas; and it legitimises the use of subsidies to the industry as long as they can be claimed to be efficient. "It's great that coal is mentioned. That's a first, it's a start. But unfortunately it's now attached to weasel words," said Richie Merzian, a director at the Australia Institute and former COP negotiator. Both UN Secretary General Antonio Gueterres and Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development Secretary General Mathias Cormann have used COP26 to call for the phase-out of all harmful subsidies to fossil fuel production and consumption. But US climate envoy John Kerry on Friday (Saturday AEDT) backed the new formulation. "It's unabated coal. We're not talking about all [coal], we're not talking about eliminating it. We're talking about the capacity for capture, if you can do it," he told the conference. Meanwhile, the demand that countries come to COP27 in Egypt next year with beefed-up commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions further by 2030 - an initiative of which Australia has reportedly been wary - was also diluted. In the first draft earlier this week, countries were "urged" to scale up their commitment next year; now, they are "requested" to do so. That winds back the lexicon to the standard Paris Agreement formulation, which the British government had earlier indicated was insufficient, and which Greenpeace International executive director Morgan described as little more than "a polite request". A Chinese official told the COP that countries should be allowed to "decide on their own roadmap and timetable for their national policies and actions". Clash of ambitions The negotiations were meant to wrap up at 6pm British time on Friday (5am Saturday AEDT), but will now spill over into the weekend as negotiators try to find a landing zone that satisfies all parties. Britain is trying to muscle up the agreement, looking to inspire confidence among business and civil society that governments are working at pace and with commitment. Its aim is to foment policies and actions that might keep global warming to below the potentially catastrophic threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. A report from environmental monitors Carbon Action Tracker earlier this week suggested that countries' pre- COP26 policy settings would put the world on course for warming of 2.7C by 2100. The level of 2030 commitments on offer at the summit would reel that in only to 2.4C. The momentum appears to be shifting away from Britain's level of ambition, but environmental groups say they are still pressing to reverse that. "There's wording in here worth holding on to, and the UK Presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal," Ms Morgan said in a Greenpeace statement. "Negotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who've come here to wreck progress." The Saudi Arabian climate envoy told the conference floor on Friday (Saturday AEDT) that the Glasgow summit could reach "a good outcome" if the concluding document "keeps faithful to the Paris Agreement" - code for avoiding new text on fossil fuels or targets. But Norwegian climate and environment minister Espen Barth Eide told the conference that "ambition must be the essence". "We know that we have to act in the 2020s, otherwise adaptation will simply be way too costly for many of the nations assembled here," he said. In a positive intervention, Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege told the conference that "this is a text that takes us in the right direction". Mr Merzian said there had been progress in the argy-bargy between rich and poor countries over finance to help the developing world cut emissions and adapt to climate change, which had threatened to derail agreement on the more political elements of the text. "It's looking good enough for now," he said, noting that the issue would be carried over to next year's COP in Egypt where it would be the top priority. The summit still appears to be short of a $US100 billion goal for annual support for mitigation measures, which has now become a more distant target. But funding has been unlocked for adaptation, and the issue of compensating vulnerable countries for climate-related loss and damage is on the table. \</doc>

For the Glasgow climate summit to be judged a success, a key outcome had to be that parties agree the majority of the world's fossil fuel reserves need to be left in the ground. As HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8 recent research suggests, 89% of coal and 59% of gas reserves need to stay in the ground if there's to be even a 50% chance of global temperature rise staying under the crucial limit of 1.5? this century. The summit, COP26 Some promising proposals have been put forward, including the HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/australias-refusal-to-sign-a-global-methane-pledge-exposes-flaws-in-the-term-net-zero-170944 pledge to cut methane HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-global-deforestation-deal-will-fail-if-countries-like-australia-dont-lift-their-game-on-land-clearing-171108 to deforestation , and ending some overseas funding of fossil fuels. Yesterday, 13 countries launched HYPERLINK https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297225-cop26-new-alliance-commits-to-ending-oil-and-gas-extraction/ a new alliance to end gas and oil production within their borders, led by Denmark and Costa Rica. But most proposals suffer either from a lack of ambition or a lack of participation from key countries. Take the pledge to cut methane emissions. Some of the biggest methane emitters such as Russia, China and Australia failed to sign up. Similarly, the plan to phase out coal allows some signatories such as HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/small-print-gives-indonesia-a-way-out-in-cop-coal-pledge Indonesia to keep building coal-fired power plants. Read more: Australia's refusal to sign a global methane pledge exposes flaws in the term 'net-zero' What these proposals and, indeed, the whole COP process, suffer from is an inability to address the fact that if we're to avoid the worst of climate change, we simply can't keep extracting fossil fuels. While national governments and their negotiators remain willing to listen to the interests of fossil fuel lobbyists, the COP process will continue to be riddled with loopholes that will derail the achievement of real targets. Five big loopholes come to mind. 1. Subsidies and finance Much has been made of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions which aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy. But many of its efforts will be undermined while governments continue to subsidise the fossil fuel industry. With fossil fuel subsidies globally running at US$11 million (A$15 million) HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/06/fossil-fuel-industry-subsidies-of-11m-dollars-a-minute-imf-finds every minute , GFANZ is insufficient to halt emissions because subsidising the cost of production and sale of fossil fuels continues to make the industry feasible. Moreover GFANZ is voluntary, when we need commitments to be binding. It also includes banks who have recently provided https://www.ran.org/the-understory/the-net-zero-banking-alliances-40-billion-exxon-problem/ US$575 billion (A$787 billion) in fossil fuel finance to some of the world's biggest polluters. Governments should not wait for future COPs to address this issue. Countries such as Australia should immediately start reining in the subsidies that make the industry profitable and should not entertain new subsidies, such as the National Party's proposal in Australia for a coal rail line to HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-13/barnaby-joyce-says-coal-will-be-sent-from-toowoomba-to-gladstone/100537238 Gladstone . 2. New production Despite the overwhelming evidence that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, governments are still approving new projects. The UK government has 40 fossil fuel projects in the pipeline despite being host of HYPERLINK https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/28/the-uk-has-40-new-fossil-fuel-projects-in-the-pipeline-what-does-this-mean-for-cop26-credi COP26 . Australia, too, continues to approve new gas and coal developments. The NSW government has approved eight new projects since HYPERLINK 2018 , despite the state's target of HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-29/nsw-new-carbon-emissions-reduction-target-for-2030/100498444 50% emissions reduction Until future climate negotiations put a ban on new fossil fuel projects and agree to a clear and rapid phase out of current production levels, the fossil fuel industry will continue to thrive. 3. Business as usual A further loophole for the fossil fuel industry is how it's being allowed to continue its huge levels of production because it has committed (in some cases) to making its operations greener. Measures such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting have been touted by some governments as solutions to bringing the industry's emissions down. But these HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/big-business-greenwash-or-a-climate-saviour-carbon-offsets-raise-tricky-moral-questions-171295 are not real solutions Read more: Big-business greenwash or a climate saviour? Carbon offsets raise tricky moral questions While offsetting will have to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/we-cant-stabilise-the-climate-without-carbon-offsets-so-how-do-we-make-them-work-169355 play a role in reducing emissions in some hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and agriculture, it is not a substitute for genuine cuts to fossil fuel use and misleadingly gives the impression fossil fuel companies are HYPERLINK https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/revealed-9-examples-of-fossil-fuel-company-greenwashing/ going green . 4. Influence These loopholes that allow fossil fuel production are, of course, no accident. The largest group of representatives at COP26 were from the https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484 fossil fuel industry One of the striking and disturbing characteristics of government approaches to climate change is the impact of fossil fuel companies on HYPERLINK decision making . It's hard to think of other issues (smoking, peace negotiations) where we tolerate this kind of influence. The industry's influence on successive Australian governments has been well documented, with over HYPERLINK https://publicintegrity.org.au/political-donations-and-the-resources-sectors-influence/ A$136.8 million in donations recorded between 1999 and 2019. Having a display by gas company Santos ( HYPERLINK https://www.marketforces.org.au/politicaldonations2020/ a major donor to Australian political parties ) at Australia's COP26 pavilion rightly provoked ridicule. 5. Decoupling production The failure to address these loopholes will mean the production of fossil fuels in countries like Australia will continue for much longer than it should. The fact there are still willing buyers for fossil fuel assets such as HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bhp-sell-stake-metallurgical-coal-jv-stanmore-up-135-bln-2021-11-07/ BHP's Queensland coal mines HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/bhp-is-selling-its-dirty-oil-and-gas-assets-but-hold-the-applause-166333 and few climate liabilities COP26 . Read more: BHP is selling its dirty oil and gas assets, but hold the applause One of the most glaring failures of COP26 is the failure to connect emission cuts with production cuts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in countries HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/norway/ such as Norway which have impressive domestic reduction targets (55% by 2030) yet continue to champion HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58896850 fossil fuel production A key to progress at future COPs and domestically is ending the false idea one can make progress on climate by cutting domestic emissions while simultaneously supporting fossil fuel production. If countries such as Australia and Norway can't come together to agree on cutting support for production, then we will continue to see loopholes that allow the industry to flourish. Some countries are taking positive steps. The HYPERLINK http://www.beyondoilandgasalliance.com/ Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance Multilateral action such as this, whether as part of COP or outside it - and, crucially, the pressure from below that causes it - must be a focus if we're to avoid climate change.

COP26 , the recently concluded UN climate change conference in Glasgow, marked a critical turning point in global politics. From now on, the issue of climate justice will be unavoidable for rich countries. The Glasgow Climate Pact "urges" rich countries like the US (referred to as "developed countries" in the text) to increase funding for poor countries like Bangladesh ("developing countries") to around US$40 billion (\£329.8 billion) annually by 2025, to help them adapt to mounting floods, droughts and other effects of climate change. This is pretty strong language in UN speak and is welcome support. But the rich world has a history of failing to meet its financial promises. Only HYPERLINK 80% of the US$100 billion The failure to meet the amount developing countries need to adapt to climate change means the world faces a life sentence of escalating climate impacts. Those impacts that we won't be able to prevent or adapt to are referred to as " HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction-to-loss-and-damage loss and damage " in the lingo of international climate policy and they are already beginning to bite in the most vulnerable countries. The failure of COP26 to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-glasgow-climate-pact-171799 commit to keeping warming below 1.5\'b0C will mean more such loss and damage in future.

However you describe it, the fine print of the previous UN climate treaty, the 2015 Paris agreement, sought to squash any notion of developed countries being liable. But the outcome of COP26 shows that the issue of who is responsible and who should pay for the consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored. However, even the annual climate funding that has been pledged doesn't include any money allocated for loss and damage. Who should pay?

Adapting to climate change isn't straightforward: even the UK, for all its wealth and its relative lack of exposure, HYPERLINK https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/independent-assessment-of-uk-climate-risk/ isn't getting it right In the lead up to COP26 , all countries were expected to update their climate action plans, known as NDCs. Recent HYPERLINK http://www.climate-loss-damage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LD_NDC_PB.pdf analysis showed an increasing number were talking about loss and damage in their plans. This makes sense: as countries increasingly have to divert resources towards preparing for and responding to disasters like cyclones, or sea-level rise and melting glaciers, there will be less public financing available for them to cut their emissions and contribute to meeting the 1.5? goal. More talk? There was important progress in Glasgow. But much of this came from outside the negotiating rooms. The negotiators working on loss and damage conducted their talks late into the night to flesh out what the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/santiago-network Santiago Network - a new way of offering technical assistance to developing countries - should be doing to support countries in a practical way. But progress was slow and calls to set up a "Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility" which would have provided financial support for vulnerable countries HYPERLINK https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-us-block-financial-support-climate-change-cop26/ went unheeded . Agreed instead was the establishment of a "Glasgow Dialogue" to discuss funding arrangements over the coming years. This could be an important step to real, material support for vulnerable countries. But in some ways, this feels like deja vu. COP23 in 2017 established a "Suva Expert Dialogue" - a two-day workshop which produced a HYPERLINK https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unfccc-publishes-report-of-the-suva-expert-dialogue-on-loss-and-damage/ technical paper - to explore information on finance for loss and damage. COP24 the following year and COP25 in 2019 pushed for the establishment of an expert group on loss and damage which was finally launched in early 2021. Progress is incremental, but with all these dialogues it's no wonder that young protesters decry this " HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/greta-thunberg-cop26-blah-b1957364.html blah, blah, blah " approach to climate action.

The Queen was back at work on Tuesday, greeting two diplomats via a conference call from the comfort of her favourite residence, Windsor Castle, in her first appearance since HYPERLINK https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/ill-queen-elizabeth-told-to-rest-for-a-few-days/news-story/49a7e19cb6a098f6ff58b7f7d94a139e becoming unwell last week Despite undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle, Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will not travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 next Monday. In a statement from Buckingham Palace, the Queen said she was "disappointed" to not attend the gathering of 120 world leaders, including Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and US president Joe Biden, but will deliver an address via a recorded video message. Earlier, Buckingham Palace released images of the Queen, dressed in a yellow outfit and pearls, smiling from a computer screen as she conducted a virtual audience with diplomats. News the 95-year-old monarch was feeling well enough to speak via video link was greeted with relief by an anxious nation after she was not well enough last week to attend Northern Ireland centenary events.

On Sunday, the Queen also missed her regular church service and of late she has not been outside, leaving the walking of her dogs to staff members. But overnight (AEST), she spoke via web link to South Korean ambassador Gunn Kim, who was joined by HeeJung Lee, and Switzerland's Markus Leitner and his wife Nicole, during their visit to Buckingham Palace. It was the first time the Queen had been seen since October 19, when she hosted a Windsor Castle reception for global business leaders. \</doc>

The task facing HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/boris-johnson-pins-hopes-china-india-springing-cop-surprise-20211031-p594mf UN climate talks in Glasgow COP26 to accelerate the transition to clean energy and avoid the worst impacts of catastrophic climate change. The future stability of the global financial system depends on governments, business and investors working together to address climate risks through ambitious targets, clear and credible pathways, streamlined disclosure frameworks and strong green investment. Investors are acutely aware they are operating in an environment long on commitment but often short on detail. As representatives of long-term investors, we have seen a clear trend of companies in exposed industries adopting net zero targets and disclosing pathways towards decarbonising their businesses. Investors will continue to play a critical role in holding companies to account on their climate aspirations to ensure they have developed realistic and tangible plans to achieve these. Research by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors shows that companies with more than $1.5 trillion in market capitalisation have set net zero commitments. When you add those with carbon-neutral targets, this increases to 90 companies covering 72 per cent of the ASX200 market capitalisation, or $1.65 trillion. Boral, BlueScope, Orica, Alumina and Beach Energy are among the companies in exposed sectors that have embraced net zero 2050 targets in recent weeks. Importantly, these are being linked to increasingly ambitious shorter-term targets for 2030. Seventy companies in the ASX200 have set medium-term targets between 2025 and 2040, including 22 major companies that set net zero by 2030 or earlier. These include Ampol (2040), Seven Group Holdings (2030), Blackmores (2030), Dexus (2030), JB Hi-Fi (2030), Worley Limited (2030) and Mirvac (2030). Keeping up with climate strategies This trend shows that HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/ceos-up-the-climate-ambition-at-glasgow-20211028-p5944e Australian companies Companies will need to provide high levels of transparency around their progress on reducing carbon emissions, and investor scrutiny will be vital to make sure the commitments are being delivered on. Increasing policy certainty and stability in Australia will attract investment capital. Global capital markets have moved and are looking for net zero investment opportunities. Action on climate change is an enormous opportunity for Australia. The Investor Group on Climate Change estimates that strong climate policies will unlock more than $130 billion in fresh investments by 2030. The Business Council of Australia estimates that Australia stands to reap an economic dividend of $890 billion and 195,000 jobs over the next 50 years. Need for more ambitious 2030 targets In the lead-up to COP26 , global economies have been opening the door to new opportunities for investment driven by accelerated global emissions' reduction commitments. The federal government's 2050 net zero commitment is welcome, but investors will be looking for more ambitious 2030 targets in line with the Paris Agreement, to support investment in the transition to a low carbon economy. Failing to keep pace with international developments presents investment risk and could see capital allocated to other markets. Paris-aligned emissions reductions by the end of the decade will offer a strong signal to capital markets and attract investment in clean industries and infrastructure. Superannuation funds are invested across the economy and the country's transition to a decarbonising economy affects the financial outcomes of super fund beneficiaries. COP26 is not an end point for the investors, companies and policymakers who are seeking to address the financial risks posed by climate change. The summit will require us all to re-evaluate the policies and targets we have set and seize the competitive advantages that decarbonisation will bring. It is imperative that we promote a financial system that can adapt to the pace and scale of change and provide a more sustainable economy for generations to come. Louise Davidson is the CEO of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. \</doc>

It is easy to point out the holes in the deal struck in Glasgow on climate change, but the outcome offers at least a glimmer of hope and keeps the pressure on both political parties to revise Australia's weak emissions reduction targets for 2030. This first major meeting of heads of government on climate since the Paris Treaty in 2015 was always going to be a messy event. The 197 governments were distracted by the rivalry between China and the US and, of course, the global pandemic, which has caused huge economic and social damage, especially in the developing world. Pessimists can justifiably complain that political leaders copped out and produced a fairly empty deal that will not stop global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say if we miss that target the world will suffer a catastrophic increase in droughts, hurricanes, rising sea levels and the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef. The meeting failed to generate enough cash for research into new emissions reduction technologies and aid to developing countries. After an 11th hour rebellion by China and India, the final declaration calls for the "phasing down" rather than the "phasing out" of coal. The fossil fuel industry has been given wiggle room to argue, as Australia's Nationals do, that it still has a long-term future. The big disappointment is that many important countries, including Australia, have resisted calls to dramatically strengthen their emissions reduction targets for 2030. The Morrison government refused to increase the commitment Tony Abbott made in Paris of a cut of 26 to 28 per cent in emissions below 2005 levels, although it said it projected a cut of 35 per cent. Even that projection is weaker than other developed countries or the combined pledges of Australian state governments. Global environmental groups singled Australia out as a laggard, or "colossal fossil". Yet for all its faults, the COP26 deal was important. After action on climate change went backwards in the Trump era, the meeting has decisively shifted political momentum in the right direction. President Joe Biden has championed the cause of climate change and, while China's Xi Jinping did not attend COP, China issued a joint statement with the US in support of stronger action. India signed up for net zero, albeit only by 2070. The language on coal is weak but it is still the first time countries have accepted it is on the way out. There has also been a sea change in the attitude of business, which is now leading rather than delaying emissions reduction. One crucial aspect of the final declaration urges countries to update their 2030 pledges at the ministerial meeting in Cairo next November, rather than waiting five years as envisaged under the Paris Treaty. This keeps the pressure on Australia, which came to Glasgow empty-handed except for some talk of the Australian Way (through unspecified technology) and its pledge of net zero by 2050. Both major political parties now must decide whether it is in Australia's long-term interests to persist with our weak 2030 target. When he finally announces Labor's climate change policy for the next federal election, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese faces a huge call on whether to go further than Prime Minister Scott Morrison. If the ALP takes a more ambitious approach to cutting emissions the campaign could become a repeat of the climate wars of the past decade. The ALP might lose coal seats in Queensland, while if the Coalition tries to wedge the ALP too hard it could lose seats in Sydney and Melbourne, with their strong environmental votes. Australian politics has been stuck in this dead-end for a decade but COP26 has made it clear that the diplomatic cost of our inaction is rising. Australia as a rich country is not pulling its weight. Both parties must stop playing for time and develop stronger policies to bring us back into line with our key allies and set an example to the world.

Australian coal miners say a COP26 pact to "phase down" unabated coal-fired power generation strikes a balance between the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy poverty in developing nations, and affirms their expectation that a global energy transition will take decades to deliver. The response from the leaders of Whitehaven Coal, Yancoal and New Hope Coal came after a plan to reduce consumption of coal was included in the final text of a United Nations climate conference pact for the first time in Glasgow. But India and China combined at the conference to ensure that a plan to enforce a "phase out" of coal was changed in the text to "phase down". South Korea, which consumes about 17 per cent of Australian thermal coal exports, according to Macquarie, was one of 46 nations to pledge to phase out coal-fired power by 2040, while one of the nations expected to be a source of future demand growth for Australian coal, Vietnam, also signed the "phase out" pledge. Whitehaven exports thermal and semi-soft coking coal from New South Wales and managing director Paul Flynn said his company supported global efforts to keep temperature rises to less than two degrees. "The Glasgow Climate Pact is a result of negotiations involving over 190 nations and necessarily strikes a balance between competing interests to achieve the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement, which we support," he said. "It also calls upon parties to £ccelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power'. This is not a call to unilaterally end coal production but rightly recognises that decarbonisation must be balanced with the needs of many developing nations for affordable and reliable power. "Net zero emissions does not mean no emissions. In addition to meeting Asian demand for high-quality thermal coal, we will continue our investment in the Low Emissions Technology Australia [LETA] fund to progress carbon capture and storage technology, to ensure where coal is required in a carbon-constrained world it can be used with minimal greenhouse gas emissions." Yancoal chief David Moult said there was no change to his belief that demand for coal would remain robust in the decades ahead. "For several years now, Yancoal has openly acknowledged that a change in the global energy mix is inevitable as the world transitions towards a lower carbon economy, and that resource companies must work to mitigate and manage climate change impacts. The recent COP26 "Despite the anticipated increase in the proportion of renewables and other non-fossil-fuel energy sources in the global energy mix, which Yancoal supports, the reality is that the demand for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal will remain relatively robust over the next few decades. "We believe the Australian coal mining industry has a key role to play in the energy transition by continuing to supply high-quality coal, which has a lower emissions profile than other exporting countries and which ensures that our customers are able to provide affordable, reliable and modern energy. "This will be partly underpinned by the ongoing demand generated from high efficiency, low emissions power plants across Asia." New Hope chief executive Reinhold Schmidt said his business would respond to the demands of customers, who in recent months have paid record prices for Australian thermal coal. "The outcomes of COP26 confirm our assessment that there will be an energy transition which will take some decades to play out. There will be an ongoing demand for thermal coal, particularly in Asia, which demand can be met by the high-quality, low-emission coals that we produce," he said. "We are a business that responds to market needs and our stakeholders." Australian Conservation Foundation spokesman Gavan McFadzean said Australia's stance on climate change was becoming increasingly distanced from the nation's closest allies such as Britain and the United States. "Australia has once again been part of the problem, not the solution. We are in the group of climate laggards - along with Russia and Saudi Arabia - that have gone to great lengths to water down the agreement surrounding coal power and subsidies," he said. "Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest places on earth, we are missing a golden opportunity to become a global renewables superpower. We should be leading from the front, not lagging from the very back." The reference to phasing down "unabated" coal-fired power leaves open potential for coal-fired generators to continue operating with abatement measures in the event such measures become financially viable in future. Carbon capture and storage has to date proven financially unattractive when attached to coal-fired power stations at locations such as NRG Energy's WA Parish Power Station in the United States, but the coal industry continues to fund further research and development, including into whether the low-emissions Allam cycle can be converted from gas to coal. "Abatement pathways include retiring inefficient plants, co-firing low-carbon fuels such as ammonia or hydrogen and retrofitting CCS," said Prakash Sharma from resources industry intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie. Whitehaven hopes to produce higher volumes of semi-soft and hard coking coal - otherwise known as metallurgical coal - for steelmaking in future through development of new mines at Vickery in NSW and Winchester South in Queensland. Mr Flynn said those plans were not derailed by the Glasgow pact, adding: "Importantly, the pact does not call for the same phase-down of metallurgical coal, which will be essential to meet ongoing global steel demand to support development, and will become a growing proportion of our business." \</doc>

The crucial COP26 climate conference in Glasgow has been declared by some to be dead before it even starts, after the G20 nations failed to deliver any strong commitments at their meeting in Rome. However, such pronouncements may be premature, with all eyes turning to the much more important  and complicated  talks beginning in Glasgow. "My impression is Glasgow is a dead duck before it even starts," political journalist Phil Coorey . There is no doubt the outcome in Rome was a win for those trying to slow action on climate change. A strong communique committing the world's biggest economies to ending fossil fuel subsidies, winding down coal production or tackling methane emissions would have been a shot in the arm for COP26 . On all those counts  \~and others  \~the club of the world's biggest economies failed to agree on anything significant when it comes to climate. Australia reportedly played its role in that failure, opposing moves to wind down subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  \~who has bet a lot on success at Glasgow  \~lashed out at his fellow world leaders, saying the commitments made in Rome were "drops in a rapidly warming ocean when you consider the challenge we've all admitted is ahead of us". "The countries most responsible for historic and present-day emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work," he said. "If we are going to prevent COP26 from being a failure, that must change." US President Joe Biden blamed Russia and China for the failures. "Russia and China didn't show up in terms of any commitments to do with climate change," he said after the summit. The UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres was downbeat. "I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled  \~but at least they are not buried," Mr Guterres\~said. Despite G20 being a disappointment for those gunning for strong climate action, the summit was just one small battle. The rest of the fight is ahead, and that involves a much more complicated set of dynamics.\~ Still a 'good chance' for climate pledges The big economies in the G20 represent about 80 per cent of the world's emissions. However, when they get to Glasgow, they'll be faced with the rest of the world, which is being most impacted by the emissions of these G20 nations. Small island nations and the least-developed countries have loud voices at COPs. They have been crucial to the architecture of the Paris Agreement, and have driven much of the ambition to which the rest of the world has agreed. Howard Bamsey  \~who led Australia's negotiations at previous climate conferences  \~says the outcome from the G20 is no reason for dismay. "I'm not too discouraged by the fact that the G20 could not find a common formula," he said. Mr Bamsey said the approach of G20, which involves a high-level statement, is pass\'e9. "We are past the point where issuing generic, high-level commitments is sufficient. What people are looking for now are specific commitments," he said. And, he said, getting concrete commitments out of the G20, before COP26 even gets going, was never going to be likely. "The ambition was always going to be at COP and there is still a good chance more pledges will come." Bill Hare, the chief executive of think-tank Climate Analytics, said that, although the lack of ambition in the G20 communique was a lost opportunity, it would not\~undermine what happens in Glasgow. "Everything is still on the table," he said. "The rubber will really hit the road, politically, in the second week of the Glasgow COP, with ministers engaging directly in the final deal." \</doc>

On what was billed as youth day at COP26 , some of the old men of the movement took to centre stage inside the United Nations "blue zone" to consider the week that had passed and call for more action and haste in the climate effort. Most notable was the former US vice-president Al Gore, who quoted Winston Churchill, saying: "The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close. Mr Gore said a political tipping point had been reached, and that a green revolution larger in scale than the industrial revolution and in pace with the digital revolution was now under way. Outside the wire, Greta Thunberg dismissed the rhetoric of older generations at COP as she addressed thousands of young people who rallied in central Glasgow. "It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure," she said. "It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place. "We need immediate drastic annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen. "The people in power can continue to live in their bubble filled with their fantasies, like eternal growth on a finite planet and technological solutions that will suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere and will erase all of these crises just like that. "All this while the world is literally burning, on fire, and while the people living on the front lines are still bearing the brunt of the climate crisis." Back in the blue zone, the success - or failure - of the first week of COP is still a matter of live debate. Another old man of the movement, US climate envoy John Kerry, told reporters he detected a great sense of urgency at the meeting compared to previous UN climate talks, but warned that the "the job is not done yet". Before the COP, that figure was 2.7 degrees, and before the Paris talks it was 6 degrees, COP president Alok Sharma reminded a press conference. But echoing the message of the protesters outside the wire, Sharma said he did not believe "populations would accept it" if leaders returned from the meeting at the end of next week and pledges and agreements did not bring those projections down to 1.5 degrees, and demonstrate how such new ambitions might be met. Delegates and negotiators have focused on hammering out the fine print of what is hoped will become a document some are already calling the "Glasgow pact". Though Mr Sharma would not say what the sticking points were in tens of different negotiating tracks, there is no secret that some states, like China, do not want 1.5 degrees locked in as the target. Others are resisting calls from blocs of nations such as the so-called High Ambition Coalition - a caucus of both small island states and powerhouses such as the United States - to make the reporting of new reductions targets annual rather than a five-yearly responsibility for signatories of the Paris Agreement. The arduous work of negotiating so-called article 6 - the rules governing a future global carbon market - grinds on, as it has now for six years. Without proper transparency, the positive projections celebrated this week could retreat into fantasy. In the coming days, ministers will begin to return to the blue zone to check on the progress of their negotiators. Mr Sharma is already demanding more from them, issuing a statement to the teams saying he expected work to start early and move quickly on Monday, and that he did not want COP to bleed on into its second weekend as it has in the past.

Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and wife Annie have pledged to donate and invest $1.5 billion on climate projects by 2030 to reinforce the COP26 goal of spurring global action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The couple will spend $1 billion on investments in green technology businesses and another $500 million on donations towards philanthropic organisations, think tanks, institutes and civil society organisations working on the climate crisis, he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. He said Atlassian would also bring forward its net zero goal from 2050 to 2040. Mr Cannon-Brooks said he believed that the 2050 net zero target locked in by most developed economies and preferred by the Australian government was already a "done deal", and that ambitious 2030 targets were now far more important. He has not yet decided where to direct the funds but said the $1 billion-odd he has already put into clean economy ventures before this new pledge indicated the sort of projects the couple may back. Mr Cannon-Brookes and Andrew "Twiggy" Forest are lead investors in the $20 billion Sun Cable project which plans to sell solar power to Singapore via a cable from what would be the world's largest solar farm in the Northern Territory, as well as ventures to make solar cells cheaper and more efficient. To deepen its emissions cuts Atlassian, a software giant, plans to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2025, make its data-centres more efficient, reduce business travel and develop more efficient buildings for its staff around the world. " COP26 The commitment comes as another group of Australian chief executives calling itself the Climate Leaders Coalition commits to strong decarbonisation efforts by 2030, signing on to a roadmap to act as a guide for business leaders to reduce emissions. The CLC was founded with the B-Team Australasia, a regional arm of a group of "purpose driven" business leaders created by Sir Richard Branson. "We need the collective wisdom of governments, corporations, academics, not-for-profits, small businesses and the entire community to solve this challenge with practical solutions. Every country in the world must play its part without exception," said David Thodey, co-chair of the group and chairman of the CSIRO. Signatories from 33 companies which account for around 22 per cent of Australian domestic greenhouse gas emissions have committed to measuring their environmental footprint and working with suppliers and customers to encourage them to reduce their emissions. The group, which includes companies as diverse as Fortescue Metals, Microsoft Australia and Unilever, says it supports the Paris Agreement and Australia's commitment to it, "including the objective to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels". The roadmap does not mention the more ambitious Paris target of 1.5 degrees. "We believe that a responsible and equitable transition to a low emissions economy is an opportunity to improve Australia's prosperity," says the group's charter of commitments. \</doc>

Glasgow | The Morrison government has refused to join US President Joe Biden's initiative to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent this decade, even as more than 100 other countries backed the plan at the Glasgow COP26 summit yesterday. Mr Biden told world leaders who joined him to launch the Global Methane Pledge that "one of the most important things we can do" to prevent global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius was "to reduce methane emissions as quickly as possible". The US and European Union announced the pledge in mid-September, and amassed a flurry of last-minute signatures in recent days. The US said those involved accounted for 70 per cent of global GDP and half of all methane emissions. Their biggest win was signing up Brazil, the world's largest methane emitter. Other backers included Canada, New Zealand, Britain, Argentina, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Absentees included Australia, Qatar, Brunei, China, Russia and India. Energy Minister Angus Taylor told a group of journalists, environmentalists and businesspeople in Glasgow that Australia did not want to set specific targets for particular emissions. "We've got a net-zero goal for 2050 for the whole economy. We're not setting sector-specific targets, and we're not setting gas-specific values, we're pursuing the entirety," he said. "The number that counts is the CO2-equivalent concentration in the atmosphere, that is what counts. ... Specific gases, they contribute to that overall outcome ... [but] the overall outcome [is what] we continue to focus on." Australian climate campaigners condemned the government's decision not to join the pledge. "It's a really excellent initiative and I wish Australia was a part of it. Cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do over the next few decades," said Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Climate Council, who is in Glasgow. "Regrettably we've ruled it out, and that will help cement our reputation as a bit of a handbrake at these talks." The Australian Conservation Foundation's clean energy campaigner Suzanne Harter said even a fossil-fuel producer such as Australia could still mandate actions such as detecting and repairing leaks at coal and gas operations, or recovering vented gas. "The federal government's refusal to budget on methane cuts is irresponsible and based on their own party bickering rather than a genuine assessment of what's possible," she said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said methane emissions had accounted for 30 per cent of global warming since the industrial revolution, and were 80 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide emissions. Although they were among the most potent greenhouse gases, they were also among the easiest to curb, she said, so they were useful in making early progress towards 2030 and 2050 emissions reductions targets. "We have to cut emissions faster, and methane is one of the gases we can cut the fastest," she said. "Cutting back methane emissions ... is the low-hanging fruit." The pledge requires countries to work together to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels, rather than each country having to meet that target individually. Ms von de Leyen said the EU would next month introduce regulations to measure, verify and report methane emissions, detect and repair leaks, and put limits on venting and flaring. "We are making COP26 the moment when the world moves from aspiration to action," she said. Mr Biden said his administration would work to reduce methane losses from oil and gas pipelines, and consult with farmers on reducing emissions. He called on other countries to back the pledge. "There are more countries that can join, and should," he said. Agriculture accounts for about 14 per cent of Australian greenhouse gas emissions, while "fugitive emissions" - methane produced from flaring, venting and leakage in the natural gas industry, or from decommissioned coal mines - accounts for 10 per cent. \</doc>

Labor's grand plan to outsmart China in the Pacific is simplistic and highly political. The claim from Anthony -Albanese and Penny Wong that -climate change is the "No 1" issue for Pacific islanders is rubbish. Just like Australians, the No 1 issue in the Pacific is economic -security - secure jobs, reliable -energy and internet connection, putting food on the table and housing. Combating family violence, better hygiene, improving education outcomes and access to basic health services to treat preventable diseases and extend the average life of islanders are also top priorities. Climate change is a significant concern for small island states, particularly low-lying atoll -nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu, which have learned to live with storm surges and flooding. Many of those climate change exposed countries have signed up with China. Kiribati last year agreed to a Beijing-funded airstrip upgrade. China is the world's biggest polluter and refuses to meet -demands from advanced nations to scale back its coal-fired generation. Under no circumstances will China and India agree to be -competitively disadvantaged and put at risk millions of -people who have been pulled out of poverty. Solomon Islands, Kiribati and other Pacific governments are not signing up to Xi Jinping's global agenda because of climate change. Political corruption is rife across the region and MPs have been bedazzled by cash incentives and shoddy projects. Labor says it wants Australia to host a UN climate change conference "with our Pacific nations", -ignoring the repeated failures of previous COP summits. Despite fierce lobbying, the UK and US walked away red-faced from last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow. Albanese and his senior shadow cabinet members are weaponising the security situation to land climate change blows on the Coalition and win domestic points ahead of the May 21 election. The march of China in our -region is well advanced. There is no quick fix to reverse it. The blame is not only shared by successive Coalition and Labor governments, but also the US, Britain and France who dropped the ball and are only now stepping up their efforts. \</doc>

Poll after poll shows more Australians than ever are concerned about climate change and want greater action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global heating. And they have good reason to be. This summer, even in a cooler La Nina year, temperature records were broken and residents of northern NSW became climate refugees as they fled their inundated homes during record-breaking floods. From the fierce black summer bushfires two years ago to the recent bleaching - again - of the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, it's clear that catastrophic climate change is underway and harming Australians here and now. It's happening from the Pilbara town of Onslow, where super heating in January equalled Australia's hottest ever temperature of 50.7 degrees celsius, to Doon Doon in NSW, which broke records with more than a metre of rain in two days. Yet many Australian voters feel cognitive dissonance when they contrast the climate election promises of the two major parties with the urgent calls from scientists for quick, deep emissions cuts by 2030. Nowhere has the divergence between scientific evidence and political ideology been more painfully clear than in Australia's decade-plus climate war. The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change says global emissions must be halved by 2030 to have any hope of limiting global warming to, or close to, 1.5 degrees. It's stark and simple. What is the "fair share" of this emissions budget for Australia? Replicating the same methodology that the federal government's Climate Change Authority used in its advice ahead of the Paris conference, two recent University of Melbourne reports determined that if Australia is to stay within its 1.5 degree budget it would require a 75 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, with net zero by 2035. Before the COP26 There's also considerable political support from the government for emissions intensive fossil fuel industries. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised $250 million subsidies to Australia's two oil refineries and $660 million to accelerate fracking in the Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin. This vast spend dwarfs the coalition's commitments for clean energy projects. It also stands in contrast to what the International Energy Agency (IEA) says is needed: no new oil and gas fields or coal-fired power stations can be created if the world is to stay within less dangerous global heating limits. Already, that hope is fading. As for Labor, it promises to set an emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 and increase the share of renewables in the national electricity market to 82 per cent. This is less than the 45 per cent cut Labor promised under Bill Shorten ahead of the 2019 election and shows the chilling effect that electoral loss had on the party's climate ambition. The 43 per cent figure has been forged through the process of political expediency, but will not reduce emissions quickly enough, according to the scientific evidence. Despite the IEA's "no new coal power" plea, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has committed a Labor government to support new coal mines, matching the pro-mining stance of the Coalition in a push for blue-collar votes. Since the last election, climate change has accelerated and the economy, industry and public attitudes have shifted. In 2019, the Business Council of Australia in 2019 described Labor's 45 per cent emission reduction pledge as "economy wrecking". Now it supports an even-greater 50 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and global forums like COP26 have increased the pressure on climate laggards to act. Neither of the major parties have the emissions reduction policies the scientists say we need, but Labor would be less of a climate wrecker than the Coalition. The Coalition and Labor may struggle to form government on their own, meaning the Greens or independents could hold the balance of power after this election. Climate action would then become a bargaining chip. \</doc>

Responding to climate change is a matter of " HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adapt-or-die-says-environment-agency adapt or die " according to Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the UK Environment Agency. While much of the attention at COP26 is trained on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the crisis, these gases are already at dangerous levels in the atmosphere and will continue to influence the climate for decades to come. Adapting to the mounting floods, droughts and heatwaves is equally as important. These consequences of climate change already affect communities worldwide. Many countries have developed https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/cancun-climate-change-conference-november-2010/statements-and-resources/Agreements national adaptation plans African nations, including Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have proposed HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/cop26-african-nations-seek-talks-climate-finance-deal a finance deal at HYPERLINK COP26 - the UN climate change summit in Glasgow - which would channel US$700bn (\£3520bn) every year from 2025 to help poorer countries build barriers which could alleviate coastal flooding for example, and install solar-powered irrigation systems for growing food. HYPERLINK https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/cop-26-experts-offer-innovative-ways-finance-adaptation-east-africa-46574 Between 2014 and 2018 HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2021 A new report by the UN Environment Programme showed that the costs of damage from climate change in developing countries are five to ten times greater than the amount of public aid so far raised. Zimbabwe, for example, devotes about 9% of its GDP to funding adaptation efforts. But need exceeds expenditure among developing countries by about 80%. The gap between these two is growing. Continuing to delay adequate funding will be more expensive in the long run, and expose more people to greater and greater risk. The benefits of funding adaptation Although around 79% of all countries have adopted some form of national adaptation plan, no country is adapting fast enough. Even in a wealthy country like the US, almost a quarter of roads and other critical infrastructure - from hospitals to police and fire stations to wastewater treatment plants - are at risk of inundation by flood water if they aren't adapted, according to a recent HYPERLINK https://firststreet.org/research-lab/published-research/highlights-from-infrastructure-on-the-brink/ report . Cities globally are unprepared. Two HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57965298 hospitals in east London US$16.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed by governments since the beginning of the pandemic. This is far less than what governments have funnelled towards climate adaptation over the last few decades.

HYPERLINK https://www.adaptation-undp.org/how-profitable-adaptation-climate-change Research in Laos showed that investment in drought and flood-resistant rice seeds raised profits by 78%.

The 26th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties, popularly known as COP26 , is happening at a time when the world has HYPERLINK just experienced one of the warmest years on record. The year 2020 reached temperatures that were about 1.02\'b0C warmer than average. These kinds of extremes, driven by climate change, are being felt intensely across Africa. Greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide and methane - are largely to blame for the changes to the climate. Some of the sun's energy is reflected back to space and is HYPERLINK trapped by these gases leading to a warming of the earth.

African countries cannot be ignored, or just listened to. Their needs should shape the agenda. There must be action that immediately addresses the challenges facing the continent.

Revisiting the Paris Agreement The COP26 summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement , created in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2\'b0C, preferably to 1.5\'b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Essentially, the agreement brought all countries together in a common effort to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. The agreement provides a framework for financial and technical support to countries who need it. It also https://legalresponse.org/legaladvice/interpretation-of-article-9-1-paris-agreement/ obliges developed countries to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts - because they are largely responsible for the losses and costs associated with climate change. The developed nations promised to raise US$100 billion a year to support climate change adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable countries. However, HYPERLINK reports show that this pledge has fallen short by at least US$20 billion since 2018. Unfortunately, there are no clear plans provided by the "rich" nations on how this deficit will be met. This is the time to hold them accountable. COP26 platform At COP26 , countries will launch an adaptation goal and adopt strategies for achieving such a goal. This presents African countries with the opportunity to shape the agenda, once more. Leaders of African countries should approach the convention with a strong, unified voice, presenting their climate change concerns and needs. The negotiation outcomes at COP26 must succeed in favour of Africa and other developing countries by: Making finance more accessible and faster to African and other developing countries.   Developed nations must pledge to boost non-financial efforts in climate change adaptation, such as education. A re-commitment of climate finance in line with the revised nationally determined contributions (NDCs). In addition, African countries should continue to remind developed nations of the need to complement local adaptation efforts with global emission reductions. The concentration of carbon dioxide is on an HYPERLINK https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10794 upward trend , despite a dip in 2020 as a result of economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The HYPERLINK https://www.g20.org/about-the-g20.html G20 countries HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions with China alone emitting nearly 25% of the global emissions, closely followed by the US. Despite emitting the least greenhouse gases, African countries have sought to mitigate the effects of climate change. On average, by 2019, African countries were already spending HYPERLINK https://www.cdcgroup.com/en/news-insight/insight/articles/cdc-emerging-economies-climate-report-2021/ about 5% of their annual GDP to support adaptation and mitigation initiatives, exceeding their contributions to climate change. In addition, regional organisations such as the HYPERLINK https://www.aaainitiative.org/en/initiative African Adaptation Initiative Most African countries HYPERLINK have explored renewable energy resources that can help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. There have also been HYPERLINK https://www.worldagroforestry.org/publication/forestry-based-carbon-sequestration-projects-africa-potential-benefits-and-challenges numerous carbon sequestration initiatives, among other environmentally sustainable investments, running across the continent.

Glasgow | Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher has come back to his native Scotland to be seen being green, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. But our conversation quickly veers off from green to greens. Scotland boasts more than 500 golf courses - more per head of population than anywhere else in the world. And Gallagher, growing up in the heart of the country near Stirling, made sure he didn't miss out. "What we would do as kids, we'd get up and play in the summertime, when it gets light very early," he reminisces. "We'd get up and play before the greenkeeper came. We'd play nine holes. We had a bag of clubs and everything, we just avoided paying." Then he remembers he's talking to a journalist. "I shouldn't admit that, should I?" he chuckles. Practice paid off: he had a single-digit handicap in his youth. Now, he seldom if ever plays, and reckons his handicap would probably be in the 20s. These days he has other things on his mind, like steering an oil and gas company through the existential crisis of the energy transition. And it's that, rather than the lure of the links or the call of family, that has brought him to Scotland. I meet him at Australia's pavilion in the cavernous main hall of the COP26 venue, where Santos has set up a model of its $US165 million ($220 million) Moomba carbon capture and storage (CCS) project being developed with Beach Energy in South Australia. The project's controversial status among green groups back in Australia - they fear it is unproven, unreliable, and will extend the life of fossil fuels - has carried over to Glasgow, where some activists have questioned its inclusion in a government showcase stand. Technology battle Also exhibiting at the Australia pavilion alongside Santos is Fortescue Future Industries, whose founder Andrew Forrest is a champion of renewables-powered hydrogen, and who disparages CCS in all its forms as an unworkable route to net zero. But Gallagher is adamant Moomba will deliver the goods. "Capturing carbon from other industries, transporting it somewhere to store it, that doesn't stack up economically. But that's not what we're talking about here," he says. "We're talking about decarbonisation of oil and gas assets. And we've been injecting gas and reservoirs for more than 50 years all over the world very successfully. There are hundreds if not thousands of cases where that happened." Previously, the gas was stored then later withdrawn again, to manage supply. "What we're talking about now is keeping it there. Very straightforward." And he's happy to keep https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/fortescue-santos-clash-over-hydrogen-20211027-p593oi agreeing to disagree with Forrest He suggests green hydrogen has higher water usage, and higher electrolyser costs, than making it with natural gas. "I think what you'll find is it's more likely to be blue hydrogen, or clean hydrogen, that gets the market up and running on a global basis," he says. To him, the argument can be settled just like it is in the gadget market: all the technologies should compete, and the best one will win. What about inferior VHS beating superior Beta in the videotape era, I ask? He laughs. "They all lost to digital in the end." At COP26 "There's always a lot of enthusiasm around conferences, right? It's really what that enthusiasm level is like two, three months from now," he warns. "But certainly what I'm hearing at the conference is a lot of increased understanding of what these technologies are, and how far they've gotten or not, and what the readiness of the various technologies are." Perhaps less welcome to a natural gas producer is the US-led Global Methane Pledge, signed by more than 100 countries, which aims to HYPERLINK cut methane emissions by almost a third in the coming decade. Energy Minister Angus Taylor refused to sign Australia up, saying the government would not set targets for specific gases or sectors. "I don't think that's a reflection on the gas industry at all," Gallagher says. Santos has young infrastructure and high standards, he says, so its "fugitive emissions", or methane leakage, is low. "Whereas a lot of countries that would operate to lower standards or have older equipment, will have more leakage throughout their systems," he says. "We measure the emissions across our facilities, and we publish all that stuff in our annual climate change report. And they're very low levels, very low indeed." Tartan ties A big benefit of being at COP26 , Gallagher says, is the chance to test his strategy with an exacting audience, and also to have conversations on climate issues that just don't happen anywhere else. "I'm having meetings here with Australian companies in the context of COP26 , whereas if I met them in Australia we wouldn't be talking about these issues, or not as intensely as we've focused on them here." The COP tour of duty ends with a trip to Edinburgh to watch the Wallabies play Scotland at rugby. For Gallagher, this might be an even more challenging assignment than COP. His company is sponsoring the Aussies, but even after more than two decades Down Under his loyalties lie with the land of his birth. Even in the Wallabies' corporate box, he'll be cheering on the Scots. "I support the Wallabies against everybody. Except Scotland," he laughs. "I was speaking to the CEO [of Rugby Australia] just a couple of weeks back, and I said, \' Mate, I'm sorry, but on the day, I'll be wearing blue'." \</doc>

THE Coalition government has promised to invest $220 million in forestry technology if elected, which the industry says could quickly inject a significant amount of timber into the constricted domestic market. The investment comes despite Australia signing an international agreement at the COP26 summit to end deforestation by 2030 last year. However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Coalition would never support shutdowns of native forestry and would work with state governments to create permanent timber production areas. Mr Morrison said as the country battled a building material shortage and uncertainty around global supply chains, Australia's forestry industry would be critical to a stronger future. "Global demand for wood products is set to quadruple by 2050 so this investment in the jobs and future of the forestry industry is critical," he said. "The pressures on the building industry and the uncertain international trade situation has made it clear that local wood products and local skills are critical - just ask any tradie who has been trying to get wood products." A $100-million National Institute for Forest Productions Innovation will be established in Launceston, Tas, with up to five regionally-located Centres of Excellence across Australia, which will be paired with $113 million in grants to accelerate the adoption of new wood processing technologies in manufacturing businesses. Australian Forest Products Association chief executive Ross Hampton said it was "absolutely possible to get quick wins" from the grant funding and see a "significant amount" of timber injected into the domestic market. "There are new saws that can cut around curves, it's possible to glue smaller pieces of timber to get the strength we need in construction and there's an opportunity to review the timber grading system we use." \</doc>

Labor remains confident it can secure the rights to host a UN climate summit in Australia, despite its pro-coal stance running at odds with the global push to phase out the fossil fuel. An Albanese government would bid to host a COP summit as part of its attempts to repair Australia's international reputation on climate action, which it says has been battered by the Coalition's refusal to set higher emissions reduction targets. Labor wants to host the event in partnership with Pacific nations, which face an existential threat from climate change. But Labor's climate credentials and suitability to host the event are being called into question because of its ongoing support for the coal sector. After sending mixed messages on the resources sector during Labor's failed 2019 campaign, Mr Albanese has this week made clear he wouldn't oppose the construction of new coal mines which secure environmental approvals or seek to stop coal exports if he wins next month's election. Mr Albanese offered a blunt "no" when asked on Wednesday if Labor would sign up to a global pledge to end the use of coal power over the next two decades. More than 40 countries signed on to the pledge at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. The Morrison government snubbed the deal. Asked to explain why Labor wouldn't sign the agreement, Mr Albanese said: "Coal is a part of our energy mix here in Australia, right now". Despite the pro-coal stance, the Opposition Leader said a Labor government would have a "very good chance" of hosting a future climate conference. Mr Albanese used the prospect of a conference co-hosted with Pacific nations as another angle of attack at the Morrison government's failure to thwart the new security pact between Solomon Islands and China. \</doc>

Last week National Farmers' Federation president Fiona Simson and I had the chance to speak at the Federal Nationals party room meeting as they debated Australia's plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050. It was a rare and significant opportunity - the result of tireless lobbying - and during the time that we had we were united in conveying several key messages to the party room. Firstly, that Australian agriculture cannot accept another 'Kyoto' (COP3) outcome, with the 20 years of damage it has inflicted on farmers who significantly and disproportionately delivered on our nation's carbon reduction commitments. During that time, vegetation management laws in Queensland have been radically amended more than 40 times - locking up land and preventing active management, resulting in thickening vegetation that chokes, rather than protects, healthy ecosystems. Secondly, we agreed that our industry must be recognised and included in any future government policy for the work that farmers have done and for the future opportunities we have in front of us. Agriculture and regional Australia have a powerful and positive story to tell on climate - both in terms of what has so far been achieved and what they still have to offer. We are the only industry to have tangibly and demonstrably reduced emissions since COP3 and we can continue to be a strong part of Australia's ongoing contribution to this issue. However, for that to happen we must be equals in the conversation - counted in, not carved out, as some have suggested doing. Australian agriculture, with support from science and the broader community, has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world and announce its intention to do so on the international stage at COP26 in Glasgow. We know it's possible, we have the evidence to support it - now we need governments to back us. Finally, Fiona and I conveyed to the Federal Nationals our shared belief in AgForce's AgCarE program as a system that allows farmers to retain control of their ecosystem services, while improving the environment, and increasing their agribusiness' resilience. My own family-run operation participated in the initial AgCarE pilot and, as a result, I now know that our cattle breeding, trading, and fattening business sequesters more carbon than it emits. Participation in AgCarE has given us renewed confidence in our operation, enabled our family to understand where we can do even more on climate, and opened our eyes to future opportunities available to us. If COP26 It's time we launched a new, compelling narrative - one that becomes woven into the fabric of every Australian's consciousness and celebrates the combination of our unique landscapes, powerful agriculture industry, and strong regions. That focuses on the truth behind our incredible industry's role in enhancing our landscapes, our environment, and our communities. - Georgie Somerset, AgForce general president \</doc>

ABSTRACT While the last minute watering down of the language in the COP26 agreement is deeply disappointing, it will be the actions of countries, corporates and individuals in the coming years that will determine its ultimate impact on our future. FULL TEXT Trying to declare COP26 a success or a failure is hard to do. While the last minute watering down of the language in the COP26 HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/ reports still conclude that A step in the right direction Let us also not forget the progress that has been made: pledges to phase out coal production, end financing of overseas fossil fuel projects, end deforestation, the methane reduction pledge. They're not perfect, nor are they universal, but they are an important step in the right direction.\~ [related-story id="221211"] Another significant development we have seen at COP26 is the shift from what previously was largely intergovernmental agreement to the engagement of the private sector. CEOs of multinational corporations from every sector were in attendance. The world's largest companies have now realised that without embracing climate action and showing a path to net-zero, they will not be able to win customers or retain staff and their cost of insurance and financing will increase. The other thing many of these CEOs realise - and the reason many HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/australian-eco-entrepreneur-fends-off-2700-rivals-to-win-cop26-prize-20211105-p596cz entrepreneurs were in attendance - is that the climate transition represents an enormous investment opportunity. Let's face it, humans aren't great at assessing threats years down the road, even if that threat could mean our demise. Where we excel, however, is in taking advantage of opportunities that are right in front of us. Solving the climate crisis is an enormous HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/technology/crisis-or-opportunity-reframing-the-climate-emergency-20210929-p58vrb opportunity . As Bill Gates says, "We need to transform the way we do almost everything..." and this transformation and disruption is perfectly suited to entrepreneurs and startups. We shouldn't rely on the stick, we should embrace the carrot.\~ The climate tech already exists Australia has a long history of creating world leading technologies (ultrasound, the bionic ear, WiFi, PERC solar cells). We also have a number of competitive advantages in the climate space; great renewable resources that will allow us to more easily decarbonise our grid, rare minerals for batteries, an agricultural sector that embraces technology, world-leading research centres and universities, corporates and consumers who want to take action and ambitious founders with game-changing ideas. But in order to be a leader, we need to focus on funding early stage businesses and building capacity and skills across the ecosystem. We can see the pathway. Many of the technologies we need to make this transition already exist and they simply need to be deployed at speed and scale. Energy from renewables is now the cheapest source of electricity - we just need much, much more of it. Electric vehicle performance has surpassed that of internal combustion engines (which are being outlawed in many jurisdictions and OEMs are discontinuing them anyway). You can now also pick up alternative and HYPERLINK https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/covid-19-supercharged-australia-plant-based-meat/ plant-based meat in just about any supermarket and even in fast-food outlets. We need to be supporting the startups that have the technologies that can help create and deploy these types of opportunities at scale.\~\~ Solving climate change does need some new technological breakthroughs, especially in the sectors hard to decarbonise like cement, steel, aviation and chemical production. Australian universities and research centres could make some of these innovations a reality, but without investors supporting seed and early investment rounds, many of these important climate solutions won't make it out of the lab.\~ [related-story id="221234"] We need more support to help subject matter experts commercialise and scale new innovations. Investors need to share founders' drive to have the greatest impact by supporting founders to be the most successful they can be.\~ For us at Investible, that vision and commitment will be realised by creating dedicated pools of capital for climate tech companies, supported by innovative projects HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/technology/battle-for-climate-start-ups-as-sydney-launches-new-cbd-innovation-hub-20210729-p58e5i like Greenhouse that bring together industry, academia, research, government, capital and ancillary services for startups. Initiatives like this will help Australia become a focal point for climate tech innovation.

\~\~It will be scientists, not politicians, who come up with the solution to climate change, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told assembled world leaders at COP26 . \~\~ "The challenge of combating climate change will be met the same way, and it will be met by people who frankly are largely not in this room," Mr Morrison toldthe summitin Glasgow on Monday. \~\~ "It will be our scientists, our technologists, our engineers, our entrepreneurs, our industrialists and our financiers that will actually chart the path to net zero and it is up to us as leaders of governments to back them in." \~\~ Global momentum to tackle climate change is building and Australia's best and brightest are at the ready, he said. \~\~ "The Australian way is to bet on them and we think that's a good bet," he said. \~\~ But he said it was important to do so in such a way not to deny people their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life - especially those in developing nations. \~\~ "Cleaner technology solutions must out-compete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere," he said. \~\~ "Raising the cost of energy just impacts on those who can afford it least." \~\~ Earlier on Monday, Mr Morrison announced an additional $500 million in climate financial aid to our Pacific and South East Asian neighbours, bringing our total commitment to $2 billion over the next five years. \~\~ "Australia meets and beats our commitments," he told the summit. \~\~ Australia has already reduced emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005 and we are on target to fall by 35 per cent by 2030, far exceeding our 2015 Paris climate agreement, he said. \</doc>

Australia will have to revisit and strengthen its carbon emission 2030 targets by the end of next year if the first draft of the Glasgow COP26 agreement is approved in the coming days. The first official draft, a seven-page document of technical commitments, was released by the United Nations Climate summit on Wednesday and will form the basis of tense negotiations in the coming days. The key point that affects Australia urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". It is clearly directed at countries such as Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh plans on the table by the end of next year, which, for Australia, falls after the general election. Australia had come into the COP with a new net zero commitment for 2050, but had kept its more immediate plans for 2030 the same: pledging reductions of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. These commitments were well below those of other developed nations. The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fight to keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set time frames or specific targets. British prime minister Boris Johnson has returned to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations for a final push to "pull out all the stops" as the final negotiations begin. Energy Minister Angus Taylor has made it clear that the government is supportive of coal and fossil fuels and blue hydrogen - using hydrogen from fossil fuels - as well as renewable energy. Once Canberra has analysed and responded to the draft - like the near 200 COP member countries - specific emphasis and wor-ding can change and the final "cover statement", could be watered down. The UN wants to keep countries on track to try and prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels. The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century. Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to fine tune their pre-2030 ambitions. Money for developing countries to try and mitigate climate change and make them more resilient is to go beyond the current target of $100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025. India had asked that there be $1 trillion a year support for developing countries. The draft says that developed countries are to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries. \</doc>

Editorial When Scott Morrison lands in Glasgow he will be in the unfortunate position of somebody who turns up to a pot luck dinner with a packet of corn chips in the hope someone has brought salsa. While, at first blush, getting the Coalition to sign up to net zero by 2050 was a significant achievement, on closer examination Tuesday's announcement is essentially meaningless. Although the goal post has shifted the game plan is virtually unchanged. Previous announcables have been repackaged to persuade voters less is more when it comes to saving the planet. COP26 was always going to be about 2030, not 2050. That was reiterated yet again by Wednesday's annual UN Emissions Gap report. The Morrison government's failure to even consider increasing Australia's short term target to match the latest projections of a 35 per cent reduction by 2030 is a travesty and a sop to the Nationals. The lame excuse this wasn't taken to the 2019 election is so obviously fallacious as to be risible. The LNP mocked Labor for its commitment to net zero by 2050 during that campaign. It has now adopted the same target. If you believe the PM and the Climate Minister it's possible to achieve a climate nirvana with no taxes, no cost to the community and no pain and all gain. Unfortunately the modelling to back these assertions up is only going to be released "eventually"; presumably after the election. While commitments to driving down the cost of greenhouse friendly new technologies and to accelerate their deployment are not without merit, we can't punt humanity's future on blind faith all will be saved by a "technological crunch". The onus is now on the ALP to release a credible policy based on real action rather than a blind faith in technologies that don't exist and may never come to fruition. It's not good enough to say, as Mr Albanese effectively did on Tuesday, "they're the government, they're the ones that need a plan, we'll announce something after Glasgow". An election is imminent, possibly even before the end of the year. Labor needs to take a stand and soon. \</doc>

ABSTRACT Momentum is building in the Pacific as two Torres Strait community leaders attempt to sue the federal government for failing to act on climate change. FULL TEXT Pacific nations need to be central to COP26 's upcoming discussions, according to four Australian researchers due to attend the summit talks. Momentum is building in the Pacific as two Torres Strait community leaders are attempting to sue the federal government for failing to act on climate change, arguing it breached a duty of care.\~ Lawyers for Pabai Pabai and Paul Kabai say in the Federal Court that Australia should reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will prevent their communities from harm.\~ Kabai HYPERLINK told the ABC he worried one day "we'll be underwater" and the island communities would lose their culture and identities. "We'll lose everything," he said. "We're not going to survive if the government is not going to help us." Dr Virginia Marshall, from the Australian National University, will attend COP26 as a delegate of the Indigenous Peoples' Organisation Australia and the UN Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples' Platform.\~ She's aiming to build collaboration across Pacific Indigenous communities and through her engagement with Latin American ambassadors.\~ "Climate change will have major impacts on biodiversity, water security and fire regimes across Australia's vast expanse of Indigenous estate," Marshall said, adding the cause should be part of the government's National Roadmap for Indigenous Australia. Also attending the UN conference in Glasgow to represent various Pacific island nations are ANU's Dr Siobhan McDonnell, Dr Ian Fry and Sala Dr George Carter. McDonnell, a lecturer at the Crawford School of Public Policy who negotiated for Vanuatu on loss and damage at COP25, will be supporting the Fiji delegation on loss and damage. "These are actual costs that are borne now and into the future by Pacific island nations and their people in terms of spiritual loss of place, loss of aspects of culture, burial grounds and loss of attachment to place," she said.\~ Fry said his focus was to finalise the rules for carbon markets for least developed countries.\~ "At the last COP in Madrid, we got very close to a final decision that would implement the carbon market, but Brazil blocked an outcome," Fry, who first attended COP in 1997, said.\~ "Since then, we have been having many online informal negotiating sessions to resolve some of the outstanding issues." The key issue, he said, was to ensure the carbon market delivered real emissions reductions with rigour that stopped countries buying their way out of meeting goals.\~ Carter lamented that representatives for Pacific island nations had lobbied for climate action since 1990. "The signs are detrimental and there is an existential threat to the livelihoods, the security and the well-being of Pacific people," Carter said.\~ He said the states were "like-minded, multi-actor coalitions" and were "at the forefront of making sure the current negotiations for the Paris Agreement uphold environmental integrity".

Glasgow | Australian eco-entrepreneur Sophia Hamblin Wang's carbon-busting start-up has fended off 2700 worldwide competitors to take first prize in a Dragon's Den-style contest for the business pitch at COP26 in Glasgow. The prize will dramatically raise the profile of Ms Hamblin Wang and her company, Mineral Carbonation International, potentially drawing new investment and international expansion opportunities. The carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) company, which can take carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and convert them into building materials, is being showcased at Australia's pop-up pavilion in the COP26 summit venue. British High Commissioner Vicki Treadell entered MCI into the competition back in September, which involved Ms Hamblin Wang, who is chief operating officer, making a three-minute video pitch. She eschewed the typical slickly produced, soundtrack-backed video and just filmed a three-minute piece to camera - banking on the product itself to do the hard work. Feedback from the judges suggested the gamble paid off. They were impressed with the technology's applicability and adaptability to different industries, even when the CO2 purity is low. She described the win, from among 10 pitches that made the final at the Glasgow event itself, as "surreal". "We've been quietly building the technology for eight years, and we've been really underselling what we do, just happily in development phase," she said. "And now to come out of that and into a commercialisation phase, and being able to tell people \' hey, we've got a technology that can actually turn waste into new products and be part of a $6 trillion industry', it's really exciting, to be seen as a global leader." The prize had barely been announced when new suitors began approaching her. "Even directly at the award event itself, I was approached by a number of investors, hard-hitting investors," she said. "MCI is looking to raise money from values-aligned, strategic investors. And we've been approached by a number of them since the pitch battle, that's for sure." The evidence was visible at Ms Hamblin Wang's stand at the Australia pavilion, adorned with a Jenga-like pile of mini-bricks, where during our interview people kept coming up to speak to her. Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest has said he is a fan, as did Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake. "I've sat in on so many sessions this week, and I'm just blown away by the sort of things people are working on. A lady gave me a little block of cement in which they're doing incredible CCUS work," Ms Wikramanayake told a meeting. Ms Hamblin Wang welcomes all the interest, of course, but said she wanted investors to act judiciously during the coming clean-tech boom. "At the same time as all of this finance is being unlocked, there's a lot of technologies that are emerging that are making great claims that need to be validated," she warned. The company already has a pilot plant at Newcastle University, but has received a $14.6 million grant to build a demonstration plant at Orica's ammonium nitrate facility on Kooragang Island. "It will be built in a modular and mobile way, so once we demonstrate at Orica, then we can pick it up and take it to a steelworks or a nickel mine or a cement plant, and validate the technology in those industrial settings." Ms Hamblin Wang was almost unable to come to Glasgow, after her travel exemption was turned down at first attempt. But in other ways, the constraints of COVID-19 have been a kind of benefit. "We've always been internationally focused, from the beginning. So COVID was really hard because it felt like we would lose opportunities," she said. "But it made us really focus on the Australian market for that period, and we progressed many projects in the Australian context. And when you think about turning CO2 into usable materials, including materials for the construction industry, the kinds of jobs and competencies and skills that Australia has fit really well." \</doc>

Australia finally has a net zero plan at the Commonwealth level. But so far, health hasn't been factored into Australia's national climate response. The federal government has yet to announce plans specific to the sector or, more broadly, the health of Australians.

Glasgow | British Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the COP26 summit in Glasgow by comparing the world to James Bond at the climax of one of his films, strapped to a ticking doomsday machine and struggling to defuse it. During the two days he spent in Glasgow, Johnson probably corralled world leaders into snipping at least one of the wires - but over the next fortnight there is still a tangle to unpick. His big job was to turn the Paris Agreement of 2015 into a larger pair of bolt-cutters. Back then, it was enough to agree that global warming had to be kept below 2 degrees Celsius. The UN has since said the catastrophe kicks in at 1.5C, and Johnson's mission was to get the world to accept that the doomsday machine was getting menacingly larger. This he seems to have done - at least until China expressed reservations late on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT). The next job was to sharpen the tools needed to defuse the climate doomsday clock. At the very least, this meant a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; but far better - since the world has already warmed by 1.1C from pre-industrial times - a 2030 target that gets most of the way there. This he partly seems to have done. Not all countries have gone hard on 2030 but most have made a 2050 pledge, though big-emitting China is going for 2060 and India for 2070. But the consensus founders when it comes to exactly what is required to hit those targets, and whether anyone is really yet doing enough to get there. So Johnson and his stalwart new accomplice, Joe Biden, sought to move this debate on from the realm of grand abstraction to the realm of the tangible and practical. They tried to rev up technology partnerships with the private sector, and funding commitments, and side deals or mini-deals - anything that would, as EU boss Ursula von der Leyen said, make the leap from "aspiration to action". India came to this party, softening the impact of its 2070 punt into the outfield by laying down some highly specific targets for 2030. Even so, climate activists and fellow nations are having to take a lot of countries' commitments and pledges on trust. And trust remains a problem: another issue that Johnson did not iron out is the dissatisfaction that poor-country leaders expressed - in highly emotive and moralistic terms - about the $US20 billion shortfall in rich nations' Paris pledge to fork over $US100 billion a year to support the developing world's energy transition. The private sector is piling in, though, and over the next few days it will be the finance and energy industries' turn to unveil initiatives, campaigns, deals and projects. Meanwhile, in the background, negotiators will be looking at the unfinished business of Paris - trading in carbon credits, and how often commitments should be assessed and scaled up - ready for a week of painful line-by-line dissection. Optimists are saying that all this means COP26 might sufficiently arm James Bond, standing in for the world, to give him a shot at hobbling the doomsday clock. The pessimists, though, are worried that there is too much evidence of dithering and insincerity in Glasgow, and so he might run out of time. \</doc>

Glasgow | A clutch of countries with large oil and gas reserves have vowed to halt exploration and phase out production, hoping to trigger the kind of momentum that has turned coal into such a climate bogeyman. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which was launched on Thursday (Friday AEDT), has barely a dozen members, but co-founders Denmark and Costa Rica said they hoped it would be "the beginning of the end for oil and gas". The major signatories have pledged to stop issuing exploration licences, extraction permits or leases, and to phase out production by 2050. "After this COP, we will no longer be able to say that gas is a transition fuel. It has been called out," said Australia Institute director Richie Merzian. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) announcement came as negotiators from 197 countries wrangled over whether the COP26 summit's closing statement would include, for the first time, a commitment to "accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". COP26 host Britain is keen to retain this text, but as negotiations reached crunch point on Friday (AEDT), Saudi Arabia, Russia and India looked set to put the kybosh on it. Its likely deletion will disappoint environmental groups, who will have to take solace from the BOGA launch plus the various anti-coal pledges from the COP's first week. The group of countries signing up to BOGA includes some with large reserves such as Greenland, Denmark and Costa Rica, alongside France, Ireland and New Zealand. Portugal and Italy have taken out lower-tier membership, and Quebec, Wales and California have joined at a sub-national level. Welsh climate minister Lee Waters said even if COP26 failed to deliver, "this alliance shows that action is possible  the point of this is to create momentum". Denmark's Climate & Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said he was talking to more countries about signing on. Without specifically referencing Australia, he said any oil and gas exporter with a 2050 net-zero target should be looking to join. "How can you defend wanting to be carbon-neutral in 2050 ... but still be wanting to produce oil and gas and selling it to others?" he said. "That, in our view, does not add up." Denmark was once among Europe's largest oil producers, and Mr Jorgensen admitted that his country's decision to stop issuing exploration licences had been difficult and expensive. It had required heavy investment in retraining workers and in building offshore wind capacity. Costa Rican environment and energy minister Andrea Meza Murillo said her government had withstood two decades of pressure to exploit its oil reserves. "It's not an easy conversation in any country," she said. Simon Bradshaw, research director at the Climate Council, said that like BOGA, the PPCA initially included few major coal producers or consumers. "Cut to 2021, and the list of countries committing in various ways to phase out coal includes Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland and South Korea," he said. "The rest of the world is moving while Australia is standing still." But Mr Merzian said the overall effect of the various alliances and groupings was that momentum was "moving in the right direction, and it's all moving in the same direction". Australia Institute analysis suggests coal, oil and gas production must fall globally by 69 per cent, 31 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in the next nine years if global warming is to remain within 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. But although the coal output of Britain, the US, Canada, Norway and Australia is expected to drop 30 per cent in that time, their collective production of oil is set to rise by 33 per cent and gas by 27 per cent. "This is a grand transition of extreme complexity," he said. "This alliance is a good forum to discuss, to create synergy, to create momentum, to exchange ideas and best practices, to choose together the way to go ahead." \</doc>

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his deputy Barnaby Joyce are spruiking the future of the coal industry, just days after Australia agreed to a global pact to "phase down" the sector to address climate change. The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow "sounded the death knell for coal power", however,\~Mr Morrison disputed that characterisation of the outcome of the global talks. "I don't believe it did, and for all of those who are working in that industry in Australia, they'll continue to be working in that industry for decades to come," he said. Standing in front of a coal-laden train in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said international demand for coal was strong and Australia should take advantage of it. "You've got record prices and record volumes, so if the world's buying it, there's a market for it," he said from Singleton. "If they say the world is transitioning away from [coal], well, you'll see that at the Port of Newcastle and you'll see that at the Port of Gladstone  \~but it's not happening." Australia won't move on 2030 target, despite global call The final COP26 Despite agreeing to the communique, the federal government is adamant it will not change Australia's current 2030 emissions reduction target, which was set six years ago as a\~26 to 28 per cent cut, based on 2005 levels.\~ "Well, all that happened at COP26 was all countries noted a request to revisit these things," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. "But I've been very clear about what our target is, and that we will meet and beat it."

Mr Joyce  \~who, as leader of the Nationals, recently negotiated a secret HYPERLINK deal on climate policy "We're not starting to change targets for 2030, because we've got to earn a buck," he said.

Opposition flags climate announcement before end of year Federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese accused Mr Morrison of walking away from commitments he has made, given the PM was\~not willing to revisit the 2030 target next year. "I find it completely extraordinary that, 24 hours after the federal government signed up to having a higher 2030 target in 2022, they've walked away from that commitment they voluntarily signed up to in Glasgow," he said.\~ "Why is it when it comes to Scott Morrison, what he says yesterday doesn't matter today?"\~ The Labor Party has yet to announce its policy on a 2030 emissions reduction target, having ditched its commitment from the last election to cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. Earlier today, Mr Albanese was again asked when Labor would announce its own climate ambitions. "We will be releasing further climate change policy before end of the year," Mr Albanese said.\~ \</doc>

\~\~A former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris pact six years ago has condemned Australia's "suicidal" plan to limit global warming as Scott Morrison prepares to address world leaders in Glasgow. \~\~ The prime minister is expected to deliver Australia's national statement at the COP26 climate summit early on Tuesday, Australian time. \~\~ His refusalto adopt ambitious new targets to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a headline objective of the conference, has been heavily criticised by some. \~\~ But possibly the harshest criticism has come just ahead of his address to the World Leaders' Forum, from former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped unite nations behind 2015's Paris climate agreement. \~\~ She says she cannot reconcile Australia's failure to ramp up its 2030 target beyond what was set six years ago, when the science has come so far. \~\~ "I struggle to find an adjective that is politically correct, to be honest. What Australia continues to do is so irresponsible," she told the ABC on the sidelines of the summit. \~\~ Australian observers have echoed that assessment. \~\~ He says it appears the government is trying to "do as little as possible" and has praised Ms Figueres for using challenging language to describe Australia's approach. \~\~ "The purpose of the Paris Agreement is to ensure a safe climate for all Australians. They are failing to ensure that, and therefore they must revisit their contribution and encourage others to do the same," he told AAP from Glasgow. \~\~ Tim Baxter is a senior researcher for climate solutions at the Climate Council. \~\~ He says it was always incumbent on Australia, as a party to the Paris pact, to come back to key climate talks with ambitious targets to reduce emissions. \~\~ "With each new report we get out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is this additional degree of certainty," he told AAP. \~\~ He says that if the world warms by 2C, tropical coral reefs like the Great Barrier Reef, and low-lying Pacific nations, will be lost along with challenges such as more intense and more frequent heatwaves and more erratic rainfall patterns. \~\~ But what is evolving alongside the science, he says, are the solutions that mean 1.5C is still possible, and Australia is one of the richest nations on earth in that regard. \~\~ "We have so many ducks in a row. We're the sunniest continent on the planet, the windiest inhabited continent on the planet," he said. \~\~ "We have massive reserves of new economy minerals like lithium, that underpin what's needed for a zero-emissions future. \~\~ "All of these things, these chess pieces, are on the board to ensure Australia can successfully navigate this. \~\~ "The one thing that's very very clear is the absence of leadership at the federal level." \~\~ Mr Morrison has said he cannot change Australia's 2030 target because voters elected the Coalition in 2019, and in doing so rejected Labor's promise to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by the decade's end. \~\~ But he has said Australia will exceed its promise to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, and will provide projections at COP26 indicating the figure will settle at about 35 per cent. \~\~ He has promised his plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 will get the job done by aiding the development of low-emissions technologies, without killing off industries including coal and gas exports. \~\~ "It is not OK ... to say to developing countries that they somehow have to settle for less, that they can't have the same growth to their own economies, and the jobs and the lifting of living standards that developed countries have been appreciating," he said before leaving the G20 summit in Rome and heading to Glasgow. \~\~ "The way that is achieved for them is ensuring that we can get those technology costs as low as possible." \</doc>

I n a basement restaurant in Glasgow last weekend, Alden Meyer, a veteran of three decades of United Nations climate negotiations, gathered a group of journalists and experts together in the hope the latter could explain to the former what was actually going on in the climate talks. In his opening remarks, Meyer, who has advised many governments on climate and is now a senior associate of the think tank E3G, quoted a comment Barack Obama's science advisor John Holdren once made about climate change. "We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation and suffering," Holdren said in 2007. "We're going to do some of each. The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be." On those key metrics, the years since have been wasted, despite the success of the 2015 Paris talks in delivering an agreement on a course of action the world might follow to save itself. Big visions, small gains Carbon emissions have continued to rise steadily upwards, as has warming, as has extreme weather, as has ocean rise and acidification. Depending on which analysis you trust most, when the latest climate summit began, the world was headed for catastrophic warming of 2.7 degrees, should governments act on their pledges. In the final hours of negotiations it is headed for catastrophic warming of just over or under 2 degrees. It might still come down further. But with the last hours of negotiating to come, it seems clear the central goal of COP26 - to halve emissions by 2030 so the world has a hope of reaching net zero by 2050 and in turn, perhaps, stabilise the climate at 1.5 degrees - will not be met. And whatever the final outcome of the talks, the terms of the terrible equation Holdren laid out a decade-and-a-half ago have now shifted. Due to past and ongoing failure on mitigation, there will now necessarily be far more suffering than there needed to be, and in the corridors of COP26 , that fact is etched into the faces of delegates, particularly those from the global south. There will also need to be faster mitigation and more expensive adaptation. Meyers points out that if we'd started acting decisively to drive down emissions as recently as 2018, we would have needed a 7 per cent cut in emissions each year to be on a 1.5 degree path. But we didn't, and now we need a 10 per cent cut each year, a figure that grows every month of inaction. We can now add the trillions of dollars needed for developing nations on the climate frontline. They are counting the cost of loss and damage caused by emissions released by wealthy nations over the past 200-odd years, since the industrial revolution began with the steam engines on the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow Good cop or bad cop Well before this COP26 summit started, many had written it off. There were those that feared that the United Kingdom had sidelined itself as a serious international player with Brexit, that Boris Johnson's support for the project was rhetorical rather than substantial. There were fears that the summit's president, Alok Sharma, was too distracted by cabinet duties to focus on building momentum. The energy crisis would wreck it, said others. What Meyer referred to as "the food fight and finger pointing between China and Russia" would derail it. But overwhelming it all was the threat of COVID-19. Should the conference become a superspreader event, the cost to the UK hosts would have been catastrophic and the talks themselves could have been hampered as delegates retreated to lockdown in hotels. Fearing (rightly) that representation from some of the most climate vulnerable countries would be curtailed by pandemic travel restrictions, the Climate Action Network in September called for the conference, which was to have been held last year, to be delayed again. That was never a serious consideration. In a very real sense, the hard work had already been underway for months. The UK and the US, the G7 and the G20 had laid out a year of diplomacy leading up to this fortnight. It was locked in. As the event kicked into its second day, Greta Thunberg offered her searing assessment of its worth to protests outside. "Change is not going to come from inside there. That is not leadership. is leadership... We say \' No more blah, blah, blah... No more whatever the f--k they're doing inside there'." Hers was, is, an absolutely reasonable point. The world has failed on climate, and it has particularly failed her generation. But inside, on that second day, the end of the leaders' meeting was approaching and the tone was sincere and urgent. "Recent climate action announcements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around. This is an illusion," said UN Secretary General Antonia Guterres, who has been carefully increasing the urgency of his own rhetoric for months. "Failure to provide the critical finance  and that of loss and damage  is measured, my friends, in lives and livelihoods in our communities. This is immoral, and it is unjust," said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottely in a standout address "For those who have eyes to see, for those who have ears to listen, and for those who have a heart to feel: 1.5 is what we need to survive. 2 degrees... is a death sentence for the people of Antigua and Barbuda, for the people of the Maldives, for the people of Dominica and Fiji, for the people of Kenya and Mozambique  and yes, for the people of Samoa and Barbados." What was notable to many who had attended these conferences for years was that there was no challenge to the science of global warming, no argument against the need for action. The debate was settled. Side deals and backtracking Over the following days, a momentum orchestrated by the COP presidency was injected into the proceedings as negotiators began the painstaking work on what is known as a cover decision. A series of pledges, essentially side deals to the UN negotiations, were announced. A pledge by 40-odd nations to phase out coal was welcomed, particularly for the inclusion of major coal users such as Poland and Vietnam. But enthusiasm was dampened because China, the US and Australia were not onboard. Another deal to end deforestation was celebrated, especially for the inclusion of Brazil and Indonesia. The following day though, both Brazil and Indonesia walked back their pledges. More than 100 nations agreed to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, a move scientists believed could have the single most significant impact on warming of all the side-deals. Meanwhile, the private sector congratulated itself for announcing that $130 trillion worth of assets were now in line with a 1.5 degree efforts. Nigel Topping, the UK official appointed by the UN to be High Level Champion for Climate Action at COP26 , told the Herald and The Age that this was "a big f---ing deal". It was welcomed, though some analysts questioned the rigor with which the claims could be tested. By the week's end the most optimistic analyses of the pledges combined with new national commitments suggested that the gap had shrunk by as much as 0.7 of a degree. Later projections by the United Nations' Environment program and the widely regarded Climate Action Tracker challenged this in large part because many of the reductions commitments - such as Australia's - were based on 2050 targets without being supported by the 2030 commitments that would make them achievable. Either way, Johnson and Sharma's campaign rolled on. By earlier this week, criticism of Sharma's presidency began to wane. In his management of plenary sessions and briefings, his manner was firm but calm. He drove the vast cumbersome process forward, constantly urging delegates to work harder and more generously, refusing to allow deadlines to slip. Early drafts of the cover decision appeared and predictably enough contained elements to disappoint everyone, but some points that reassured observers, particularly a focus on 1.5 and action this decade. "Come equipped with the currency of compromise," Sharma kept telling delegates, before shooing them back into their meeting rooms. As the optimism, and stamina, began to ebb on Wednesday, news broke that the HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/existential-crisis-united-states-and-china-stun-cop26-with-joint-climate-change-pact-20211111-p597wq.html US and China were about to make a joint announcement . Minutes later, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua was in the briefing room explaining that on this issue the two great powers had common ground. "We need to think big and feel responsible," he told startled reporters "We need to work  hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world." This sudden moment was long in the making, the product of months of meetings between Xie and his US counterpart John Kerry. Again, by the following day the response was mixed. The statement was light on detail and self-congratulatory, said the critics. But it did focus on 1.5 and on action by 2030, argued those relieved that the great power rivalry had not ended the proceedings. As negotiations continued and observers speculated about which elements of the cover decision might be lost in compromise - would China accept more accountability if the US backed down on ambition? - representatives of the most vulnerable nations kept reminding western diplomats, delegates and journalists that though the world faces a common threat, we don't all bear the same risk. On Thursday afternoon, news broke that India and China were leading a bloc of nations that wanted to dump the mitigation section of the draft - the language that focussed on 1.5 over 2 degrees, and that might call on nations that have not improved their 2030 targets to do so next year rather than in five years. Around the same time, Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and an ambassador for a voting bloc of nations known as the Climate Vulnerable Forum, issued a blunt statement. "This COP is in danger of failing. The combined pledges from parties are still far from 1.5 degrees. If we don't limit global temperature rise to 1.5 my country will die," he said. "Our islands will go beneath the waves. 40 million islanders around the world will become refugees. "We are now in an urgent situation and we need to save this COP." The night before the summit began, a staffer for a key official considered the weeks ahead. Asked about the prospect of failure, he said the process created in Paris was already a miracle. There is no other diplomatic instrument in history that has extracted commitments from so many nations. There is no other mechanism to herd a global community of nations in the same direction, let alone one that might have a passing chance at reaching a consensus. COP26 is, as John Kerry and Boris Johnson keep saying, our last best chance. Whatever its outcome it will be too little too late, but far better than nothing.

NSW Treasurer and Environment Minister Matt Kean says his government has signed a pledge with the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to boost electric vehicle sales and says it is on track to make 50 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the state electric by 2030. The three-page joint pledge with COP26 says federal governments who sign will seek to work "towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission by 2040 or earlier, or by no later than 2035 in leading markets". The second part of the pledge, relevant to regional governments and states, says they will convert their owned or leased car and van fleets to zero emission vehicles by 2035 at the latest, as well as putting in place policies that will enable and accelerate the transition to zero emission vehicles as soon as possible. Mr Kean told Sky News he had "signed the document" on Wednesday and was working with the federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to get it formalised. "Because of the policies we have put in place we are already well on target to meet those ambitious targets set by COP. In fact, we'll have 50 per cent of all new cars sold in NSW being electric by 2030," he said. The COP electric vehicles pledge is one that the UK, as the host country, pulled together. DFAT has been contacted for comment. Other states are also looking to sign the pledge. The NSW government announced on Wednesday it would spend another $105 million to spur the uptake of electric vehicles among councils, taxi companies and other fleet operators by offering to cover part of the extra costs over conventional cars. The state has committed almost $600 million to drive the uptake of electric vehicles. Earlier this year, the NSW government announced it would abolish stamp duty on electric vehicles and offer drivers other incentives to increase their uptake to ensure more than half of all new car sales by 2031 were electric. Mr Kean's action stands in contrast with that of the federal government, which has not made clear whether it will sign the pledge. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday the federal government would HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p596zh boost investment in charging infrastructure , particularly in regional Australia, to help manage the transition towards a 1.7 million electrified national fleet. Mr Kean said he was looking forward to working with his federal counterparts, but they could be doing more to support the electric vehicle industry. "They can put a lot more money up to ensure that everyone can benefit from owning an [electric vehicle]. They can also do things like providing subsidies or waiving taxes for people who buy an [electric vehicle], and the final thing they can do is look at tail pipe emissions standards," he said on Sky News. "We want to ensure people are getting access to cheaper vehicles that are cheaper to run as well, and our policies are designed to do that." The motor industry has hit back at the federal government's new electric vehicle strategy, saying there were large gaps in the policy that need to be addressed. Domestic sales of electric cars have risen at record levels in the past six months amid state government incentives, but come off a very low base. New car sales data released in August showed 8688 battery and plug-in electric vehicle were sold in the first half of 2021. Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Behyad Jafari said NSW had recognised that once a car was sold it stayed on the road for 15 to 20 years, and therefore reaching net zero by 2050 required action today. The Victorian government has a $100 million electric vehicle road map. Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future. Sign up to our COP26 newsletter here . \</doc>

COP26 president Alok Sharma has described the pivotal United Nations talks, which HYPERLINK concluded over the weekend, as only a "fragile win" for ambition on climate change. But, against the odds, the summit produced the goods on several important aspects of international climate policy. It resolved tricky outstanding issues for implementing the Paris Agreement. And most importantly, it reinforced the multilateral consensus that much stronger climate action is needed in both the short and long term. Here's a preliminary interpretation of some of the decisions at COP26 on climate change mitigation, and the implications for Australia. Coal power "phase down" Global climate negotiations are usually a relentless grind, with occasional fireworks. One such firework moment came in the final session when HYPERLINK https://youtu.be/v9paeHNZkLk?t=15702 India , supported by China, demanded the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cop26_auv_2f_cover_decision.pdf Glasgow Climate Pact's To prevent the disagreement scuttling the entire deal, the revision was agreed to, despite bitter protests by many countries intent on stronger action. The wording of United Nations agreements is cumbersome, but deliberate. Here's the full reference to coal in the final COP26 text. It calls on the parties to the Paris Agreement to: accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition. (By way of definition, "unabated" coal power refers to the absence of carbon capture and storage in power stations. This technology is very expensive for power generation and unlikely to be used at large scale.) Read more: Are you kidding, India? Your last-minute Glasgow intervention won't relieve pressure to ditch coal On the face of it, the change in wording makes a big difference. But the signal to investors in coal mining and coal power plants is the same: the international community has decided coal-fired power must fall, and its end is coming. No previous United Nations climate change decision has so directly called for action to cut fossil fuels. So even the weakened language is unprecedented. What's more, nations can act independently of - and more ambitiously than - the wording in the COP agreement. For example, China recently HYPERLINK https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202111/1238071.shtml pledged to rely much less on coal power and HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58647481 stop building coal-fired power stations abroad. And the surprise US-China joint HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/ declaration on climate change announced at Glasgow enshrines the "elimination of support for unabated international thermal coal power generation". The international market for thermal coal - the type burned for electricity - will shrink and could do so quickly. Australia is the world's number two HYPERLINK thermal coal exporter Ratcheting up 2030 targets Another key aspect of the Glasgow pact is the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3_0.pdf call for stronger 2030 emissions targets and short-term action. By the end of next year, nations are asked to strengthen their 2030 targets to align with the 1.5? temperature goal. This puts big pressure on Australia. The federal government still retains the very weak target of a 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, based on 2005 levels, and recently said the target will be HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australia%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20Update%20October%202021%20WEB.pdf exceeded by up to 9% HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/australian-ministers-say-2030-emission-target-fixed-will-be-beaten-2021-11-14/ insistence on Sunday that the target is "fixed" will not cut it over the next year. Almost all other developed countries have strengthened their targets already, some greatly so. An important reference point is the United States, which has adopted a 50-52% reduction target in the same time frame. This puts the onus on the federal government. Its recent "plan" to reach net-zero by 2050 falls far HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/scott-morrison-attends-pivotal-global-climate-talks-today-bringing-a-weak-plan-that-leaves-australia-exposed-170842 short of the mark of what constitutes a real national strategy. Read more: Government assumes 90% of Australia's new car sales will be electric by 2050. But it's a destination without a route International carbon trading COP26 managed to resolve an issue that had proven extremely difficult since the Paris talks - rules for future international carbon markets. The compromise reached appears to largely close loopholes for HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/double-counting-of-emissions-cuts-may-undermine-paris-climate-deal-125019 double-counting of emissions reduction. What kind and extent of international emissions markets will emerge under the Paris Agreement framework remains to be seen. However, the rules to underpin them are now available. From an Australian perspective, an outcome on international emissions markets is very positive. Australian governments and negotiators have worked to help make it happen. It opens the door to Australian companies or governments purchasing emissions reductions achieved in other countries, if this turned out cheaper than acting more strongly to cut emissions at home. It will also help Australia work with countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia to reduce emissions there, and to share the resulting emissions reductions between countries. Australia's large land mass and unlimited potential for cheap renewable energy means it's better positioned than most countries to become a net-negative emissions economy in the long term. In other words, Australia could one day remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than it emits. So an international carbon trading framework means Australia could eventually sell emissions reduction credits to other countries, and the revenue could fund large-scale CO? removal from the atmosphere. Earth's climate will not be determined by what is agreed at global climate talks, but by the actions that businesses and people take, and the policies governments put in place. The Glasgow outcome, however, shows there is global resolve to get on top of the problem. Governments that might prefer the old ways of a carbon-intensive economy cannot ignore that momentum.

Under this scheme, energy producers are obliged to inform consumers whether their hydrogen is green (produced by solar or wind power), blue (produced by burning natural gas) or brown (produced by burning coal). A further $300m is earmarked to turn Darwin into an export hub for the production of low-emitting LNG (liquid natural gas) and clean hydrogen - but that funding is linked to controversial carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which critics say have produced disappointing results to date. The government will also spend $50m over the next two years to accelerate gas infrastructure projects, another $200m is set aside for the development of hydrogen-powered manufacturing in the Pilbara, and an equal amount will be spent to increase Australia's iron ore processing capacity to support the manufacture of green steel in Japan and Korea. Neither Energy Minister Angus Mr Taylor nor Treasurer Josh Frydenberg referenced the ambitious 30-35 per cent emissions cut forecast which Prime Minister Scott Morrison presented at the COP26 conference in Glasgow last November. \</doc>

PRESSURE on Australia to increase its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions targets is set to intensify after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned global temperature increases of 2C or even 3C were looking more likely. Australia plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 26-28 per cent by 2030 but the latest IPCC report said global emissions would need to peak by 2025 and come down by 43 per cent by 2030 to hold out any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5C. "Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5C is beyond reach," the report states. ANU's Professor Frank Jotzo, a lead author on the report, said the world "is heading towards a three-degree outcome," but "there was no magical threshold below which we're fine, and above which we're doomed". Studies have shown the planet has already warmed by about 1.1C on pre-industrial levels. The Climate Council has warned the Great Barrier Reef would be virtually wiped out from an extra 2C of warming, while extreme weather events would become much more frequent. Prof Jotzo, pictured, said it was imperative for countries to cut their greenhouse gases further. Australia declined to update its 2030 emissions targets at the COP26 conference in Glasgow last year but is expected to be pressured to do so at COP27 in Egypt in November. A new global stocktake of emissions measures undertaken by the IPCC would also add pressure on Australia to act, Prof Jotzo said. \</doc>

Pod-like homes 3D-printed from raw clay. A school building crafted from bamboo. A Brazilian favela converted into an "urban ecovillage" that generates 100 per cent of its own energy and converts organic cooking waste into cooking gas. These are some of the 17 sustainable projects presented in the Build Better Now "virtual pavilion" run by the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) as part of COP26 , which began in Glasgow last weekend. Only one Australian building made the cut: the Woodside Building for Technology and Design at Monash University's Clayton campus, in Melbourne. From outside, the five-storey, 19,000 square metre structure - the only building in the southern hemisphere to achieve Passive House status - looks like a series of perfectly arrayed, elegant modernist boxes. Rust-hued sun blades and variegated window casements add visual interest as the daylight moves across. Nothing much screams "green" - but look closer. Hermetically sealed (a defining condition of Passive House certification), the interior is arrayed around a monumental, full-height void created by 24-metre-wide trusses, with two-storey top-lit atriums to provide natural light throughout the day. Acoustically isolated learning spaces occupy the first three floors; academic and research activities are carried out on the top two. The vast, open learning spaces in the centre of the building capture the heat of humans and disperse it throughout the building when required; informal, small-group learning areas are spread around the periphery, requiring less intensity from the building's systems and benefiting from solar penetration via a precise 50 per cent window-to-wall ratio. (Except the north facade, which is completely solid and highly insulated.) Those sculptural sun blades are actually operable louvres that radically reduce the energy demands of cooling and dehumidifying. "The combination of active and passive environmental strategies defines the building's expression and operations while assisting Monash University intelligently, and lead its 2030 Net-Zero Initiative with unique, purpose-defined architecture," says Andrew Cortese, managing partner of Grimshaw, the Sydney-based practice behind the building's design. "Yes, it's a classic, modernist building," concedes engineer Jeff Robinson of Aurecon, the company that delivered Woodside, which houses the faculties of technology and design. "But the building envelope and its performance has been parametrically modelled to meet the Passive House standard. By controlling solar gain, we get very comfortable, high-performance spaces with much smaller mechanical plant." Woodside has won a slew of Australian Institute of Architects 2021 awards, including the Victorian Architecture Medal, Melbourne Prize and Educational Architecture Award. On Thursday night it took out the institute's top national honour, the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, and its highest award for sustainability. Its inclusion in the Build Better Now virtual pavilion puts it alongside a net-zero housing estate in Nottingham, England, a Dutch bridge made from laminated timber, and a Swedish cultural centre made from conifers sourced from local sustainable forests and 100 per cent powered by hydro-electricity. What's interesting is that many of these structures don't read as "green" - they're too intent on reducing carbon emissions to worry about virtue signalling. (Those that do flaunt natural materials like mud and bamboo do so as part of their structural and sustainable integrity.) The building industry is estimated to be responsible for 40 per cent of global CO emissions. And yet, we keep building. While calls to slow down construction in favour of repurposing existing structures get louder (and this year's Pritzker Prize is going for the first time to one such practice, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/life-and-luxury/design/architecture-s-top-prize-recognises-surprising-claim-to-fame-20210416-p57jw0 Lacaton & Vassal of France While world leaders try to align on global environmental policy at COP26 , businesses threatened with early extinction are taking the lead. The HYPERLINK https://www.ukgbc.org/ UK Green Building Council The built environment "has a crucial part to play" in tackling climate change, says the council's chief executive, Julie Hirigoyen. "Everyone on the planet has a stake in our buildings and cities," she says. "I invite everyone to take inspiration from Build Better Now as a global showcase of pioneering solutions to climate change, and hope that it supports the industry to create more sustainable buildings, places and cities of the future." The Global Cement and Concrete Association - which represents nearly 80 per cent of the industry outside China - is also mobilising to eliminate carbon emissions. Which is not a bad thing, since the concrete industry is estimated to be responsible for 7 to 8 per cent of the world's CO emissions. The association's road map, aligned with the Paris Agreement, aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees - a goal thought by many to now be off the map. While our Prime Minister may be mocked as "Coal-o-Phile Dundee" for his COP26 performance, Andrew Cortese of Grimshaw Sydney says "there has been strong growth in the number of large-scale sustainable buildings constructed in Australia, with over 3050 Certified Green Star buildings. "The next step is to design and build new and refurbished net zero carbon buildings to reduce the impacts of climate change. "It is essential that building envelope performance is greatly improved, with interiors that enable a wider range of comfort by embracing our temperate climate, and that we make spaces with a more specific character and greater adaptability." \</doc>

Glasgow: The Glasgow climate summit has closed with members failing to agree on a call to "phase-out" coal use, after a last-minute intervention by India which succeeded in watering down the language to "phase down". The change prompted disappointment and even anger among many nations, who believed an emphatic call to end reliance on fossil fuels was necessary to put the world on a path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, and that India's change was adopted without due process. COP26 president Alok Sharma described the talks as a "fragile win", adding the "pulse is weak" in the effort to keep 1.5 alive. Commitments made at the conference failed to clear a path to reducing emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 which was needed to stabilise the climate at 1.5 degrees. But after negotiations between nearly 200 countries that were to have ended on Friday ground on into Saturday night (Sunday morning AEDT), members agreed to change the wording to protect the broader "phase down" agreement, which has been cautiously welcomed by observers for increasing momentum in emission reductions and for the first time specifically addressing fossil fuels. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the final texts were compromised and reflected "the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world . . . "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the climate deal struck was a big step forward, and he hoped it would mark the beginning of the end of climate change. "There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years," Mr Johnson said. "But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. "I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal." India was insistent right to the very end on the need to retain fossil fuels. "This climate crisis has been caused by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption," said Indian Environment and Climate Minister Bhupender Yadav. "The world needs to awaken to this reality. Fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth and wellbeing." Yadav said "targeting any particular industry is uncalled for" and stressed developing countries were entitled to use fossil fuels given developed nations had used them for decades and were responsible for historic emissions. The agreement, already being called the Glasgow Climate Pact, calls upon nations to phase out "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" and recognises the need for "a just transition" from fossil fuels. Mr Sharma said he was "deeply sorry" about the last-minute changes on the wording about coal. His voice breaking with emotion after hearing from vulnerable nations which expressed their anger over the changes to the text, he said: "May I just say to all delegates I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry." The pact speeds up the so-called "ratchet mechanism" of the Paris Agreement by calling on countries like Australia that have not increased their 2030 targets to do so as soon as possible before the next COP summit in Egypt next year. It calls on all nations to revisit and improve the emission reductions targets and strategies annually and report their progress via ministerial meetings. Asked by the Herald what the consequences should be if a country like Australia ultimately ignored the request to come back in 2022 with higher 2030 emission reductions targets, Mr Sharma said: "All countries have signed up to this and at the end of the day this is an international agreement and each country will be judged by whether or not they stuck to the commitments they've made." Climate activist Greta Thunberg, whose urgent calls for action were often quoted by negotiators inside the "blue zone", expressed her disappointment and determination in a tweet after the result. "The COP26 And she reposted a message sent last week midway through the summit: "Unless we achieve immediate, drastic, unprecedented, annual emission cuts at the source then that means we're failing when it comes to this climate crisis. 'Small steps in the right direction', 'making some progress' or 'winning slowly' equals losing." The final pact text "expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 degrees of warming to date . . . and that carbon budgets consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal are now small and being rapidly depleted". It also emphasises the need for rapid reductions this decade if 2050 targets are to work, and completes key elements of the so-called Paris rule book, governing how a global carbon market can operate. Even before the Indian intervention delegations had expressed serious misgivings about the final document, most said they believed it was a realistic compromise that drove forward efforts to curb climate change. "Obviously, we know the old adage that in negotiations you can't let perfect be the enemy of the good," said United States climate envoy John Kerry. "And this is good. It's a powerful statement." Developing nations failed in their effort to have the pact include a mechanism for wealthy countries to pay for the damage already occurring in climate vulnerable states. The move to pay for damages was opposed by powerful countries that are progressive on other climate related matters, such as the United Kingdom and the US. "The needs of the world's vulnerable people have been sacrificed on the altar of the rich world's selfishness," said Mohamed Adow, director of energy and climate think tank Power Shift Africa. "The outcome here reflects a COP held in the rich world and the outcome contains the priorities of the rich world. They claim to want urgency on emissions reductions, yet they continue to expand fossil fuel production within their own borders." Simon Bradshaw, head of research for the Climate Council, said the direct references to fossil fuels and the mechanism to increase the tempo of emissions reductions were significant. "The new commitments that countries brought to Glasgow are not enough to get on the path to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but the real measure of success will be whether it has succeeded in kickstarting a decade of truly transformative action . . . on that front there are reasons for hope." He said Australia had eventually backed the pact, despite earlier opposing some of the language, but it had isolated itself at the talks. "The federal government showed up empty-handed to a pivotal moment in the fight for our future. They've let down our Pacific neighbours, as well as Australians who do not deserve to endure more frequent and severe bushfires, floods, droughts and heatwaves," Dr Bradshaw said. \</doc>

\~\~ --With renewed COP26 commitments, Airbus, CottonConnect, Earthworm Foundation, Tropical Forest Alliance and World Resources Institute called for collaborative action across supply chains during RSPO's 2021 roundtable conference to achieve positive impact for people and planet. \~\~ On 16 November, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) hosted the 2021 Virtual Roundtable Conference on the theme of "Climate Resilience: Assuring the Future of Sustainable Palm Oil". The panel brought together leading voices across the agricultural commodities sector to exchange views on some of the thorniest issues in the industry - from climate change to accessible technological innovation to economic inclusion. \~\~ Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1695674/RT2021.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1695674/RT2021.jpg \~\~ Logo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1160778/RSPO_Logo.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1160778/RSPO_Logo.jpg \~\~ Panellists opened with their views on COP26 , highlighting that forests and land use have never been more prominent during the summit where over 100 world leaders pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Directly impacting commodities like palm oil - often seen as a driver of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions - COP26 underscored the vital need for solutions like RSPO and other voluntary initiatives. \~\~ Protecting human rights and labour rights The first deep dive addressed the complex issue of human rights and labour rights, where panellists emphasised that human rights and labour rights' violations cannot be separated from environmental issues, and they remain some of the toughest challenges facing agri-commodity industries. \~\~ Panellists highlighted the importance of standards, such as RSPO's, "as guidance for a rights-based approach across supply chains," Janhavi Naidu from the Earthworm Foundation said. "We focus on translating the agenda, visions and expectations set by RSPO and similar standards into resources and actionable solutions. This is because actors require guidance, time and investment to be able to scale just labour practices." \~\~ Echoing this sentiment, Alison Ward from CottonConnect added, "Ensuring just treatment of workers requires strong investment in each step of the supply chain, local intervention and engagement. In the textile sector, this means brands and companies meeting farmers, ginners and spinners to understand their concerns and investing adequate resources to address them." She shared examples of building trust in cotton growing communities in India and Pakistan to ensure that their health and safety needs are met, inspired by similar work in the palm oil sector. \~\~ Appropriate uses of technology Panellists also explored the importance of leveraging innovation and technologies to address climate challenges. Technology can help provide greater transparency and traceability in the palm oil supply chain and enable businesses to uphold their sustainability commitments. RSPO has been at the forefront of developing solutions to strengthen the credibility of its certification scheme. \~\~ Rod Taylor from the World Resources Institute (WRI) cited one example, GeoRSPO, which integrates RSPO concession maps with the Global Forest Watch platform. He explained "Global Forest Watch feeds directly into GeoRSPO by combining satellite imagery and cloud computing to show land use change in a user-friendly manner... it helps companies manage deforestation risk in their supply chain and integrate risk management and reporting into a single system". \~\~ Wendy Carrara from Airbus elaborated, "We have invested 20 years of research and development on a verification tool that promotes traceability to plantations, raises alerts on deforestation and correlates it with supply chain data. Altogether, this ensures the responsible sourcing of palm oil. Satellite images are analysed using biophysical parameters to create a base map against which monitoring can be done at scale and with local precision". \~\~ Supporting rural livelihoods The final deep dive discussion covered how achieving climate resilience through certification like RSPO not only delivers benefits for the planet, but for people too. Achieving climate resilience in the sustainable palm oil sector is not merely an ecological imperative - it can also generate social empowerment by strengthening workforce capacity, creating jobs and fostering economic development. \~\~ Justin Adams from the Tropical Forest Alliance advocated for integrating livelihoods into climate action: "There is a clear recognition of the importance of the social dimension in achieving environmental goals; climate goals are central but just one dimension to optimise. We need ecopreneurs in the landscape to drive real change". Rod continued by highlighting that the big picture solution is to optimise existing resources like land through sustainable practices, stabilise existing resources, and make farming more lucrative, topped with incentives to reward good stewardship. \~\~ Despite the challenges ahead, the past few years have seen closer integration of environmental and social goals - key to securing a sustainable and resilient future across the palm oil sector. Panellists closed on an optimistic note by saying that organisations like RSPO are critical because they bring communities together to solve problems. "It goes beyond simply increasing the volume of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil and towards creating a sustainable palm oil ecosystem; all of us have a role to play in achieving this", said Justin. \~\~ About RSPO: The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was formed in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. RSPO is a not-for-profit, international, membership organisation that unites stakeholders from the different sectors of the palm oil industry including oil palm producers, palm oil processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental or nature conservation NGOs, and social or developmental NGOs. \~\~ This multi-stakeholder representation is mirrored in the governance structure of RSPO such that seats in the Board of Governors, Steering Committees and Working Groups are fairly allocated to each sector. In this way, RSPO lives out the philosophy of the "roundtable" by giving equal rights to each stakeholder group, facilitating traditionally adversarial stakeholders in working together to reach decisions by consensus, and achieving RSPO's shared vision of making sustainable palm oil the norm. \~\~ The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur with satellite offices in Jakarta (ID), London (UK), Zoetermeer (NL), Beijing (CN) and Bogota (CO).

"This is the only way to make net zero emissions achievable for all countries." The minister added that Australia would be sharing a revised document to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat for HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australia%20NDC%20recommunication%20FINAL.PDF nationally determined contribution (NDC) , reaffirming Australia's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. "This week the government released our plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050," Taylor said, noting that Australia's updated NDC included seven low emissions technology stretch goals. "We are backing this target with practical, responsible action and a clear plan to convert ambition into achievement."

The way Boris Johnson told it, Scott Morrison's decision to formally adopt a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 was nothing short of heroic. The UK prime minister, a man known for a turn of phrase that veers Churchillian, was addressing an audience of school children at Downing Street in the hours after news came through that whatever the Nationals made of it, the Australian PM would travel to Glasgow for the United Nations climate talks with a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Johnson was thrilled, even if the broad international ecosystem of climate scientists and activists was less impressed. "I do think that world leaders are really starting to listen and see how urgent this is and what an emergency this is," Johnson told the children. "[The Coalition's new net zero by 2050 policy] was actually very difficult for Australia to do ... because Australia is very heavily dependent on coal and on lots of carbon-producing industries. " HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/boris-johnson-hails-scott-morrison-s-heroic-net-zero-policy-20211026-p5932e.html They've done a heroic thing "I hope they will be joined by lots more countries in that region for the COP summit." In climate circles though, Morrison's commitment was widely viewed as the very least he could do, done at the last possible minute. "Seen from the UK, Australia is claiming a leadership position on climate change - unfortunately the league table it's leading is that of climate bullshitters," said one well-positioned observer, honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at the Imperial College London, Richard Black. So why was Johnson so effusive? Johnson has a lot invested in the success of COP26 It will be evidence that despite Brexit, the United Kingdom remains a key global player rather than a diminished one. Should the talks fail, Johnson as host will bear a large portion of the blame. With that in mind it made perfect sense that Johnson was so effusive in praise of Morrison, whatever the merits of Australia's climate contribution. At their best, international talks like this are settled well before negotiators and heads of state lob in to grip-and-grin for cameras. The Paris Agreement might have been drafted at a COP conference in December 2015, but its success was all but guaranteed a year earlier in secret talks between the United States and China. Former US president Barack Obama, shaken by the failure of the Copenhagen talks at the start of his term, was determined that Paris would be a success and directed his climate envoy Todd Stern to begin discreet talks with China. For nine months, negotiations dragged on before Obama and Xi shocked the world with a joint announcement. The US would set new emissions reductions targets and China would agree to cap their emissions by 2030. With the world's two superpowers, and two greatest greenhouse gas polluters, determined to act, Paris was locked in. But the world has changed and the object of Glasgow is different. At Paris, the world promised it would begin reducing emissions in an effort to keep warming well below 2 degrees and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. At Glasgow, nations must demonstrate that they are on track to doing so, and that they can keep to the voluntary reductions targets they have already set and increase them as needed. Today the cautious trust that Xi and Obama once shared has evaporated in the geopolitical rivalry between the two nations. Xi will not attend the talks and nor will his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. COVID-19 has not only distracted leaders from climate but contributed to an energy crisis that has led to a surge in coal and gas production. Though under President Joe Biden, the US has not only rejoined the Paris Agreement, but become a global leader on the climate effort, Biden is being undermined in his efforts to reduce domestic emissions by the stubborn resistance of two Democrats whose votes are necessary to pass massive spending bills. On Friday morning Australian time, China announced its updated climate targets under the Paris Agreement, to the general disappointment of observers. It contained little more than a previously declared effort to see emissions peak by 2030 and hit net zero by 2060. Thom Woodroofe, a former climate diplomat and a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, described China's announcement as a "missed opportunity" to seize global climate leadership as the COP talks began. He added that if China was serious about hitting its 2060 net zero goal it cannot wait until the second half of this decade to start phasing out domestic coal use. Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics with the World Resources Institute, a US think tank, was also faint in her praise, describing China's plan as a "modest improvement" over previously announced targets. Before these talks begin, there has been no grand bargain. In this environment as Johnson heads to Rome for G20 talks convened by Italy - the co-host nation of COP26 - what he needed most was momentum, or something that looks like it. And this is where the soaring praise for Australia's 2050 net zero commitment comes in. But as the Grantham Institute's Richard Black put it so bluntly, not everyone sees Australia's goals in such a positive light. Morrison's decision to bring to COP a projection that Australia will beat its previous commitment of reducing emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030 wins little praise in a world where organisers are calling for 50 per cent cuts by that date. And besides, if Australia is so sure of beating its target why not make a formal commitment? But scepticism towards Australian commitment on climate exists well beyond headline figures. Australia has rejected joining a global compact to reduce methane emissions that is being championed at COP26 by the European Union and the US. Indeed it is championing a gas-led recovery. It backs the coal industry in the face of the growing global alliance to see coal rapidly phased-out. Similarly the HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-to-lodge-bigger-2030-target-in-un-talks-in-glasgow-20211027-p593qe.html road map outlined by Australia this week emphasises the role of as-yet unproven technology to reduce emissions in future instead of policies that would drive them down at once. This suggests to observers like Black that Australia's heart is simply not in it. "It's very obvious that the Australian government doesn't really want to be announcing a net zero target but that it's been forced into doing so by a combination of US pressure, the threat of an EU carbon border tax and the utter horror with which it's being regarded by its Pacific neighbours," Black says. "The plan just put forward isn't realistic from either a climate change or economic point of view. It doesn't even try to halve emissions this decade, which the science indicates is necessary." Closer to home, Australia's small island neighbours have been polite but clear in their lobbying. "I welcome Australia's net-zero pledge by 2050 and look forward to seeing my friend @ScottMorrisonMP at @ COP26 ," tweeted Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. "There, Fiji will seek plans from high-emitting nations to halve emissions by 2030 - the only goal that can keep 1.5 alive and keep low-lying island nations above water." Australia is far from the only country whose rhetoric is not always congruent with policy. A little over a week ago Saudi Arabia announced a net zero target despite the fact that not long earlier his energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, had reportedly said at a private event hosted by the Bank of America that his nation would not stop selling oil until none was left to sell. "We are still going to be the last man standing, and every molecule of hydrocarbon will come out," he said. Despite the rapidly heating climate and the threat of catastrophic climate change within most of our lifetimes, it is not yet clear that the Paris Agreement can survive the mounting pressures confronting it, or that COP26 can succeed in harnessing its promise. One person who fears the worst is UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who tweeted this week: "The time has passed for diplomatic niceties. If all governments  especially G20 governments  do not stand up and lead efforts against the climate crisis, we are headed for terrible human suffering." As an agreement rather than a treaty, there is no penalty for those nations that do not set and reset increasingly ambitious emission reduction targets. It is becoming clear that should COP26 succeed and the Paris accord prove resilient, it will need nations like Australia to embrace in spirit as well as in word.

Tuvalu's foreign minister has given a speech to the UN\~ COP26 climate summit while\~standing knee-deep in seawater\~to show how his low-lying Pacific island nation is on the frontline of climate change. Images of Simon Kofe standing in a suit and tie at a lectern set up in the sea\~have been shared widely on social media, drawing attention to Tuvalu's struggle against rising sea levels. "The statement juxtaposes the COP26 setting with the real-life situations faced in Tuvalu due to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise," Mr Kofe said of his conference video message. The video was shot by public broadcaster TVBC at the far end of Fongafale, the main islet of the capital Funafuti, a government official said. It was due to be shown at the climate summit in Scotland on Tuesday local time,\~amid a push by regional leaders who want\~more aggressive action\~to limit the impact of climate change. Many big polluters have vowed to intensify their carbon cuts over coming decades, with some aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But HYPERLINK Pacific Island leaders have demanded immediate action , pointing out that the very survival of their low-lying countries is at stake. Tuvalu is already seeing the effects of climate change\~ Tuvalu is made up of nine atolls and has a population of around 11,000 people. Its\~highest point is just 4.5 metres above sea level, making it particularly vulnerable to climate change.\~\~ Since 1993, sea levels have risen about 0.5 centimetres per year, according to a 2011 Australian government report. Mr Kofe said he delivered the video address in a place that used to be dry land, adding that Tuvalu was seeing a lot of coastal erosion. When asked what Tuvalu's people thought about the rising sea levels, Mr Kofe said some of the older generation said they would go down with the land, while others were leaving. "The one thing is clear  that the people have a very close tie to their land," Mr Kofe said. Relocation being considered under 'worst-case scenario'\~ Mr Kofe said Tuvalu was looking at legal ways to keep ownership of its maritime zones and recognition as a state, even if it becomes completely submerged due to climate change. "We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged," he\~said.\~ "We're looking at legal avenues where we can retain our ownership of our maritime zones, retain our recognition as a state under international law. So those are steps that we are taking, looking into the future." Tagaloa Cooper-Halo,\~the director of climate change at the Pacific's peak environmental body the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, is at COP26 in Glasgow, She told the ABC's Pacific Beat program that\~the camaraderie and support in Mr Kofe's speech had been well received by Pacific delegates who were with her\~in Scotland. "People are doing their best to raise the alarm," she said. "So the Pacific message is permeating the halls of of the negotiations,\~but more importantly, the public and social arena." \</doc>

It was marketed as the world's "best last chance" to solve the global climate change crisis but the COP26 Glasgow summit has been criticised for failing to reach the ambitious heights many had hoped for. The summit concluded without strong, binding targets for the world's largest fossil fuel producers to commit to, as Australia's contribution was described as a "great disappointment to the rest of the world" by a top climate advisor in the United Kingdom. Watching on from his leafy residence in Yarralumla, the European Union ambassador to Australia Dr Michael Pulch had a more optimistic outlook on the summit's outcomes. Despite some setbacks, the experienced envoy was grateful the summit's negotiations were able to lift the quality of targets, setting a stronger starting position for next year's summit in Egypt. "We achieved probably more than we expected going into it, but less than we hoped for," Dr Pulch told The Canberra Times days after the lights were switched off at the once-abuzz conference centre in Glasgow. "But then there is a certain moment where you also have to step back a bit and lower the expectations so that the bar isn't too high. "We have to continue pushing for additional ambition." Countries, including Australia, signed on to a pledge phasing down coal, which UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described as a "death knell" for coal. But a separate pledge, championed by US President Joe Biden, to slash methane emissions by 30 per cent this decade was not agreed to by Australia. Dr Pulch said it was a disappointing result but still showed progress in the right direction. "[Coal's phasing down] was not what we would have supported but it is a step in that direction and it is a signal," he said. "If you look at this country, all the big business groups have stepped up and said 'we would like, as a country, to do more'." However, the major trading bloc is unlikely to sign any free trade agreements with Australia without first seeing a strong 2030 target. Dr Pulch said the EU doesn't budge on excluding climate change targets, adding that trade agreements need to pass through its parliament, which is heavily influenced by environmental parties. "Our approach has always been substance before speech so there are a few areas where we need to make more progress still," he said. "The fact that Australia signed up to [a] 2050 [net zero target] I think was a very important step in that regard, and crucial." With planning already underway for the next COP summit in Egypt next year, Dr Pulch is hopeful the world is in a good position to continue setting the bar higher. "[Glasgow] achieved a few very important things and on others, it set the tone for the next COP 27 to pick up and continue," he said. \</doc>

PITCH TO BE GLOBAL CLEAN TECH LEADER AUSTRALIA has taken its low emissions technology plan to the world, positioning itself to be a global leader in cheap solar power that could also fuel a clean hydrogen boom. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor unveiled his new low-emissions technology statement at the Glasgow climate summit on Tuesday night, detailing the advancements Australia is betting on to deliver half of the emission cuts needed to hit net zero by 2050. "A step-up in global collaboration on practical solutions is the most meaningful and lasting impact this COP could have," Mr Taylor said. On the summit's opening day, Scott Morrison also pushed Australia's technology approach, saying decarbonisation needed to be achievable "not just in the developed economies of the North Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo-Pacific as well". The Prime Minister upped Australia's $1.5bn climate finance commitment to $2bn, with the cash particularly targeted at the Pacific, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged leaders to deliver a $100bn global fund. A senior Biden administration official said the methane plan was "the single-best strategy to defeat the climate crisis that we have in the near term", as new research from energy think tank Ember showed Australia's coal mines were leaking methane emissions equivalent to a quarter of its annual carbon emissions. Livestock feed supplements are considered an emerging technology in Australia's road map, along with low-emissions cement, hydrogen-enabled home appliances and small modular nuclear reactors. But the plan prioritises developing clean hydrogen, energy storage, green steel and aluminium, carbon capture, soil carbon and ultra low-cost solar. Mr Taylor said slashing solar costs to a third of today's prices would unlock the potential of green hydrogen and give Australia a major advantage in "low-cost, bulk electricity supply". The statement also revealed the world's first shipment of liquefied hydrogen from Victoria to Japan was due to hit the seas within six months. In Mr Morrison's statement to COP26 in the opening day, he confirmed even though Australia was maintaining its target of a 26-28 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, the country was on track to deliver a 35 per cent cut. He pushed his "technology not taxes" approach, declaring raising the cost of energy would otherwise harm "those who can least afford it". "Cleaner technology solutions must out-compete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies," Mr Morrison said. "This needs to work not just in the developed economies of the North Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo Pacific as well." He said the world's remarkable success in developing coronavirus vaccines was "cause for optimism", and that the challenge of climate changes "will be met in the same way". "It will be met by those who frankly are largely not in this room. It will be our scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, industrialists and financiers that actually will chart this path to net zero," Mr Morrison said. "It is up to us as leaders of -governments to back them in." With a key goal of the summit to deliver a $100bn climate finance fund for developing countries, Mr Morrison announced Australia would lift its $1.5bn commitment over the next five years to $2bn. He unveiled the promise after a meeting with Pacific Island leaders from Fiji, Tuvalu and Palau, saying Australia wanted to cut out red tape and help countries most exposed to global warming "in our backyard". "It will also drive private sector-led climate solutions that support clean technology, jobs and growth across our region." "Australia stands with our Pacific family in our joint commitment to scale up mitigation and ensure adaptation support." Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama commended Mr Morrison's 2050 net-zero commitment but urged him to develop a "concrete plan to halve emissions by 2030". Mr Morrison also welcomed Fiji as Australia's first partner in its new Indo-Pacific carbon offsets scheme. In his opening speech, Mr Johnson referenced climate activist Greta Thunberg's criticism of leaders offering "blah, blah, blah" instead of real action, saying COP26 had to be "the moment we get real about climate change". "We have the technology, and we can find the finance \'e2\€ \£6 the question for us today is whether we have the will," he said. Mr Johnson said future generations of children would "not forgive us" if COP26 was the "historic turning point where history failed to turn". He urged more than 100 world leaders gathered in Glasgow to build "a lifeboat for humanity" and to give it "a mighty shove into the water".

HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/down-to-earth-just-stop-oil-protest Just Stop Oil activists At the same time, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has announced a new wave of protests beginning on April 9 2022. XR's previous "rebellions" and separate efforts by HYPERLINK Insulate Britain saw determined campaigners block motorway traffic and interrupt city life. These are the kind of actions which the UK government aims to restrict and counter with its Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will redefine HYPERLINK what counts as legitimate protest The police and local councils are tasked with facilitating peaceful protest at the same time as activists see the scope for it being closed down. The urgency of the climate crisis and these new limits on protest will probably HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-uks-policing-bill-will-make-climate-activism-almost-illegal-just-when-its-most-needed-173231 raise conflict between state authorities and environmentalists in the years to come. In this fraught situation, mediation between all involved in protests could help people achieve their aims peacefully. How mediation can help At COP 26 - the most recent UN climate change summit, hosted by the UK in November 2021 - I was among 50 people who volunteered to attend protests in Glasgow and help defuse disagreements and tension between protesters, the police and others through dialogue. The HYPERLINK http://centreforgoodrelations.com/keeping-our-cool/ Keeping Our Cool initiative assumed that contention can be handled well, and that mediation might sometimes feel useful to everybody involved in a protest. Mediation between different parties can help people on all sides reach an outcome they're relatively happy with. In our branded uniforms, we were a visible point of contact for hundreds of people attending protests in the city's streets and squares. Our team members were involved in situations which could have deteriorated without mediation. In one instance, we relayed messages between XR activists and police officers which helped to de-escalate an unexpected stand-off near a motorway junction. We listened to the frustrations some people had about who was being heard (and who was not) at the climate talks. We helped campaigners who had walked all the way from Germany proceed with their protest even though they had not given prior notice to the council and the police. Deeply frustrated with the initial bureaucratic response, they left COP26 feeling that they had been able to represent children and families back home. We also found ourselves in some of the sharper incidents across COP26 , like when the police decided to contain or "kettle" some activists. Mediation is not always appropriate for handling these situations. Some activists, clear-eyed about the possible consequences, including arrest, will decide to escalate the situation anyway. There are signs that increasing numbers of people are ready to escalate matters, by doing things like HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/tyre-extinguishers-activists-are-deflating-suv-tyres-in-the-latest-pop-up-climate-movement-178911 temporarily disabling SUVs HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/protesters-block-oil-depot-near-heathrow-as-action-enters-fourth-day blocking fuel depots HYPERLINK https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4946-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-a-letter-from-the-editor advocated destroying the machinery involved in extracting, processing, distributing and consuming fossil fuels, like oil pipelines. Other campaigners believe disruptive action and property destruction could prevent an effective movement for change emerging by alienating potential supporters. They will be among those trying to avoid breaking the law or provoking a police reaction, but could still find themselves subject to heavy policing. Altercations and arrests could result from misunderstandings and misjudgements between the parties. This is exactly the kind of problem mediators can help with. Conflict between protesters and the police can occur when no one expects or wants it, and in ways which activists - and the police - see as a distraction from the course which they wanted to pursue. By offering protesters and police officers a space to consider other options, volunteer mediators can be helpful to everybody. My own experience of and research into civic mediation began with work on racialised social divisions in north-west England, written up in my book HYPERLINK On Burnley Road . My academic collaborators in Keeping Our Cool had traced the origins of civil mediation from the Northern Ireland peace process through their HYPERLINK https://journal.equinoxpub.com/MTP/article/view/450 research . As a result, Keeping Our Cool was not based on a naive view that there can be easy consensus or deep agreement between the people we talked to. Instead the experiment helped us to develop our understanding of how mediation can be applied. We found that clarity about our role was key. We needed to explain our impartial character to the police, so that they would not be tempted to treat us as quasi-colleagues who could help influence protesters. We also talked about our intentions and approach to XR protesters and others committed to direct action. Some immediately saw the value of independent mediation, while others suspected that we were essentially "soft cops" who might share the information we gleaned from demonstrators with the authorities, inadvertently or not. It was relatively easy to address these issues. Some campaigners who saw us respecting confidential information were, after a couple of days, happy to give their approval to us relaying some of their questions and concerns to the police or to staff in the offices they were protesting outside. Other activists challenged us on what they saw as the essentially liberal character of our initiative. They accepted that mediators would not seek to obstruct or influence protest tactics, or tell protesters what they could and couldn't do. Nevertheless, they argued that - in spite of our good intentions - our logic would tend to demobilise and defang their efforts, blunting their campaigns on issues which in fact call for sharp and decisive action. Some pointed out that, although there are times when de-escalation and a degree of cooperation between protesters and the authorities is appropriate, there are other times when a degree of tension helps to achieve the protestors' aims, including the relatively modest goals of publicising their cause and recruiting new supporters. They worried mediators would get in the way of this. Mediators at climate protests should not obstruct anyone who has decided to act in a particular way. But they should offer space for people to consider and try out alternative ways of meeting their goals in a process open to and shaped by all others who have a stake. Our conversations with demonstrators at COP26 showed how people could take time to reflect and make useful connections. Such support might be useful to them - and to councils and the police - as the coming months bring further protests by Just Stop Oil and other campaigners.

As hosts of COP26 HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/COP26-Explained.pdf the UK has called for attendees to submit more ambitious emissions reductions targets for 2030 that will help the world reach net zero by mid-century, to raise contributions to climate adaptation and mitigation funds and to finalise the rules which would govern the implementation of the Paris climate agreement made in 2015. This round of the UN climate talks was originally supposed to take place in 2020, but it was HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/cop26-postponed postponed because of the pandemic. Around the main talks, from October 31 to November 12 2021, Scotland's largest city will host a series of meetings and events between world leaders, scientists and civil society groups. In a year plagued by catastrophic floods, wildfires and heatwaves, the need to act on climate change has never been more urgent. So what will the negotiators in Glasgow be debating? Up for discussion HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement/key-aspects-of-the-paris-agreement landmark Paris Agreement A persistent source of disagreement concerns how international carbon markets should work - Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. These markets would allow countries to receive credits for reducing emissions in excess of their targets, which could then be sold to countries struggling to meet their own commitments. Implementing carbon markets is HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-q-and-a-how-article-6-carbon-markets-could-make-or-break-the-paris-agreement very difficult . Developing countries worry that these markets will allow rich countries to avoid painful emissions reductions at home while making marginal contributions to abate emissions abroad through buying credits. Poor countries argue that developing countries could use the same emission cuts they sell as credits towards their own domestic reduction targets, effectively counting them twice. Carrying over old credits accumulated under the previous system of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol might also allow emerging economies such as Brazil and India, and carbon-intensive economies such as Australia and Russia, to meet future reduction targets without much additional effort. This clashes with the spirit of the Paris Agreement to increase ambition over time. Difficult negotiations are also expected over how to support poorer countries to develop sustainably. The Paris Agreement recognised the existential threats to climate-vulnerable countries from mounting floods and droughts. HYPERLINK Loss and damage provisions Another contentious issue will be the delivery of HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/100_billion_climate_finance_report.pdf US$100 billion (\£374 billion) annually in climate finance.

The siren has rung for halftime, and our team is losing. Our opponents are more united than expected. It's hard to see how Team Australia will even try to catch up in the second half. COP26 has been a conference of wins and losses. Australia came into this event ranked at the bottom of the climate action ladder out of nearly 200 countries. On the global playing field, our strongest allies may soon become rivals, as Australia continues to distance itself from the rest of the pack. The United States has led a coalition of 190 countries and organisations to consign coal to history. Australia, on the other hand, is opening more than 100 new fossil-fuel projects off the back of this conference. The United Kingdom has pledged to slash emissions by 68 per cent this decade - that's more than half of Australia's formal target. Even if Australia was to slash its pollution by one-third by 2030, the science tells us it is nowhere near enough. So how is Australia being viewed here in Glasgow? Let's start with the Australian pavilion, which this week has been abuzz with presentations from Energy Minister Angus Taylor and four carefully selected businesses. The most prominent display has been by Santos - a fossil-fuel company whose unproven technology has been on show for the world to see. The Santos carbon capture and storage model was so large it had to be wheeled away out of sight, where it should remain. Next door to the so-called Australian pavilion is the zero methane section. The irony is not lost on the many hundreds of people who walk past each morning. Australia's pavilion sticks out like a sore thumb, although I will be first to admit - it's got the best coffee in the entire centre. But once you've had that first sip of caffeine, it becomes ever so clear that our federal government has come to Glasgow linking arms with a fossil-fuel company. It is spruiking a technology aimed at extending the life of gas, while our pavilion neighbours are offering solutions to curb the dirty fossil fuel.

"When I saw the Australian government's pavilion, I went into a very deep silent painful scream," said Pastor Ray Minniecon, who is in Glasgow to represent the Indigenous Peoples Organisation. "There were no images of any kind that represented our people. Nothing! It was like I walked into contemporary Australia's version of terra nullius and the White Australia Policy. Our people are not represented or included in any form. No art or anything that resembles our place in our own country!" To add to Pastor Minniecon's fury and frustration, there's been no attempt by the Australian government to meet with environmental organisations in Glasgow. I am told by COP long-timers that this is highly unusual behaviour, and in the past the likes of former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop would sit down with civil society for a robust discussion. So, what kind of team is Australia now? It is one that is exclusive, mostly for white men in blue suits. It champions profit over people. This team certainly isn't playing for the majority of Australians, who want to see strong climate action taken this decade. If team Australia wants to win before the final siren, it needs to start listening to the people in the grandstand. Those voices matter most.

Glasgow: If hypocrisy could be harnessed as a renewable fuel source, the Glasgow climate summit might have a good chance of saving the planet after all. For months now the gathering has been touted as the world's last chance to get serious about climate change. But having been here for two days, it's clear the event itself actually adds to the problem. The brutal truth is that a serious gathering of world leaders and their negotiators has been hijacked by a grotesque mix of rent seekers, hangers-on and political wannabes. Some at least arrive with best of intentions, but their presence will have no impact on whether Glasgow ends up a success or failure and undermines the sustainability principles they repeatedly urge others to follow. The vast majority of the 30,000 attendees do not need to be here and the United Nations and United Kingdom should never have encouraged them to come. This is not a summit in the traditional sense. In Glasgow, world leaders are only a small slice of a climate carnival best described as part-trade fair and part-public relations opportunity. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a cavernous hall hosting dozens of unique \' pavilions' occupied by countries and organisations keen to spin a positive version of their climate credentials. Renting the space costs tens of thousands of dollars and construction costs hundreds of thousands more. An uninformed visitor to many of these pavilions could be forgiven for thinking the host countries are saving the planet through innovation, when they are instead digging up fossil fuels and burning them at record rates. It is the definition of greenwashing. Some pavilions aren't exactly beacons of environmental sustainability, either. The so-called Science Pavilion, hosted by the World Meteorological Organisation, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UK Met Office, features a long panel of 20 large television screens which display a glittering sign reading \' You can make the change'. They are hardly leading by example. Qatar, a major fossil fuels producer, has a grand setup featuring models of energy-efficient stadiums to be used for next year's FIFA World Cup. Why? Australia has a pavilion, too, boasting glossy booklets, information on businessman Andrew Forrest's green hydrogen crusade and details about a proposed cable linking a huge solar farm in the Northern Territory to Singapore. There's also a large exhibit from oil and gas giant Santos spruiking carbon capture and storage, which has raised a few eyebrows. The broader Glasgow venue is so big it takes 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, and the United Nations and United Kingdom have accredited so many guests that a stack of temporary buildings - most made from white plastics - have had to be constructed to fit everyone in. Many have noted the alarming amount of plastic packaging at food stalls, although they are at least serving coffee in reusable cups. Elsewhere, celebrities dash around as if the conference is one giant red carpet. Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio was chased by a huge throng of fans and press as he walked around in sunglasses to an indoor meeting. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, triggered a wave of negative headlines when he flew into Glasgow on a private Gulfstream G650ER jet which reportedly cost him $65 million. About 400 private planes - one of the most inefficient ways to travel - have flown to Glasgow over recent days. Prince Charles, a longstanding campaigner for the environment, also arrived by a private jet after being in Rome for the G20. "His Royal Highness has personally campaigned for a shift towards sustainable aviation fuel and would only undertake travel to Rome when it was agreed that sustainable fuel would be used in the plane," a spokesperson explained. The UK says the whole Glasgow summit will be carbon neutral because they will offset emissions by buying credits elsewhere. "Sustainability will be at the core of COP26 ," a spokesperson says. The conference was designed with the help of a carbon management plan, but the UK has not released the document despite pledging to do so "shortly". Defenders will argue the excesses at COP26 are a drop in the ocean compared to the broader climate objectives the conference is trying to solve, and that is true. But would the summit really be any less successful if scaled back to core business? The bigger the circus, the less pressure applied to the main act: the leaders who have the ability to make a difference here. Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future.

World and business leaders may be blustering about emissions at the COP26 climate summit in Scotland but that did not stop more than 400 of them flying in on their private jets. In what one Scottish MP has labelled "rank climate hypocrisy", it has been estimated the flights will produce more global warming gas than 1600 Scots burn through domestically in a year or conservatively 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Private jets burn more than commercial flights all of which were available to most of the various leaders and business executives at the summit which has one central theme of flying less to cut emissions. US President Joe Biden and his entourage came in two aircraft to line up next to the French Cotam 001, Canadian Air Force VIP, German Konrad Adenauer, Japanese Air Force One, Air India One, Israeli Wing of Zion and of course Prime Minister Scott Morrison's RAAF aircraft although with Qantas only starting to fly internationally again yesterday, he had little option. Mining billionaire and environmentalist Twiggy Forrest also flew into Scotland on his private jet as did Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in his $87 million Gulfstream. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was also reportedly to jet into COP26 , in what 2GB's Ray Hadley likened to a "toolie" attending a schoolie's week. "They have no place being there, no one wants them there, and basically they are pests, which are dealt with by authorities," he said. "I'm suggesting Malcolm Turnbull is the equivalent to a toolie, going to Glasgow. He's a pest, no one wants him there!" Defence Minister Peter Dutton revealed Mr Turnbull was jetting with Mr Forrest, on his new $98 million jet, but he joked he was sure carbon offsets were being purchased for the trip. Matt Finch, UK policy manager for Europe's Transport and Environment lobby group, said the hypocrisy was staggering. "The average private jet, and we are not talking Air Force One, emits two tons of CO2 for every hour in flight. It can't be stressed enough how bad private jets are for the environment, it is the worst way to travel by miles. Our research has found that most journeys could easily be completed on scheduled flights. "Private jets are very prestigious but it is difficult to avoid the hypocrisy of using one while claiming to be fighting climate change." Britain's Secretary of State Liz Truss defended the move telling the British press it was better than a zoom call. "It's really important that we do have people face-to-face," she told breakfast radio. "I think everybody who's ever done a Zoom call knows that they're quite useful for some things. But when you really get into crunch negotiations, when you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face-to-face, you do need to meet in person and this is really critical." Such has been the air traffic jam in Glasgow some aircraft had to be diverted elsewhere to park, flying empty to other strips. According to industry experts, an average private jet journey emits 10 times as much greenhouse gases per person as the same trip on an economy class flight. Scottish Labour MP and spokeswoman for the newly created Net Zero portfolio, Monica Lennon, describe it was rank hypocrisy but gave Mr Morrison an out. "It goes against what all of these national leaders tell people they should be doing - they should be leading by example," Ms Lennon said. "Except in rare cases where there is no other option - for example some global south states which don't have scheduled flights available - it sends out completely the wrong message." Qantas has only just begun flying again, with its first flight to London, QF1, on Monday night so that commercial flight would have been unavailable to Mr Morrison and his entourage. Greenpeace UK also said the leaders' arguments would sound more convincing if they chose to not fly in on private charters. \</doc>

An updated draft of the UN's COP26 climate summit agreement has watered down commitments to reduce the use of coal and other fossil fuels. The draft decision, the second released this week, is being negotiated by representatives from nearly 200 countries and the final version has to be agreed to by all countries at the summit. While retaining its core demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges, the draft uses weaker language than an earlier text in asking countries to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Wednesday's draft https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-11/draft-cop26-agreement-calls-on-countries-to-boost-2030-targets/100611260 called on countries to "accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels" , but Friday's updated version changed that to say countries should accelerate "the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels". It is understood Russia, Saudi Arabia, India and other countries have been pushing to soften the language on coal and fossil fuels. The new draft also now "invites" parties to consider more action to reduce emissions by 2030, instead of the original draft's urging of countries to strengthen targets by the end of next year. Australia committed to net zero by 2050 coming into COP26 , but its formal target of reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 remained the same as when it was set in Paris in 2015 when Tony Abbott was prime minister. The ABC asked the office of Energy Minister Angus Taylor whether Australia had been pushing back against anything in the first draft and whether the government was comfortable with the original wording in the statement around phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The minister's office provided no direct answers to those questions, instead referring the ABC to a previous statement that said Australia had been an "active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26 ".\~ The Climate Action Tracker has calculated the world is heading for a rise of 2.4C, while University of Melbourne analysis published last week found if all countries' nationally determined contributions (NDC) and emissions pledges were fulfilled, a best estimate of peak warming this century would be 1.9C. On Thursday, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said the 1.5C goal was on "life support" and that reductions in emissions were meaningless as countries continued to invest in fossil fuels. "Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies," he said. "We know what must be done." Climate finance still a contentious issue Climate finance continues to be a stumbling block during negotiations at the summit. It did say that, from 2025, rich countries should double the funding they currently set aside to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts  \~a step forward from the previous draft, which did not set a date or a baseline. It also broached the contentious topic of compensation for the growing losses and damage that climate change is inflicting on countries that had little part in causing it. The draft pledges a new facility to address those losses, but does not specify if this would include new funding. Mixed reactions for latest draft Helen Mountford, vice president of the World Resources Institute, said the new draft was "a stronger and more balanced text than what we had two days ago". Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said time was running out to make the deal better. "It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better," she said. "Right now the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow. "Negotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who've come here to wreck progress and instead listen to the calls of youth and vulnerable nations." Talks are scheduled to end at 6pm GMT on Friday (5am AEST Saturday) but are likely to drag into the weekend, as has happened at previous meetings. ABC/Reuters \</doc>

Scott Morrison heads to Scotland this weekend for the opening days of the two-week United Nations climate summit in Glasgow that organisers, activists and businesses hope will set the planet on a course to avoid catastrophic climate change. What is " COP26 Almost three decades ago, at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the world's nations agreed to hold annual meetings - the first of which was in 1995 - on how to manage climate change. This year's meeting in Glasgow, hosted by the UK government, is the 26th gathering of the so-called "conference of the parties" to the UN Framework on Climate Change - hence the wonky name COP26 . Even though it is an annual meeting, only a handful of COPs genuinely move the global dial. The initial step came with the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol, which saw countries commit for the first time to reducing emissions. After the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen summit, which collapsed when developed countries baulked at having to curb the use of fossil fuels, agreement was reached on cutting emissions this decade at the 2015 Paris Agreement. Many consider Paris to be the "crowning achievement" to date for collective action. The Paris Agreement was signed by more than 190 countries, which each promised to cut their long-term emissions to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees, and preferably no more than 1.5 degrees, above pre-industrial levels. Australia agreed to cut its emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Those numbers are what is known as Australia's "nationally determined contribution", or NDC. Critically, countries promised to update their contributions to the Paris Agreement every five years and explain how they were being implemented. How is the world tracking against Paris? The latest scientific consensus is that the gap has widened, making it more urgent that countries lift their emissions reduction efforts. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's August report into the latest science, the planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees since pre-industrial times and is now on a steepening trajectory towards 1.5 degrees, which is regarded as the threshold at which climate changes become permanent and intensifies. According to the panel's central scenario, the 1.5 degree threshold will be reached early next decade, cutting the time for action to less than 10 years, according to scientists. What is Glasgow expected to achieve? So far more than 125 countries have confirmed they will attend, and many, including across most of the developed world, have vowed to lift their 2030 Paris targets. But big names are missing. China's Xi Jinping has not yet said whether he will attend, while Russia's Vladimir Putin has already said he would not. Nor will New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, or Japan's leader, Fumio Kishida. Other feared no-shows include India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico, which would take out some of the world's biggest and fastest growing emitters. This makes it very possible that while many countries will arrive with upgraded 2030 targets, COP26 will again fall short of what is needed in aggregate to prevent temperatures from spinning out of control. Former climate sceptic and Glasgow host Boris Johnson has four main goals for the two-week summit, which he listed last month as "coal, cars, cash and trees". Not only does the UK Prime Minister want to make this year's summit the one that "ends coal", he has put adaption and finance on the agenda. The first involves working out how to cope with climate impacts that cannot be avoided. The second will see pressure put on advanced economies to help developed economies cope by coming good on their promises a decade ago to provide $US100 billion a year. What will Australia take to Glasgow? Morrison, who is due to leave at the end of the week for Scotland, is working to get agreement from the Nationals to commit Australia to a target of "net zero by 2050". The Prime Minister is also expected to take updated government forecasts for Australia's emissions trajectory through to 2030, which will show it beating the Paris Agreement pledge of 26 per cent to 28 per cent. After the world's leaders arrive and give their speeches during the first two days of this year's COP, officials will get to work on some of the more technical, unfinished business of previous COPs and any new initiatives or ideas. Among them are talks on finalising Article Six. Also known as the "Paris rule book", this aims to establish rules about how countries and companies trade their emissions reduction units or credits. This has ramifications for Australia's own emerging market for carbon credits, known as Australian Carbon Credit Units, or ACCUs, which are issued by the government's Clean Energy Regulator for abatement and other actions that capture or reduce carbon emissions. \</doc>

LABOR will propose amendments to "strengthen" the state government's Climate Change Bill as parliament resumes this week. Labor leader Rebecca White said her party would argue the existing Bill needs to go further in three key areas. "One is to ensure there is a just transition as we move away from carbon-intensive industries," she said. "The second is to protect those in our community who are most vulnerable from bearing a disproportionate impact on any action we take on climate change. "And the third is to make sure this legislation has independent oversight." Ms White said one way of ensuring independent oversight was establishing a joint house committee to oversee decisions and progress of the Bill. Labor candidate for Huon Toby Thorpe attended COP26 and has long advocated for climate policy, and emphasised the need for a fair transition for workers and protections for vulnerable Tasmanians. The Bill will be read and debated in parliament, with the debate expected to kick off this week. \</doc>

Having led the delegates at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to believe that the first draft of the final agreement would be published at midnight Tuesday, the UK presidency will not have made many friends by delaying it till 6am Wednesday morning. There will have been plenty of negotiators - not to mention journalists - who will have needlessly waited up all night. In fact, COP26 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3.pdf text itself either. As the host and chair of the summit, it is the UK's responsibility to pull together all the negotiating texts which have been submitted and agreed over the last week into a coherent overall agreement. But the widespread consensus among delegates I have spoken to is that the draft they have produced is not sufficiently "balanced" between the interests and positions of the various country groupings. And for the chair of such delicate negotiations, that is a dangerous sin. Let's recap. This COP (the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is the designated moment under the 2015 Paris Agreement when countries must come forward with strengthened commitments to act. There are two main areas for this. One is emissions cuts by 2030, the so-called "nationally determined contributions" or NDCs. The other, for the developed countries, is financial assistance to the least developed nations. The problem facing the COP is that we know already that, when added together, countries' emissions targets are https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/09/cop26-sets-course-for-disastrous-heating-of-more-than-24c-says-key-report not nearly enough to keep the world to a maximum warming of 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial times, as the Paris Agreement aims for. And the financial promises don't even reach the US$100 billion (\£374.1 billion) a year that was meant to be achieved in 2020, let alone the much larger sums the most vulnerable countries need. So what have the poorest countries - and the vociferous civil society organisations demonstrating in Glasgow - been demanding? First, that NDCs should be strengthened before the scheduled date of 2025. And second, that HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3 at least US$500 billion Urging - not requiring So what does the UK draft text say? It merely "urges" countries to strengthen their NDCs, proposing a meeting of ministers next year and a leaders' summit in 2023. But "urges" is UN-speak for: "You may do this if you wish to, but you don't have to if you don't." That is not enough to force countries to get onto a 1.5?-compatible path. The text must require them to do so. On finance, the text is even weaker. There is no mention of the US$500 billion demand, although it does call for adaptation funding to be doubled. There is no mention of using the HYPERLINK https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/08/23/how-the-world-can-make-the-most-of-new-special-drawing-rights special drawing rights Of course, developing countries do not expect to get all their own way in the negotiations. But commenting on the overall balance of the text between different countries' positions, one European delegate said to me: "This looks like it could have been written by the Americans." It is of course true, as Alok Sharma emphasised in his afternoon press conference, that the text can still be changed. There are several issues on which negotiations are continuing and the text has yet to reflect their progress. Sharma has asked all parties to send in their suggested amendments to the draft and to meet him to discuss their reactions. He will find himself asked for a lot of meetings. But it matters how this early text is drafted, for two reasons. First, the lack of balance means that it is the least developed countries which will have to do the most work to change it. In Paris the French presidency worked the other way round. They drafted an ambitious text and dared the biggest emitters to oppose it. Second, the perceived imbalance could affect the trust in the British hosts. Sharma has built himself a strong reputation over the past couple of years preparing for the COP. He will not want to lose that in the crucial last days ahead. This story is part of The Conversation's coverage on COP26 , the Glasgow climate conference, by experts from around the world.

\~\~Labor is demanding the prime minister clarify his government's position on net-zero emissions after a coalition candidate described the pledge as not binding. \~\~ Colin Boyce, the LNP candidate for the Queensland seat of Flynn, labelled the commitment "flexible" and noted "wiggle room" within it, a view Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce described as "completely understandable". \~\~ Labor's energy spokesman Chris Bowen has accused the government of attempting to "be on both sides of the stream". \~\~ "Scott Morrison has a job to do today - is net zero a firm commitment of the government, or is it simply a flexible guideline as the candidate for Flynn has said?" he said to reporters in Sydney on Tuesday. \~\~ The coalition was saying one thing on climate change action in seats such as Hinkler in Queensland, and another in Higgins in metropolitan Melbourne and Queens Park in eastern Sydney, Mr Bowen said. \~\~ "They want to be on both sides of the stream - well they can?t be." \~\~ Mr Boyce said the net-zero pledge would not be legislated, although moderate Liberal MP Dave Sharma has previously described it as binding. \~\~ "It leaves us wiggle room as we proceed into the future. Morrison?s statement that he has made is not binding," Mr Boyce told the ABC on Tuesday. \~\~ The Liberals and Nationals agreed to an unlegislated target of net-zero emissions by 2050, following tense negotiations ahead of the COP26 UN climate change conference in late 2021. \~\~ Mr Joyce acknowledged the government was on a pathway to net zero, but insisted major export sectors such as coal could not be exited immediately. \~\~ "We have acknowledged that along that pathway, it is not a lineal form," he told reporters in Shepparton while campaigning in central Victoria. \~\~ "We understand that for this nation's economy to prevail, we cannot just step aside from our second biggest export or our third biggest export, that would be completely and utterly economically irresponsible." \~\~ Asked whether Labor's own climate targets were designed to appeal to voters in a number of marginal seats, Mr Bowen said the party's targets would be sold nationwide. \~\~ Labor is aiming for a 43 per cent emissions cut by 2030, exceeding the government's forecast figure of 35 per cent, but falling well short of a 75 per cent pledge by the Greens. \~\~ "Labor?s climate policy is determined by science and economics ? our policy, I sell it in regional Queensland, in Sydney, in Melbourne," Mr Bowen said. \~\~ "It?s a good policy and stands up to scrutiny anywhere in Australia." \</doc>

Australia has been labelled a\~climate change "pariah" and untrustworthy when it comes to\~international relations in the wake of the COP26 summit and the Prime Minister's recent stoush with French President Emmanuel Macron. During a raucous episode of Q+A, Scott Morrison's own party member, NSW Treasurer Matt Kean, railed against the PM's\~political stoush with Mr Macron. He criticised the\~leaking of text messages between the Prime Minister and Mr Macron, which came after the\~ HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-31/morrison-on-the-defensive-over-french-subs-deal-after-brief-t%C3%AAte/100583394 French President's accusation that Mr Morrison was a liar . Mr Kean backed the decision to exit the French submarine deal, but said Mr Morrison handled the situation with Mr Macron poorly. "The substantive decision was the right one in our national interests," Mr Kean said of ending the submarine deal and entering the AUKUS alliance. "But France is a long-term friend and ally of ours and we needed to handle that decision in a respectful, honest and transparent way  \~and that clearly\~didn't happen. "So I think our international reputation is damaged." When asked about the leaking of text messages, he was even more blunt in his criticism of his party and the nation's leader. "I don't think it's appropriate that we act this way if we want to build trust, particularly with our closest friends and allies, and I think this brand of politics is not in our national interest," he said. "[It is] a brand of\~politics which seeks to divide, seeks to play things out through the media, seeks to push misinformation and play games. "We need to be finding common ground and building trust with our allies and friends. That's the\~brand of politics which I think is in our national interest." His comments were echoed by many members of\~the panel\~who felt Mr Morrison had damaged Australia's international standing. Greens leader Adam Bandt took it a step further, calling for Mr Morrison to apologise to Mr Macron. "I think\~it's damaged our reputation and I'd be inclined to believe President Macron over Scott Morrison\~given his track record when it comes to the truth," Mr Bandt said. "I think now there needs to be an apology. "Scott\~Morrison needs to work together with President Macron and other EU leaders on climate because this has damaged Australia's reputation. "Countries are now saying at Glasgow, 'If\~you can't trust what Australia says and if the Prime Minister is going to leak your text messages to the media when you're having discussions between heads of state, how can we trust them on climate and\~on other issues?' "When we're facing such a global crisis, that's a terrible position to be in." However Greg Sheridan, foreign editor of The Australian newspaper, said it was Mr Macron who was out of line for calling the Prime Minister a liar. "I don't think\~Morrison lied to Macron beyond conducting  sensitive nuclear negotiations confidentially," Sheridan said. "I don't think he told any specific lie to Macron. "I think it's very damaging\~for Macron's reputation." Sheridan went on to say the leaking of the text message exchange was not a unique incident in world politics. "I don't want to break any secrets or disappoint anybody, but having done international journalism for 40 years, I find governments leak on each other all the time. Constantly." 'Cigarette salesman in a cancer ward' It was not the only time the Prime Minister was criticised on the program,\~with\~Mr Bandt taking at\~Mr Morrison's actions at the COP26 climate conference and particularly\~ HYPERLINK Australia's refusal\~to sign up to a commitment to shift away from coal. Major coal-using countries, including Poland, Vietnam and Chile, are among the signatories to the deal but Australia, India, China and the US are absent from that list. It was a decision that did not sit well with the Greens leader  \~who appeared on the show wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "no more coal and gas"  and he went on the attack against Mr Morrison. "That has been the whole point of this COP conference. "The US has led a process to say let's cut gas because gas is as dirty as coal, and others like the UK have led a process to say let's get out of coal, and Australia\~has played a spoiler role. "Scott Morrison has been a cigarette salesman in a cancer ward at this conference. "The whole world is saying we need to get out of coal and gas and they are signing pledges to do it and Australia is turning up and Scott Morrison is giving them the middle finger." "Australia is now a handbrake on world action." "The reality is the future of coal is going to be determined by foreign governments and foreign companies," he said. "Right now those foreign governments and foreign companies are moving to a clean energy future.\~So\~rather than investing in the technologies of the past, we must make\~sure we set\~ourselves up to grab the enormous economic opportunities that are going to come with a low-carbon future." "I think the Commonwealth government should be doing a lot better because it's not only in the nation's environmental interest to do so, it's in our economic interest to do so." Sheridan did not agree with Mr Bandt and\~Mr Kean but he had a message for the federal government. He warned it was\~losing the battle on the narrative surrounding\~climate change, and refusing invitations\~to air the government's views\~was a "tremendous mistake". "I think the federal government makes a tremendous mistake not appearing on Q+A," Sheridan said. "They're losing the\~argument [on climate change]\~and should be putting [forward their]\~argument whenever they can  It's incredibly dumb of them." 'Australia is the pariah' in Glasgow The hits though kept on coming for the government as climate justice lawyer Kavita Naidu joined the panel from Glasgow, where she has been at the COP26 conference. Asked about whether Australia was doing enough to combat\~climate change for its Pacific neighbours, she said the view from COP26 was a dim one. "Australia is the\~pariah here right now," Ms Naidu said. "It has not enhanced its ambitions since 2015. "Most countries are really stepping up to making sure that by 2030, so in the next decade, we see some real reductions in emissions.\~Australia is not giving that at all, we're playing with numbers. "Twenty-five per cent, 35 per cent,\~the fact is it needs to do it by 75 per cent if there's any chance of us to keep the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. "Australia is\~just not stepping up and nobody is buying Australia's bullshit anymore." Mr Bandt said Australia's behaviour towards its Pacific neighbours, currently among the most affected by climate change,\~needed to improve. Mr Kean said relationships were a\~two-way street, and if Australia wanted help with\~other issues, such as dealing with Chinese ambitions\~in the region, it needed to help its neighbours combat climate change. "I think we should be good friends to our neighbours," Mr Kean said. "If\~we want our neighbours to stand by us on the issues we care about  we're seeing the Chinese Communist Party trying to expand their influence through the Pacific and through the Belt and Road Initiative  so too should we be concerned about the issues they're concerned about."

There are fears governments might go slow on renewables in the face of rising power prices, writes DAVID MILLS SOARING gas prices in Europe threaten to trigger food shortages, factory closures and massive job losses, and could get even worse as the weather gets colder, experts have warned. Gas prices have increased by 600 per cent in some countries, causing supply problems for a wide range of industries, including retail, food and agriculture. Some have likened the current situation to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Others say it has the potential to become an even bigger global problem. The crisis is a "salient reminder that you can't just turn off one part of your energy system and hope for the best", the head of one of Australia's largest resource industry organisations has argued. Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive Andrew McConville said the crisis "highlights that the development of alternative sources of energy is complex and takes time, and we're not at that point yet where there is like-for-like replacement for the energy that comes from hydrocarbons". In the UK, a comparatively windless few months caused a massive drop in energy production from turbines, sending prices up and forcing a greater reliance on already scarce supplies of natural gas. The energy regulator also took the dramatic step of firing up an older coal-fired power station. Meanwhile in China, a spike in the cost of coal is also prompting increased demand for gas, further exacerbating global supply issues. With energy prices at record highs, 12 provinces have introduced power rationing for businesses and factories, while Beijing has ordered an immediate increase in coal mining. Some commentators have argued China's ban on Australian coal imports has only made their problems worse. One week out from the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, the global energy issues have caused some to question whether there should be a rethink on the rush to embrace renewables such as wind and solar. In Australia, outspoken senator Matt Canavan has cited Europe's energy woes as a reason for his opposition to net-zero targets. The head of the International Energy Agency Fatih Birol has said suggestions the crisis was caused by the transition to renewables were wrong. But he also conceded concerns about renewables "may become a barrier to the policies we need to enact to make the energy transition work" if they became "the dominant voice". Mr McConville said the energy crisis had the potential to influence negotiations in Glasgow. "My hope is that it underscores the importance of hastening slowly," he said. But the current crisis was also a "reasonably short-term problem. It's one of supply in its purest form," he said. Australia was somewhat "insulated" from the global volatility in resources other than oil because of our sovereign production capabilities, he said, whereas Europe had become increasingly exposed to price fluctuations as it had moved away from long-term contracts for gas. More and more gas was being traded at spot prices, Mr McConville said. In an influential analysis of the current energy crisis, Nikos Tsafos from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US said the supply shortfall was "being used as a political excuse by both sides of the aisle". Mr Tsafos said an electricity system run on intermittent energy sources was "bound to be volatile and produce enormous short-term stress". But he also pointed out Europe's energy crisis was affecting all countries on the continent, regardless of the level of renewables in their system. Greg Bourne, a former President of BP Australasia and adviser to Margaret Thatcher who is now a member of the Climate Council, rejected the suggestion that Europe's energy crisis was in some way caused by its embrace of renewable energy. "Europe is coming out of an economic depression, effectively," he said. "We've been in Covid and obviously the economic activity was suppressed by that. What we're seeing now is the bounce-back. Demand now suddenly exceeds supply." Mr Bourne said he doubted the crisis would affect negotiations at COP26 . "One swallow doesn't make a summer," he said. "People see this for what it is - short-term volatility." But the crisis did illustrate the need for resilience to be built into the energy supply system, he said. "Whether it be energy or food supply, building resilience into a system is really important," Mr Bourne said. "Europe does have system resilience but even the best of systems under the largest of stress will have hiccups," he said. "Absolutely that will be the case."

\~\~Australia will play a global role in helping other countries reduce their emissions and better prepare for disasters. \~\~ That's the message Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor aimed to leave with leaders as they prepared to exit the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. \~\~ However, Labor says the government went to the conference with a pre-election political deal cobbled together with the Nationals and left having had nothing new or ambitious to say to the world. \~\~ Mr Taylor used the summit to unveil the second of the government's low emissions technology statements, following the inaugural statement in September 2020. \~\~ The technology plan and emissions reduction fund are the two pillars behind Australia's recent pledge to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. \~\~ Mr Taylor noted Australia was willing and able to share emissions-reducing technology to enable the world to reach the 2050 goal. \~\~ "Getting costs down to parity is essential to unlocking widespread, global deployment (of solar, batteries and hydrogen)," Mr Taylor said. \~\~ Ultra-low cost solar - generating electricity at $15 per megawatt-hour - would be one of the six priority technologies under the enhanced plan. \~\~ The government has also identified the timeframes under which parity with existing technologies would be reached for the six priority technologies. \~\~ And it will support the greater use of technologies like electric vehicles. \~\~ Mr Morrison on Tuesday joined in an announcement alongside the UK and India of a new financing arrangement to helpsmall island developing states prepare for disasters. \~\~ The Infrastructure for Resilient Island States platform is expected to be joined by other countries to boost spending oninfrastructure that can withstand disasters and lessen economic losses in island nations. \~\~ Worsening disasters are putting the existence and economies of small island states at risk. \~\~ The Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank has estimated the infrastructure investment deficit across the Pacific and Caribbean at almost $120 billion to 2040. \~\~ Australia also joined with 104 other countries in signing a leaders' declaration on forests and land use. \~\~ "(We) reaffirm our respective commitments to sustainable land use, and to the conservation, protection, sustainable management and restoration of forests, and other terrestrial ecosystems," the statement said. \~\~ "We commit to working collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation." \~\~ Labor leader Anthony Albanese said he remained hopeful the conference, which ends on November 12, emerged with a "positive outcome". \~\~ However, he said Australia was trailing the rest of the world when it comes to clean energy because the prime minister had overseen a "decade of denial" in terms of climate action. \~\~ Greens leader Adam Bandt said the failure to commit to phasing out coal and gas would sabotage global action on climate change. \~\~ "Money won?t help a Pacific that is drowning because Scott Morrison and Labor want more coal and gas,? he said. \</doc>

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has blasted politicians and businesses in the wake of a grave climate crisis assessment. "It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world," Mr Guterres said of the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. "Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness," he continued. "Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying." Addressing the world's population, he said, "Demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale." The IPCC report said actions such as drastically cutting fossil fuel use, growing forests and eating less meat were needed to contain global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history. The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2C by century's end. "We left COP26 Only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity. "It's now or never," IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said. \</doc>

Friday's announcement that Prime Minister Scott Morrison will definitely be attending next month's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is the clearest evidence yet the Liberals believe they are on the cusp of striking a deal with the Nationals over a net-zero-by-2050 emissions target. It would be inconceivable, after all the speculation about Australia's likely position and the PM's reluctance to commit to Glasgow, for him to turn up empty handed. While some world leaders have been prepared to cut Mr Morrison some slack while he gets the recalcitrant - and obsessively self-interested - minor party on board, that was never going to last for ever. If the Prime Minister were to go Glasgow with nothing more in his backpack than a "preference" for net zero by 2050 and our already inadequate 2030 targets he would get a mauling from the global media and from the leaders of many other nations. On Thursday, prominent Australian businessman and green hydrogen advocate Andrew Forrest used his National Press Club address to urge the Liberals to go it alone on net zero - thereby risking a Coalition split - if the Nationals won't sign up. He also took aim at renewable energy sceptic Bridget McKenzie and said he had recently spoken to Barnaby Joyce about the issue. His comments came on the same day Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle warned Australia risked a "capital strike" by foreign investors if it did not do more. Mr Debelle's analysis echoed remarks made by the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in a speech on September 24. While the Prime Minister's shift towards net zero by 2050 is as welcome as it is overdue it should not be allowed to overshadow the fact that the debate has moved on in recent months, with 2030 emerging as a possible tipping point. Australia's current targets, set as part of the Paris Agreement during the Abbott era, are manifestly inadequate and are in need of urgent revision - particularly given many analysts say we are already on track to exceed them despite a lack of federal government leadership. And, with Australians set to go to the polls within the next few months, Labor also has to come clean on what it thinks a desirable 2030 target should be as well. Editorial \</doc>

Transport accounts for HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050 21% of global carbon emissions Even if current and committed policies were to succeed, transport's carbon emissions would still HYPERLINK https://www.itf-oecd.org/itf-transport-outlook-2021 grow almost 20% by 2050 HYPERLINK https://www.itf-oecd.org/itf-transport-outlook-2021 by 70% - but not to zero. Ahead of "transport day" at the COP26 climate summit, here are seven reasons global transport is particularly hard to decarbonise. 1. Demand is closely linked to population and economic growth As economies and populations grow, demand for goods grows, as does the number of people with the desire and means to travel. Globally, total transport activity HYPERLINK https://www.itf-oecd.org/itf-transport-outlook-2021 is expected to more than double HYPERLINK there is no way we can meet the decarbonisation targets of the Paris agreement by 2050 without reducing demand to more sustainable levels. But this is hard to do. It requires the transformation of the whole transport system, including tackling how often and how far we travel and move goods. Some of the more promising options, such as HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.17128 road-space reallocation 2. Transport is still 95% dependent on oil The (near) total HYPERLINK dependence on oil across all forms of passenger and freight transport is hard to change. Substituting oil with low carbon "fuels", such as electricity, will drastically reduce emissions by 2050. But even an optimistic scenario where global new car sales were 60% electric by the end of the decade would see CO? emissions from cars HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030 drop by only 14% by 2030 3. We are too obsessed with electric cars The HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/the-conference/presidency-programme/ COP26 presidency programme HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf4d2 15-20 years to replace the world's fossil fuel cars. Electric cars do not solve problems of road traffic congestion, safety and other issues of HYPERLINK https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/reversing-car-dependency.pdf car dependency . They also need a reliable electricity supply - not a given in many parts of the world - and do not address HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2009.09.001 transport inequality 4. 'Jet zero' is still a mirage Middle- to long-distance air travel is hard to decarbonise because realistic HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/25/boris-johnsons-jet-zero-carbon-flight-goal-dismissed-as-a-gimmick-experts-technology-avaiation-emissions "jet zero" technologies are limited for longer distances. Electric plane batteries simply can't store enough power while remaining light enough. Zero carbon aviation fuels and electric airliners are neither proven nor can be scaled up to the level needed for emissions from flying to fall fast. However, we should be able to reduce the total number of flights by, for example, introducing HYPERLINK https://stay-grounded.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/progressive-ticket-tax-frequent-flyer-levy.pdf frequent-flyer levies HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102194 50% of aviation emissions were caused by 1% of the world's population . About 80% of people in the world have never flown. HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac286e New research shows that a 2.5% annual decline in flights could significantly limit aviation's warming effect by 2050. While most people won't be affected, frequent flyers would have to radically curtail their habit - which may be tough to enforce, as they are more likely to be wealthy and powerful. 5. Cargo ships run on diesel and last for decades https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/20/global-shipping-is-a-big-emitter-the-industry-must-commit-to-drastic-action-before-it-is-too-late 10% of all global emissions by 2050 As with aviation, ships operate in a global market so are difficult to govern and regulate. But the sector has HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2 significant potential to reduce emissions through a combination of retrofitting to use zero-carbon fuels, such as HYPERLINK https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/low-carbon-energy-programme/green-ammonia/ green ammonia , and "slow steaming". A HYPERLINK https://seas-at-risk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2019.6.11.-Mitigation-ship-speeds.pdf 20% reduction in ship speeds can save about 24% of CO? . 6. A collective sense of entitlement to the status quo A collective sense of entitlement and dislike of limiting "personal choice" have a lot to do with inaction on reducing and improving travel by powered vehicles. Many people are reluctant to give up their car or flying, feeling that it is an infringement of their rights. Efforts to decarbonise transport are being hindered by a cultural attachment to the polluting status quo, which isn't as present in other sectors. 7. We are locked into bad habits Many developed countries are firmly locked into high-carbon https://www.transportforqualityoflife.com/u/files/The%20carbon%20impact%20of%20the%20national%20roads%20programme%20FINAL.pdf infrastructures and HYPERLINK https://www.itf-oecd.org/reversing-car-dependency lifestyles . Most modern cities have been built to serve cars, not people. The necessary roads, parking lots, driveways are set to last decades. To reverse this needs a shift in how we use our land and transform our cities, both in terms of mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects. This will need investment and political will. Major funding for new road-building programmes should be reallocated to fund high-quality, HYPERLINK https://eciu.net/analysis/briefings/net-zero/net-zero-cars-lorries-buses-and-trains zero-emission public transport HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2021.102764 active travel . That's the easy part. Political will and leadership in the face of uncertainty and initial resistance to change is harder to find.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson launched the COP26 HYPERLINK coal, cars, cash and trees The global food system is currently responsible for HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions-food about a quarter of all human made greenhouse gases, a figure that is projected to increase. The HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/global-food-system-emissions-alone-threaten-warming-beyond-1-5-c-but-we-can-act-now-to-stop-it-149312 increase in food system emissions alone threatens warming above 1.5?. There is no doubt we need to stop burning fossil fuels, but reducing livestock consumption in high- and middle-income countries is also vital to both protect the climate and restore nature. Governments at COP26 have pledged to HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59088498 halt deforestation and HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/world-leaders-kick-start-accelerated-climate-action-at-cop26/ cut methane emissions 30% HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-leads-45-governments-in-new-pledges-to-protect-nature pledge to protect nature HYPERLINK at all . Here are four reasons why less meat (and dairy) on our plates needs to be on the table at COP26 . 1. Livestock have high carbon footprints It is not very efficient to feed plants to livestock when we could eat the plants directly ourselves. Even though cows, sheep and goats can eat grass, unlike humans, they still need lots of land for grazing which could otherwise store more carbon dioxide as natural forests, grasslands or bogs, or in some cases be used to grow plant crops for human consumption. These animals also produce substantial amounts of methane in their digestive systems, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. The carbon footprint of beef and lamb is roughly three times higher than that of pork, poultry or farmed fish per 100g of protein, and HYPERLINK 24 times higher than pulses such as beans and lentils. Livestock produces just HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216 18% of global calories Small amounts of meat and dairy have a role in sustainable food systems, while some plants have quite high environmental impacts and some nuts use HYPERLINK https://newrepublic.com/article/125450/heres-real-problem-almonds lots of water . But in general, even meat with the lowest carbon footprints still has higher emissions than the highest emitting plant-based foods which are high in protein. 2. Reducing livestock production would protect nature Farmland takes up https://ourworldindata.org/land-use 50% of Earth's habitable land, and the vast majority of that farmland is used for livestock and their feed. Farming is the leading cause of natural habitat loss, which is the biggest threat to wildlife. HYPERLINK https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/summer-2018/articles/what-are-the-biggest-drivers-of-tropical-deforestation Beef production is the top driver of tropical forest loss. Eating more meat means that more natural habitat needs to be cleared and deforested, and the diets of people in high- and middle-income countries can be HYPERLINK key drivers of global deforestation 3. Meat production has quadrupled since the 1960s Since 1961, meat production worldwide has quadrupled as meat supply per person has almost doubled (from 23kg to HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-supply-per-person?tab=chart&country=%7EOWID_WRL more than 43kg ) and the human population has more than doubled (from 3 billion to 7 billion). The number of animals slaughtered each year has consequently skyrocketed. The number of chickens killed each year has increased tenfold since the 1960s (from 6.6 billion to 68.8 billion), pigs have almost quadrupled (0.4 billion to 1.5 billion) and cows have increased from 0.2 billion to 0.3 billion. Meat consumption is also very unevenly distributed. Just as richer countries tend to have higher greenhouse gas emissions, they also tend to eat more meat. For example, the average US citizen is supplied with HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-supply-per-person?tab=table 124kg of meat a year 4.

There are some important exceptions: oily fish benefits health but the fuel used by fishing boats means it generally has higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based proteins, while many fish populations are overfished.

Glasgow | The planes, trains and motorways out of Glasgow began to fill up on Thursday evening. World leaders had jetted out of the COP26 climate summit on Tuesday; now it was the turn of the massed ranks of business and finance execs to quit the tent city on the banks of the River Clyde. The summit, which aims to get the world to net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees, will reconvene for its second week with only negotiators, NGOs and the occasional minister still inside the cavernous premises. Come Monday, the exodus means Glasgow's SEC Hydro will feel tangibly thinned out. By consensus, the business presence at this COP has been far larger, and far more senior, than ever before. And that is changing the way a Conference of the Parties (COP) works, and what it might deliver. If this is the "last chance saloon", as Prince Charles said, puts it, then business arrived with full saddlebags, ready to rumble. Something has shifted in the business world. The capital is flowing into the energy transition; investors are holding companies to account for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance; and the risks and costs of going green are shifting in the climate's favour. "The challenge used to be, how to get mainstream investors to think about ESG issues. That was an uphill battle, and here at this COP you can see that the battle has been won," says Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the UN agency Principles for Responsible Investment. The question is whether businesses, financiers and investors can now, in turn, shift government. The corporate crowd used to come to the second week of COP, trying to jockey for outcomes from the inter-governmental negotiations. This time, though, business executives have come the first week with the leaders to drive the terms of debate from the start. They unleashed a blizzard of announcements, pronouncements and denouncements. Pledges, promises and commitments. Initiatives, investments and ideas. Sums of money that were counted in billions of dollars, and by Wednesday even in trillions. Energy Minister Angus Taylor says the growing business presence has given the COP process a whole new feel. "It changes the dynamic a lot because it's about solving problems, not talking about problems. That's what business people generally prefer." "That change in focus, certainly from the Australian perspective, has been very, very welcome. And I think it's important that at future COPs, there should be more and more of this," he said. Old COP hands say chief executives used to turn up mostly at side events. Now, like Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest, they appear on centre stage with US President Joe Biden. Peter Flavel, the Adelaide-born CEO of British bank Coutts, says that at one business event he attended he asked the five other big-bank bosses if they'd been to a COP before. The answer: not one of them had, but the time had come. Andrew Liveris, the Australian former Dow Chemicals CEO and chairman, says that's because previous COPs had a "negative vibe" for business. "CEOs have to be judicious with their time. They want to come somewhere where they feel they will be listened to, and there'll be action from it. Pretty much every COP, with the exception of Paris [in 2015] has not had a reputation for engaging in business in a meaningful way, or for getting anything done," he says. But with investors, and even Millennial employees, breathing down their necks, the CEOs were pushed onto planes. "You have to be here, you can't not show your face - it's what investors and stakeholders want to see," says the CEO of one major Australian company. But it's not just guilt that has driven CEOs to brave the queues, the cold and the sketchy food. There is a more wholesome combination of self-interest, and enlightened self-interest. The pure self-interest comes from the deals and networking opportunities that come from having so much political and economic power concentrated in such a small space. "It's like a mini-Davos, you can meet so many people," says one CEO. David Griffin, boss of Australian company Sun Cable, puts it more pragmatically: "COP has been a great opportunity to talk to suppliers, off-takers, multiple governments and investors, all under one roof ... It's very efficient." Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher says the Glasgow atmosphere has brought out something different in his discussions with fellow business leaders. "I'm having meetings here with Australian companies in the context of COP26 , whereas if I met them in Australia we wouldn't be talking about these [climate and energy] issues, or not as intensely as we've focused on them here," he says. Flavel says even if businesses are focused on deal-making, it brings its own greater good: "There's a network effect going on here, when you're in a room with your competitors, when you see you're all on the same or similar path." The more enlightened self-interest is that business cannot push headlong into the energy transition without governments smoothing the road. So the corporate titans came to COP to lean on the politicians and officials who are supposed to be clearing the obstacles. "The pressing point is speed at which all this needs to happen, and what will hold things back is regulation," says one Australian business adviser at COP. "Finance has been committed here at COP, there have been great financial commitments. But the gap, potentially, is countries identifying where the regulatory hurdles are; because we all know that fixing those can take years to work through the system." Not every business had the same agenda. Forrest and his ally, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, came to disparage carbon capture and storage (CCS) and its promise of blue, or abated, hydrogen. Santos' Gallagher, on the other hand, sprang to its defence. Views differ on how far, and how fast, the transition needs to go, and which technologies and tactics will, or should, prevail. But most businesses agree on a couple of things. They want a carbon price that will create the incentives required. They want targets and deadlines that will help show where capital should and should not be allocated. And they want to see common rules of the road. "What business wants now is to see all the tools - the standards, the data, the financial instruments - that you have in mainstream finance, so that you can actually allocate capital," says PRI's Reynolds. To that end, the biggest announcement of the week was not Prime Minister Boris Johnson promising to save forests or kill off coal, nor US President Joe Biden corralling more than 100 countries into a methane-cutting pledge. The unlikely beacon was the creation of the International Sustainability Standards Board, which will sit alongside the International Accounting Standards Board and elevate sustainability reporting to the same status as financial reporting. "That's a biggie," says Liveris. "At the end of the day, for businesses seeking to invest, and investors or lenders supporting businesses to invest, the metrics on the balance sheet will matter. Now we'll have the promise of a uniform way of measuring the asset exposure to the greening of the world. "When I do long-term, environmentally forward-leaning investments, the financial owner might not reward me on those because there's less return. So to get that air cover from the financial institutions, and have a way to measure it, that is a big movement." The finance and investment community had a particularly busy COP, as banks, insurers, asset managers and even private equity firms joined the ever-growing initiatives and associations created to signal ESG commitment and compliance. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney had the task of bringing some sense of order to this tangle, through his Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). On Wednesday GFANZ said it had 450 banks, insurers and asset managers from 45 countries with combined gross assets of $US130 trillion ($174 trillion) that were committed to net-zero by 2050 and "delivering their fair share of 50 per cent emission reductions this decade". Keith Tuffley, an Australian expat who heads Citi's global head of sustainability and transitions, calls it "groundbreaking". "It is a real commitment. Now it's about implementation. There are lots of promises under GFANZ, now it's about saying \' let's embed them in our policies, our lending and our investment activities.' " Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors, puts the COP26 achievements together with the G20 sustainable finance road map - "a really interesting, boring document" - and sees a tectonic shift underway. "If you look past all the caveats, what we're starting to see now is some mapping of how the whole international financial architecture can come together to deliver the Paris Agreement," he says. "We're seeing that evolve in real time." As the executives return to their C-suites, it's not yet clear if governments will deliver the kind of COP26 result that will inspire business to start coming back, year after year. World leaders are cautious about inflicting economic pain on their citizens, and the governments of countries such as Australia, China, India, Russia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia are particularly daunted by political anxiety about how the transition might play out. If COP26 Climate Council research director Simon Bradshaw says the business shift is "likely to further accelerate after Glasgow, to gather more momentum. Investors are leaning with the wind". Many leaders are going home quietly confident that Glasgow will lock in the change they feel they need to see, and set the ball rolling faster. "Most business people are leaving now with the feeling that they've rolled up their sleeves, they've done their job. If it does go well next week, there will be a commitment to the 1.5 degree target, and an acceleration of the halfway point at 2030," says Liveris. But Rebecca Mikula-Wright, CEO of the Investor Group on Climate Change, warns businesses not to get too complacent. "I'm hopeful, but the pressure has to be consistently applied. The pressure of Glasgow has to be with us every single year. It can't be every five years," she says. "But I feel that's there in the investor community, and I don't think it's going away." \</doc>

More than 100 world leaders meeting at COP26 - the UN climate summit in Glasgow - have committed to https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/%22%22 halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 . The countries that have signed the HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59088498 agreement contain 85% of the world's forests. The announcement includes \£314 billion (US$19.2 billion) of public and private funds for conservation efforts. In addition, 28 countries have committed to ensuring trade in globally important commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soy, does not contribute to deforestation. Saving the world's HYPERLINK https://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/%22%22 dwindling forests is essential if we are to avoid HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf dangerous climate change HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00976-6%22%22 7.6 billion tonnes of carbon every year over the last two decades. This is roughly 15% of HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions%22%22 global emissions . But forests around the world are moving from net sinks of carbon, which soak up more than they release, to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2035-0?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29%22%22 net sources .

Increasing global temperatures are HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02771-y%22%22 causing more forest fires Given that the window for keeping global warming below 1.5\'b0C, HYPERLINK or even 2\'b0C , is rapidly closing, humanity desperately needs remaining forests to stay standing. So is the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/%22%22 Glasgow leaders' declaration Past failures This is only the most recent commitment to stop forest loss in a HYPERLINK series of similar initiatives HYPERLINK https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/396/66/PDF/N0539666.pdf?OpenElement committed to "reverse the loss of forest cover worldwide" by 2015. In HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241277 2008 , 67 countries pledged to try and reach zero net deforestation by 2020. This was followed by the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/new-york-declaration-on-forests New York declaration on forests These earlier efforts clearly failed to meet their targets. On average, rates of forest loss HYPERLINK https://forestdeclaration.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2020NYDFGoal1.pdf have been 41% higher HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320717305219?casa_token=eTVee0gVee8AAAAA:kw2vCRtOv7WlIVFNMcvwK4AZ6Rdz2yGwYFi7zlD1CCZ8x974bCQTbeEcM6Ef8x_PwK0ebHIJpkU%22%22 almost impossible to know what deforestation rates would have been without these pledges. It is important not to vilify those clearing tropical forests. In most cases, whether it's oil-palm plantation workers in southeast Asia, or the owner of a family-run cocoa farm in Ghana, these are just ordinary people trying to make a living. Where those clearing forest are poor subsistence farmers with few alternatives, such as many in Madagascar for example, preventing forest clearance can mean some of the poorest people on the planet are HYPERLINK https://peerj.com/articles/5106/ bearing the cost of tackling climate change. Given that such people contribute HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/contributed-most-global-co2%22%22 relatively few emissions What we do know is that progress on slowing deforestation has been wildly inadequate. The good news is Brazil, Russia and China, who did not sign the 2014 declaration, HYPERLINK have this time . However, words are cheap, actually slowing deforestation is difficult to achieve. Why is it so hard to slow deforestation? The causes of forest loss HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3445 vary from place to place, but the problem boils down to a conflict between those who benefit from deforestation and those who benefit from keeping forests intact, and whose ability to influence what happens on the ground wins out. Conserving forests benefits everybody by stabilising the climate. But logging, or clearing a patch of forest for farming, benefits the people involved in a much more direct and tangible way. Ultimately, to keep forests intact, those who benefit from forests (that's all of us) need to fund efforts to conserve them. Despite HYPERLINK https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/23493/0 criticism , and problems with HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343517301872 implementation , this is the underlying rationale to REDD+ ( HYPERLINK https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.12933 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ) - the UN mechanism whereby tropical nations are paid for efforts to conserve forests. Just before flying to Glasgow, Madagascar's minister of environment and sustainable development, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, visited a village to ask people HYPERLINK http://forest4climateandpeople.bangor.ac.uk/%22%22 their views on what would make forest conservation more effective. They spoke about the lack of HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17300475 alternative livelihoods HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941921003782218 more support to help them manage the forest sustainably, and the fact that local communities often HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026483771631105X lack the ability to exclude those who wish to exploit forests. Raharinirina said: Madagascar has contributed relatively little to climate change, but our people are suffering the consequences. For example, HYPERLINK https://news.sky.com/story/madagascar-is-on-the-brink-of-famine-caused-by-climate-change-with-children-most-at-risk-12456981%22%22 a million people in the south I am cautiously impressed with how much attention is being paid to the question of fairly reducing tropical deforestation at COP26 . The https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEI5LG_86ns first event in the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UK-Presidency-Pavilion-at-COP26-Programme.pdf%22%22 UK-led programme brought forest communities and indigenous people together to discuss lessons from the last decade of forest conservation. Perhaps I am naive, but I sense a helpful change in tone among world leaders, from assuming that forest conservation inevitably delivers triple wins which benefit the climate, biodiversity and local livelihoods, to a more honest acknowledgement that often, HYPERLINK https://www.espa.ac.uk/book there are winners and losers So, will this pledge finally halt and reverse deforestation? Unlikely. But given the importance of the issue, the renewed focus on deforestation at COP26 is certainly positive.

A Samoan-born University of Wollongong student who went to Glasgow last year to speak on behalf of Pacific Island nations at the climate conference, joins the co-ordinator of Bellambi Neighbourhood Centre, among the NSW Women of the Year awardees. State MPs were asked to select a Woman of the Year in each electorate as part of the NSW government's Women of the Year Awards. They will be honoured at an event tomorrow where the state winners will be announced. The electorate winners do not go in the running for the state awards. Moemoana Schwenke, 21, was MP for Wollongong Paul Scully's pick for the electorate's Woman of the Year, after she travelled to Glasgow to speak at the COP26 climate change conference. Ms Schwenke, of Wollongong, attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) as part of The Pacific Climate Warriors and represented both Samoa and the other islands of the Pacific. She has been working to raise awareness of the impact of climate change on Pacific Island nations and also wants to share her culture with the Illawarra community. Mr Scully said he was struck by Ms Schwenke's commitment and dedication. "Wollongong has a rich history of activism that has had national and international influence and helped create change," he said. "Moemoana has again put Wollongong on a world stage with her activism and advocacy on behalf of the Pacific Island nations, and her dedication to promoting Samoan and Pacific Island culture among our community." Ms Schwenke is one of the few females in the world able to perform the Siva Afi - a traditional Samoan dance. She also teaches Pacific youth about cultural artforms and is writing and co-directing a Pacific dance and theatre production to take place in April. Ms Schwenke, whose first name means 'calm ocean', first became concerned about the effects of climate change at 14 before joining The Pacific Climate Warriors, who are fighting to raise awareness of the plight of Pacific nations when it comes to climate change. MP for Keira Ryan Park chose Cath Daley as his electorate's Woman of the Year. Described as a passionate advocate for the Bellambi community, Ms Daley provided "outstanding leadership to her community" during the COVID-19 lockdowns and worked with NSW Health to co-ordinate the pop-up vaccination hub at the neighbourhood centre. "Cath has made a wonderful contribution to our community, in particular the community of Bellambi, and has a genuine want to help and assist those community members who are less fortunate," Mr Park said. MP for Shellharbour Anna Watson chose Dr Jodi Edwards as the electorate's Woman of the Year, describing her as a passionate advocate for ensuring better outcomes for local Indigenous communities. Dr Edwards is the NSW Education Standards Authority's Curriculum Advisor for Aboriginal Education and has an "unwavering passion towards revitalising the Dharawal language in the Illawarra". She helped establish Gumaraa Aboriginal Cultural Education and Illawarra Flame Trees Aboriginal Performing Arts Group. \</doc>

NEXT month's COP26 Community expectations are high, and the Liberal Party, bruised by more than 20 years of Australia's parliamentary "climate wars", appears finally ready to commit to net-zero in a serious fashion. IN THE NEWS: Extinction Rebellion activist charged after coal train protest Progress on Black Hill to Raymond Terrace M1 extension Cessnock woman in her 30s Hunter's third COVID death Supercars 'need support from council' to extend deal Hunter vaccination rates up but deaths show COVID's threat Their junior Coalition partners, the National Party, however, worry about what a net-zero commitment will mean in the bush. After a briefing from Liberal Party MP Angus Taylor as Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister and a subsequent party-room meeting - Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce emerged to say the Nationals would not be bullied into a net-zero commitment. RELATED READING: Zali Steggall bill, deeper cuts and a Climate Change Commission Forrest urges end to climate inaction Albo talks climate backing Hunter candidate Phil O'Neill on climate and agriculture Most of the public attention - and political action - on reducing greenhouse gases has been focused on the generation of electricity by fossil fuels: partly because the sector accounts for a third or more of global greenhouse emissions, but also because there are alternative methods of generating power. The Nationals have come to see the coal industry and coalminers as their constituency, but they are also concerned about agriculture, which accounts for 13.5 per cent of Australian emissions, on the latest official figures. Ultimately, though, they will have to join the Liberals in a net-zero pledge. Mr Joyce may be able to rattle the cage for a little longer, but the days of outright opposition to carbon intervention are over. Australia should not promise more than it needs to in Glasgow, but those Nationals worried about employment impacts should realise that decarbonising will create new jobs and new industries, meaning "net" job losses are unlikely. ALSO THIS YEAR: Morrison's February Press Club address Climate Council wants net zero by 2035 Regions suffer for 'inner-city elites' says Institute of Public Affairs International Energy Agency backs hydro Tasmania wants state net-zero law Similarly, "net-zero" does not mean zero emissions: it means equally offsetting whatever is emitted. Forestry and other forms of agricultural carbon-storage will have a big role to play in whatever form Australia's net-zero pledge finally takes. Even if some Coalition MPs doubt the climate science, seeing COP26 as a jobs generator would surely make committing to it a whole lot easier.

\~\~The federal government and Labor don't appear overly concerned about the watering down of one key element of the United Nations' final agreement on climate change at the Glasgow COP26 summit. \~\~ However, the Greens called it a "cop out" on coal. \~\~ But there was a last-minute change to the wording of the UN agreement around coal at the insistence of India. \~\~ Instead, a clause was amended to accelerate "efforts to phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies", weakening what had been "efforts to phase out". \~\~ Even so, cabinet minister and former environmental minister Greg Hunt believes the summit has made important progress for the world. \~\~ "We welcome theoutcome at Glasgow. It's important progress for the world. It's important protection for Australia," Mr Hunt, a former environment minister, told the ABC's Insiders on Sunday. \~\~ Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said he was comfortable with the wording. \~\~ "What needs to happen is a transition. I'm comfortable with the world working together," he told reporters in Sydney. \~\~ "The difference is Australia needs to be a part of working constructively, rather than as we are at this conference, where we've worked with Saudi Arabia, with Mexico and Brazil, as one of the few industrialised countries that refuse to change the 2030 target." \~\~ ButGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has been in Glasgow, said the last-minute watering down of the already watery ?Glasgow Pact? was very disappointing. \~\~ "This conference should have ended coal?s future, instead all that could be managed is a phase down,," she said. \~\~ Greenpeace Australia Pacific CEO David Ritter also felt the final text of the agreement was far from perfect, but the message to Australia and other fossil fuel producers is clear. \~\~ ?The momentum is in the right direction," Mr Ritter said. \~\~ "The task ahead is relentless pressure on the fossil fuel corporations and reckless governments such as Australia?s.? \~\~ Australia has set out a net zero emissions by 2050 target. It also set a 2030 target of minus 26 to 28 per cent emissions but with a projection of minus 35 per cent. \~\~ The UN agreement also calls on all countries to return the negotiation table next year to set stronger 2030 targets. \~\~ Repeatedly asked whether Australia would be updating this target, Mr Hunt said: "We've set our target. But what we'll continue to do is update our projections." \~\~ "We're doing it without higher electricity prices and higher petrol prices." \~\~ Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said Australia's national adoption of a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 is positive. \~\~ "But our core 2030 commitment remains as it was in 2015," he said. \~\~ "We will need to update it before COP27 in Egypt to ensure we are in the main stream of advanced economies." \</doc>

BORIS JOHNSON, UK PRIME MINISTER: It is beyond question that Glasgow has sounded the death knell for coal power. REPORTER: Do you agree that COP26 sounded the death knell on coal? MATT CANAVAN, NATIONALS SENATOR: Given the fact that the agreement did not say that coal needs to be phased down or taken out, it is a big green light for us to build more coalmines. BARNABY JOYCE, NATIONALS LEADER: What you have got happening here is our nation earning money. LAURA TINGLE: All year, the Glasgow Climate Conference has loomed over Scott Morrison and the Federal Government - a pressure point for it to find a credible position on emissions reduction without breaking the Coalition. SCOTT MORRISON: Very smooth. Really smooth. LAURA TINGLE: Despite the Prime Minister's attempts last week to reposition on electric vehicles with inner city Melbourne MPs, the Government is now sending very different messages to different voters. BARNABY JOYCE: All those people in Glasgow just laying poo on the people in the Hunter Valley. All those billionaires in their corporate jets. LAURA TINGLE: But as often happens with such massive international meetings, things didn't quite go to plan. ALOK SHARMA, PRESIDENT COP26 : I also understand the deep disappointment, but I think as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package. LAURA TINGLE: Two crucial developments in the dying days of the conference have shored up Scott Morrison's domestic position on climate. A last-minute intervention on coal by India which changed the wording of the final communique from speaking of the 'phasing out' of coal to the 'phasing down' of coal. There was also a watering down of a proposal for nations to come back with more ambitious emissions reductions targets next year, instead of in five years\' time and with a crucial rider. A draft version of the Glasgow agreement circulated on Wednesday urged countries that hadn't upgraded their 2030 targets to do so by the next meeting in November next year. But in the final agreed text, paragraph 29 had changed. Now, only requesting that parties revisit and strengthen their 2030 targets, taking into account national circumstances. REPORTER: Are you ruling out a more ambitious 2030 target for COP27 if you're elected? SCOTT MORRISON: All that happened at COP26 was all countries noted a request to revisit these things, but I've been very clear about what our target is and that we will meet and beat it. ANTHONY ALBANESE, OPPOSITION LEADER: I find it completely extraordinary that 24 hours after the Federal Government signed up to having a higher 2030 target in 2022, they've walked away from that commitment that they voluntarily signed up to in Glasgow. LAURA TINGLE: The upshot is that whatever the communique says, the Government is now claiming legitimacy for its unchanged 2015 emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent when the goal for Glasgow by major developed economies was twice that and it is claiming that the coal industry has nothing to fear. SCOTT MORRISON: To all of those who are working in that industry in Australia, they'll continue to be working in that industry for decades to come because there will be a transition that will occur over a long period of time. And I make no apologies for Australia's standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or our economic interests. LAURA TINGLE: The PM is now in full campaign mode on the unofficial hustings again in Western Sydney today. REPORTER: Do you regard yourself as the underdog at this election? SCOTT MORRISON: I think that's fairly clear. LAURA TINGLE: Campaigning, of course, means setting up differences between yourself and your opponents and for the PM, seeking to exploit what focus groups are saying is a frustration with intervening governments after two years of lockdowns. SCOTT MORRISON: We're not going to legislate them and regulate them and force them to do things. I think Australians have had a gutful of governments telling them what to do over the last couple of years. The Labor Party loves telling people what to do and the only thing they like doing more than that is taxing then. LAURA TINGLE: Labor have long said it would wait for two things before setting out its own climate change policies - the Glasgow conference and the release of the Government's economic modelling. The modelling was released on Friday and met with widespread derision for its lack of detail. As the Prime Minister says, the modelling is based on the private sector doing things, not the Government. As a result, it is a forecast, not a plan. As we have previously reported, 15 per cent of the reduction in emissions by 2050 come from unspecified further technology breakthroughs. It is also built on a voluntary carbon price of between $24 and $400 a tonne. REPORTER: Prime Minister, this net zero modelling released on Friday appears to show to get to net zero you need a carbon price of between $24 a tonne and $400 a tonne. What's the difference between that and a carbon tax? SCOTT MORRISON: Well, what we have is the cost of abatement that is run through our Climate Solutions Fund. REPORTER: Doesn't that pass cost on? SCOTT MORRISON: No, there's no carbon tax in Australia and there won't be one because we are for technology, not taxes. REPORTER: But that's funded through tax, isn't it? Ultimately, when you are putting out these incentives... SCOTT MORRISON: We're not putting a tax on Australians to do that. Not at all. Talk of another budget before a poll has pushed election speculation into May but the option of a March election on the back of a mini budget contained in a late mid-year budget review in January is still an option if things go well for the Government. At least that would mean just four more months of high-vis jackets on news bulletins every night. \</doc>

Dear school striker, Well done on all you are doing - you seem to have made more impact on the climate issue in the past couple of years than I've managed in the previous three decades working away on it, and I've been described as HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000fgcn the physicist behind net zero I have one suggestion. You are calling for climate action now, which of course we need - we needed it 20 years ago. But you will find the climate establishment gathered in Glasgow will, weirdly and frustratingly, clap enthusiastically when you shout at them, and then assure you they are listening and taking action. Here's why you should be sceptical. So far, at COP26 , we've had a pledge to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-a-global-methane-pledge-is-great-but-only-if-it-doesnt-distract-us-from-co-cuts-171069 reduce methane emissions by 30% HYPERLINK stop deforestation by 2030 "Yes," they will tell you with just a hint of condescension, "but every little helps and the climate issue is very complicated". This is the point where you should get angry. It isn't complicated at all. We need to stop fossil fuels from causing global warming. All fossil fuels. There are only two ways to do this: we either ban fossil fuels altogether, and enforce that ban, everywhere in the world, or we require anyone selling or using fossil fuels to ensure that the carbon dioxide they generate is safely and permanently disposed of and not just dumped into the atmosphere. Now, you'll find most people in the climate establishment, particularly the green movement who claim to be on your side, come down on the side of a ban. But that's because they aren't the ones who are going to have to implement it. You are. When they say "we need to just stop using fossil fuels", what they mean is "you (the school-striker generation) need to stop using fossil fuels". And if you don't, you'll end up with catastrophic warming.

Why not? Well, perhaps because paying for all that carbon dioxide disposal might affect the profits of oil and gas companies - and the lucrative royalties and taxes that governments cream off the fossil fuel industry. But before you start to feel too sorry for them, they are doing rather well right now, with HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/37947e4a-71a1-4c0e-919b-1e3d55ee19ea oil and gas prices sky-rocketing HYPERLINK https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-compares-climate-change-to-james-bond-150149569.html invoking James Bond In the longer term, safe disposal of CO? will make fossil fuels more expensive, and no-one wants to admit this. But we don't let water companies just dump our sewage in the rivers even though it would make our water bills smaller - and they could argue "the water was clean when we supplied it". Why do we let fossil fuel companies fly-tip CO? into the atmosphere, claiming "the petrol wasn't causing global warming when we sold it to you." You can change this. Reclaim net zero. The only net zero that matters for fossil fuels is what goes in and out of the earth's crust. If the industry insists on continuing to dig fossil fuels up, it has to put the CO? back. This is the principle of HYPERLINK https://carbontakeback.org/ carbon takeback , and it's the only fair way to stop fossil fuels from causing global warming.

The COP26 summit may come to be regarded as a failure or an important milestone, but it certainly failed to address the "other" climate change problem: ocean acidification. With the exception of rising sea levels, climate change impacts on the oceans have been treated as a peripheral matter at global climate change negotiations. This marginalisation of the oceans largely continued at COP26 . Almost four decades ago, 168 states signed up to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf UNCLOS ). Under this treaty, they must address CO? in the oceans consistent with (but distinct from) their obligations under the climate regime. Ocean acidification (OA) is caused by excess CO? in seawater. Atmospheric concentrations of CO? have now reached https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/ 414ppm (from about 280ppm in 1750) and the oceans are a major sink, having absorbed nearly HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/depts/los/global_reporting/WOA_RPROC/Chapter_05.pdf half of all anthropogenic emissions But rising levels of CO? in the oceans change the acidity of seawater, measured as pH. Ocean acidity has remained remarkably stable for more than 800,000 years, but has HYPERLINK https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/ocean-acidification increased by about 30% This has negative consequences for HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1208277?doi=10.1126/science.1208277 shell-forming organisms and coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Recent research suggests it may also affect the larvae of fish, including commercially important species such as HYPERLINK yellow fin tuna . Read more: The outlook for coral reefs remains grim unless we cut emissions fast - new research Climate agreements and the oceans The climate regime comprises the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/ UNFCCC ), 1997 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol Kyoto Protocol and 2015 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement . It addresses CO? emissions, the primary cause of ocean acidification, but states have significant discretion over what action they take, and there is no explicit requirement to address CO? separately from other greenhouse gases. Although the Paris Agreement sets a target of limiting average global warming to well below 2? above pre-industrial levels (and aims to keep it at 1.5?), it does not set a target for limiting ocean pH change. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cop26_auv_2f_cover_decision.pdf Glasgow Climate Pact Read more: COP26 What the law of the sea says Under part XII of HYPERLINK UNCLOS , which has been accepted by all states as part of customary international law, states must take all measures necessary to "prevent, reduce and control" marine pollution from any source. States also have a general obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment. Carbon dioxide can be classed as pollution under UNCLOS, and therefore states have an obligation to avoid or control it. UNCLOS requires states to prevent pollution from land-based sources and from the atmosphere. ... adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from or through the atmosphere arising from their territory or vessels under their control. However, this is a due diligence obligation: it relates to conduct (effort) rather than result. Article 212 does not specify what states must do to meet their obligation, but stipulates they should take into account internationally agreed rules and standards. International standards Apart from emissions from vessels, there is no agreement on what these internationally agreed rules and standards are. It can be argued the climate regime constitutes these standards, and if states comply with their commitments under the Paris Agreement they have met their obligations under Article 212 of UNCLOS. Supporters of this position assert it is unreasonable to expect states to go beyond their commitments under climate agreements, particularly when UNCLOS provides no additional guidance. On the other hand, if it can be shown that commitments under the Paris Agreement are clearly insufficient to "prevent, reduce and control" ocean acidification, it would be anachronistic to say compliance with those standards constitutes "due diligence" under UNCLOS. I argue the latter - the due diligence obligation under Article 212 of UNCLOS is not met by compliance with climate regime commitments, except where those commitments expressly relate to ocean acidification or CO? reductions. This conclusion is arguably supported by the UN's 2015 adoption of the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life in the Oceans . One of the goal's HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 targets calls for states to explicitly address ocean acidification. This recognises that commitments under the Paris Agreement do not adequately address the issue. COP26 confirmed the climate regime is the main forum for addressing the consequences of climate change. But it is not the only game in town or the only legally relevant regime. UNCLOS requires states to protect the oceans. These obligations must be expressly considered and incorporated into commitments made by states, including New Zealand and Australia, in international climate agreements and their actions to implement these at the domestic level. COP27, to be held in Egypt next year, provides the next opportunity to address ocean acidification and to support a more integrated approach under both the climate change regime and the law of the seas. \</doc>

The decision by the world's richest G20 nations to blur the target of net zero by 2050 by changing the deadline to sometime "mid-century" underlines how little chance there is that the COP26 summit in Glasgow will achieve a climate breakthrough on the scale of Kyoto or Paris. Once the leaders of big emitting countries such as China, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Japan decided not to show up in Glasgow, it became clear COP26 was not going to produce the far-reaching, global agreement on decarbonisation that many hoped it would. The Prime Minister of the world's third largest emitter of carbon, India's Narendra Modi, is in Glasgow alongside Scott Morrison and 100 or so other global leaders. But, unlike Mr Morrison, Mr Modi is not there to commit his coal-dependent developing nation to the net zero target. Joe Biden's defeat of Donald Trump last November was supposed to be the hinge of history that made aggressive action on climate change part of American foreign policy. But amid the failure of the US Congress to pass the President's infrastructure and spending packages, Mr Biden has turned up in Glasgow without the political and financial muscle to sponsor and galvanise a global deal. Europe's energy crunch, which has pushed up the price and demand for fossil fuels, has tempered enthusiasm for a faster climate action, such as the push to precipitously shut Australia's coal and natural gas industries by 2030. Meanwhile, China's road map provides no new detail on how President's Xi Jinping's net zero by 2060 target is to be achieved. Along with India's intransigence, Beijing's failure to outline a credible emissions reduction plan makes it less likely that the EU will risk targeting the world's second and sixth largest economies with its proposed carbon border tax. This does not mean the summit will be a total failure. Valuable technical work of importance to Australia will occur behind the scenes, such as the negotiations to finalise the so-called Article 6 rules for the trading of emissions reductions and carbon credits. The big emitters are either Australia's largest markets for its energy and mineral exports - China and India - or its biggest competitors, Brazil and Russia. Hence getting out in front of the decarbonisation challenge could impose costs on Australia's economy. However, the momentum for the world to achieve net zero, generated by global investors and financial markets in particular, will continue to build. Hence a capital-importing, fossil fuel-dependent, energy-exporting frontier economy such as Australia will have to continue working on the transition to the net zero future irrespective of the outcome in Glasgow. That Mr Morrison is in Glasgow, having secured a Coalition deal to support the 2050 target, is a major political achievement. As we report today, the Prime Minister plans to tell the summit that his "plan" to reach net zero using affordable, scalable, commercially developed technology represents the global solution for tackling climate change, especially for developing nations. However, the reality is that while Mr Morrison has shown up in Glasgow, he has done so without a credible plan for reaching net zero and seizing the opportunities of the lower-carbon world. That technology will be the ultimate solution to stopping the release of carbon into the atmosphere is simply a truism that Mr Morrison has turned into political marketing hype. And the government's slogan about decarbonising through "technology, not taxes" rules out the market mechanism - a revenue-neutral carbon tax - that is the least-cost, most efficient path to Australia reaching the highly challenging economy-wide target of net zero by 2050. Ironically, an economy-wide carbon price would sharpen incentives for business investment in the emissions reducing and clean energy technologies Mr Morrison wants to see become affordable, scalable and commercially developed to decarbonise the planet. This would help Australia to get ahead in the global race to build the clean export industries of the future, such as hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Adopting a carbon price, while much of the world hesitates over a credible plan for net zero, would become a new competitive advantage. \</doc>

After two long weeks of talks, red lines, green lines ands landing zones, the delivery of the Glasgow Climate Pact has kept the 1.5C global warming goal alive, but with a weak pulse, officials say. The results from the summit were the introduction of a phasing-down of coal, the need for countries to return next year with upgraded plans to cut emissions, as well as doubling of developed nation contributions to developing countries fighting climate change. But the COP26 "I apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry,'' he told stunned delegates during a dramatic finale, where the text around coal was changed. Mr Sharma, usually known as "no-drama Sharma'' for his calm demeanour added: "I also understand the deep disappointment but I also think, as you have noted, that it is vital that we protect this package." In the final discussions Indian Environment and Climate Minister Bhupender Yadav and China's delegate Xie Zhenhua had objected to phasing out of coal, something raised by South Africa earlier, and even though there weren't supposed to be any last minute changes, India took the main running, demanding the change or detonating the entire agreement. There was anger, frustration, finger-pointing and much texting on phones as the agenda was delayed and key negotiators came up with words that watered down the coal clause for the third time. The text that was adopted now reads to "phase-down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuels subsidies while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the support towards a just transition". Mexico was furious about the "non-transparent and non-inclusive process". Fiji expressed "astonishment and immense disappointment'' saying countries could exploit loopholes and the phase-down had no demonstrable measurements. But as the US climate envoy John Kerry later pointed out, the wording on coal can be adjusted at the next COP and coal has to be phased down before it can be phased out, so it was, he believed, a big diplomatic win to get any reference to coal and fossil fuels into the text in any form. Essentially the Glasgow Pact ensures that countries will return in 12 months time with upgraded national plans to try and bridge the gap and make more ambitious efforts. Even if every government carries out its current promises, the global temperature rise is still on track for 2.4C, well above the 1.5C target and scientists warn such a rise will cause dramatic devastation across the globe. The Pact also allows for poor nations hit by extreme weather events to be compensated, but plans to offer reparations to countries for the damage caused by richer nations was put on the back burner. An agreement was reached on the fundamental process of carbon markets, which will make the Paris Agreement fully operational. There was also agreement about the format to account for targets and emissions, something that Australia had strongly lobbied for. Australia's chief negotiator Jamie Isbister had earlier told a stocktaking plenary of the summit: "we heard the need for a greater focus on adaptation and the doubling on adaptation going forward, we also heard the call for loss and damage and acknowledging the need we deliver a tangible focus and how we support regional efforts to address this." Mr Sharma said: "We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action." UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres warned the world: "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread." \</doc>

Macquarie Group chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake said coal's profitability will not last and affected communities must reskill, but warned the transition to renewable energy can't happen overnight. The comments come as the Coalition government faces internal division over its climate policy, after Nationals Senator Matt Canavan declared the net zero emissions target was "dead", prompting rebukes from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. More than 40 countries pledged to shift away from coal during the Glasgow climate summit last year, but sanctions following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine have triggered a surge in demand for fossil fuels produced outside Russia. Wikramanayake yesterday said the current profitability of coal companies would not last and new opportunities must be created for coal communities, pointing to Macquarie's efforts to diversify the world's largest coal port in Newcastle by investing in hydrogen hubs. "We are accepting the coal industry is running off. It's very profitable at the moment but it is going to run off," she said. "So the people of Newcastle, we the people of Australia, need new industry. We need reskilling for jobs." Macquarie retains small but shrinking investments in coal, but announced last year plans to reduce this to zero by 2024. Speaking at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia conference in Sydney yesterday, Wikramanayake said the next 10 years were crucial to addressing climate change, and developing decarbonisation solutions required three to six times more capital invested each year. "Climate change is one of the most critical and complex challenges of our time. When history judges our generations, this will be one of the biggest issues we will be held to account on," she said. Wikramanayake said she was optimistic following COP26 but progress had reversed. "Emissions globally had come down a lot in COVID," she said. "But now, fast-forward six months on, and we are back again. It's surged to peak emissions ... emissions [are] not just high but rising very fast." Fossil fuels still make up 80 per cent of global energy consumption and Wikramanayake said it was unrealistic for this to change overnight. She said renewables would continue to grow market share but the transition must be done with respect for all affected communities. "People need energy and if we end up creating energy scarcity we could end up losing the mandate for the transition," she said. "We can't ... [say] shut down all the gas, shut down all the oil." She said fossil fuel usage will rise before falling in the long term. "We are going to have a pick-up in fossil fuel energy but it's ... pushing the journey to renewables along." Wikramanayake said the global response to climate change would continue to create opportunities for investors who identify the right companies and industries. Macquarie has invested billions of dollars in the green energy transition since the early 2000s and Wikramanayake called on other investors to follow suit, saying regulatory and technology settings make "this a good investment area". \</doc>

Climate change leadership requires more than stirring speeches. It means facing up to hard truths. One truth that governments around the world are struggling with is the immense contribution their militaries are making to the climate crisis. For example, the US Department of Defense is the largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels in the world - and the largest institutional emitter. Two of us worked on a HYPERLINK 2019 study which showed that if the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal. In other words, the US military is a more consequential climate actor than many of the industrialised countries gathered at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Despite the outsized role of militaries, we know surprisingly little about their emissions. This is remarkable given their reach and fossil fuel dependency. Some scientists HYPERLINK estimate that, together, militaries and their supporting industries might account for up to 5% of global emissions: more than civilian aviation and shipping HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector combined . One reason we know so little is due to militaries being one of the last highly polluting industries whose emissions do not need to be reported to the United Nations. The US can take the credit for that. In 1997, its negotiating team won a blanket HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/05/climate-us-exempts-military-from-kyoto-treaty/ military exemption under the Kyoto climate accord. Speaking in the Senate the following year, the now special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, hailed it as " HYPERLINK https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-105shrg46812/html/CHRG-105shrg46812.htm a terrific job ". At present, 46 countries and the European Union are obliged to submit yearly reports on their national emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 2015 Paris Agreement removed Kyoto's military exemption but left military emissions reporting voluntary. Our HYPERLINK http://www.militaryemissions.org/ research into this military emissions gap has for the first time shed light on the dire state of global military emissions reporting. Under-reporting is the norm, as is data that is inaccessible, or aggregated with non-military sources. For example, Canada reports its emissions under multiple IPCC categories, reporting military flights under general transport, and energy for bases under commerical/institutional emissions. Military emissions reporting by the many countries that do not have to report annually to the UNFCCC is even worse. This includes countries with massive military budgets, such as China, India, Saudi Arabia and Israel. HYPERLINK https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020 nearly US$2 trillion This vast military imprint on the Earth's atmosphere is not on the formal agenda of COP26 . However, hopes are that it will be for COP27 next year, as countries begin to wake up to their huge military carbon bootprint. In June, the military alliance NATO HYPERLINK https://ceobs.org/did-nato-members-just-pledge-to-reduce-their-military-ghg-emissions/ announced that it would set concrete targets for it "to contribute to the goal of Net Zero emissions by 2050". Meanwhile, countries like Switzerland and the UK, which have passed domestic legislation setting net zero targets, are finally having to face up to the uncomfortable truth that their defence ministries are the largest institutional emitters within government. While military emissions are gaining attention, the culture of military environmental exceptionalism that birthed it will continue to drive the long war that militaries have been quietly waging on the climate. For all their spending power and political influence, militaries are behind the curve on sustainability. This was clear from NATO's additional 2021 pledge to develop a carbon counting methodology for its members to use - an area where militaries are lagging behind other major sectors. Which emissions should militaries count? Should such accounting exercises focus exclusively on fuel use and energy consumption? Or should the operation of the massive, global supply chains - like those run by the US government's HYPERLINK https://www.dla.mil/ Defense Logistics Agency HYPERLINK https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/004/811/original/CDP_Supply_Chain_Report_Changing_the_Chain.pdf?1575882630 5.5 times higher than an organisation's own operational emissions. And what about overseas operations, whether overt or covert, or the wider climatic costs of HYPERLINK https://ceobs.org/how-does-war-contribute-to-climate-change/ war and peace , such as landscape degradation, deforestation or rebuilding? Western governments, including institutions like NATO, are busy positioning themselves as HYPERLINK https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_184999.htm leaders on the security implications of the climate crisis. Their credibility on climate security, and on climate action more broadly, will be contingent on their willingness to first face up to some difficult truths about their own contribution to climate change. It will also require far more openness and transparency. Both will be vital for delivering real change, rather than more weapons-grade greenwash. There should be no illusions as to the scale of the challenge governments face. War is a dirty business. Militaries are institutionally complex, and procurement cycles last decades, which can "lock in" emissions. Things will not change overnight, but what they do not count, we can't see. And what we cannot see, they will not cut. You can view your government's military emissions data at the authors' website The Military Emissions Gap.

ACT Opposition Leader Elizabeth Lee will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, saying she hopes to learn from world-leading experts what could be implemented in Canberra to further cut the capital's emissions. Ms Lee will attend the conference, known as COP26 , as part of a delegation organised by Coalition for Conservation, an Australian conservative lobby group that advocates for climate action. "Action on conserving our environment, valuing and respecting our environment, they're inherently conservative values and it's also important to note that action on climate change, action to conserve our environment, should not be a political issue," Ms Lee said. "It is something that is of great importance to many people across all political spectrums. It's important that leaders show that." Ms Lee said the cost of her flight would be covered by Coalition for Conservation, and she would speak at three events, including the legislators' summit and the youth environment summit. The Opposition Leader said she had contacted the ACT Greens leader, Shane Rattenbury, and Chief Minister Andrew Barr, offering to "wave the flag for the ACT". "Is there something specific that you want me to bring back for the benefit of the ACT and is there anything you want me to push in Glasgow on behalf of the ACT?" Ms Lee said she asked Mr Barr and Mr Rattenbury. Mr Barr told an ACT budget estimates hearing last week no ACT government representatives would attend this year's conference. Ms Lee declined to be drawn on whether the federal government's recent net-zero pledge should be enshrined in legislation, but welcomed the commitment and said "it's about a matter of working together to ensure that we get there". "Look, I'm not going to go into that detail. It's not really my call, obviously. But what I can focus on is of course, again, the Canberra Liberals have always had a very strong record when it comes to commitment and action on climate change, including our tripartisan commitment to net zero emissions by 2045, which is of course ambitious," she said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week confirmed the federal government would commit to a 2050 net-zero target. A so-called plan for achieving the target produced by the federal government was widely criticised by climate change experts for failing to offer detail on how the country would actually reduce its emissions, other than relying on unproven and as yet undeveloped technology, including large-scale carbon capture. Climate change policy has been bitterly contested in Australia, and some sectors of the Coalition continue to downplay the scientific significance of a changing climate or the need to limit emissions to protect the environment and humanity. Ms Lee on Monday emphasised the importance of technology for reducing carbon emissions and ensuring there was a "just transition" as the economy was decarbonised that did not cost jobs. Ms Lee was criticised in August for attending a ball organised by the youth arm of her party, the ACT Young Liberals, where a lump of coal from the controversial Carmichael mine was reportedly auctioned for $2600. The Opposition Leader on Monday defended her party's "very strong commitment" to climate action in the ACT, including supporting shifting to 100 per cent renewable energy in the territory. \</doc>

The first week of the United Nations climate talks in Glasgow are drawing to a close. While there's still a way to go, progress so far gives some hope the Paris climate agreement struck six years ago is working. Major powers brought significant commitments to cut emissions this decade and pledged to shift toward net-zero emissions. New coalitions were also announced for decarbonising sectors of the global economy. These include phasing out coal-fired power, pledges to cut global methane emissions, ending deforestation and plans for net-zero emissions shipping. The two-week summit, known as COP26 , is a critical test of global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required, every five years, to produce more ambitious national plans to reduce emissions. Delayed one year by the COVID pandemic, this year is when new plans are due. Pledges made at the summit so far could start to bend the global emissions curve downwards. HYPERLINK https://data.climateresource.com.au/ndc/20211103-ClimateResource-below2C.pdf Credible projections HYPERLINK similar conclusion . This is real progress. But the Earth system reacts to what we put in the atmosphere, not promises made at summits. So pledges need to be backed by finance, and the necessary policies and actions across energy and land use. A significant ambition gap on emissions reduction also remains, and more climate action is needed this decade to avoid catastrophic warming. Achieving necessary emissions reductions by 2030 will be a key focus of the second week of the Glasgow talks, especially as global emissions are projected to HYPERLINK https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/21/highlights.htm rebound strongly in 2021 For its part, Australia contributed virtually nothing to global efforts in Glasgow. Alone among advanced economies, Australia set no new target to cut emissions this decade. If anything, this week added to Australia's reputation as a member of a small and isolated group of countries - with the likes of Saudi Arabia and Russia - resisting climate action. Global momentum: What did major powers bring to Glasgow? Since the last UN climate summit we've seen a worldwide HYPERLINK surge in momentum toward climate action. More than 100 countries - accounting for more than HYPERLINK https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/article/net-zero-pledges-go-global-now-action-needs-to-follow-words-oxford-eciu-report two-thirds of the global economy - have set firm dates for achieving net-zero emissions. Perhaps more importantly, in the lead up to the Glasgow summit the world's advanced economies - including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand - all strengthened their 2030 targets. The G7 group of countries HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57461670' pledged to halve their collective emissions by 2030. Major economies in the developing world also brought new commitments to COP26 . China pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 and strengthened its 2030 targets. It now plans to peak emissions by the end of the decade. This week India also pledged to achieve net-zero by 2070 and HYPERLINK https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/india-net-zero-emissions-pledge-cop26-renewables-promise/ ramp up installation The opening days of COP26 also saw a suite of new announcements for decarbonising sectors of the global economy.

For it's part, Australia pledged an HYPERLINK additional A$500 million Missing the moment: The Australian Way While the rest of the world is getting on with the race to a net-zero emissions economy, Australia is barely out of the starting blocks.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrived with HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/scott-morrison-attends-pivotal-global-climate-talks-today-bringing-a-weak-plan-that-leaves-australia-exposed-170842 scant plans to accompany his last-minute announcement on net-zero by 2050.

On the way to Glasgow, at the G20 leaders meeting in Rome, Australia blocked global momentum to reduce emissions by https://theconversation.com/g20-leaders-talk-up-climate-action-but-avoid-real-commitments-casting-a-shadow-over-crucial-glasgow-talks-170533 resisting calls for a phase out of coal power.

Walking through the vast COP26 summit in Glasgow, the first impression was always of an unfettered, almost unmanageable, political bazaar. In the main hall of 80-plus pavilions, a bewildering array of countries, collectives and companies were cheek by jowl, offering coffee and consciousness-raising, pop-ups and propaganda, dealmaking and debate. And in the corridors, the world's cosmopolitan climate elite networked, or sometimes staged Instagram-ready protest moments, as journalists stalked potential interviewees, and a battalion of security guards scouted for trouble. But amid the clutter, noise, and haste of 40,000 people gathered under one roof, or set of roofs, common themes and ideas eventually began to emerge. From the participants' perspective, what, actually, was this COP all about? Sitting in the upstairs room of the Australia pavilion, Ian Learmonth, CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corp, and Darren Miller, boss of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, agreed that one subject in particular had come up again and again: hydrogen. "We've been talking about hydrogen for decades, but it feels like never has there been so much energy, effort, capital and technological ingenuity put into it," Learmonth told an Australia-organised panel. Almost every country's pavilion ran an event on hydrogen. Many had their hydrogen strategy or plan pinned to the wall. And even when the topic wasn't hydrogen, somehow it always came up. Great white hope The COP was overshadowed by a growing fear that governments couldn't or wouldn't agree to do enough, nor quickly enough, to arrest runaway global warming. From within that anxious pall, hydrogen - whether grey, blue, turquoise or green - emerged as the great white hope. Although hydrogen is hard to compress and transport, and can be leaky and flammable, the planet-friendly menu of use-cases is compelling. It can act as the storage mechanism for intermittent renewable energy. It can become the fuel for trucks, ships and planes. It can travel down domestic natural gas pipelines and heat people's homes. At a trepidatious COP26 , the hydrogen revolution felt like a lifebuoy of hope, and everyone was keen to grab hold. " COP26 has put green hydrogen firmly on the map," declared Fortescue Metals Group boss Andrew Forrest as he prepared to leave town after a high-profile few weeks touting his new passion. "The trend is moving sharply away from fossil fuels, sharply away from fossil-fuel hydrogen, and the trend is moving towards green hydrogen." Forrest had a full dance card of leaders and ministers during his 11-day waltz through Glasgow. The encounter he was keenest to talk about was with a Russian minister. The Russian insisted that "blue hydrogen" - produced using fossil fuels whose emissions are then sequestered using carbon capture and storage - was the way forward. "Green hydrogen", made using renewable energy, was a distant and uncommercial prospect. Forrest walked the minister through his deal to sell 1.5 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen to British construction equipment giant JCB. "He came away saying, \' if you're getting multibillion-dollar agreements in place right now, it's us who has to change, not the facts'." Around the world Russia is planning to export 200,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year within three years, and 2 million tonnes a year by 2035. That probably makes it one of the less ambitious players in the burgeoning new world of hydrogen. COP26 The United Arab Emirates produces 300,000 tonnes a year of hydrogen already, but wants to use natural gas with CCS to make blue hydrogen for the Japanese and Korean markets. But the UAE is also betting on green hydrogen, with its Dubai Electricity and Water Authority and German conglomerate Siemens collaborating on a solar-driven electrolysis facility that will serve as a demonstration plant. For the Middle East, as for Australia, it's all about developing an export market. Little wonder that coal-dependent, non-nuclear Germany has forged hydrogen partnerships with both the UAE and Australia, as Berlin hunts for a magic ingredient to add to its renewables-focused energy mix. Other countries or blocs, with bigger markets and large industrial clusters, are more focused on creating a domestic energy supply. The European Union is flexing its financial muscle on hydrogen development, and expects 40 gigawatts of green hydrogen electrolysers will be in place by 2030, churning out 10 million tonnes a year - which will still be only 1 per cent of the bloc's total energy demand. The use-case focuses on ammonia, steel and transport; almost \€ 12 billion ($18.8 billion) has gone into it. China reckons it is going to throw together 100 gigawatts of electrolysers to make green hydrogen by the end of this decade. By some estimates, that's one-third more than the world's current total capacity, and needs a tenfold increase in electrolyser manufacturing capability. Then there are the countries where the strongest use-case for hydrogen is as a vehicle fuel, so the transport sector is leading the charge. Japan and Korea fit this bill, although Japan is also looking at how it can rapidly scale up hydrogen in power generation. The need for scale At national level, at least 40 major economies have produced a hydrogen strategy, although the priorities, and the levels of technical, regulatory and financial support, vary widely. "Each country has its own strategy focused on its own needs - and that isn't a bad thing," says Kate Vidgen, the global head of industrial transition and clean fuels at Macquarie Capital. As someone who has watched the sector for longer than many, she is excited about the fresh tailwind that is pushing hydrogen along. "The headwinds are still there as well, though," she warns. "The reality is, how do you aggregate demand? To get the cost down, you do need scale - scale is really important." It's a chicken-and-egg problem: not many businesses are using hydrogen yet, so it's hard to get supply up and running. But until there's plentiful supply and the cost drops, not many businesses will use it. In Britain, Europe and parts of the Middle East, the idea is to aggregate demand in hydrogen hubs, hydrogen valleys, hydrogen villages - government-guided efforts to create scale that can then seep outwards. "You do need a business model where people work together - it will only work if you have large consortiums," Vidgen says, pointing to Australia's Port of Newcastle as an example. The other option is that you are a company like Fortescue: big enough, with geographically concentrated production and customers, deep pockets, and a relatively straightforward use-case, so you can go it alone. Fortescue's singular circumstances have made for quite a singular campaign from Forrest. He is, as he puts it, "all in" on green hydrogen; and he's famously withering in his criticism of blue hydrogen. Australia, though, is punting on both horses. Fiona Simon, the CEO of the Australian Hydrogen Council, says it's not clear how big a role CCS needs to play in developing the hydrogen economy, but "we're open to different pathways". "It's too early to be definitive about where the world is going to go, or what Australia must do," she says during a visit to Glasgow. Blue v green ARENA's Miller counsels against getting hung up on the blue versus green debate. He says governments need to look at "how to make those two things happen together, rather than fighting against each other ... the common enemy is greenhouse gases". Macquarie Asset Management's head of real assets in Europe, Martin Bradley, agrees, saying blue is a complement to green, not a competitor. "There is so much methane demand that we can't replace it with green hydrogen tomorrow. It will be a migration, a dynamic picture," he says. "We need to get away from the concept of technologies being in competition. We've got so much to do, all these technologies have a role to play, and over different time periods." That's a pretty common view. Joe Doleschal Ridnell, Perth-based founder of JDR Advisers, a consultancy specialising in energy and resources, worries that this blue-green cleavage could upset the stable, bipartisan consensus at state and federal level around Australia's hydrogen trajectory. "Getting stuck into a debate around colours without a deeper analysis of how hydrogen production options meet national climate targets, and understanding the broader environmental, economic and social impacts of different choices, won't move us closer to sound investment decisions," he says. "The colour debate also overlooks a critical question customers have: how do I get and store clean hydrogen? In some ways, production should be the easy part." Global standards Forrest isn't going to step back, but he agrees that the next big step is to knuckle down and actually produce the green hydrogen - and lots of it. "We've had a lot of commentators take potshots at us because of the scale of our plans, and I can say, \' yes, the scale of our plans are problematic - compared to the market I've seen, they're too small'." Simon's AHC, meanwhile, is backing the Canberra-supported, 22-country International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy, which is developing carbon accounting standards. She hopes that "different forms of certification will be able to talk to each other", even if "one person's green is not necessarily another person's green". If the debate over green versus blue hydrogen wasn't settled at COP26 , the buzz around hydrogen at least gave fresh impetus to the most daunting challenge: just getting it up and running. "Fundamentally, we have a market that can exist and will play a vital role in decarbonisation. But what we lack is the scale," Simon says. "Governments are recognising that they need to play a stronger co-ordinating and market-making role because the market can't create itself. "In Glasgow, we're all confronting exactly the same issue: how do you harness this enthusiasm and go from the demonstration stage to this enormous world scale? That's where everyone is still getting stuck." \</doc>

Scott Morrison has dismissed anger among Nationals over emissions reduction as he moves to head off more climate wars within the Coalition. But standing alongside the Prime Minister in Rockhampton on Wednesday, a Nationals MP has told her rogue colleague to "pull his head in" as climate divisions threaten stability in the Coalition. Senator Canavan on Tuesday enflamed tensions in the Nationals over net zero, describing the target, agreed to by the junior coalition partner in October, as "dead" and "all over bar the shouting". Mr Morrison accepted debate over climate action had been "very difficult for our side of politics", but insisted fractious negotiations last year had put an end to the matter. "Everybody knows that Matt hasn't been supportive of that position. There's no news there," he said. "We did the hard yards to get everyone together. Of course, there'll be some who disagreed with it at the time, and I suspect they still will. "But that doesn't change the government's policy." "Pull your head in, Matt," she said. Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers described the Coalition as "hopelessly split" on net zero, accusing it of offering different answers in inner-city and regional seats. "It's one of the central issues of this election campaign, and the governing party seeking re-election ... cannot get story straight on net zero by mid-century," he said. Mr Morrison insisted he and Senator Canavan were in lockstep over Labor's "sneaky carbon tax" through its reliance on the safeguard mechanism. The safeguard mechanism system was implemented by the Coalition in 2013, and already applied to more than 200 sites. "Once again, the government has been lying about the safeguard mechanism to try and distract from the diabolical dysfunction and division that we are seeing," Mr Chalmers said. "The government is a joke when it comes to climate change." The Business Council of Australia also moved to damp down the Coalition's attack, stressing the safeguard mechanism was already in place. "The concrete, bipartisan commitment to net-zero emissions was a critical step towards giving businesses the certainty they need to make investments," it said on Twitter. Earlier, former Nationals leader Michael McCormack on Wednesday agreed Senator Canavan should "pull his head in" over the comments, insisting the junior coalition partner would stick to its word "When country people make a deal, a deal is a deal is a deal," he told ABC radio. "That's what we agreed to ... We shook hands on that. That's what the Nationals said we would do, and so that's what we will do." In October, the Coalition struck a deal for net zero emissions by 2050 after marathon talks before the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow. The junior coalition partner's blessing was only given after concessions from the Liberals, which have not been spelled out in public. \</doc>

If there is one thing that everyone needs from a UN climate summit, it is clarity. Deciphering the mass of decisions, deals, pacts, coalitions and pledges matters greatly if scientists, campaigners, policymakers and the public are to understand how the summit has advanced the goal of halting climate change and where it has fallen short. For months now, political journalists in the UK HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59084086 have played up the notion One of the distinguishing features of the first week at COP26 in Glasgow was a "blizzard" of announcements on three of the UK presidency's four priorities - coal, cash and trees. They were preceded by a HYPERLINK global pledge on reducing methane emissions, and succeeded by three evaluations of the combined impact of these various announcements. We suspect that the decision to launch this blizzard during week one of the summit had several overlapping purposes. Firstly, it distracted attention from the start of formal negotiations, which can be a distinctly dysfunctional affair. The announcements also brought real-economy stories such as the decline of coal into a COP setting. Finally, they allow the UK government to tell a story of COP "success" even if week two negotiations founders. In all of these announcements, headline claims were more evident than clarity on the reality behind them. But claims can be unpicked: and unfortunately for the government spin machine, many were. Unspinning the spin Whereas US president Joe Biden claimed the methane pledge could potentially reduce global warming by around 0.2\'b0C, https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c independent analyses HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/world-leaders-kick-start-accelerated-climate-action-at-cop26/ Breakthrough Agenda Most glaringly, https://ukcop26.org/end-of-coal-in-sight-at-cop26/ the claim that 23 countries had for the first time pledged not to phase out coal-fired electricity generation wilted under scrutiny. For example, ten of the nations, it emerged, HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/patrickgaley/status/1456722673610940416 are using no coal generation Even as the claims were being probed, analysts Climate Resource HYPERLINK https://data.climateresource.com.au/ndc/20211103-ClimateResource-below2C.pdf calculated that all of these pledges, plus new targets announced by a few nations including HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-59125143 India , could limit temperature rise to 1.9\'b0C. A day later the HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/commentaries/cop26-climate-pledges-could-help-limit-global-warming-to-1-8-c-but-implementing-them-will-be-the-key International Energy Agency The day after that, the Energy Transitions Commission HYPERLINK https://www.energy-transitions.org/speech-by-lord-adair-turner-chair-of-the-energy-transitions-commission-at-the-cop-26-destination-2030/ declared the pledges had substantially closed the gap between likely emission levels in 2030 and those needed to keep global warming below 1.5\'b0C. All gave crucial caveats, the most important being the two words "if enacted". Pledges do not cut emissions - policies do. And by common consent - now confirmed by the widely-respected HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/997/CAT_2021-11-09_Briefing_Global-Update_Glasgow2030CredibilityGap.pdf Climate Action Tracker Another less-discussed set of caveats concerns double-counting. Most obviously, if enacting one of these pledges makes it easier for a country to meet its overall 2030 target, it is not necessarily obliged to achieve the emission cuts it had planned for in other areas. And it is here that we return to the need for clarity. In journalism, crucial caveats can go missing, especially in articles written by political journalists unfamiliar with the topic. And so it has transpired, with the HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnsons-green-machine-gathers-steam-to-turn-cop-into-a-coup-r23bz3dn2 Sunday Times , for example, stating: "The UN warned before the summit that [temperatures] are set to rise to 2.7\'b0C. By the end of the week, experts suggested the agreements reached would lower this to 1.8\'b0C." Two days later, when the Climate Action Tracker highlighted the yawning gap between countries' headline pledges and concrete policies, we had headlines such as " HYPERLINK World on track for disastrous heating of more than 2.4\'b0C ". As a recipe for confusing the public, it is hard to beat. In reality the COP has made progress. The draft agreement recognises the huge risks posed by climate change and the urgency of finding solutions. There has also been movement on adaptation, finance and loss and damage - and HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CP-26.pdf this COP decision could be the first to urge phasing out of coal and ending fossil fuel subsidies. As we enter the summit's crucial final days, when spin flies around like chaff from a combine harvester, the stakes are higher than ever. That places an onus on scientists and analysts for full clarity on the caveats, on journalists to reflect them, and on leaders not to over-claim. COP26 will neither be a total success nor a total failure, but somewhere on the spectrum between. The details matter - not least for prioritising what comes next.

Climate finance is money paid by wealthy countries (which are responsible for most of the historic emissions) to developing countries to help them pay for emissions reduction measures and adaptation. Climate finance should be in addition to standard development aid. At the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks, wealthy nations promised HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3 US$100 billion a year A new climate finance HYPERLINK plan , developed by Germany and Canada, has been proposed. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/24/poor-countries-to-be-offered-extra-funding-to-break-cop26-impasse Reports suggest it will propose meeting the US$100 billion annual target by taking an average of the finance provided from 2020 to 2025, instead of in single years. The renewed focus on the plan is welcome. But it must be robust enough to tackle the mammoth task ahead, not just an exercise in shuffling figures. Time is running out - if developing nations can't afford to reduce emissions, we won't hit global climate goals and everyone will suffer. Read more: Glasgow showdown: Pacific Islands demand global leaders bring action, not excuses, to UN summit Failing to commit enough climate finance puts us all at risk At COP26 The promised US$100 billion a year is not nearly enough.

The cost for inaction is high and livelihoods are at stake. Crop failures, water shortages, and poor health outcomes due to pollution in major cities are all on the cards. Wealthy nations such as Australia are also affected by such issues - but they often have a far greater capacity to prepare and respond than developing nations. Australia's pledges lag behind others Australia's current pledge for climate finance under the Paris agreement is A$300 million a year by 2025. So far, there are no signs this will change. Compared to many countries, Australia is lagging. Even New Zealand, with its much smaller economy, has increased its pledge to HYPERLINK NZ$1.3 billion over four years 2025. The European Union is pledging an additional (EURO)4.7 billion until 2027 and the US is doubling its HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/22/developing-nations-welcome-us-climate-finance-pledge-but-warn-more-is-needed commitment to over US$11 billion The EU remains a world leader in climate action and pledges commitments fully in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

It could mean companies have to buy allowances to continue emitting CO?. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Another topic expected to be fiercely negotiated at COP26 is the so-called "third pillar" of climate change action: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/approaches-to-address-loss-and-damage-associated-with-climate-change-impacts-in-developing-countries#eq-5 loss and damage caused by human-induced climate change.

Loss and damage goes beyond what we consider "normal weather". Increased human migration and displacement also fall under "loss and damage" if caused by climate change impacts. Between HYPERLINK 2008 and 2014 and average of 22.5 million people were displaced because of extreme weather and climate-related disasters. This figure does not include migration due to sea level rise, desertification or environmental degradation. After several previous attempts to include loss and damage in convention text, it was finally recognised under Article 8 in the HYPERLINK Paris Agreement in 2015. However, the document's fine print ensured Article 8 does not provide any basis for liability or compensation. Finance to address loss and damage was also not identified. The Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Least Developed Countries and the Africa Group make up over half the world's nations and currently take the brunt of climate damage.

The hashtag\~"Australian Prime Minister Misrepresents Tackling Climate Change\~As Tackling China" has so far been seen more than 130 million times on Weibo. A social media post from Chinese\~state media outlet Guancha.com mocked Mr Morrison's mistake and said in a post:\~"[His] head is full of China." It has been\~shared\~nearly 2,000 times and liked by more than 10,000 users. "No way it's a slip of the tongue, it's just speaking out of his mind,"\~a Weibo user said.

Australia faces more fires, droughts, heatwaves and floods unless a greater commitment is made to reducing carbon emissions, a dire warning from the United Nations' peak body on climate change warns. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report says if global leaders fail to make greater commitments, the world faces a "grave and mounting threat to our wellbeing". Released on Monday, the review, a second instalment of the panel's Sixth Assessment Report, warns that Australia faces continuing warming with "more hot days and fewer cold days, snow and glacier retreat, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification". It predicts more extreme fire weather across southern and eastern Australia, and an increase in heavy rainfall and more droughts. "Climate impacts are cascading and compounding across sectors and socio-economic and natural systems," the report states. "Complex connections are generating new types of risks." The review identifies a total of nine key risks for the region. "Disruption and decline in agricultural production and increased stress in rural communities in south-western, southern and eastern mainland Australia due to hotter and drier conditions," the report said was a high likelihood of occurring. It also listed with high confidence an "increase in heat-related mortality and morbidity for people and wildlife in Australia due to heatwaves". "Cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on cities, settlements, infrastructure, supply-chains and services due to wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea-level rise" was also predicted with high confidence. Worldwide it reports that in the worst-case scenario global sea levels will rise by 0.15m - increasing the risk of unprecedented flooding by as much as 20 per cent. The latest report comes after the first IPCC instalment released in August - ahead of the COP26 Climate Change Summit in Glasgow - which warned the world would not achieve its target of keeping global warming to 1.5C without "immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions". Prime Minister Scott Morrison attended the COP26 climate summit in November after a long internal debate over committing to climate action. He recommitted to the pledge to reduce greenhouse gases by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 but said he thought Australia was on track to achieve reduction up to 35 per cent. Last night, a Morrison Government spokesman said Australia had reduced emissions faster than many comparable countries and on a per person basis was forecast to achieve a similar or greater reduction than what the US, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and others had achieved. "We are also one of only a handful of countries to set out a detailed plan to achieve our target of net zero emissions by 2050," the spokesman said. Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, said the report was "a dire warning about the consequences of inaction". "It shows that climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our wellbeing and a healthy planet. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks." Working Group Co-Chair Hans-Otto P\'f6rtner said delayed action could no longer be afforded. "The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet," he said. "Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future." \</doc>

ABSTRACT Labor is calling for the prime minister to reaffirm his government's net-zero emissions pledge after an LNP candidate described it as flexible. FULL TEXT Prime Minister Scott Morrison has reaffirmed as "absolute policy" the government's target of net-zero emissions by 2050 after a coalition candidate appeared to describe the pledge as not binding.Colin Boyce, the LNP candidate for the Queensland seat of Flynn, labelled the commitment "flexible" and noted "wiggle room" within it, a view Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce described as "completely understandable".The comments prompted Labor to demand the prime minister clarify the government's position."Scott Morrison has a job to do today - is net zero a firm commitment of the government, or is it simply a flexible guideline as the candidate for Flynn has said?" opposition energy spokesman Chris Bowen told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday. The coalition was saying one thing on climate change action in seats such as Hinkler in Queensland, and another in Higgins in metropolitan Melbourne and Queens Park in eastern Sydney, he said."They want to be on both sides of the stream - well they can't be." Mr Morrison claimed Mr Boyce was talking about the pathway to net zero, rather than the strength of the pledge."He wasn't talking about the commitment itself, he has clarified that," he told reporters in Townsville."Our commitment to net zero by 2050 is a commitment of the Australian government that I made in Glasgow. It is the government's absolute policy."As technologies change and improve, we are going to get there and we will get there by the best method possible.Mr Boyce earlier said the net-zero pledge would not be legislated, although moderate Liberal MP Dave Sharma has previously described it as binding."It leaves us wiggle room as we proceed into the future. Morrison's statement that he has made is not binding," Mr Boyce told the ABC on Tuesday.The Liberals and Nationals agreed to an unlegislated target of net-zero emissions by 2050, following tense negotiations ahead of the COP26 UN climate change conference in late 2021. Mr Joyce acknowledged the government was on a pathway to net zero, but insisted major export sectors such as coal could not be exited immediately."We have acknowledged that along that pathway, it is not a lineal form," he told reporters in Shepparton while campaigning in central Victoria."We understand that for this nation's economy to prevail, we cannot just step aside from our second biggest export or our third biggest export, that would be completely and utterly economically irresponsible."Asked whether Labor's own climate targets were designed to appeal to voters in a number of marginal seats, Mr Bowen said the party's targets would be sold nationwide.Labor is aiming for a 43 per cent emissions cut by 2030, exceeding the government's forecast figure of 35 per cent, but falling well short of a 75 per cent pledge by the Greens."Labor's climate policy is determined by science and economics  our policy, I sell it in regional Queensland, in Sydney, in Melbourne," Mr Bowen said."It's a good policy and stands up to scrutiny anywhere in Australia." \</doc>

British naturalist and documentary maker\~Sir David Attenborough has issued a rallying cry to\~leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, saying the world was looking to them to oversee the recovery of the planet. Sir David, who was\~a 'people's advocate' to the COP26 conference, said he had witnessed "a terrible decline" during his 95 years of life,\~but was confident that the next generation could and should\~see "a wonderful recovery". "Our burning of fossil fuels, our destruction of nature, our approach to industry, construction and learning, are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at an unprecedented pace and scale," he told the conference. "We are already in trouble." He called on the world leaders to step\~up. "It's easy to forget that ultimately the climate emergency comes down to a single number  the concentration of carbon in our atmosphere," Sir David said. "The people alive now are the generation to come, [and] will look at this conference and consider one thing: Did that number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here? "There's every reason to believe that the answer can be yes." Sir David also raised the issue of inequality, saying people in developing countries "who've done the least to cause this problem are being the hardest hit". He said cooperation would be needed to tackle the issue. "We are, after all, the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth," he said. "If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet. Surely working together, we are powerful enough to save it." \</doc>

Hundreds of young Australians will attend digital and in-person rallies on Friday demanding strong climate action, as organisers reshape how they maintain momentum for the School Strike 4 Climate movement, three years after it started. About 2000 young people across NSW will log onto Zoom on Friday to hear from activists and musician Jack River, enrol to vote and send emails to various ministers demanding greater investment in clean renewable energy, secure jobs and First Nations' solutions to protect Australia. Elsewhere across the country, nearly 40 COVID-safe actions have been organised. School Strike 4 Climate activists estimate that more than a total of 10,000 people will participate. In Melbourne, about 500 students are expected to tune into a Zoom event. But it will be a far cry from the 80,000-strong group that gathered in Sydney's CBD in 2019. Sydney rally organiser Natasha Abhayawickrama, 17, said the pandemic has forced organisers to think creatively about how to get their message across in a COVID-safe way. "You cannot recreate marching in street with tens of thousands of other people, but there will be small COVID-safe gatherings keeping up the pressure," she said. "The climate movement hasn't got as much traction as much as it did in 2019. "But I think the movement has taken the time to re-energise and upskill so that when we come out of the pandemic, and we are stronger than ever, we are going to be able to hold Morrison government to the highest level of accountability we can. The climate crisis is a timebomb." Standing alongside the students tomorrow will also be unions, First Nations communities and parents. Australia's education unions have thrown their support behind Friday's strike. "Students and young people are counting on us. Australia must take an ambitious pledge to the Glasgow COP26 Summit and work towards a safe, fair and prosperous future for young Australians," the joint- statement from the Australian Education Union, Independent Education Union and National Tertiary Education Union said. "Our three unions, representing nearly 300,000 education workers, support this urgent call from students for a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects, 100 per cent renewable energy by the end of the decade and the funding of a just transition for fossil fuel workers." Melbourne rally organiser Shuzhong Wu, 14, joined the strike movement last year after hearing about it on a podcast. "I want the government to take real climate action - the youth are rising, we will use our voting power and vote them out if they won't do anything," she said. "It's important to hold them accountable because it's our future they are putting on the line." Save the Children chief executive officer Paul Ronalds said although many of Friday's strike participants were too young to vote and influence climate policy, they had a different kind of power. "They have built a movement to demand change, and they should be heard," he said. The strike comes just before the COP26 summit in Glasgow with Prime Minister Scott Morrison still unclear as to whether he will attend. School students are preparing to hold events and continue campaigning via social media for stronger climate action during the summit. Ten-year-old Jonah, who survived the devastation of the black summer fires, said he is joining the strike because he worries about living through future climate disasters. "It doesn't feel right if Scott Morrison doesn't go to the big climate meeting next month," he said. "He needs to make a change because if he doesn't, a fire like that could happen again. Things could get way, way, way worse. I don't want a 50-degree Celsius Earth." \</doc>

\~\~Prime Minister Scott Morrison has reaffirmed as "absolute policy" the government's target of net-zero emissions by 2050 after a coalition candidate described the pledge as not binding. \~\~ Colin Boyce, the LNP candidate for the Queensland seat of Flynn, labelled the commitment "flexible" and noted "wiggle room" within it, a view Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce described as "completely understandable". \~\~ The comments prompted Labor to demand the prime minister clarify the government's position. \~\~ "Scott Morrison has a job to do today. Is net zero a firm commitment of the government? Or is it simply a flexible guideline as the candidate for Flynn has said?" opposition energy spokesman Chris Bowen told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday. \~\~ Mr Bowen said the coalition was saying one thing on climate change in seats such as Hinkler in Queensland, and another in Higgins in metropolitan Melbourne and Queens Park in eastern Sydney. \~\~ "They want to be on both sides of the stream - well they can?t be." \~\~ Mr Morrison claimed Mr Boyce was talking about the pathway to net zero, rather than the strength of the pledge. \~\~ "He wasn?t talking about the commitment itself, he has clarified that," he told reporters in Townsville. \~\~ "Our commitment to net zero by 2050 is a commitment of the Australian government that I made in Glasgow.

Global carbon emissions are set to surge back to near pre-pandemic levels, according to new research which has sparked fresh warnings about the need for urgent and sustained cuts to pollution. But a separate analysis has offered some hope in the climate fight, showing that global warming could be kept below 2 degrees if countries deliver on the promises which they've presented at the Glasgow climate summit. COP26 summit, it is a marked improvement on the 2.7 temperature rise trajectory which was forecast just weeks ago. World leaders including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison have now departed Scotland, leaving senior officials and ministers to negotiate a new global climate agreement over the coming week. Amid those negotiations, a new report has highlighted the scale of the task to bring down emissions to the level needed to contain global warming. Global emissions dropped 5.4 per cent in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic forced countries around the world into lockdown. MORE GLASGOW COVERAGE: Australia snubs coal pact Scott Morrison pledges more climate cash, but dodges new 2030 target Australia signs on to plan to halt deforestation by 2030 The new report from the Global Carbon Project shows that drop has proven to be temporary, with emissions set to increase almost 5 per cent in 2021. China's emissions are set to rise 4 per cent on 2020 levels, which would make it accountable for more than 30 per cent of global carbon pollution. Emissions in the US, EU and India are also expected to rise. The figures exclude international transport, including air travel. The researchers have warned that if emissions continued at 2021 levels, there was a 50 per chance that the 1.5 degree threshold would be breached in 2032. In order to reach net zero emissions by 2050, carbon pollution cuts at a similar scale to those during the pandemic would need to be replicated every year. "This highlights the scale of the action that is now required, and hence the importance of the COP26 Meanwhile, a separate report from research firm Climate Resource says pledges made at the summit have for the first time put the planet on a path to limiting global warming below 2 degrees this century. That marks a significant shift from just two weeks ago, when the UN's latest analysis of commitments made by signatories to the Paris Agreement predicted temperature rise could reach 2.7 degrees by the end of the century. The Climate Resource forecast is largely the result of policies announced since then by the world's largest emitters, China and India. India this week announced it would pursue net zero emissions by 2070, while China - whose president Xi Jinping didn't show up to Glasgow - made a modest update to its previous climate action commitments. China has promised that emissions will peak before 2030, en route to carbon neutrality before 2060. Back in Australia, The Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have flagged the global transition to lower emissions will have an impact on the economy, urging financial institutions to properly assess the underlying risk. In a statement on Thursday, both regulators claimed climate abatement policies would impact the value of certain assets and income streams, which will heighten financial stability risks.

There will, no doubt, be more than a touch of theatre to COP26 . It is true that with Xi Jinping and possibly Narendra Modi too busy rearranging their stamp collections to attend, the organisers might as well stage Waiting for Godot. But while Vladimir's weary admission in Godot that "I get used to the muck as I go along" perfectly encapsulates the numbness BoJo's big show elicits, it would be wrong to dismiss the event as just another display of performance art. After all, in the theatre, the play eventually ends, allowing normal life to resume. In contrast, for all of their hypocrisy, the commitments extracted at Glasgow will have enduring impacts as governments, pummelled by armies of angry activists, create rods for their own backs. Already, well-funded plaintiffs are clogging the world's courts demanding that governments meet emissions reductions targets set years ago; if Glasgow results in even more ambitious promises being legislated, as seems likely, the lawfare will only escalate, further reducing the ability of governments to balance costs and benefits in the face of enormous uncertainties about what is feasible and what isn't. The problem is that potentially reasonable policy objectives have degenerated into all-or-nothing slogans, such as "net zero", that are worthy imitators of Mr Micawber's much-ridiculed maxim: "Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, result happiness; annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery." And as if rampant Micawberism weren't bad enough, those slogans, along with climate change more generally, have acquired the status and motivating force of political myths. To say that is not to suggest that climate change is a fiction - political myths may mangle the facts, but they are not necessarily fables, fairytales or legends. Rather, they are narratives, often capable of being reduced to catchphrases, that galvanise political actors by investing an event, prediction or cause with cosmic significance, crowding out competing considerations. Those narratives' extraordinary effectiveness is hardly news. In the Republic, which was written 2400 years ago, Plato notoriously recommended myths to rulers as a means of enforcing social cohesion, while Pierre Bayle, the author of the monumental Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697), claimed that monarchs would find nothing that could better divert "unruly and inconstant" populaces from their real problems (or create more jobs for those he mockingly called "diviners") than apocalyptic projections and "vain imaginings". But a long line of eminent thinkers believed progress would relegate political myths to history's dustbin. For Francis Bacon, the "idola theatri" - the theatrical side of human affairs - would be swept away by science's forward march; David Hume argued that the delicate balancing of interests would replace tempestuous "enthusiasms" as the stuff of politics; and Max Weber, observing the triumph of bureaucracy, predicted that modern societies would be trapped in the "iron cage" of instrumental rationality, coldly and efficiently aligning means with ends. In reality, the opposite proved to be the case, with modernity allowing political myths to flourish as never before. Few scholars more astutely grasped that phenomenon than Ernst Cassirer, a great German philosopher who recoiled in horror from the wave of popular support for Nazism and communism. Four core features, Cassirer argued, characterised modern societies: the bewildering pace of change, which undermined traditional authority and fuelled anxieties about what lay ahead; rising education, which encouraged a predilection for new, abstract, ideas; the entry of "the masses" into politics; and the emergence of unprecedently powerful means of mass communications. As these features played themselves out, the demand would burgeon for myths that could project a coherent, if potentially terrifying, image of the future and motivate collective action to avert the worst and secure the best. That would, in turn, create the space for a new type of politician, little different from the magicians of old, to thrive by exploiting mass communications to meet that need. "To be sure," Cassirer wrote, "we no longer have the primitive kind of sortilege, we no longer observe the flight of birds nor inspect the entrails of animals"; instead "the new sorcerers" rely on "refined and elaborate methods that claim to be scientific". But with "prophecy an essential element in the new technique of rulership" and politicians morphing into "public fortune-tellers", the "most improbable or even impossible promises are made; the millennium is predicted over and over again". Writing in the late 1930s, Cassirer certainly didn't get everything right. For example, he expected political myths to become secular religions, like the all-encompassing ideologies of the 20th century; however, today's political myths typically limit themselves to telling a story about some of the conditions of existence, without aspiring to address the meaning of life in general. Forming an archipelago of extremisms, each myth takes an aspect of our concerns - race, gender, climate change - and elevates it into an absolute, as if all competing values had disappeared, and all trade-offs with them. But of course they haven't: which is why European politicians, while smugly proclaiming ever grander emissions reduction targets, are scrambling to subsidise families and businesses hit by the spiralling electricity and heating prices that are both those policies' inevitable result and the key to securing the abatement they purportedly seek. As one hand furiously offsets what the other aims to do, reason seems no closer to determining policy than it was in the days of Bayle and of his equally formidable sparring partner, Baruch Spinoza. Like Bayle, Spinoza doubted political myths would vanish any time soon. Yes, he observed in his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670-71), which proved to be one of the Enlightenment's defining works, it is possible to persuade people "by experience or ratiocination"; however, that requires "a long chain of arguments, as well as great care, acuteness, and self-restraint - qualities which are very rarely found". Far easier then to rely for their persuasive effects on the "beings of imagination", which "we are accustomed to feign", than on the complex and contestable "beings of reason". Rulers always had - and, Spinoza concluded, they always would. But if societies were inevitably governed by "the imaginary", where they differed is in the degree to which those imaginaries could be openly questioned. That, for Spinoza, was what political maturity meant, and what the Enlightenment could hope to achieve: not the disappearance of the dreams and nightmares, apocalypses and utopias, which were inherent in the human condition, but their taming by the nonsense-cleansing power of honest, untrammelled discussion and reasoned critique. It is those virtues that will be entirely absent from COP26 . Were Spinoza attending, 350 years after the publication of his epoch-defining text, he could only gasp and weep. \</doc>

It's been described as the world's "best last chance" to solve the climate crisis but there's many other reasons billions of people eagerly await the outcome of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland. Better known as COP26 (26th Conference of the Parties), or the Glasgow summit, the international climate change forum is the first to occur since the global pandemic began. After being called off last year, COP26 will mark more than five years since an historic agreement in Paris' COP21 was reached between countries to curb emissions, namely fossil fuels, by the middle of the century. Leaders will need to show what they've done since COP21 to limit rising global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius and set ambitious mid-term targets to achieve by 2030. But it will also be a chance for nation heads to discuss updated targets, following new evidence showing the rising urgency of climate change's impact. By the conference's end, it's hoped there will be a "Glasgow Agreement" that would set a higher bar for emissions reductions across the international community. What is the COP26 Glasgow summit and why are we having it? In 1995, in a freshly-reunited Berlin, the United Nations held its first conference of the parties that agreed to the Framework Convention on Climate Change - more commonly referred to as COP. It was a chance for countries around the world to come together and discuss the scientific warnings about a warming planet and what implications that might bring for the future. Fast forward 26 years and some of those warnings have now become reality. Each year since, bar 2020 due to a deadly global pandemic, COPs have been held to assess the impacts of climate change as the situation deteriorates and more recently, set out paths and targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The 26th summit in Glasgow, however, is particularly important. READ MORE: Scott Morrison's plan for net zero makes less sense the deeper you look Canberra's European ambassadors urge Australia to make stronger 2030 climate targets ahead of Glasgow summit Net zero: Emissions, low targets put Australia 'dead last' on climate action It will be the fifth conference since countries signed on to the momentous Paris Agreement at COP21. It marked the first legally-binding global treaty on climate change, which set out low but clear targets to curb emissions by 2050 and stop rising global temperatures. The Glasgow summit will be a chance to take stock of what countries have done since then to reach them. Richie Merzian, the climate change director at progressive public policy think tank The Australia Institute, said having more than a hundred world leaders join to discuss climate change showed how significant the next two weeks will be. "The ambition is that getting all the leaders in the same room means that you can actually have a serious conversation about everyone taking on more action," Mr Merzian said. Why is it considered the world's "best last chance" at climate action? While the 2015 Paris Agreement was promising forward momentum for global climate action, it was criticised for setting the bar on emissions reductions far too low. In the six years since, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), considered the global authority on the subject, has released two assessments and a special report on rising temperatures. The latter report, published in 2018, revealed an increase of just 1.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century was still possible. While no amount of average temperature rise was good news for the planet, the 1.5 degree target would reduce the chances of extreme weather and rising sea levels threatening human health and wellbeing. But to reach that, emissions would have to be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050. The race has since become even more urgent. The IPCC's report this year showed the 1.5-degree Celsius mark was expected to be reached or exceeded before 2040 - shaving a decade off earlier estimates. Which inevitably leads us to... How do Australia's plans stack up on the world stage? To put it bluntly, not great. Prime Minister Scott Morrison managed to wrangle out a net zero emissions target by 2050 after fierce debating within the Liberal Party and its Coalition junior partner, the Nationals. It means that Mr Morrison will take a goal to achieve net zero by 2050 that is not legally binding, won't cut fossil fuels, relies on unproven technologies and makes no changes to the existing 2030 target. Instead, Mr Morrison will tell the world stage Australia will "meet and beat" its promise to cut 26 to 28 per cent of emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels. Mr Merzian said Australia, which already has a bad reputation on climate change, will look like a national version of a coal lobby. "Australia's contribution to Glasgow is disappointing," Mr Merzian said. "The homework was clear - bring a new commitment for 2030. Australia has failed on that brief." The federal government has also ruled out reductions to methane emissions by 30 per cent at the decade's end - a pledge led by our "forever friend" US. To compare, the conservative British government has committed to cut emissions by 68 per cent by 2030. US President Joe Biden has brought the world superpower back into the treaty and pledged a 52 per cent cut. Mr Merzian said Australia's targets meant we were among climate conservative peers, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, who are also among the world's largest fossil fuel exporters. "If you compare Australia to developed, like-minded countries, then it's bringing one of the worst plans to the table," he said. "If Australia wants to become besties with Saudi, besties with Russia, then it's made the right moves." What happens after the summit ends? By mid-November, the world will hopefully have a plan. Country leaders and diplomats will return to their countries and get to work before doing it all again for next year's COP27 in Egypt. But in between the COPs, monitoring will occur to ensure countries are remaining on target. "Then there'll be another COP and another one, and another one, because we're not solving climate change now at the speed that we need," Mr Merzian said. "So we'll have to keep grinding because as the UK says, it's the best last opportunity." \</doc>

\~\~ - Global coalition of more than 90 wind energy companies and associations releases COP26 Manifesto calling on governments to take eight concrete steps to get to net zero. \~\~ - Annual wind installations need to scale up by four times current levels to reach net zero by 2050; current projections will provide less than half what is needed. \~\~ - Signatories include largest companies in the sector including Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, Goldwind, Mingyang, Nordex-Acciona, Iberdrola, ENEL, SSE, Orsted, EDP Renovables, Equinor, Mainstream Renewable Power, Green Investment Group and DNV, as well as industry associations from Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America and Africa, including China, USA, India and the UK. \~\~ - The world needs decisive action to combat the climate emergency. The wind industry has the tools available to achieve ambitious targets like a fourfold increase in the amount of wind energy deployed globally - this manifesto asks governments to help the wind industry get there. \~\~\~\~The wind energy sector has released a manifesto at the BNEF London summit calling on governments to "get serious" about the energy transition and work with the private sector to rapidly scale up wind and renewable energy installations. \~\~ Wind energy is one of the fastest growing energy sources in the world, with a record 93GW of installations in 2020. However, current growth rates are falling behind a net zero trajectory and will only put us on-track for 43% of the wind capacity required by 2050, according to leading international energy institutions IRENA and the IEA. To get on-track, annual wind energy installations worldwide must quadruple within the next decade. More than 90 of the world's leading wind energy companies, led by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), including manufacturers, supply chain actors, investors and industry bodies from around the world have united to support this Manifesto. The eight actions being called for include: \~\~ 1. Increase wind power ambition and reflect this in updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), comprehensive national climate strategies and long-term energy plans. 2. Commit to rapid phase out of coal-based generation now. 3. Design and implement energy markets for the future. 4. Implement streamlined and sensible permitting schemes for renewable energy projects to accelerate deployment and minimise project attrition. 5. Initiate plans to rapidly build out clean energy grids and charging stations for electric vehicles. 6. Develop cohesive and inclusive policies which dedicate public resource to the people-centred shift to a net zero economy. 7. Align national and regional finance flows with benchmarks for a net zero, 1.5 degrees C-compliant pathway. 8. Advance voluntary cooperation on carbon pricing under articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris agreement. \~\~ The renewables industry is already delivering decarbonisation of the global power sector. Wind power helps the world avoid 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually and already provides more than 1.2 millions jobs around the world, while transforming economies and communities for good. \~\~ But the industry requires supportive policy frameworks to grow more rapidly. The Manifesto urges governments to work with industry to enact a shift in energy and economic policymaking to a "climate emergency" approach. \~\~ "This Manifesto sets out the meaningful actions that governments need to carry out to realise the energy transition. Governments need to aim higher and deeper - updating their NDCs to drive real change, cutting red tape and streamline permitting proceedures, and supporting vital investments in infrastructure. The recent volatility in global energy markets shows the importance of moving decisively to phase out of coal and other fossil fuel based generation and create energy markets which are fit for purpose for a clean and sustainable future." \~\~ Rebecca Williams, Director of COP26 at GWEC, commented: "We already have the tools and the technology we need to tackle climate change. What we don't have yet is the unprecedented political will we need to make this happen. \~\~ "Our Manifesto sets out eight clear actions policymakers and governments must take to seize the vast economic, environmental and social opportunities that wind energy provides, helping meet NDCs and achieve sustainable growth. World leaders gathering in Glasgow next month have a chance to get serious about driving the new era of renewable energy, not stifling it." \~\~ About GWEC GWEC is a member-based organization that represents the entire wind energy sector. The members of GWEC represent over 1,500 companies, organizations and institutions in more than 80 countries, including manufacturers, developers, component suppliers, research institutes, national wind and renewables associations, electricity providers, finance and insurance companies.

Teenage activist Greta Thunberg has labelled the ongoing global climate talks in Glasgow "a failure", and branded the event as "a global north greenwash festival," as rallies take place across the city. Students skipped school on Friday to join\~the high-profile campaigner in a youth-led rally outside the major UN climate change conference, with thousands demanding greater action from world leaders. The crowd marched across the city of Glasgow in a colourful protest, chanting "what do we want, climate justice", while delegates continued official talks at the summit just streets away. The rally stretched hundreds of metres forcing major roads to shut down, and eventually packed George Square, where activists called on the conference to deliver more for young people. "They have had 26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah  and where has that got us?" Ms Thunberg asked the exuberant crowd. She said "the leaders are doing nothing", and it was time to hold them accountable. "It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo," Ms Thunberg said. "We don't need any more empty promises  [or] commitments that are full of loopholes." Gudanji-Wakaja woman Rikki Dank, one of a contingent of Australians who joined the protest, said she had travelled across the world to put the issues her community faces on the global stage. "I'm here in Glasgow to raise awareness about fracking in my country and the effects that that has," she said. She\~hoped\~those in power were paying attention to the large turnout, and their desire for more progressive action. "The world's political leaders need to start listening to what's happening, start taking notice and start taking action," she said. Glasgow resident\~Ayla Shields, 17, skipped school to join the demonstration. "We don't really have the power to change anything like world leaders do  we hope we can kind of encourage them to do it [with this protest]," she said. Some young people were invited to the conference to represent the interests of their generation.\~ Arctic iceberg\~left to melt Another creative demonstration\~in the city featured a 4-tonne Greenland\~iceberg sent to Glasgow to melt outside the summit. Gail Whiteman, the founder of Arctic Basecamp, said the\~block of ice was a reminder of the climate crisis\~taking place in the Arctic region. She said the iceberg was brought in a "carbon-offset" cargo ship.\~ "The Arctic is in crisis and that's not just bad news for the polar bear ... it's bad news for countries and societies everywhere,"\~Professor Whiteman said. "If we lose the snow and ice in the Arctic we will amplify global warming by 25 to 40 per cent. "It is one eco-region that packs a big punch and we felt that negotiators here had to actually come face to face with the Arctic so we brought the iceberg." Doctors also staged a protest against fossil-fuel finance outside\~JP Morgan's Glasgow office. Meanwhile, the British president of COP26 , Alok Sharma, said the summit needed to secure more ambitious commitments in the coming days. "It is not possible for a large number of unresolved issues to continue into week two," Mr Sharma said in a note published by the United Nations. The conference will continue over the weekend and into next week, though most world leaders have already left. \</doc>

Six candidates have already put their hands up to contest the Federal seat of Hume at this year's Federal election. Mr Morrison is expected to set an election date this week, probably by the time you pick up your Boorowa News this week. More so than previous elections, 2022 is shaping up to be a real battle with incumbent MP Angus Taylor facing a challenge from Independent Penny Ackery in addition to the traditional Labor opposition in the form of Greg Baines. Whilst the Coalition has held the seat since 1974, recent date from poll agency Community Engagement showed support for Liberal party candidate and incumbent Hume MP Angus Taylor had dropped by 21.7 per cent - from 53.3 per cent to 31.6 per cent. Additionally the poll showed that almost half (49.4 per cent) of the Hume voters surveyed did not feel confident that Mr Taylor had put the interests of the community above his own personal or business interests. Lt's take a quick look at who will be vying for your vote later this year. Angus Taylor - Liberal Party The incumbent and holder of Hume since 2013, picking up 53.3 per cent of the first preference vote in 2019. Mr Taylor is a prominent member of the Morrison government. He is Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction and was involved in Australia's delegation to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. He will likely campaign on the positives of the Federal Government's pandemic response. Greg Baines - Australian Labor Party Mr Baines was unveiled as the Labor candidate at a fundraising function at the Astor Hotel in February. Hailing from Gunning, Mr Baines is a school teacher and has told voters he was inspired to run after disapproving of the Government's pandemic response. He will also campaign on climate change like his 2019 predecessor Aoife Champion. Penny Ackery - Independent Ms Ackery has run a loud campaign so far and has focused her attention on Mr Taylor, calling for a change in how the electorate is represented. The semi-retired secondary school teacher of 36 years lives on a Goulburn district property. She has worked with young people with special needs and developing special education programs during her career. Garry Dollin - United Australia Party Hailing from The Oaks, the father of four has spent the past 20 years in the aquaculture sector. continued on page 7 \</doc>

Deal fails amid activism TENNIS Australia was lobbied by climate activists in the lead- up to a deal being scrapped for Santos to be the Australian Open's "official gas partner". The agreement, quietly ended sometime last year just one year into a three-year deal, is understood to have ended mutually for several reasons, including Tennis Australia being lobbied by climate protesters. The company and Tennis Australia had been under pressure after a campaign was launched by a Sydney-based climate activist group, 350 Australia, calling on the tournament to end the sponsorship agreement. It is understood there were others issues that contributed to the deal collapsing. The petition, which received more than 7600 signatures and was sent to TA chief executive Craig Tiley, claimed the tennis tournament was letting Santos "sportswash" its image. In a statement issued on Sunday, 350 Australia chief executive Lucy Manne said TA should be "congratulated" for ending the association with Santos. Ms Manne indicated she would extend the group's activism to other sporting events supported by Santos. A Tennis Australia statement announcing the deal in February highlighted Santos's commitment to being part of the solution to a lower-carbon future. "With the aim of being a world-leading fuels company, Santos has set an ambitious target of net-zero emissions by 2040," the statement read. Santos has made big inroads in carbon mitigation. COP26 climate change conference, which was held in Glasgow last year. Santos has signed a $220m deal for the Moomba carbon capture and storage project, a model of which was on display at the COP26 summit. Each year the company will pump 1.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into reservoirs that once held gas. Santos declined to comment on Sunday. Tennis Australia was contacted for comment. \</doc>

Documentaries about the climate crisis are often illustrated with spectacular satellite images of forest fires, hurricanes and flooded landscapes. People around the world weather these conditions with little control over how their experiences are recorded and represented. Our project, HYPERLINK https://open-weather.community/ open-weather , offers the tools and knowledge to change that. On the first day of HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/cop26-80762 COP26 (the latest UN climate change conference in Glasgow) our network of 29 volunteers captured a collective image of Earth by tuning into transmissions from three orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. We did this using DIY satellite ground stations made up of radio antennae plugged into laptops. Each member of the group recorded a satellite image as well as what they could feel and observe of the weather on the ground. Across 14 countries and six continents, the network recorded a total of 38 images which, when stitched together onto a map, produced a HYPERLINK https://cop26-nowcast.open-weather.community/ snapshot of the planet This snapshot included a cyclonic weather system curling around the UK, dust clouds sweeping the Indian subcontinent, and the glaciers of the Patagonian Andes, which have been shown by geographer HYPERLINK http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/glacier-recession/shrinking-patagonian-glaciers/ Bethan Davies to be rapidly receding and thinning in response to global warming. How to take your own satellite images Receiving images from the public data broadcast of NOAA satellites is something anyone can learn how to do. All you need is a basic V-shaped antenna, a device called a dongle, and one of many free software programmes, like HYPERLINK https://cubicsdr.com/ CubicSDR . The antenna and dongle together cost around \£350 (US$66). Now you're ready to launch your DIY satellite ground station. First, use a HYPERLINK https://www.n2yo.com/ free online tool to track satellite orbits overhead, then find somewhere outdoors with a clear view of the sky. Connect the antenna to your laptop using the dongle and tune it to a specific frequency using the software. Position the antenna so that the tip of the V points north, and the arms of the V are parallel to the ground as a NOAA satellite passes overhead. Your antenna captures the satellite's unique radio transmission and sends it to your laptop, where the software transforms the signal into a sound. The sound can be decoded into two images received by the satellite as it passed over you. The first is composed of mostly visible light reflecting off the surface of the Earth, the second is made of infrared radiation - invisible electromagnetic waves emitted by the land, sea and clouds. The way you position your antenna and even your body are recorded in the image as signal and noise. This means each image is unique to the person and place that created it. Open-weather was founded in April 2020 out of a desire to open up this practice to non-specialists. We published a series of HYPERLINK how-to guides and HYPERLINK https://publiclab.org/notes/sashae/06-21-2021/diy-satellite-ground-station-workshop hosted workshops in different countries. We also HYPERLINK https://cop26-nowcast.open-weather.community/ created artworks in collaboration with design studio HYPERLINK https://rectangle.design/ Rectangle , and commissioned by The Photographers' Gallery in London. As a result, a network of amateur satellite image decoders has begun to form around the world. Here's what they captured while world leaders were gathered in Glasgow for COP26 . The climate crisis in a snapshot For their part in the project, cartographer and marine technician Joaqu\'edn Ezcurra and journalist Aim\'e9e Juhazs travelled to Parque Nacional Ciervo de los Pantanos in Argentina - a wetland at risk from climate change. It was "a day of unexpected low temperatures" after the arrival of the cold sudestada wind, Ezcurra and Juhazs wrote in their field notes. They added that "communities living in the delta of the Paran\'e1 River in Argentina are suffering dearly from both low levels of water, and increasing numbers of fires during the winter dry season". Ankit Sharma, a mechanical engineering student in Mumbai, India, submitted a trio of images covering the vast region from the Persian Gulf to the Himalayas. During the second satellite pass, he noted: "My laptop had a layer of dust on it ... heavy pollution was felt". "The pattern of cloud [reflects] the beauty of the nature", wrote radio amateur Yoshi Matsuoka in Atsugi Kanagawa, Japan. He noted, too, that the region had had "extreme torrential rain". Many contributors wrote about their experiences of exceptional rainfall. "Weather systems are getting tougher and tougher to predict", and so too is knowing "what to plant, where to plant, and when to plant", wrote Natasha Honey, a farmer in New South Wales, Australia. In Glasgow, not far from the COP26 conference venue, artist and curator Alison Scott commented: "Climate change is felt ... in a lack of public transport resilience; in bike lanes being opened (and closed) ... in the corporate hijacking of COP26 and the city's unpreparedness for its scale; in the erosion of rogue-landlord-ed sandstone tenement buildings in need of retro-fitting. It is felt in the history of the place." "The sun dominates", wrote artist C\'e9drick Tshimbalanga in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Before, "the rainy season was alive and rain was abundant, and during the dry season, it was much colder". Zack Wettstein, a doctor in Seattle, Washington, received a satellite transmission during a "cold, dry, autumn morning, with no wind in sight ... in stark contrast to the weather of the past week, when we were struck with an atmospheric river of rain from a bomb cyclone off the Pacific". He added: "As a physician working in the emergency department, I see patients affected by these hazards wrought by climate change ... with injuries, illness and exacerbations of their underlying disease". We received a surprise contribution from Barfrost in Kirkenes, Norway, who imaged the cartographic North Pole and noted that "southern insects [are surviving] the winter". These satellite images and field notes demonstrate that the climate crisis feels different depending on who you are and where you live. In some places, dry seasons are expanding. Elsewhere, it's clouds of dust, increasingly volatile storms, or health effects triggered by the air that we breathe. As politicians fail to respond to the climate emergency, a growing community of Earth-watchers has practical and political potential. Together, we might learn to be collectively responsible for, and accountable to, the environments we are changing. For more images, field notes and how-to guides, visit our website.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed\~he will attend the\~United Nations COP26 \~international climate conference in Glasgow in November. The announcement followed HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-27/scott-morrison-decision-co26-climate-conference-glasgow/100493884 weeks of uncertainty about whether or not he would go in person , and\~ongoing negotiations with the National Party about committing to net zero emission by 2050. Mr Morrison said the government's position on net zero would be outlined before he left for the conference. His decision to join global leaders in Glasgow is his strongest indication yet that the government is likely to adopt the target. Earlier this year, Mr Morrison said the government's goal was to reach net zero as soon as possible, "preferably" by 2050. The Prime Minister had been urged to attend the conference by other world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden  who are both attending. More recently, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-12/prince-charles-scott-morrison-climate-change-cop26/100531092 Prince Charles also joined the calls A draft plan to meet the net zero target was put to Cabinet during the week. The next step is for it to go through both the Liberal and National party rooms separately, before a joint meeting of both the party rooms before it is formally adopted. The plan may also outline an interim 2030 emissions target as well. The Nationals party room will meet on Sunday to discuss the target, with some senior members flagging they want assurances the plan will not come at the cost of jobs in regional Australia. More to come. \</doc>

Welcome to Climate fight: the world's biggest negotiation , an expert's guide to the UN climate talks in Glasgow from HYPERLINK The Anthill Podcast As hosts of COP26 https://ukcop26.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/COP26-Explained.pdf step up efforts to mobilise public and private sources of financial aid. Developed countries agreed to raise US$100 billion a year by 2020. The most recent data only goes up to https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm 2019 , but it shows that just under US$80 billion was raised that year. "It's likely that we will continue to see consistent growth in climate finance mobilised over the last decade," according to Alina Averchenkova, distinguished policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, London School of Economics and Political Science. But as for meeting the 2020 target, "Our assessment was that we're likely to come up short." This is a big problem. Climate finance is supposed to help countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique, which are among the world's poorest and most vulnerable to climate change, weather stronger storms and droughts. Since fossil fuels powered the extraction of wealth from these countries over centuries, there's arguably a moral obligation for developed nations to help poorer countries develop sustainably by transferring money and green technology. Failing to deliver the necessary aid on time could push the goal of net zero global emissions by 2050 out of reach, and fatally undermine faith in the world's effort to stem climate change. But developed countries must do more than simply meet the target. Thanks to the reporting of Maryam Charles, we'll hear from two residents of Zanzibar about why some climate finance can leave people feeling worse off. Some projects funded through climate finance end up depriving local people of an income, such as mangrove forest protection in Tanzania that can deny people access to a natural resource they rely on, says Jessica Omukuti, COP26 Fellow in Climate Finance at the University of York and a research fellow on inclusive net zero at the University of Oxford. "At the international level ... there's really very little thought about what 20 square miles of mangroves means for a [Tanzanian] household," Omukuti says. Frustration with the UNFCCC process for remedying loss and damage due to climate change is driving some people to seek compensation by other means - by suing the states and companies most responsible for the crisis. Harpreet Kaur Paul, a PhD candidate in climate justice at the University of Warwick, says that "if domestic courts start finding corporations which disproportionately contributed to the crisis have responsibilities to redress them", it may make developed countries at COP26 "come to a political agreement about meeting financing needs".

Editorial Friday's announcement that the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, will definitely be attending next month's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is the clearest evidence yet the Liberals believe they are on the cusp of striking a deal with the Nationals over a net-zero-by-2050 emissions target. It would be inconceivable, after all the speculation about Australia's likely position and the PM's reluctance to commit to Glasgow, for him to turn up empty handed. While other world leaders, including Boris Johnson and Joe Biden, have been prepared to cut Mr Morrison some slack while he gets the minor party on board, that was never going to last forever. If the Prime Minister were to go Glasgow with nothing more in his backpack than a "preference" for net zero by 2050 and our already inadequate 2030 targets he would get a mauling from the global media and from the leaders of many other nations. It's a fair bet that both France and China would welcome the opportunity to lead a pile-on - though Xi Jinping won't be in the room. Mr Morrison's decision comes after a remarkable week on the climate change front here and overseas. Both Prince Charles and the Queen, usually extremely wary of becoming involved in the domestic politics of any nation, expressed concern about his possible absence from Glasgow. And, on Thursday, prominent Australian businessman and green hydrogen advocate, Andrew Forrest, used his National Press Club address to urge the Liberals to go it alone on net zero - thereby risking a Coalition split - if the Nationals won't sign up. He also took aim at renewable energy sceptic Bridget McKenzie and said he had recently spoken to Barnaby Joyce about the issue. Mr Forrest had literally put his money where his mouth was earlier in the week when he backed plans by both the NSW and Qld governments to develop multi-billion dollar "green hydrogen hubs". His comments came on the same day Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle warned Australia risked a "capital strike" by foreign investors if it did not do more. It echoed remarks made by the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in a speech last month. "We cannot run the risk that markets falsely assume we are not transitioning in line with the rest of the world," he said. While the Prime Minister's shift towards net zero by 2050 is as welcome as it is overdue it should not be allowed to overshadow the fact that the debate has moved on in recent months with 2030 emerging as a possible tipping point. Australia's current targets, set as part of the Paris Agreement during the Abbott era, are manifestly inadequate and are in need of urgent revision - particularly given many analysts say we are already on track to exceed them despite a lack of federal government leadership. The NSW government's recent commitment to a 50 per cent reduction by the end of the decade would be an excellent place to start. ISSUE: 39,697 \</doc>

Washington| US President Joe Biden might be jetting half his Cabinet to the climate change HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/topic/glasgow-summit-1nsz summit in Glasgow next week, but he knows team USA will resemble a pack of injured footballers with a crucial away game to play when they arrive. Start with the head coach. Biden was betting on HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/energy-tensions-rise-in-washington-as-glasgow-looms-20211015-p5906q a $US150 billion Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) in the much-debated $US3.5 trillion reconciliation bill However, the CEPP - effectively the early stages of a carbon price - was all but scotched last week when key moderate Senator Joe Manchin conditioned his backing on the inclusion of carbon capture as an accepted mitigation technology. Late last week Biden's deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had to fend off questions about how team Biden could still achieve his lofty climate goals after having lost Congressional support for the CEPP. She referenced a report from the New York-based public policy outfit Rhodium Group that said the key CEPP program would now, after months of debate, not even be needed to achieve the administration's emissions reduction goals. "This independent analysis lays out a path to the President's climate goal without a CEPP in place. What we're saying is we don't need Congress. We can do it without Congress," she repeated. Instead of relying on the CEPP, the administration could reduce emissions by shifting towards electric vehicles, phasing out super pollutants such as HFCs, and making substantial across-government investments in clean energy technologies such as offshore wind and solar, to name but a few. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry will be fronting Biden's Cabinet team in Glasgow. They'll be there to explain how the country will realistically hit its goals of further reducing emissions by 2030. But they are all under pressure. Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm has been scrambling for solutions to rapidly rising energy and petrol prices in the US. These have raised questions about whether team Biden has gone too hard, too early, on curtailing fossil fuel exploration and production. Granholm late last week did not rule out a ban on crude oil exports to keep US energy prices down. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Glasgow. He, too, has been feeling the heat in Europe over the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/us-congress-gives-overwhelming-support-to-aukus-20210923-p58u31 AUKUS military intelligence deal, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/middle-east/biden-s-administration-in-turmoil-as-americans-killed-in-kabul-20210827-p58mck Kabul fell to the Taliban.

Despite all this, Seth Schultz, chief executive of climate change advocacy group The Resilience Shift, said that while Congress might not have helped, the Biden administration's green credentials are still intact. "I don't think there's going to be a lot that Biden is going to be able to announce at COP26 . Its terrifying," Mr Schultz said, "But do I think his credentials have suffered? No, I think anybody who looks at this understands he's put together one of the most ambitious plans ever, and he is still trying to champion that." Biden's rhetoric on climate change leadership has no doubt played well across the world, but locker room motivational speeches can only go so far. He and his team need to deliver results. As US founding father Benjamin Franklin once said: "Well done is better than well said." \</doc>

A week out from the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, all eyes are on two nations: China and the United States. Together, the superpowers are responsible for HYPERLINK https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions more than 40% of global carbon emissions. US-China relations have been fractious in recent years, and whether they can cooperate on climate action is crucial to success at COP26 and beyond. US progress on climate change went backwards under the Trump administration, but President Joe Biden has brought the nation back to the table. Biden wants to cooperate with China in this critical policy sphere, raising hopes of a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/trumps-trade-war-what-was-it-good-for-not-much-147247 less adversarial bilateral relationship.

Fork in the road Under a HYPERLINK https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3826681 constructive scenario, the US and China would compete to ramp up their investments in clean energy, advance their technological capabilities and build internationally competitive industries. They would also compete to help emerging countries reduce their emissions. China and the US would both seek to prove the superiority of their respective governance models by making rapid progress on climate change. In other words, does China's party-state, quasi-Communist model offer the most desirable path forward? Or is the US model of democratic capitalism the better option? By contrast, destructive competition between the US and China would have dire consequences for the climate. First, it would make the international flow and diffusion of green technologies difficult. For example, the US controls advanced semiconductor technologies required for electric vehicles (EVs) while China is leading the world in EV battery technologies. If the nations began restricting tech exports to each other, advancement in electric vehicles would significantly slow.

With a reduced market size, new climate technologies and products would then take longer to become affordable, slowing their global uptake. Second, an effective system for global climate governance requires most nations, if not all, to participate. Yet, without trust between the US and China, such a system would be untenable.

\~\~ - New Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC) signals tourism's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions - Global sector figures join the STGC conversation at COP26 - from former state presidents to leading institutions - STGC aims for greater collaboration between public and private tourism sectors to help reach net-zero, protect nature and support communities \~\~\~\~A new coalition will accelerate tourism's transition to net zero, audiences at COP26 heard today. Ministers from major tourism destinations and leaders from international organizations have voiced their support to achieve a sustainable travel and tourism industry, through the Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC). \~\~ The STGC is a multi-country, multi-stakeholder coalition established to lead, accelerate, and track the tourism industry's transition to net-zero emissions, as well as drive action to protect nature and support communities. \~\~ The tourism industry is highly fragmented, with developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) being most reliant on tourism for their economies. More than 40 million tourism businesses - or 80 percent of the whole industry - are small or medium sized. The STGC aims to support people and the planet by reforming tourism's contribution to climate change, in a bid to protect the environment and support those who need it most. \~\~ At a special session on the future of the STGC at COP26 , His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism of Saudi Arabia, was joined by former President of Mexico and Chair of New Climate Economy, and the World Resources Institute, Felipe Calderon; David Livingston, Senior Advisor, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and other leaders. \~\~ The Center's strategy will be shaped by a coalition of governments, international organizations, academia, multilateral and financing institutions and industry associations. \~\~ The countries invited to be part of this important coalition in phase one, are the UK, USA, France, Japan, Germany, Kenya, Jamaica, Morocco, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. These countries have prioritized climate, tourism and SMEs which will allow for synergies for this important initiative. \~\~ The top organizations that will help to shape the center and provide the services in phase one are WRI (World Resource Institute), UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), ICC (International Chamber of Commerce), WTTC (World Travel and Tourism Council), World Bank, and SYSTEMIQ. In addition to Harvard University, which will provide support to the STGC through research and capacity-building, while the UNFCCC will guide the Center to accelerate industry action on climate neutrality. \~\~ The Center will deliver services and products across three core pillars, including knowledge creation and sharing, measurement and monitoring, and industry enablement. Across these pillars, the STGC will focus on at least in nine areas of industry support, including developing standards and resource provision for the tourism sector, capability building, and project funding and investment. \~\~ The Center will be headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and plans to open regional offices in other countries, with a strong multilingual online presence. \~\~ Other countries and organizations will be invited to join in phase two. In addition, a group of global experts in tourism and climate is being assembled to support this important effort. \~\~ His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism, Saudi Arabia, said: "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the world the interconnectedness of humanity and nature, and the fragility of communities dependent on tourism to external shocks. We must act now to make the industry and local communities far more resilient and to help solve the challenge of climate change. That requires engaging with business, governments, and international organizations to accelerate action. Saudi Arabia is committed to contributing to this critical effort." \~\~ President Felipe Calderon, Former President of Mexico and Chairman, World Resources Institute, said: \~\~ "We share this initiative with global leaders who joined our mission to make tourism a lever toward achieving the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. There is a window of opportunity for business and governments to come together to drive these critical objectives, and the STGC will serve as a 'north star' to achieve this mission." \~\~ Hon. Edmund Bartlett, Minister of Tourism of Jamaica, said: "The Government of Jamaica, as a Small Island Developing State and vulnerable economy, remains committed to resilience building for sustainable development, including through sustainable tourism. In this regard, Jamaica welcomes the opportunity to partner with the Sustainable Tourism Global Center to contribute to and benefit from this collaborative effort to secure a better planet for future generations." \~\~ Janet Rogan. United Kingdom COP Regional Ambassador for Middle East and Africa, said: "We are proud to be hosting COP26 . Humanity has run down the clock on climate change. It is now time to take action. Tourism is a key sector that supports jobs and growth and we are pleased to be part of this important new initiative to accelerate the sector's transition to net zero." \~\~ Her Excellency Fatim-Zahra Ammor, Minister of Tourism, Handicrafts and Social Economy Morocco said: "Under the guidance of his Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God bless him, The Kingdom of Morocco made sustainability one of the main pillars of its former sectorial strategies as well as its new development model. During the last two years, the whole world has been severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and tourism is one of the most affected sectors. It is crucial to join our efforts to build and co-design a sustainable recovery plan related to travel and tourism activities. The Sustainable Tourism Global Center is an important step towards this goal." \~\~ Hon. Najib Balala, Cabinet Secretary of Tourism and Wildlife, Kenya said: "As one of Africa's most popular destinations for international visitors, Kenya has felt the full impact of the global tourism downturn as a result of the pandemic. We therefore agree that there is an urgent need for a new sustainable approach to global tourism. Along with our recently launched Wildlife Strategy 2030 which will ensure a thriving natural ecosystem under pressure from climate change, we are strong supporters of the Sustainable Tourism Global Center." \~\~ Her Excellency Maria Reyes Maroto, Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Spain said: " COP26 \~\~ Julia Simpson, World Travel & Tourism Council President and CEO, said: "At a time where leadership is most needed to address the climate emergency, we commend Saudi Arabia's initiative that will support the sector to achieve the global goals and ensure a sustainable future. WTTC is delighted to contribute to the Center through its unique data, research and expertise from businesses across the globe." \~\~ John W. H. Denton AO, International Chamber of Commerce Secretary General, said: "I applaud the - multi-country and multi-stakeholder effort - to accelerate sustainability within the global tourism sector. Given the impacts of COVID-19 on the strength of the sector, partnerships will be vital to ensure small tourism operators can genuinely build back better -- and become a powerful force for local communities and our planet. \~\~ "The International Chamber of Commerce - as the institutional representative of more than 45 million companies in over 100 countries and as official UNFCCC Focal Point for Business and Industry - looks forward to supporting the development of the Hub in the coming months -- and to connecting its work with our global business network, in particular the millions of small businesses in the tourism sector." \~\~ Gloria Guevara, Chief Special Advisor to HE Ahmed Al Khateeb, said: "The tourism sector has been through so much throughout this pandemic and combined with the urgency of a response to climate change, it needs a global solution. SMEs in our sector - like a travel agency or tour operator - might not know their carbon footprint and how to contribute to the race to zero. Every time we go on holiday, we create jobs and reduce poverty, it would be great if we reach a point that the more, we go on holiday, the better it is for the planet. The multi-country, multi-stakeholder coalition will bring tourism's fragmented stakeholders together and provide knowledge to drive action now." \~\~ Dr. Ramon Sanchez, Principal Investigator, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University, said: "To create a truly sustainable global tourism industry, all community, business, and government stakeholders require the tools, frameworks, and best practices necessary to contribute to reaching this objective. The team at Harvard is excited to collaborate with the STGC on research that will play a critical role in building the foundation and driving the industry toward net-zero". \~\~ Jeremy Oppenheim, founder, SYSTEMIQ, a global advisory and investment firm which specialises in Paris Agreement-aligned sectoral transformations and is supporting the STGC, said: "The STGC aims to bring together the many tourism-related sectors - aviation, hospitality, transport and catering services - into a world-class, multi-stakeholder coalition that can help transform the industry especially SMEs, from one that generates 8% of global greenhouse emissions to one that is a driver of a net-zero, regenerative world." \~\~ Niclas Svenningsen, Manager for Global Climate Action - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change "Tourism is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change and one of the sectors that has most to contribute with to the 2030 sustainable development agenda. Climate action offers a win-win opportunity to recover economies, communities and countries in a sustainable and climate friendly fashion." \~\~ Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1678329/STGC_1.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1678329/STGC_1.jpg Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1678330/STGC_2.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1678330/STGC_2.jpg \~\~ Source: Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC) ASIANET \</doc>

Glasgow | COP26 host Britain has warned of "a mountain to climb" if the 197 countries in Glasgow are to make a meaningful dent in climate change, as an authoritative climate report revealed the extent of the summit's shortfall. COP26 president Alok Sharma, a British cabinet minister, will on Wednesday (AEDT) issue a draft text of the "cover decision" - a summary of what the conference has agreed and achieved - on which negotiators will rapidly consult with their home governments. The summit is supposed to conclude at 6pm on Friday (5am Saturday AEDT), but is likely to go at least 24 hours past that deadline as countries wrangle over finance, targets and reporting rules. "The time has now come to find political consensus on the areas of divergence, and we only have a few days left," Mr Sharma told a press conference, as he demanded "greater urgency" and "all hands on deck". "What we have committed to gets some way, but certainly not all the way, to keeping 1.5 Celsius within reach." The summit is aiming to get countries to make enough commitments and pledges on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and reaching net-zero by 2050, such that global warming is kept below the potentially catastrophic level of 1.5C. But a seminal report from Climate Action Tracker, released on Wednesday AEDT at the summit, looked at countries' formal COP commitments and calculated that greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would still be twice as high as necessary to stay below 1.5C. Based on countries' 2030 emissions-reduction targets, global warming would still reach 2.4C by 2100, while the settings in place today would allow warming of 2.7C. First real test "It's all very well for leaders and governments to claim they have a net zero target, but if they don't have plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are not aligned to net zero, then frankly these net zero targets are just paying lip service to real climate action," said Australian scientist Bill Hare, the CEO of report co-author Climate Analytics. He said "the whole point of Glasgow" was that it was the first real test of whether the 2015 Paris Agreement would force countries to ratchet up their ambitions as required. "Glasgow at this stage has a big credibility gap," he said. Niklas Hohne, CEO of report co-author NewClimate Institute, said "not a single country" had policies in place to reach their own net zero targets. "All countries have to go back and rethink what they can do. The only way they can do that is to go into emergency mode," he told a press conference in Glasgow. "Countries must acknowledge this gap and come back next year, then next year and then next year, with even more ambitious short-term actions, not only long-term promises." Britain is pushing for the "cover decision" to include a commitment to keeping global warming to within 1.5C. But even an ambition as vague as this is unlikely to get past the opposition of countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. The decision is taken by consensus, and many countries are wary that Britain's campaign could end up reopening the text of the Paris Agreement itself. The likely landing zone is an agreement that countries will look to keep 1.5C "within reach". Negotiators will also wrangle intensively in coming days over whether targets have to be renegotiated and ratcheted up at COP every year, replacing the Paris Agreement's five-year cycle. Many developing nations are using the Climate Action Tracker report to demand that countries set more specific and stretchy goals for 2030, rather than hiding behind vague and distant 2050 targets. "We have to focus on increasing 2030 ambition - 2030 is the cliff-edge," said Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege, who leads a negotiating group called the High Ambition Coalition. "This is not the time, not that it ever is ... for a lowest common denominator approach to these negotiations." Down in the weeds, progress has been made on some outstanding disagreements from the Paris rule book. There is growing optimism, for example, that countries will agree on a mechanism to trade carbon offsets between themselves. That would open the way for huge market growth in carbon trading on a roughly level playing field. Meanwhile, Australia, the US and Europe are hoping to get China and other holdouts to agree to rules requiring more transparent country-by-country reporting of progress towards meeting national targets. "The world needs confidence that we will shift immediately to implementation, that pledges here will be delivered, and that the policies and investment will swiftly follow," Mr Sharma said. There will be a push to fudge the transparency rules - which could hurt the chances of a renewed push on the issue at future COPs. The outcome on transparency lies in the hands of New Zealand's Climate Change Minister, James Shaw. He and his Antiguan counterpart have been asked to knock heads together and find a way through - which will involve promising more money to poorer countries to help them comply. More broadly, the developing world is also holding out for more pledges of financial support from rich countries, which prompted a fractious opening to the summit last week. But on this score, there are increasing signs that some of the most shrill voices have been placated - at least for now - with promises of more money to come. Mr Sharma sought to remain upbeat amid the sprawling negotiations and competing interests. "We have bent the curve towards 2 degrees, but of course that isn't good enough," he said. "We have an opportunity to succeed. The transition to a net zero economy is technologically possible, it is economically attractive, and it is accelerating everywhere." \</doc>

Global climate talks have run into overtime, with negotiators scrambling to reach a final agreement and China calling for countries to "decide on their own timetable" for reducing emissions. The two-week UN climate change conference saw thousands of delegates descend on Glasgow, with the aim of limiting the catastrophic effects of global warming. But the scheduled program has come to an end and the wording of the final agreement remains up in the air. It needs unanimous support from nearly 200 countries. But\~in one of the final sessions of the talks, the disparity in aspiration and desired actions from different countries was clear. "Our safety, the safety of my children and yours hangs in the balance  \~it's time for us to level up," Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege said. "This will be the decade that determines the rest of human history." Tuvalu\~Climate Minister\~Seve Paeniu\~said climate changes was "an existential threat" during an emotive address to the summit that garnered widespread applause. "Our land is fast disappearing," He said. "Tuvalu is literally sinking." The small island nation was in\~the global spotlight earlier this week HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-10/tuvalu-minister-makes-cop26-speech-from-sea/100608344 when Foreign\~Minister Simon Kofe delivered a video address to the summit while standing knee-deep in seawater to show how low-lying Pacific nations were at the front line of climate change. Delegates from the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kenya, Ghana and the US all pleaded for greater ambition in the final agreement in one of the last plenary talks at COP26 . "Let the parties decide on their own\~the roadmap and timetable\~for their national policies and actions," Zhao Yingmin said. Mr Zhao called for the final conference pledge to deliver more on "adaptation, finance and capacity building". The first draft COP 26 agreement HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-11/draft-cop26-agreement-calls-on-countries-to-boost-2030-targets/100611260 was released earlier this week The second draft HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-12/second-cop26-draft-softens-language-on-coal-fossil-fuels/100617870 revealed watered-down commitments about phasing out fossil fuels and a softening of language around countries delivering new 2030 emission reductions targets within the next year. It is understood Russia, Saudi Arabia, India and other countries have been lobbying for the changes around the language\~on coal and fossil fuels. Mr Zhao told the plenary session the revised draft had "improvements compared to the previous one, and provided a good basis for our further discussions". "We still think the current text should further strengthen the parts of adaptation, finance, technical and capacities building,"\~he said. The UK's COP26 Island\~nations 'hold out' for more ambitious agreement "The least-developed countries and the small island nations and particularly the brave people of Tuvalu, are basically holding out," Mark Maslin, a climate scientist at University College London, told the ABC. Former negotiators told the ABC it was common for COP negotiations to go into overtime, with final agreements often delivered days late. Organisers of the conference set out with a few clear goals,\~including global emissions reductions that would limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and for the planet to have net-zero emissions by 2050. "We need to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and then hit net zero about 2050," he said. "Now, those countries'\~pledges don't come anywhere near that.\~ "We're looking at temperature changes of 2.4C\~to 2.8C by the end of the century, if there's no revisions." While speaking on behalf of the Marshall Islands, Ms Stege said countries should revisit their 2030 aspirations annually in order to keep climate goals in reach.\~ "We must see 1.5 [degrees Celsius]  \~and long term strategies delivered by the major emitters next year," Ms Stege said. Mr Maslin said the second draft was an improvement on the first document, and even if wording around fossil fuel use was revised it was still "absolutely brilliant"\~it was included. "It leaves the door open that if countries want to support the poorest people in their country being able to afford fuel which comes from fossil fuels, they can still do so,"\~he said. Another key goal of the conference was securing around $130 billion per year in financing to limit\~the effects of climate change. The issue of how any climate financing could be spent by developing nations is also thought to be a sticking point in the conference's final agreement. Throughout the course of the summit there were major pledges to prevent deforestation around the world, to reduce methane emissions and to phase out the public funding and use of coal power. There were several other smaller pledges\~around land management and\~phasing out fuel-powered cars and a surprise joint-statement from the US and China vowing to do more to reduce emissions. \~ But the promises came in a patchwork, with certain countries signing up to certain pledges, and none with unanimous support from the more than 200 countries. "Australia, Saudi Arabia and Russia, all of whom feel that their future is in fossil fuels, are actually trying to slow everything down," Mr Maslin said. "They're trying to actually make sure that perhaps our ambition isn't as large as we should have  \~and that's such a shame."\~ \</doc>

The contradictions were all too apparent at this year's conference, known as COP26 . The hired exhibition spaces in the conference centre were hosted by fossil fuel polluting countries and sponsored by large corporations. Corporate spin, also known as greenwash, abounded.

Everyone is keen on nature, no-one wants catastrophic climate change, but why are the solutions so divergent? At root, the two camps (and many in between) have different views on the role of capitalism in climate change. For those in the Blue Zone, a long-term shift from reliance on fossil fuels is (largely) accepted. But capitalism in its new green guise, many argue, can save the day through technology investment and market mechanisms - and notably through the plethora of offsetting schemes that make up the net-zero plans. By contrast, critical civil society and youth voices argue that capitalism is the root cause of the problem, together with its handmaiden colonialism. The only solution therefore is to overhaul capitalism and dismantle unequal global power relations. But how, through what alliances?

However, in Glasgow I missed these crucial, political debates about ways forward. Are new styles of multilateral negotiation possible? Can genuine inclusion occur, going beyond the performance of participation where an 'indigenous' person or 'community' leader is co-opted? Can a true dialogue emerge about our common future? I of course had very limited exposure to the thousands of simultaneous events. But my sense was that there was little meaningful interchange between different positions. Two worlds talked past each other or - because of restricted access, problems with visas and the high costs of attending -- never even met.

There is plenty to be achieved at the climate change global summit in Glasgow at the end of this month. Environment editor Nick O'Malley reports. It was NASA scientist James Hansen who introduced the wider world to the threat of climate change. His testimony before a US Senate committee in 1988 shook Washington and became a driving force of the global movement to address the threat. That same year, the UN formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It was to provide the world with detailed assessments of the science of climate change, to chart the risks and lay out possible responses. Its assessments of global warming were to become the largest scientific peer review process in history. Based on the IPCC's advice, the world negotiated the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Today, the UNFCCC has 195 national signatories, whose representatives normally gather annually at what is now known as the COP, the Conference of the Parties. COP1 was held in Berlin in 1995. This year COP26 will be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12, the event delayed for a year due to the pandemic. The meetings are usually attended by about 10,000 diplomats and negotiators, scientists, activists and people from civil society groups. The significant COPs such as those held in 1997, 2009, 2015 and this year - those at which key commitments are to be renegotiated - generally attract world leaders as well. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday announced he would be going to Glasgow. This year's meeting will be like a UN general assembly crossed with the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum. Organisers expect more than 100 leaders to attend, along with members of the British royal family as well as corporate heavyweights and celebrities. To many observers, COP26 is the most crucial yet because it will test whether the framework for co-operative emissions reductions agreed to in Paris can, in fact, curb climate change. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed more than 1 degree above pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, the parties to the COP undertook to hold warming to under 2 degrees. The same assessment says that to limit warming to 2 degrees we must achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and about 50 per cent by 2030. Thirty years on from Hansen's testimony, The New Yorker magazine asked him if he had a message for the next generation. His response was blunt. "The simple thing is, I'm sorry we're leaving such a f---ing mess." The first major climate treaty was thrashed out at the Second Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the meeting at which the Conference of the Parties was created. The central aim of the UNFCCC was to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". While this aim has not been realised so far, the COPs were the forums to try to make it happen. The first agreement made under the auspices of the UNFCCC was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, in which 36 developed nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gases during a set period (2008 to 2012) by 5 per cent compared to 1990 levels. Acknowledging that developed nations had already benefited from industrialisation, it allowed for poorer nations to continue to build their carbon-intensive economies. As a result, while signatories to Kyoto reduced their emissions in keeping with the agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, jumping by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010, according to an IPCC report. A new approach was needed. Have other COPs succeeded? By the most crucial measure - the rate at which the world is warming - the process has not yet worked, but it has brought the world to agreement on the scale of the problem and a course of action. Some meetings, such as the gathering in Copenhagen in 2009, have been standout failures. There, divisions between developed and developing nations became even more entrenched, as the former declined to set concrete reduction levels by 2020 and the latter insisted on their right to carbon-intensive growth. In the dying hours of two weeks of negotiations, the US delegation couldn't even find key players from the major developing nations bloc, let alone negotiate with them. At the last moment, US president Barack Obama, still as much a global superstar as politician after his startling election victory the year before, flew in, hoping to force a useful outcome. In her memoir, then US secretary of state Hillary Clinton recounts discovering that China was hosting a secret meeting attended by leaders of high-emitting economies including from India, Brazil and South Africa. She and Obama decided to crash it. She recounts racing down corridors with Obama before ducking into the meeting room as White House press secretary Robert Gibbs tangled himself up with Chinese security at the door. Those inside were stunned. But all that came of the Copenhagen COP was a political statement affirming the need to keep warming to 2 degrees, with no attendant commitments on that might be done. After Copenhagen, years were lost as emissions continued to rise. COP meetings rolled on and something like a consensus formed that the replacement for the Kyoto Protocol would be negotiated in Paris in 2015. What was agreed in Paris? Two principles were made central to the talks in Paris, both designed to help overcome the critical gulf between richer and poorer nations: all nations would commit to voluntary emissions cuts but wealthier countries would help pay for the developing world to meet their targets and adapt to a warmer world. Developed nations agreed to make their emissions peak as soon as possible, and then decline to net zero by 2050. To achieve the goal, all nations would set "ambitious" reductions targets that would be updated and increased over time. This is often described as the agreement's "ratchet effect". The president of this year's COP, British cabinet minister Alok Sharma, has said that the Paris summit put the world on track for a rise of global temperatures of just under 4 degrees. Commitments made since, should they be met, have put us on course to 2.4 degrees. This level of warming would be catastrophic, and to critics, it is evidence of a failure of the process. But the decline is the point. Loose language in the Paris agreement has also prompted criticism. The financial commitment of the developed nations was absolutely crucial to any agreement being secured at all. But the language of the Paris accord was deliberately muddy. Under the agreement, rich nations would create a Green Climate Fund to "mobilise" $100 billion for mitigation and adaptation projects by poorer ones. But what did "mobilise" mean? And which countries would be donors and which were recipients? In order to secure agreement, negotiators were not clear on these points. "Mobilise," one of Australia's former top climate diplomats Howard Bamsey has said, "is one of those UN verbs, so you have to parse it very carefully." Even the goalposts set by the IPCC shifted in Paris. In a last-minute change to language inserted as a result of a diplomatic push by small island states, Tony deBrum, a former president of the Marshall Islands (halfway between Australia and Hawaii), believed that while a 2 degree goal might be tolerable in some parts of the world, it would lead to the complete destruction of many small island nations. He quietly set about forming a bloc of nations that eventually became known as the High Ambition Coalition, which appeared as if out of nowhere moments before the talks' final session. Demonstrating the power of smart negotiators from small nations equipped with little more than moral authority and a sense of urgency, deBrum had secured 90 votes and reshaped the Paris accord. The agreement's intent would now be to limit global warming to "well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels". What's on the table at Glasgow? When the world met in Paris in 2015, nations accepted the IPCC's advice that it must massively reduce emissions to keep it on a path to holding warming to beneath 2 degrees, and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. In Glasgow, they must reset their ambitions reductions targets to make that goal possible. As Sharma puts it, Paris promised, Glasgow must deliver. For about two years now, COP26 Sharma has travelled the world pressing the need for nations to bring to the Glasgow conference emission reductions commitments in line with that target. For vulnerable countries, Sharma said in his last major speech before the conference, "'1.5 to stay alive' is not a hollow slogan. It is a matter of survival". Sharma and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been unequivocal about their terms for success. They say COP26 must result in nations committing to new emissions reductions targets that close the gap between our current warming trajectory and the 1.5 degree goal raised in Paris. To get to that point, the science suggests, most nations must not only commit to net zero emissions by 2050, but also agree to 2030 reductions targets that collectively add up to 45 per cent. This would be a significant feat. It would mean securing increased ambitions from more than 70 countries accounting for 41 per cent of global emissions. They include China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and Australia, which has so far not committed to net zero nor raised its 2030 target beyond the 26 to 28 per cent reduction it committed to in Paris. There is also debate about the mushy language of the agreement. Some nations interpret the prime Paris goal to be 1.5 degrees warming, others 2 degrees. The potential failure of the $100 billion climate fund could be used as an excuse for any number of reluctant nations to abandon the agreement, experts say. Since US President Joe Biden was elected, Sharma has been joined by the US State Department - the world's largest diplomatic machine - and US climate envoy John Kerry, an infamously relentless negotiator, in cajoling world leaders to commit to greater efforts. But success is far from assured. \</doc>

On the day Australians gamble more than any other, the Prime Minister is having a punt, too. Australians have just dropped around $200 million in bets on which horse would take out the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse. In the wee hours on the other side of the world, Scott Morrison set out his wager, an each-way bet\~that $20 billion invested in technological potential will either fix the climate crisis, or at the very least, convince other nations Australia is contributing sufficiently to efforts to limit global warming. "The Australian way is to bet on them  \~and we think that's a good bet," he boomed to other world leaders at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. He was talking about the researchers, scientists, entrepreneurs and investors his government is relying upon to turn potential technological breakthroughs into actual cuts in pollution. Just as the bookies carefully calibrate the chance of success for each horse at the track, world leaders have sized up other nations' contributions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And most aren't willing to back the odds of Scott Morrison's long-game on technological dependence delivering the goods. Allies and neighbours alike are looking at what can be done in the next few years, while Australia\' s gaze remains fixed on the far horizon of the middle of the this\~century. 'The Australian Way' not received well on international stage Scott Morrison, like other world leaders in Glasgow, was allocated just a few minutes to address his counterparts at the climate talks. There would be no surprises in his speech. The Prime Minister made it clear ahead of his arrival that Australia's commitments to reduce emissions would not change for 2030, and committing to net zero emissions by 2050 was predicated on both the significant advancement of existing technologies and the emergence of as-yet-unknown technologies. From the lectern, he chose to deliver a defensive speech, high on nationalism despite the global context. Prospective technological developments were billed as "the core of the Australian Way", the slogan developed in domestic political negotiations between the Liberals and Nationals proved\~to be an awkward transplant for\~the international stage.\~ The speech was low on urgency: "Technology will have the answers to a de-carbonised economy, over time," Mr Morrison\~told other world leaders. While lacking haste, it was not short of boasts. We're "ahead of the pack" on emissions reduction, he said, and will be "far exceeding our Paris commitment". He cited the 20 per cent cut thus far as notable progress on the target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. However, Mr Morrison's take on Australia's efforts\~ignores the low level of ambition that target represents, compared to other developed countries, when it was set six\~years ago. It rings even more hollow when you consider Australia was given exemptions\~under the Kyoto Protocol to continue to increase its emissions when other nations began cutting theirs. World leaders say Australia has not made a safe bet In stating his case for some kind of Australian exceptionalism, the Prime Minister spoke loudly, despite the twin microphones before him. His voice seemed to rebound across the room as he talked around  \~but not directly to  \~the fact that Australia would not commit to greater emissions reduction this decade. The forceful faith in technology-not-yet-known, in decades beyond the end of this one, was in stark contrast to the tenor of those leading the meeting. From the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, there was a plea for immediate action. "Countries must revisit their national climate plans and policies. Not every five years. Every year. Every moment." Speaking for the host nation, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson reflected the urgency, albeit in terms that could only be described as, well, Johnsonian. "We're in roughly the position  as James Bond," he said, "strapped to a Doomsday device  \~while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it." "This decade. The science is clear: We only have a brief window left before us to raise our ambitions and  \~to meet the task, that's rapidly narrowing." And, from Australia's near neighbours in the Pacific, the message was even blunter. "Empty promises of mid-century ambition are not enough," Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said. In failing to offer more action this decade  the main objective of COP26  \~Scott Morrison needed to make a case for Australian exceptionalism. In some sense he succeeded, but not as hoped. "The Australian Way" seems to have highlighted that this nation, as in past COP meetings, is acting as a brake on climate action, not a ready participant. Which makes it all the https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-02/india-commits-to-net-zero-2070/100587092 harder to convince 'developing' countries  \~which includes the likes of China and India  \~to follow suit. Scott Morrison will depart Glasgow with Australia's six-year-old 2030 target unchanged. He may be able to brush off the criticism Australia is copping at COP26 , but it is likely to follow him. Frank Bainimarama, the strong man and powerful voice of the Pacific, made it clear that success in limiting climate change should not be left to chance. "We have moral authority," he said. "You have a moral obligation." \</doc>

Macquarie Group chief executive Wikramanayake has declared the profitability of coal will not last and affected communities must be reskilled but warned the transition to renewable energy cannot happen overnight. The comments come as the Coalition government faces HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/net-zero-dead-nationals-force-climate-war-eruption-in-coalition-20220426-p5ag4g.html internal division over its climate policy after Nationals Senator Matt Canavan declared the net zero emissions target was "dead" which prompted rebukes from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. More than 40 countries pledged to shift away from coal during the Glasgow climate summit last year, but sanctions following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine have triggered a surge in demand for fossil fuels produced outside Russia. Wikramanayake on Wednesday said the current profitability of coal companies would not last and new opportunities must be created for coal communities, pointing to Macquarie's efforts to diversify the world's largest coal port in Newcastle by investing in hydrogen hubs. "We are accepting the coal industry is running off. It's very profitable at the moment but it is going to run off," she said. "So the people of Newcastle, we the people of Australia, need new industry. We need reskilling for jobs." Macquarie retains small but shrinking investments in coal but HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/macquarie-to-exit-coal-by-2024-hikes-dividend-20210507-p57pqb.html announced last year Speaking at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia conference in Sydney on Wednesday, Wikramanayake said the next 10 years were crucial to addressing climate change, and developing decarbonisation solutions required three to six times more capital invested each year. "Climate change is one of the most critical and complex challenges of our time. When history judges our generations, this will be one of the biggest issues we will be held to account on." Wikramanayake said she was optimistic following COP26 but any progress had since been reversed. "Emissions globally had come down a lot in COVID and we were feeling like there was good momentum," she said. "But now, fast-forward six months on, and we are back again. It's surged to peak emissions ... We're back up with emissions not just high but rising very fast." Fossil fuels still make up 80 per cent of global energy consumption and Wikramanayake said it was unrealistic for this to change overnight. She said renewables would continue to grow market share but the transition must be done carefully and with respect for all affected communities. "People need energy and if we end up creating energy scarcity we could end up losing the mandate for the transition," she said. "We have to be realistic. We can't get going around and saying shut down all the gas, shut down all the oil." She pointed to the Biden administration's moves to ramp up domestic production of oil and gas following the Russia-Ukraine war to illustrate fossil fuel usage will rise before falling in the long term. "We are going to have a pick-up in fossil fuel energy but it's also, in parallel, pushing the journey to renewables along." Wikramanayake said the global response to climate change had created "tectonic shifts" right through the economy, which would continue to create opportunities for investors who identify the right companies and industries. Macquarie has invested billions of dollars in the green energy transition since the early 2000s and Wikramanayake called on other investors to follow suit, saying regulatory and technology settings were combining to make "this a good investment area". "We've been doing this, it just needs to scale up a lot, lot more if we're going to meet the challenge of sorting this out. I'm a little big of a flag carrier. Get on board."

Mayors and councillors from the most flood-damaged regions in Australia have called on the federal government to do more to protect communities from -extreme weather, including consideration of buy-back or land-swap schemes for residents whose homes are destroyed. \'ef\'bb\'bfIn a joint statement to be provided to the Morrison government on Thursday, 31 mayors and councillors from Lismore in NSW to Logan in Queensland have pushed for immediate -action on climate change to curb extreme weather events. "Heavy rain, flooding, strong winds and storm surges are damaging communities, endangering residents, and costing millions of dollars in clean-up costs," the statement says. "We are exhausted by the immediate costs and challenges and we are worried about what's to come. "The cost of extreme weather disasters in Australia has more than doubled since the 1970s. If we don't take urgent action, floods could cost us $40bn a year by 2060." The statement called on the government to deliver on an ambitious emissions reduction target this decade, invest in preparation before climate disasters strike, ensure disaster -response funding allows commun-ities to be rebuilt and establish a national body to support research on adaptation. It follows the government commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 at the COP26 -climate summit in Glasgow, -although it has refused to update its short-term emissions targets beyond the existing commitment of cutting emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The statement also asked for a minimum of $200m a year for disaster mitigation and an extra $200m over four years to fund better local government climate responses. Lismore city councillor Elly Bird said beyond ensuring -"significant funding for climate change and emissions -reduction", buy-back schemes needed to be part of the conversation. "People need to be -offered a buy-back so they can move out of a flood plain - that needs to be an option they can take up," she said. "And if they choose to build in (a) flood plain, they need to be able to access innovative solutions that can help their homes withstand floods of this scale." The floods across NSW and Queensland are expected to cost billions, with the Insurance Council confirming this month it had received about 86,00 claims worth about $1.3bn. \</doc>

"Scare campaign" allegations have been traded by the two major parties, with each side accusing the other of using "disgusting" and "dodgy" tactics. Labor and the Coalition each used press conferences on Tuesday to call out the campaign tactics of the other side. Prime Minister Scott Morrison labelled Labor "disgusting" over its charge that the Coalition was looking to move pension payments to cashless debit cards. "It is an out-and-out disgusting lie," Mr Morrison said, referring to Labor's Jim Chalmers as "Sneaky Jim" for spreading the allegation. "Good old Sneaky Jim. He's the one who's been telling the lies," Mr Morrison said. "It was Jimmy Chalmers yesterday who was out peddling this lie, seeking to scare pensioners." Labor has denied it is running a baseless scare campaign by claiming the Coalition has plans to force pensioners onto the cashless welfare card. Having similarly accused the Coalition of spreading falsehoods about Labor's signature energy plan, Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers were asked on Tuesday why the opposition continued to push the cashless welfare card claims. Mr Morrison has said it is "simply not true" that the Coalition will move pension payments to cashless cards, despite former social services minister Anne Ruston earlier this term having told 7 News the government was seeking to move payments to a cashless system. "We're seeking to put all income management on to the universal platform, which is the cashless debit card," Senator Ruston said in February 2020. Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said he had received assurances from Senator Ruston that the Coalition was not looking to implement a cashless card system for pensioners. "It is trying to scare older Australians one way or the other into not voting for the other side, based on things that are not factual," Mr Yates told ACM. Mr Albanese cited Senator Ruston's comments to support his claims that the option remains on the table, while Dr Chalmers said Labor planned to abolish the cashless debit card entirely if it is elected next month. "Labor will abolish the cashless debit card. The Liberals and Nationals won't, and they've talked about expanding it and those are facts," he said. READ MORE: Federal election 2022: Scott Morrison says no deal with independents to form next government Crispin Hull: Hold your horses on PM's re-election prospects What matters in this election for first-time voters On Tuesday the opposition also hit back at sledges from the Coalition regarding speculation that Labor's net-zero climate policy would cost consumers more. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers branded Energy Minister Angus Taylor "dodgy" and claimed he was central to fudging numbers released to the media showing consumers would be $560 worse off under Labor's $78 billion energy policy. "These are dodgy numbers from a dodgy minister in a dodgy government," Dr Chalmers said. "These numbers have been made up by the minister and put into the papers in an effort to mislead people about the vast opportunities of renewable energy." In Brisbane, Mr Albanese said Labor's energy and climate plan outlined last year would lower power bills overall, and said a greater reliance on renewables was needed in the energy mix. "That scare campaign is based upon a view somehow that renewables aren't the cheapest form of new energy," he said. "And we know that that is why the market is choosing clean energy and renewables for new energy growth." Labor's climate modelling was conducted by RepuTex following the COP26 Glasgow climate summit last year. It predicted a 43 per cent reduction in net emissions by 2030 under Labor's plan. \</doc>

Fast forward to the final tense hours of COP26 , and India almost derailed the talks. It HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/13/cop26-countries-agree-to-accept-imperfect-climate-agreement demanded a key commitment in the Glasgow agreement be watered down: that a pledge to "phase out" coal be weakened to just "phase down" the fossil fuel. China supported India's holdout. The controversy cast a long shadow over the Glasgow agreement, which was already shaping as too weak to keep global warming below 1.5? this century. The world - including India - needs to phase out coal by 2040 if that warming goal is to be met, and India's government is kidding itself to think the Glasgow intervention will make that problem vanish. India should not consider itself off the hook. Rather than slow the decline in coal use, India has ensured it and other coal-intensive nations, including Australia, will be under even greater global pressure to ditch coal. A big coal problem Since 2000, coal-fired power capacity in both India and China has HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants grown massively . At COP26 , the two nations were HYPERLINK https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cop26-draft-calls-for-end-to-fuel-subsidies-india-7621694/ joined in their last minute demands by other big coal users like South Africa and Nigeria, along with Venezuela, a coal exporter. India cannot absolve itself by pointing to its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2070. Like many other nations to adopt a net-zero goal - including Australia - India has no firm plan to get there. Nor is India's 2030 target strong enough. A global research organisation I help lead, Climate Action Tracker, HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/climate-target-update-tracker/india/ found India can largely meet the goal with policies already in place. India no doubt has a big coal problem, and will need substantial support to deal with it, such as finance and technology from developed nations. But it also has HYPERLINK enormous potential for renewable energy expansion. HYPERLINK https://climateanalytics.org/media/report_coal_phase_out_2019.pdf Analysis shows that to prevent further climate disaster and keep warming to 1.5?, thermal coal must be phased out by 2030 in developed nations and by 2040 globally - including in India. Softening the language in the COP26 decision doesn't change this fact. Read more: The ultimate guide to why the COP26 summit ended in failure and disappointment (despite a few bright spots) Parallels with Australia So where does all this leave Australia, one of the world's largest coal exporters? Like India, Australia also has a big coal problem and huge renewables potential. And like India, Australia firmly resisted signing up to big COP26 pledges for a faster phase-out of coal and large reductions in HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-03/australia-refuses-to-join-global-pledge-to-cut-methane-emissions/100589510 methane emissions by 2030. Large methane reductions need to come from fossil fuels - namely coal mining and gas production. These are both industries our government has fought hard to protect. To stay within the 1.5?C warming limit, gas must be HYPERLINK https://climateanalytics.org/latest/report-why-gas-is-the-new-coal/ phased out almost as quickly as coal. But Australia's political class is largely in denial about the gas problem. One development at COP26 , however, suggests the issue will not go away. It involves a new coalition, led by Denmark and Costa Rica, known as the Beyond Gas and Oil Alliance. Sooner rather than later, we can expect it to come for Australia's fast-expanding LNG export industry.

And for all nations - including India, China and Australia - the pressure to do so will be unrelenting. Whichever government Australia has after the next election will have no choice but to substantially increase Australia's actions and commitments beyond our pathetically weak efforts so far. Without strong near-term targets, the world won't get to net-zero emissions in time. As Climate Action Tracker has pointed out, even if the world meets its 2030 targets it is still heading for a catastrophic HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/press/global-update-projected-warming-from-paris-pledges-drops-to-two-point-four-degrees/ 2.4? of warming this century.

Australia could be pressured to revisit its targets for greenhouse gas emissions cuts as soon as next year, if a draft climate plan released at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow gets the green light. The draft plan, released on Wednesday, came as China and the United States announced a surprising new pact to work together to accelerate climate action this decade. Under the Paris Agreement, nations are obliged to update their commitments every five years, but the COP26 draft would ask countries to revisit their targets in 2022 - three years ahead of schedule. While the draft is subject to change over the next few days, a 2022 target update could prove to be a headache for the Coalition if it wins re-election. The new commitment Australia announced at Glasgow - getting to net zero by 2050 - came after a protracted series of negotiations with the Nationals, who steadfastly refused to support a stronger interim emissions targets for 2030. The draft text calso called on countries to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". Previous climate summit decisions and the Paris Agreement itself do not so much as mention fossil fuels, focusing instead on emissions. Observers told AFP this was a "significant first mention" for fossil fuels, and one negotiator said they were confident the reference would appear in the final text, "in some form or another". Asked for a response to the COP26 draft statement, the Minister for Indusry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, said "Australia is an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26 ." COP26 which highlighted our strong record of achievement. While ambition is important, action and outcomes are what matters," Mr Taylor said. The Climate Council said the draft COP26 statement was "relatively strong". "For the first time, we have a decision text that explicitly calls on countries to phase out coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies," said Climate Council researcher Dr Simon Bradshaw, who is in Glasgow for the summit. Pressure on the Australian government to commit to serious emissions action this decade "is only going to grow in the wake of COP26 ," Dr Bradshaw said. CHINA AND UNITED STATES VOW TO WORK TOGETHER ON CLIMATE COP26 summit. "This document contains strong statements about the alarming science, the emissions gap, and the urgent need to accelerate action to close that gap," US special envoy John Kerry told reporters in a surprise announcement. "It commits to a series of important actions now this decade when it is needed." The plan is light on concrete targets but heavy on political symbolism at a conference that began with the US and China - the world's two biggest emitters - seemingly at loggerheads. Last week US President Joe Biden criticised the decision of China's President Xi Jinping not to attend the Glasgow summit, saying China "walked away". China hit back at the time, but ties appear to have thawed ahead of long-awaited bilateral talks next week. On Wednesday both US and China envoys stressed their countries' collaboration, saying they had agreed to put other differences aside to work on climate. "Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action," Beijing's longtime climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said. A document outlining the agreement includes a focus on lowering methane emissions, which Kerry described as the "single fastest and most effective way to limit warming". It says the two sides will meet regularly to "address the climate crisis". The document also stresses the need to boost emissions efforts in the short term, with scientists warning that emissions efforts before 2030 are crucial for halting catastrophic global warming. The declaration said both countries "recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis". "They are committed to tackling it through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s," the document said. China and US are the two largest emitters in the world and together account for nearly 40 per cent of all carbon pollution. The US has already said it plans to be carbon neutral by 2050, while China announced its intention last month to reach net-zero emissions before 2060. UN chief Antonio Guterres welcomed the US-China pact. "Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction," he said on Twitter. ADAPTATION AND FINANCE ISSUES IN COP26 DRAFT COP26 The agreement - or "cover decision" - published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. The text called for nations to "revisit and strengthen" their decarbonisation plans by next year and said that limiting heating to 1.5C "requires meaningful and effective action by all parties in this critical decade". Several large emitters missed the 2020 deadline for submitting new plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Vulnerable nations say that the next deadline, in 2025, is too distant to deliver the short-term emissions cuts needed to avoid disastrous heating. Some climate scientists and environmental groups criticised the draft for failing to reflect the urgency of the crisis facing the planet. "This draft deal is not a plan to solve the climate crisis, it's an agreement that we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best," said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan. "It's a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year." Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said Wednesday's draft was "fuzzy and vague" when it came to financing climate action. He said concrete commitments on funding was "a specific ask of poor countries" from COP26 . "Of course, if developed countries don't deliver on their financial promises, the talks may fall into disarray," he said. \</doc>

Energy transition The only genuine way businesses can meet their investors' ESG expectations is by making real cuts to their carbon emissions a priority. After the meeting of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow last year, the price of high-quality carbon offsets soared, signalling a brave new era of emission reductions. A centrepiece of that is the development of a global carbon market. In Australia, attention is now on the price of carbon units and the developing market for carbon trading. Carbon prices fell sharply this month after the federal government announced a policy change, which had the effect of releasing contracted supply onto the market. Yet spot carbon prices remain about double what they were a year ago. We expect policy and commercial factors to continue to put upward pressure on the market. Carbon offsets are designed to negate or net out emissions that occur elsewhere in the economy. COP26 , numerous listed companies had grasped this point and committed to zero net emissions by 2050. Others have built net zero by 2030 into their planning. The operative word here is "net". It's going to be challenging to get to zero emissions, and companies will probably still be emitting some carbon by 2050. So while most emissions reductions need to be achieved through abatement, there will be a need to offset emissions by generating or accessing activities that store carbon. As worthy as it is, merely committing to net zero by 2050 is the easy part. The hard part is the delivery. It requires planning, investment - and cost. Much more than lip service is required of company boards and management if they are to meet the environmental, social and governance obligations increasingly being imposed on them by investors, employees and other key stakeholders. Business has taken a lead in our market. The sharp rise in the spot price of Australian Carbon Credit Units - each ACCU indicating the offsetting of one tonne of carbon - from less than $15 two years ago to about double that flows largely from a sharp increase in corporate demand. However, carbon offsets should not be seen as the easy way out to meet net zero commitments. The only genuine way to achieve net zero is to explore all other ways of cutting emissions before turning to offsets. In the reductions sphere, investors want businesses to make cutting their emissions a priority. They demand companies do what they can to avoid carbon-intensive activities - unnecessary travel, wasteful energy use, and so on. They also want them to replace fossil fuel-based energy with a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy. The second piece - carbon abatement - occurs as business re-engineers its processes to reduce emission, for example by reducing fugitive gas leakage from pipelines. The third piece is offsetting. When emissions can't be reduced or abated, or when this cannot be achieved fast enough, other than at prohibitive cost, offsets can come into play. A key example can be seen in air travel involving zero- or low-emissions fuel. Transport leaders are already delivering on this to some extent. Some companies are reducing travel for staff to meet their emissions reduction commitments in the short term. However, offsets also provide a means to accelerate net emissions reductions beyond these timelines, and a means of netting off remaining emissions. Indeed, the expected upward pressure on the price of offsets will force its own discipline on these choices. Simple economics will drive a greater focus on the first two routes to net zero, and this process has already begun. The current price of voluntary offsets is encouraging many companies to explore internal opportunities for abatement, and this will be reinforced by investor demands to meet ESG goals through fundamental change. Offsets can supplement these changes but should not replace them. It will also invite scrutiny on the quality of any offsets used. The use of carbon offsets inevitably raises the questions of quality and legitimacy. In the same way one bottle of wine might cost $5 and another $55, so it can be with carbon offsets. Some companies keen to take the easy and cheap way out have purchased offsets for as little as $5 or even less, only to learn that they are of low integrity. That is, while the issuer might attest to the veracity of one tonne of carbon being offset for each unit issued, in some cases this has been far from the truth. While there will always be arguments on specifics, the good news is that in our market, ACCUs - overseen by the Australian Clean Energy Regulator - are considered high quality. This is through a combination of a clear, transparent regulatory environment, independent auditing of projects, the safeguard mechanism for capping the emissions of the biggest emitters, the carbon farming initiative and, prospectively, an official carbon exchange. Reducing carbon emissions isn't easy, and it won't come free. But it's something Australia and the world must deliver on. As we participate in this new world of carbon reduction, abatement and offsets, it's well worth bearing in mind the old maxim: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

An increasingly desperate search for industrial strength alternatives to coal and oil in the lead up to the Glasgow COP26 climate conference is rapidly changing the outlook for uranium. Australian uranium miners have bounded ahead this year on the back of what might have been another passing burst of enthusiasm for the raw material that powers nuclear reactors. But inside the last month a remarkable convergence of new commitments and recommitments to nuclear energy is extending investor interest in what had become a marginal commodity. Australia has roughly a third of the world's uranium, but local interest in "yellowcake" had waned along with softer international demand since the Fukushima nuclear power plant explosion in Japan a decade ago. Some professional investors see uranium as a re-emerging potential power source in the rush to decarbonisation. Investment bank Morgan Stanley is bullish on the commodity with a $US49 a pound target for 2024 - it is currently around $US40. Uranium-powered nuclear stations create carbon free energy, a factor that may well become a crucial piece of the energy jigsaw as planners try to match political promises set to be made at the Glasgow climate conference starting on October 31. Over the last 12 months uranium spot prices have rise strongly, moving from under $US30 at the start of the year, though retracing a little in recent days. Moreover, a powerful lift in the share price of leading uranium players such as ASX-listed Paladin Energy suggest that changed attitudes among leaders of developed economies is underpinning the renewal of investor interest. Paladin Energy is now valued at more than $3bn and is up fivefold over the last 12 months, and a string of smaller uranium players are also making big profits for investors. Perhaps the biggest swing factor in changing attitudes has been Japan, the source of the last major nuclear accident which in turn flattened the uranium for almost a decade. Just days ago Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, repositioned the government suggesting "it is crucial we restart our nuclear plants". Meanwhile, almost in unison a string of developments in Europe combined to force a very recent reappraisal of uranium as a commodity with a changed future.  In the UK, where 20 per cent of power is nuclear, PM Boris Johnson is set to rebuild the nation's nuclear energy commitment prior to the Glasgow conference. The UK government is expected to match a private consortium's funding to build 16 new "mini reactors" in conjunction with the Rolls Royce Group.  In France, where 70 per cent of power comes from nuclear, last week President Macron confirmed the role of nuclear in the country's long range electricity plans and announced a $US1bn plan to build the first mini reactor.  Even in Germany, the centre of antinuclear activism for decades, things are changing rapidly. On October 14 a set of 25 leading public figures launched a campaign for the country to change course and reverse a plan to close all of its nuclear power stations. The group says Germany is in danger of missing its climate targets if the "2022 nuclear phase out plan" goes ahead. For analysts the key issue of whether nuclear power and uranium really will have a renaissance as countries try to match emission obligations. Tim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics remains unconvinced: "All energy prices are lifting just now but nuclear power is a terribly expensive form of power with huge construction costs that only a country such as China is willing to make." Vivek Dhar, mining and energy commodities analyst at Commonwealth Bank, issued a very sceptical report on the sector earlier this year but is keeping an open mind. "I haven't crunched the numbers in terms of the incremental demand from these new policy announcements, but if nuclear power manages to gain traction as a viable solution to decarbonisation in the power sector, it can lead to more economies embracing the technology," Dhar suggests. \</doc>

London | Suppose you're a company boss and you want to cut the net carbon emissions of your business. It's hard to avoid or cut your carbon. But you've been reading about the booming voluntary carbon market where you can buy credits or offsets for your emissions. Problem solved, right? Not so fast. There must be a reason why all those protesters were lining up outside COP26 in Glasgow, saying that carbon credits were a con. Actually, there are two reasons. And they are problems that even people who are hungrily eyeing the market's potential multibillion-dollar growth will admit they're worried about. One is the much-covered anxieties about the supply side. Are these carbon offsets any good? Are they legit? Or is there a risk of buying something that has cut corners, or trampled over local communities? This is the well-publicised issue, which is being addressed by the Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets, which sprang out of the taskforce led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. By mid-2022, the ICVCM is likely to produce standards that will govern the market and help set a baseline for its rapid scaling up and quasi-commodification, allowing all the big institutional investors to get in on the act. The other anxiety is about the demand side. What if companies decide avoiding, abating or cutting emissions is all too hard, and just gobble up carbon credits while otherwise continuing with business as usual? So companies should be buying carbon offsets or credits only as a last resort. But how do you make sure that's the case? How does a vendor of carbon offsets decide when a buyer has a genuine need, versus when it is just taking an easy shortcut? This issue has been well-ventilated too, but the collective global effort to fix it has had much less publicity. The body working on it - which is a public-private-NGO collaboration with funding from philanthropic groups and the British government - has a confusingly similar name to the ICVCM: the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, or VCMI. Launched last July, the VCMI plans to next month produce the first draft of guidelines or standards that companies should meet. "We're building the plane as we fly it," VCMI co-chairman Rachel Kyte tells The Australian Financial Review from her office in Boston, Massachusetts. "There's a need to have guardrails so that the market is purposeful. But it's quite extraordinarily complex; there are a thousand moving parts. And all of this is voluntary, it's all outside of regulation. And there are people who are trying to race ahead. Trying to put guardrails in place while people are already running is interesting." The VCMI's steering committee, its expert advisory group and its various sub-groups are in the throes of consulting with governments, the private sector, local communities and indigenous groups to produce a first "iteration" of the guidelines. These can then be beta-tested, and subject to further consultation. Some elements are straightforward. If you don't have a plan for reaching net zero carbon emissions, you shouldn't be able to buy carbon credits. "What's more complicated is where a company is on a journey, it is sorting its journey out but is not yet fully able to have a science-based target for all businesses within the conglomerate," Ms Kyte says. "Do you have to be pure in order to enter the market, or can you be on a pathway to purity and enter the market? I think reasonable people disagree on that point." And if you do have a plan, is it good enough? "One of the complaints from companies and from financiers is: what do we measure? How do we measure? How do we know?" Ms Kyte says. There's already a mini-industry generating environmental, social and governance strategies for companies, or evaluating them. Ms Kyte says the announcement at COP26 of a new International Sustainability Standards Body will help get a standardised set of metrics and reporting on ESG, which companies can adopt to work out if they meet VCMI's standards for entering the carbon offset market. But she also name-checks the work of the Science-Based Targets Initiative and the Transition Pathway Initiative, two private sector attempts to benchmark the quality and efficacy of companies' net zero plans. But the VCMI's job is to bring it altogether - and fast. "If there's something that wakes me up at three o'clock in the morning, it's that there are probably bad deals being done. And lots of, well, good deals that could be done, potentially," Ms Kyte says. "And we're under such extraordinary time pressure as an international community." If the standards aren't up and running before the market takes off, "there is the extraordinary risk that all we're going to be doing is moving paper around the world, and we're not going to reduce emissions". "If it doesn't, those people participating in voluntary markets could do extraordinary damage by further undermining trust, and concentrating wealth where it doesn't need to be." \</doc>

The Fijian Prime Minister writes on the disappointments of COP26 - and on some of the breakthroughs. Less than one month ago, I returned from COP26 - one of the most critical global climate meetings in a generation. The Fijian delegation went to Glasgow with the interests of the Pacific and Small Island Developing States at the centre of our approach. We knew from experience that we were involved in a long-term process. But we also knew that COP26 needed to resolve, as a matter of urgency, a number of issues that were holding up progress on both mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its impacts. While we were pleased that the parties agreed to keep warming to under 1.5 degrees, we are deeply concerned the pledges made so far will not take us there. It is also clear that many, including Australia, have placed far too much emphasis on net zero by 2050, given that the best hope for limiting temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees is contingent on what we do between now and 2030. The agreement in the Glasgow climate pact to review and upgrade 2030 targets by 2022 was therefore one of the most welcome outcomes of COP26 . All signatory parties will have to bring greater ambition and more robust policies to COP27 next year, particularly the largest emitters - and Australia is in the top 20 of global emitters. We encourage Australia to reconsider its comments it will not revisit its 2030 targets. The opportunity to contest this was during COP26 , not after it. While COP26 did not achieve the commitments we need on the whole, it did provide the language and decisions needed to increase pressure on those who continue to shirk their share of the burden. We also need to see more ambition from the Australian government on its dangerous addiction to coal. We understand the place coal occupies in the Australian economy, history and culture but we need to explore how we take this option off the table. Australia is not only in an influential position to phase out coal globally; it could become a centre for energy innovation with its abundance of renewable energy potential. The impacts and costs of climate change are all too real for Pacific islanders, and we can't escape the science. In light of this reality, Fiji went to Glasgow with some very specific objectives on financing for adaptation. We had struggled to get developed countries to follow through on their commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020. Since Glasgow, we now have an agreement for independent monitoring of those commitments to ensure we achieve the $100 billion target as soon as possible. In that vein, I commend Australia for its new Indo-Pacific Carbon Offset Scheme (IPCOS). Trading in carbon credits will help fill the gaps in financing for adaptation. It is not a long-term solution, nor is it an alternative to action to drive down emissions, but it has merit. Australia's IPCOS will mean that Fijian resource owners and investors in renewable energy can generate carbon units that can be sold to Australian companies at an attractive price. Empowered by the legal framework established by our new Climate Change Act, this creates strong incentives to keep natural resources intact in Fiji and attract investments in nature-based solutions. We are also very pleased that Australia pledged to increase its climate finance commitment by $A500 million for the Pacific and south-east Asia. Agreements like this recognise that, ultimately, the stakes are the same for all of us - survival, plain and simple. Just as we are moving communities to high ground to escape sea-level rise, we keep hold of the moral high ground, and we believe that requires us to do more. We are one of the first countries - if not the first - to adopt a Climate Change Act which means government ministries must now seriously consider the climate impact of every program, every initiative and every expenditure. A growing majority of governments and businesses have discarded the tired notion that economic progress and environmental protection are at odds. Profitable business, strong economies and effective climate action go hand in hand. By taking advantage of the market potential that lies in carbon neutrality, government and business can drive faster decarbonisation - and help avert climate catastrophe. It is time to create a new era for the planet we call home. Political leaders - if they are worthy of the term - have critical levers for change at their disposal. Businesses, state and local governments, local communities, civic organisations, organised labour, faith communities and people everywhere must also champion change. If we can muster courage and good will - and if we seriously consider the price we will pay if our efforts fall short - then I trust we will prevail. Frank Bainimarama is the Prime Minister of Fiji. He will be presenting at the Carbon Market Institute's 8th Australasian Emission Reduction Summit today. \</doc>

Decades of scientific evidence demonstrate unequivocally that human activities jeopardise life on Earth. Dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system compounds many other drivers of global change. Governments concur: the science is settled. But governments have failed to act at the scale and pace required. What should climate change scientists do? There is an unwritten social contract between science and society. Public investment in science is intended to improve understanding about our world and support beneficial societal outcomes. However, for climate change, the science-society contract is now broken. The failure to act decisively is an indictment on governments and political leaders across the board, but climate change scientists cannot be absolved of responsibility.

Read more: The ultimate guide to why the COP26 summit ended in failure and disappointment (despite a few bright spots) Where to from here for climate change scientists? The first option is to collect more evidence and hope for action. Continue the IPCC process that stays politically neutral and abstains from policy prescriptions. A recent HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03433-2 editorial in Nature However, this choice not only ignores the complex relationship between science and policy, it runs counter to the logic of our scientific training to reflect and act on the evidence. We know why global warming is happening and what to do. We have known for a long time. Governments just haven't taken the necessary action. In a recent Nature HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02990-w survey , six in ten of the IPCC scientists who responded expect 3? warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Persisting with this first option is therefore untenable. The second option is more intensive social science research and climate change advocacy. As Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes recently HYPERLINK observed , the work of the IPCC's Working Group I ( HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ WGI , on the physical science basis of climate change) is complete and should be closed down. Attention needs to focus on translating this understanding into action, which is the realm of WGII (on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability) and WGIII (on mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions). In parallel, growing numbers of scientists are getting involved in diverse forms of advocacy, including https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03430-5 non-violent civil disobedience However, albeit more promising than option one, there is little evidence of impact thus far and it is doubtful this pathway will lead to the urgent transformative actions required. This option is also not tenable. The third option is much more radical, but unpalatable. We call for a moratorium on climate change research that does little more than document global warming and maladaptation. Attention needs to focus on exposing and re-negotiating the broken science-society contract. Given the rupture to the contract outlined here, we call for a halt on all further IPCC assessments until governments are willing to fulfil their responsibilities in good faith and mobilise action to secure a safe level of global warming. This option is the only way to overcome the tragedy of climate change science. Read more: Where to find courage and defiant hope when our fragile, dewdrop world seems beyond saving Readers might agree with our framing of this tragedy but disagree with our assessment of options. Some may want greater detail on what a moratorium could encompass or worry it may damage the credibility and objectivity of the scientific community. However, we question whether it is our "duty" to use public funds to continue to refine the state of climate change knowledge (which is unlikely to lead to the actions required), or whether a more radical approach will serve society better. We have reached a critical juncture for humanity and the planet. Given the unfolding tragedy, a moratorium on climate change research is the only responsible option for revealing and then restoring the broken science-society contract.

It is\~17,335 kilometres from Glasgow to the brown-coal-powered electricity generators of Morwell in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. But they have never felt closer. Debates and decisions at the COP26 global climate summit in the Scottish city are resonating in coal communities across Australia, as the world attempts to stop burning fossil fuels for energy, to stem the catastrophic impact of climate change. "It's a very emotive issue around this area\~because our industry is so connected to it," she said. "I've grown up in the Latrobe Valley. It's always just been part of what we do." "Seeing Dad working at a power station all his life, I'm really proud of that. Because what the power stations around here have done is propelled Victoria's innovation." Many developments in Victoria would not have happened without the age of electricity in the Latrobe Valley, she added.\~ "But it was an age, and we need to think about what's next  what's the next, best\~solution that is more kind to the world." The mine has provided brown coal to power Victoria since 1958. But the environmental impact and the falling\~cost of producing power through renewable sources means coal is on the way out. A kilometre along the edge of the open cut mine is the site of the now-demolished Hazelwood Power Station. John Morrissey worked as an electrical engineer there for 35 years, retiring just a few years before it was closed in 2017. Everyone in the Valley\~had\~a connection to coal, Ms Morrissey said. "If your parent wasn't working at the power station, or some member of your family wasn't, then if you go around to play at a friend's house, you'd need to be quiet because someone had been on night shift. Everybody knows somebody connected to the power industry," she said. Future of the region lies beyond coal But what happens when your community relies on a fuel the world needs to stop using? Ms Morrissey might be part of the solution. "There's a bit of a misnomer that tech doesn't happen in the country," she said. "There are just as many clever people who have a lot to give to industry in the country as there are in other places, but they might not have had the opportunities." Aussie Broadband was already in the Latrobe Valley. But it has grown markedly during\~the pandemic, as demand for telco services have risen. It is part of a substantial shift in employment, years in the making. The closure of Hazelwood Power Station led to the creation of an aggressive and innovative state government program to boost local businesses. The Latrobe Valley Authority was originally given a quarter of a billion dollars to fund new projects and help workers transition to jobs in them. Chief executive Karen Cain said\~with its strong networks and relationships, her local team had helped the process along with "latitude" to try unproven things. One quick success was training former power station workers in solar panel installation. The longer work is in retooling the community for a HYPERLINK life beyond coal . "I've worked here for 26 years now and the pride and understanding of the contribution that this community has made to the state and beyond has been very important," she said. With coal's end date looming, no-one wants to see a transition like the traumatic decades after privatisation last century. Ms Cain said the grief of that time  \~triggered again by the accelerated closure\~of Yallourn  remained a barrier to the change required by global factors like COP26 . "People are now more confident about the future\~for a whole range of reasons,\~and there's now a level of good acceptance about what is happening," she said. "But it's about where the opportunities are, taking a strengths-based\~approach about what we're good at." Transition of power to new industries Chris Barfoot toiled for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for more than three decades. At one point, Mr Barfoot,\~his father and\~ grandfather worked\~in the power stations at the same time. As a lifelong Morwell resident, Mr Barfoot has witnessed\~the community shift to acceptance of the looming end of coal power. "We're seeing this forced transition\~which is now occurring, as we're seeing the criticality of the climate change issues that are occurring," he said. "Also, [there is] simply the competition in terms of pricing on renewables, and also the age of the stations. "Are we seeing the acceptance of the inevitable? Yes, we are." Mr Barfoot was at Hazelwood Power Station when it closed in 2017, causing the\~loss of more than 1,000 direct and indirect jobs. He said the closure and demolition of the station\~cemented the acceptance there would be difficult change. "It's real. You know, those boilers blew up, the chimneys fell down," he said. Community members remain scarred by the punishment meted out to the community when power assets were privatised in the early 1990s. When the SEC\~was split up and sold off, thousands of well-paid workers lost their jobs, leading to business collapses and a drop in house prices. Residents were unable to afford to move and the massive economic readjustment shattered the community. That pain has lasted. In 1990, there were more than 15,000 children in primary and secondary school in the Latrobe City council area. Despite an explosion in Victoria's population in the past 30 years, there were HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-15/figures-show-latrobe-valley-youth-population-drop/11000784 just over 11,000 students by 2018 Geoff Dyke started in the industry in 1978 as a design draftsman and still works as a control room operator, part of the 1,500-strong Valley workforce still toiling to bring power to the national grid. "The region's gone into economic decline," he said. "There's no new industry, no new replacement generators being built. The whole place is facing extinction.\~[That's] the best description." That is not strictly correct, with employment growth and investment in areas as diverse as aquaculture, hydrogen and tourism already showing promise and expansion. But there are no replacements for the thousands of power jobs already gone, and there are added difficulties in helping coal workers transition to jobs in new industries. Mr Dyke, the Victorian branch secretary of the mining and energy division of the CFMMEU mega-union, is worried his highly skilled colleagues will not\~be able to find well-paid jobs as more coal-fired stations reach the end of their life. "The members sort of understand that they need to find other work\~as old stations close," he said. "[But]\~no new ones will be built. And so the question is, with the power industry expertise,\~where do they go? What do they move into? That question hasn't been answered yet." Despite the challenges, there is hope There is a 150km\~pipeline sending cash from Treasury in Melbourne's Collins Street to The Valley. Sitting inside the newly constructed Morwell Innovation Centre, funded by the Latrobe Valley Authority, Chris Barfoot sees it working. The centre is run by Federation University with a mixture of classrooms, commercial tenancies and offices for researchers working on the future of energy. "We are seeing a lot of great things," he said. "Far more solar farms, wind farms, offshore wind, the potential of hydrogen developments. "We have an incredibly skilled workforce. And that's what's fuelling the excitement in some ways\~because we're seeing that we're going to build these new things." Mr Barfoot now helps build community-based energy projects\~like solar panels at Neerim South's hospital, battery systems at the Lucknow Football Club and a small solar farm in remote Mallacoota "I think the future here is wonderful," he said. "I can't change the past. I can change today in the hope that it changes tomorrow." Back on the edge of the pit, Claire Morrissey is in her office dealing with process of on-boarding new employees. "Change is always hard to come to grips with, especially for an area like the Latrobe Valley, which has relied on a single industry for such a long time," she said. Aussie Broadband has just completed its first carbon audit\~on the way to be carbon neutral. Ms Morrissey\~is aware\~the flammable substance that has powered her community for generations has to be phased out. "But it's not new news. We've been seeing the slowdown of coal ever since the early 90s when the SEC privatised," she said. "And I think we're getting used to the idea that there needs to be another chapter in the Latrobe Valley's journey  \~in our story, really." \</doc>

London: The minister in charge of next month's crunch Glasgow climate summit has challenged Australia to nearly double its 2030 emissions reduction target and urged Prime Minister Scott Morrison to attend the talks in person. "I would dearly love the Australian Prime Minister to come," Sharma said in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. "I can understand that every leader will have to take into account what is going on domestically but COP26 really matters and we want to see as many world leaders as possible. "You're some of our closest mates in the world, and we need you by our side to demonstrate the unity of purpose that is going to be really essential at this summit." Sharma, a cabinet minister who was elevated to the COP26 presidency by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this year, has been rallying support for a new pact that would bind the world to deeper emissions cuts, a faster phase-out of coal and more cash for poorer nations. Morrison has not decided whether to fly to Glasgow but is preparing to take to cabinet and backbench MPs a formal policy of net-zero emissions by 2050. He is also under pressure to lift Australia's existing goal of cutting pollution by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, although that will be much harder to find agreement on. Warning the world was at a "critical juncture", Sharma said embracing net zero by 2050 was not enough. He cited the UK's goal of slashing dangerous carbon emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030 and Japan's promise of a 46 to 50 per cent cut. "Australia is a major world economy," Sharma said. "And if you compare to where other major world economies are, I hope that we could get to 45 to 50 per cent from Australia. "That would mean they'd be comparable with other major economies in the world." Labor took a 45 per cent target by 2030 to the 2019 federal election - a policy the government claimed would take a "wrecking ball" to the economy. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has since called Labor's pledge "a mistake". But the NSW Liberal government last week promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, building on the same policy unveiled by the Victorian Labor government earlier this year. Sharma said he has had candid conversations with the Australian government over the need to make much deeper cuts before the end of the decade. "I say to them basically what I say to everyone, which is that we need to do more. If we want to ensure that we are at a point of net zero by the middle of the century, then we have to have ambitious 2030 emission-reduction targets which align with that goal." A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in August found a 45 per cent cut by 2030 was essential to meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. "But on the current trajectory, we will see an increase of 16 per cent in emissions by 2030 rather than a reduction," Sharma said. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Australia would take part in the COP26 summit and had a strong record of "meeting and beating" its emissions reduction commitments. "We are working closely with the UK on the technology advances that will be needed for the world to transition to a net zero economy. Technology not taxes is the way to tackle climate change, keep the lights on and keep people in jobs. This will continue to be at the heart of Australia's response." The government has promised to release an updated 2030 projection and its long-term strategy ahead of the Glasgow meeting. The more ambitious action from NSW and Victoria could help the government lift its 2030 target of a 26 to 28 per cent cut to something approaching 35 per cent, but the politics within the Coalition is fraught and most cabinet ministers still do not know what Morrison is planning just three weeks out from the Glasgow summit. Sharma said the urgency of the climate crisis warranted bold decisions from Australia. "Australia is a great friend, and I really want one of my closest mates to come to my party and I want them to sing the same songs," he said. "And that in a climate context means more ambition on cutting emissions and it means more support in terms of financing for developing countries." Asked whether it was possible to achieve net-zero emissions without a price on carbon - which Morrison and Albanese are opposed to - Sharma stressed the international landscape was shifting rapidly. "I mean, even China now has an emissions trading scheme," he said. "It is internationally acknowledged that countries are going to have to domestically and internationally address the whole issue of carbon pricing and carbon leakage - every country will have to get there. "And so my advice to any country is to start to think about this now." Sharma also thanked the Morrison government and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor for assisting Pacific islands attendees with travel to the Glasgow event. More than 20,000 people are expected to arrive in the Scottish city during the first two weeks of November. Johnson recently said the gathering would be held "in the full glare of the global spotlight". "And when the summit ends, when most of the world has committed to decisive, game-changing action, it will be clear to all which of us has lacked the courage to step up," he said.

Less than one month ago, I returned from COP26 - one of the most critical global climate meetings in a generation. The Fijian delegation went to Glasgow with the interests of the Pacific and Small Island Developing States at the centre of our approach. We knew from experience that we were involved in a long-term process. But we also knew that COP26 needed to urgently resolve several issues that were holding up progress on both mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its impacts. While we were pleased that the parties agreed to keep warming to under 1.5 degrees, we are deeply concerned the pledges made so far will not take us there. It is also clear that many, including Australia, have placed far too much emphasis on net zero by 2050, given that the best hope for limiting temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees is contingent on what we do between now and 2030. The agreement in the Glasgow climate pact to review and upgrade 2030 targets by 2022 was therefore one of the most welcome outcomes of COP26 . All signatory parties will have to bring greater ambition to COP27 next year, particularly the largest emitters - and Australia is in the top 20 of global emitters. We encourage Australia to reconsider its comments it will not revisit its 2030 targets. The opportunity to contest this was during COP26 , not after it. While COP26 did not achieve the commitments we need on the whole, it did provide the language and decisions needed to increase pressure on those who continue to shirk their share of the burden. We also need to see more ambition from the Australian government on its dangerous addiction to coal. The impacts and costs of climate change are all too real for Pacific islanders, and we can't escape the science. In light of this reality, Fiji went to Glasgow with some very specific objectives on financing for adaptation. We had struggled to get developed countries to follow through on their commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020. Since Glasgow, we now have an agreement for independent monitoring of those commitments to ensure we achieve the $100 billion target as soon as possible. In that vein, I commend Australia for its new Indo-Pacific Carbon Offset Scheme (IPCOS). Trading in carbon credits will help fill the gaps in financing for adaptation. It is not a long-term solution, nor is it an alternative to action to drive down carbon emissions, but it has merit. Australia's IPCOS will mean that Fijian resource owners and investors in renewable energy can generate carbon units that can be sold to Australian companies at an attractive price. Empowered by the legal framework established by our new Climate Change Act, this creates strong incentives to keep natural resources intact in Fiji and attract investments in nature-based solutions. We are also very pleased that Australia pledged to increase its climate finance commitment by $500 million for the Pacific and south-east Asia. Agreements like this recognise that, ultimately, the stakes are the same for all of us - survival, plain and simple. Just as we are moving communities to high ground to escape sea-level rise, we keep hold of the moral high ground, and we believe that requires us to do more. We are one of the first countries - if not the first - to adopt a Climate Change Act which means ministries must consider the climate impact of every program, every initiative and every expenditure. A growing majority of governments and businesses have discarded the tired notion that economic progress and environmental protection are at odds. Profitable business, strong economies and effective climate action go hand in hand. It is time to create a new era for the planet we call home. Frank Bainimarama is Prime Minister of Fiji. He will be presenting at the Carbon Market Institute's Australasian Emission Reduction Summit today. \</doc>

More than 40 countries have signed an agreement at COP26 , the latest UN climate change summit in Glasgow, HYPERLINK to phase out coal in electricity generation. The signatories include some of the world's biggest coal burners: Canada, Poland, Vietnam, South Korea, Ukraine and Indonesia. The larger of these economies pledge to cease using coal in their power sectors in the 2030s, while the smaller ones promise the same during the following decade. Aside from generating electricity, coal is used to fuel iron and steel furnaces and cement kilns, and to a lesser extent, household heating systems. The mining and burning of coal still contribute HYPERLINK https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1783/2019/ over 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so rapidly phasing it out and replacing it with clean alternatives is a priority for international action on climate change. Coal supplied HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/britains-electricity-since-2010-wind-surges-to-second-place-coal-collapses-and-fossil-fuel-use-nearly-halves-129346 41% of the UK's electricity HYPERLINK https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/journey-to-net-zero-stories/2020-greenest-year-record-britain 1.6% in 2020 . Much of the shortfall left by coal has been met by natural gas - another fossil fuel. Swapping old coal plants for new gas power stations designed to operate well into the 2050s HYPERLINK https://carbontracker.org/reports/put-gas-on-standby/ isn't a solution to the problem, even if gas is a less carbon-intensive fuel than coal. There is no sensible alternative to replacing coal with renewable sources like solar and wind - with battery storage to fill gaps in supply - as quickly as possible. Despite progress on renewables, coal-fired power generation is rising again in the wake of the pandemic, both in https://energypost.eu/germany-2021-coal-generation-is-rising-but-the-switch-to-gas-should-continue/ Germany and the HYPERLINK https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/18/business/coal-power-climate-crisis/index.html US . Meanwhile, China's government has mandated an HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-coal-prices-dive-11-beijing-plans-intervene-ease-power-crunch-2021-10-22/ expansion in coal production Most of the largest coal consumers - Australia, China, the US, India and South Africa - have not joined the Glasgow coal phase-out agreement. China's recent ban on new financing for overseas coal power is HYPERLINK https://globalenergymonitor.org/press-release/1953/ expected to axe 44 plants HYPERLINK https://globalenergymonitor.org/press-release/1953 in the planning stages Why is coal such a stubborn relic of energy systems around the world - even where cleaner alternatives like solar power are cheaper? And what can be done about it? Breaking the political might of coal Coal is HYPERLINK https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1b58#fnref-erlac1b58bib63 still seen as a cheap, abundant and reliable source of electricity. In many of the countries in which it looms largest, such as China, India, South Africa and Indonesia, state-owned companies tend to dominate the power and mining sectors. These powerful interests deep within government offer some of the staunchest opposition to phasing out coal. It's often assumed that rapidly eliminating coal mining and burning will inevitably mean impoverishing particular countries and regions where the coal industry is a major employer, not to mention lost tax revenues used to fund a range of public services. Given that most coal plants in the developing world are relatively new, retiring them early also risks heavy financial losses for their owners. The idea of a just transition (though subject to debate) in the coal power sector would involve supporting miners and other workers to retrain and use their expertise to contribute to new or established low-carbon sectors, including renewable energy. Industrial strategies that follow this path could avoid some of the worst deprivation which has HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/ending-coal-use-blighted-scottish-communities-a-just-transition-to-a-green-economy-must-support-workers-170003 blighted coal communities There are no insurmountable technical barriers to replacing coal in power generation either. It's already underway in countries like the US, where a power utility recently HYPERLINK struck a deal with its largest retail customer to retire some of its coal plants early and replace them with solar power. Replacing coal in steelmaking and cement plants is more difficult, but also possible. Steel furnaces can be powered by electricity, and green hydrogen fuel is already being trialled by [multinational cement firms in Europe] and steel producers in HYPERLINK https://www.globalcement.com/magazine/articles/1189-the-multiple-benefits-of-green-hydrogen-for-the-decarbonisation-of-cement-production Germany and HYPERLINK https://newatlas.com/energy/h2gs-green-hydrogen-steel/ Sweden . While green hydrogen remains significantly more expensive than coal or gas, further investment in the technology needed to produce it - plus the continued decline in the cost of green electricity supplying it - may make it as cheap as fossil fuels sooner than expected. For large economies which are heavily dependent on coal power, particularly China, the most serious barriers to eliminating this fossil fuel are political. Countries with experience in phasing out coal, such as the UK, must work closely with China, Indonesia, India and others to find pathways for replacing coal power with renewables that are economically and technologically viable. Designing social policies that lighten the burden on communities dependent on coal for livelihoods can help overcome resistance to change. Coal-dependent states must also allocate hefty sums of additional investment to not just expand clean energy generation, which will eventually pay for itself through lower energy bills and public health benefits, but also to limit the financial damage from retiring existing coal mines and plants.

In 1997 leaders from around the world met in Kyoto, Japan, to sign an agreement on curbing emissions to fight climate change. In its 20 pages there is a passage that became known as "the Australia clause". Article 3.7, which the Howard government's environment minister Robert Hill pushed for during the Kyoto talks, allowed Australia to reach the targets set for it by including in the carbon ledger emissions saved due to new state laws preventing farmers from clearing land, rather than by significantly reducing emissions. No one can deny that Australia kept its side of the bargain struck in Kyoto. But just on a week before the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow begin, the nature of that bargain is precisely what worries those organising the talks. If the 2015 Paris Agreement's vision of holding warming to 1.5 degrees is to stand a chance of being met, it will not be enough to observe what one senior United Nations official calls the "creatively ambiguous" letter of the deal; nations will have to live up to its spirit. And for Australia and others, that means committing to deeper emissions cuts. "We are on the verge of the abyss and we cannot afford a step in the wrong direction," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres when asked five weeks ago about the prospects for the Glasgow talks. "I'm not desperate, but I'm tremendously worried." When it was signed, the Paris Agreement went nowhere near meeting its declared targets. Instead nations agreed to commit to their voluntary targets known as Nationally Determined Contributions that "reflect the highest possible ambition". Then, as years went on, they were expected to increase those targets. If nations lifted their targets, the world might hold warming to 1.5 degrees. Yet so far Australia has made no move to rachet up the pledge Tony Abbott made at the Paris talks to reduce Australian emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce says it is unlikely that his party would support an improved commitment, even as Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues negotiations with Joyce and his party room over what commitments the Coalition can accept. Despite this uncertainty, a broad picture of what Australia might offer the world is emerging from the political white noise, and the world is taking notice. The Australian government's "preference" for hitting net zero by 2050 now appears likely to become a firm commitment, with Morrison telling colleagues he plans to forge ahead even without the support of a small group of Nationals critics. But the 2050 target is just the price of admission, says Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at the Australian National University; it is the lowest hurdle a nation can clear to be taken seriously at the talks. In Glasgow the focus will be on 2030 targets. Most observers now believe that Morrison will travel to Glasgow armed with evidence that Australia is likely to beat its 2030 target by a healthy margin, potentially bringing its reductions close to 40 per cent. Would such a projection satisfy Australia's international peers? Not all of them, says Jotzo, also a lead author on the key climate reports prepared by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Jotzo says Australia is already out of step with what many other nations have pledged.As Alok Sharma, the British cabinet minister who is president of the COP26 talks, puts it, the Group of 20 wealthy nations emit 80 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution and are the key to preventing catastrophic climate change. Among G20 nations, Australia has the second-highest per person emissions after Saudi Arabia and will be among the last to commit to net zero. It has among the weakest 2030 targets and will be one of the few not to increase them. Jotzo also notes that in having such high per capita emissions, Australia has greater opportunity for reductions. Ambitious federal policies to speed up the displacement of fossil energy, help industry invest in cleaner processes and equipment, accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles or even introduce motor vehicle emissions standards in line with global norms would have a huge impact on national emissions. Instead, he says, the government has a history of setting itself easy targets. As was the case with Kyoto, land-use changes and the deployment of renewables by households and state governments will account for Australia's success in meeting its relatively weak 2030 goals, Jotzo says: "It's like an athlete setting themselves the goal of running 100 metres in 35 seconds and then celebrating when he achieves it." Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and a former IPCC lead author, agrees.Australia's key international friends, the US, Britain and Canada, he says, "have left political blood on the floor" in their efforts to reach credible targets. "If Australia marches in and says \' don't worry we're going to beat our target' they are going to say, 'well, why don't you put it into law? Why can't you match what we are doing?" Not all observers are equally certain a projection, rather than a commitment, would be so poorly received. One of Australia's former lead climate negotiators, Professor Howard Bamsey, believes if a projection was buttressed by a credible emissions reductions plan in line with net zero by 2050, it might be welcomed. But he adds: "I just don't see how you get to [net zero by] 2050 without substantially beating the current 2030 target." On October 10, Sharma told The Financial Times he hoped Morrison would do more: "Australia are our closest mates, and I want them to come to our party and sing the same songs - and that means making ambitious commitments on emissions reductions by 2030 and, obviously, a net zero target." Alex Scott, who heads a climate diplomacy and geopolitics team at the British environmental think tank E3G said that far from being seen as more ambitious, a projection would be regarded as breaking Australia's Paris promise: "The IPCC says we need to halve emissions by 2030. Australia's current targets aren't even close to their fair share and will be laughed out of the room." Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor disagrees. Earlier this week, he emphasised that Australia had achieved a 21 per cent reduction on emissions since 2005. "Now that's stronger performance than countries like Canada and New Zealand - big commodity exporters like Australia. It's stronger than the United States," he said. "It's stronger than Japan. It's stronger than the OECD average. And it's certainly stronger than China, that's seen emissions rise over 70 per cent in that time frame. "Australia's emissions accounting is the global gold standard. No other country offers more comprehensive or timely reporting. We prepare our accounts according to IPCC guidelines and they are reviewed annually by expert teams assembled by the UN." And even if the world does disapprove of whatever package Morrison can eventually secure from the Nationals and bring to Glasgow, does it really matter? By design the Paris Agreement lacks explicit penalties for a perceived failure to properly contribute. Jotzo and Hare argue that Australia aligning itself with a handful of nations reluctant to act rather than its traditional peers and friends has its own costs. The European Union has already declared it will introduce a tax on imports of carbon-intensive goods crossing its borders from nations without their own carbon taxes. The proposal would have little impact on Australia at present, but that will change if it is replicated more widely.And diplomatic issues have a tendency to be linked, even if not explicitly, says Hare. Australia's closest strategic allies have declared climate change to be among their greatest concerns. How long will it be before the climate issue is raised in talks over other issues? Even aside from national self-interest, friendly nations are concerned that Australia's positioning weakens the broader push for action. Doug Sonnek, economic counsellor at the US embassy in Canberra, told the Herald and The Age that international concern about Australia's stance went beyond the amount of emissions its targets allowed: "There is also concern that in standing apart from an otherwise united effort by developed nations in pushing for action, Australia makes it harder for that bloc to urge more action from large developing major emitting nations such as China, India and Indonesia." Richie Merzian, director of climate and energy policy at the progressive think tank the Australia Institute, says that if the Australian position gives cover to other nations not to act, the Morrison government would share the blame for COP26 failing. Australia has risked and worn international opprobrium on climate in the past. During the last COP meeting in Madrid in 2019 Laurence Tubiana, a former French environment minister and architect of the Paris accord, called Australia a cheat over a dispute about another carbon accounting mechanism, so-called Kyoto carry-over credits. "If you want this carry-over it is just cheating," she told The Financial Times. "Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris Agreement." Way back in 1997, after the Kyoto talks in which Australia secured not only the Australia clause but an 8 per cent increase in emissions, then EU environmental policy spokesman Peter Jorgensen described the outcome as "wrong and immoral ... a disgrace". This time the stakes are higher. There is less time for the world to commit to more action. COP26 Even the Queen has signalled her displeasure, allowing herself to be overheard venting frustration at world leaders who had not yet committed to attend. "It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do," she said. The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. . \</doc>

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Patrick Suckling is Australia's former ambassador for the environment, and he led Australia's Paris agreement negotiations. Patrick, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there's a tinge of disappointment around the outcomes from Glasgow. How do you read the summit agreement? PATRICK SUCKLING, FMR AMBASSADOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT: I think it's a significant step forward. I mean, more needs to be done but significant things have been achieved at COP. So I think the Prime Minister has been a little bit unkind to himself. I mean, number one, ambition has been significantly raised in terms of climate action. Ambition, not only at the lead up to the COP but at the COP, 90 per cent of global GDP is now covered by net zero commitments. LEIGH SALES: If the world abides by what's been agreed at Glasgow, how much warmer will the planet be by say 2100? It sounds like you think that 1.5 degrees is still achievable? PATRICK SUCKLING: Yes, 1.5 degrees is definitely achievable and some analysis around the COP said that already from the commitments made, about 2.4 degrees was achievable, if not 1.8 degrees. So given that this is the first year actually of the Paris Agreement kicking off and this is a critical decade of climate action, I'm pretty confident the 1.5 degree pathway is still achievable, especially as the COP has asked countries to come back next year with new plans, and further ambition, more actions in addition to the kind of commitments there are a range of initiatives, as you know, the methane pledge, the deforestation pledge but very significantly, this COP in my experience as ambassador, way more than ever before, the presence of business and the business community understanding the imperative of climate action but also understanding the opportunities, the economies moving in that direction and businesses is at the COP like never before. In fact, standout outcome from business was 220 asset managers aligning $130 trillion to net zero emissions which in itself will drive significant action faster and further. LEIGH SALES: The summit document calls for a phasing down of coal. It says nothing about gas and oil production. What's the significance of that? PATRICK SUCKLING: The significance of phasing down coal is that's never been explicitly mentioned before though. Of course, the Paris Agreement by implication means that fossil fuels or unabated fossil fuels have to go and that's the change you're seeing in the global economy. Over time, coal will go, the curtains are closing on coal. Everybody recognises that and this summit made that much more explicit for the first time ever in agreed text. LEIGH SALES: Is it fair to say that at this point, whether the world will make significant progress on global warming is going to come down to the actions of a relatively small number of powerful nations, chiefly China, India and the US? PATRICK SUCKLING: The big emitters matter, obviously. The US and China are a good 40 per cent of global emissions and the agreement that they made at COP is significant in of itself given the hostilities between them and strategic competition between China and the United States but the agreement that they made on climate change is a major step forward. But everyone has to play their part and everybody coming to the COP and underlining the urgency of climate action and underlining their own commitments, reinforces global resolve, including for the big emitters. LEIGH SALES: Patrick Suckling, thanks for your time. PATRICK SUCKLING: Thank you Leigh. \</doc>

ABSTRACT The UN's latest climate change report catalogues the 'empty pledges' that will make the world 'unliveable', says Secretary General Antonio Guterres. FULL TEXT UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has blasted politicians and businesses in the wake of a grave climate crisis assessment."It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world," Guterres said of the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released on Monday."Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness," he continued. "Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying." Addressing the world's population, he said: "Demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale."The IPCC report said actions such as drastically cutting fossil fuel use, growing forests and eating less meat were needed to contain global warming to 1.5C above\~\~pre-industrial temperatures.Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history. The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2C by century's end."We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments," Guterres said."But current climate pledges would (still) mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises." At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity."It's now or never," IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement with the report \- the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions \- making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments.Some scientists described the process as "excruciating," and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday.Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording."Different countries have different interests," IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx. "Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word."with Reuters \</doc>

Australia's\~carbon reduction efforts\~are receiving global scrutiny  and in\~a grassy paddock on the Mornington Peninsula, outside Melbourne, the impact is being felt right now. Allison Hawke, director of development at renewable energy company Maoneng, gestures to where a $170 million battery will be built in the coming year\~to meet the needs of 40,000 households. "The battery is intended to charge itself during the daytime, when there's rooftop solar and other forms of generation creating an excess of power in the grid, and then discharge it during that dinnertime peak period," she said. Ms Hawke would like to see hundreds of similar batteries across the nation\~but says Australia's\~targets for reducing carbon emissions are too weak to provide businesses with enough incentive to invest. "The policy vacuum is slowing down the rate of transition," she says. "Greater policy certainty would help increase the rate of the investment in the industry, in what will be a very big industry with all kinds of businesses involved." Referencing the world's greatest sprinter, she adds\~that Australia's energy market  \~and its high carbon emissions  \~will have to change. "We're sort of plodding along, we're really just sort of picking ourselves up and getting moving," she says. "We really need to be going at more of an\~Usain Bolt pace." She says because Australia has been slow to shift, other nations are gaining the advantages of investment in green technology:\~jobs and a better environment. 'We're faffing about here in Australia' It's a month until HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-27/scott-morrison-decision-co26-climate-conference-glasgow/100493884 world leaders meet in Glasgow Ahead of COP26 , the United Nations' 26th climate change conference, the leaders of some of the largest countries on Earth have been lifting their HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-20/climate-change-ipcc-australia-uk-conference-glasgow/100392252 commitments to reduce carbon emissions . "This year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis,"\~US President Joe Biden has told the United Nations general assembly. "The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world  and you all know it and feel it  represent what the secretary-general has rightly called 'code red for humanity'." "The scientists and experts are telling us that we're fast approaching a point of no return,\~in the literal sense," Mr Biden continued. "To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, every nation needs to bring their highest-possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow for COP26 and then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time." Australia has endured more than a decade of toxic politics centred around putting a price on carbon pollution, arguably costing the careers of four prime ministers. We are turning up to COP26 promising far less action than similarly developed countries. "We're faffing about here in Australia," Carbon Market Institute chief executive John Connor tells The Business. "We need to recognise we've got carbon prices, we've got carbon markets. Let's put the political posturing aside, evolve and reform those markets."\~ "Global capital is going to move away if we become a clunky and polluting economy that isn't facing up to the risks\~or the opportunities." Risk of global capital going elsewhere Earlier this year, the Reserve Bank governor told farmers the conglomerates that were buying their products were already asking what they were doing to reduce emissions and offset the carbon. "I participate in many international meetings, often kind of late at night time, and a very frequent question that comes up in those meetings is what is Australian business doing to decarbonise," Philip Lowe has told the Australian Farm Institute Conference in Toowoomba. "You're relying on overseas markets\~and\~increasingly\~overseas investors are asking about the carbon content of production  \~and that's a trend that's only going to continue." The federal government is already changing its tune, setting up targets closer to what its international allies are asking for and trying to prevent investors from withdrawing from Australia. "We cannot run the risk that markets falsely assume that we are not transitioning in line with the rest of the world," Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said last week. "Were we to find ourselves in that position, it would increase the cost of capital and reduce its availability." Mr Connor, from the Carbon Market Institute, says the creation of a carbon price  \~a concept that has bedevilled both major parties for more than a decade  \~will happen either by us\~or to us. "We're effectively getting carbon prices through capital strikes (investors withdrawing)\~or\~higher financing costs," he says. Additionally, countries are beginning to put "tolls"\~on exporters that aren't paying to deal with carbon-intensive products like steel and aluminium. The most pressing is the European Union's HYPERLINK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism "Europe is looking to implement them, but also importantly we're seeing Japan, Korea, and other countries looking at that," Mr Connor says. "So that's another way in which we're going to have carbon pricing imposed upon us\~if we don't make the reforms here at home that suit\~the Australian economy the best." Climate, not China or COVID, could dominate our future\~ Projects like the Mornington Peninsula battery show the great potential for Australia. But there are huge difficulties too.\~We're the world's second largest exporter of thermal coal, which is used for making energy, and we're the largest exporter of gas. Both create substantial emissions. On a US visit, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said our role supplying fossil fuels to Asia for energy would eventually end. "We have always been the primary exporter of energy into this region. Now that is going to change," HYPERLINK https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/prime-minister-scott-morrisons-clean-energy-export-plan/news-story/239b6706762450519ead7d3a39c5d786 he told The Australian newspaper "And we need to make sure we leap from one lily pad to the next in making that change." But the federal government hasn't signed up to the target of net zero\~ achieving balance between the amount of carbon emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere  \~by far-off 2050, much less targets for 2030 being pushed by business and advocacy groups. The former head of the Australian Coal Association, Ian Dunlop, says it's not submarines, China or COVID-19 that will dominate our lives in the next 20 years, but rather climate change. "Emission levels globally have to drop extremely quickly, and at the moment\~they're going up at worst-case levels," he says. "If we don't start to address climate change, the entire global financial system is under threat, threat of collapse." The co-author of a report about the risk climate brings to banking, Degrees Of Risk: Can the banking system survive climate warming of 3 C?, Mr\~Dunlop stresses the urgency of acting now. "What we do in the next three to five years\~is going to determine the future of humanity and that's the seriousness of the situation we're actually in," he says. \</doc>

Glasgow | China and the United States have sprung a shock at the COP26 summit, unveiling a sweeping joint declaration that heralds "concrete and more pragmatic" co-operation across the waterfront of climate change issues. The surprise agreement could signal an important rapprochement in US-China tensions, or at least insulate climate change from the broader friction. And it may help unlock a deal at the bogged-down COP26 summit. "In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between China and the US than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our co-operation," Chinese climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters in Glasgow late on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT). The deal, which the two sides said had been nutted out over the course of more than 30 meetings since the start of the year, commits both countries to step up action "in the 2020s". The agreement comes barely more than a week after Joe Biden launched a rhetorical broadside in Glasgow against the absent President Xi Jinping, saying the Chinese leader had failed to show leadership on climate. The deal will cover clean electricity, clean coal, methane emissions, deforestation, carbon capture and storage, and joint work to implement their 2030 emissions reductions targets and the broader 2015 Paris Agreement. COP26 , but "the big significance of this is geopolitical". "The US and China have signalled they will end the war of words that marred the past days. They will now build climate co-operation bilaterally and in multilateral fora," he said. Mr Kerry said it was vital for the world's two biggest emitters to work together to tackle climate change. "The US and China have no shortage of differences; but on climate change, co-operation is the only way to get this job done," he said. "We cannot reach our goals unless we work together ... We need to raise ambition and to take action in this decade." Mr Kerry said the declaration would help deliver a strong COP26 outcome, describing it as "a step we can build on in order to help close the gap". Beijing has been resisting many elements of the COP26 package proposed by summit host Britain, including a shift in the goalposts from holding global warming at 2 degrees Celsius or below, to "keeping 1.5C within reach". It remains to be seen whether the new agreement might break down some of China's opposition - and whether that would leave other holdouts such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and on some issues Australia, more isolated. COP26 The declaration does not commit China to any new target, deadline or pledge, except that Beijing will present a plan to COP27 next year on how it plans to cut methane emissions. The US last week orchestrated a pledge signed by more than 100 countries, not including China or Australia. \</doc>

Scott Morrison has met Prince Charles on the sidelines of the United Nations COP26 climate conference. Mr Morrison had a one-on-one meeting with the Prince, a vocal environmental campaigner, on Tuesday. The meeting came after a function on Monday night for world leaders, hosted by the royal family. Prince Charles has given strong speeches about the need for urgent action on climate change at both the G20 in Rome and at the UN summit. He said COP26 COP26 . Mr Morrison began day two at the summit with a side meeting attended by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "To address climate change you have to reduce emissions but we also understand the challenges," Mr Morrison said. The Prime Minister also met the International Atomic Agency and the International Energy Agency. Australia has a moratorium on nuclear energy, but there has been a move by some - particularly among the Nationals - for it to be considered as a viable energy source. Australia has the third biggest reserves of uranium. Small modular reactors are being pushed to be considered and Britain and Australia have set up a research partnership to pursue the possibility of it in the future. But the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act still has a hard ban in place. Mr Morrison will leave Glasgow to return to Australia on Wednesday, however, COP26 will continue for another two weeks. All hopes rest on an agreement on emissions being reached at the summit. The aim is to secure net zero carbon emissions and keep the Paris Agreement target of a 1.5C temperature rise within reach in order to curb the impact of global warming. On Monday, Charles delivered one of his most important speeches in five decades of environmental lobbying, warning leaders in a keynote address at the opening session of COP26 : "Time has run out." \</doc>

Australia would bid to host a United Nations climate change summit in partnership with other Pacific nations if Labor won next month's federal election as part of the federal opposition's bid to improve the nation's credentials with the region on the issue. The annual Conference of the Parties - known as COP - has brought together the world's nations for deliberations for almost three decades, taking climate from a fringe issue to a global priority, including in 1995 for the Kyoto Protocol and in 2015 for the Paris accord. The event is poised to take on greater significance in coming years as the world grapples with holding global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2030 while balancing major geo-strategic issues such as Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas and the efforts of global powerhouses China and India to decarbonise their growing economies. Opposition climate and energy spokesman Chris Bowen said if Labor won the federal election, bidding to host a COP would "send a clear message that Australia is under new management". "Seeking to host COP with those Pacific partners who wish to co-host it with us will be an excellent opportunity to remind the world about the issues at stake and enable our Pacific brothers and sisters to make their case to the world in a most direct way," he said. The federal government - which committed Australia to a net zero emissions target by 2050 at COP26 in Glasgow - has faced growing criticism from Pacific nations such as Fiji, Tuvalu and Samoa in recent years for not lifting its climate targets or moving to phase out coal-fired power stations at a quicker rate. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese blamed Australia's lack of action on climate change for Solomon Islands' decision to sign a security pact with China, but Defence Minister Peter Dutton said those claims were "completely without foundation" and "not the reality". Climate scientists warn that rising sea levels are already having a major impact on society, economies and ecosystems in Pacific Islands. It also increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones, storm surges and coastal flooding. Maina Talia, secretary of the Tuvalu Climate Action Network, said the survival of his homeland of three reef islands and six atolls, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, depended on the world's willingness to end its addiction to fossil fuels. "It is also imperative that rich polluting countries like Australia significantly increase financial assistance to help us adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already here," he said. Australia has formally committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 26-28 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels under the Paris agreement, but the government says it is on track for a cut of 34 per cent on current settings. While Labor has set a target for cuts of at least 43 per cent in the same timeframe, a new report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this week said the world needed a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by the end of the decade and is on track for a 14 per cent increase. The next COP - in 2023 - will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates. \</doc>

A week from today, a crucial round of United Nations climate change negotiations will begin in Glasgow and the stakes could not be higher. By the end, we'll know how far nations are willing to go to address humanity's biggest challenge. So is COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.npr.org/2021/05/11/995849954/renewable-energy-capacity-jumped-45-worldwide-in-2020-iea-sees-new-normal booming , HYPERLINK the tide is turning HYPERLINK https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/markets-moving-economic-costs-australias-climate-inaction/ economic costs of not acting on climate change are becoming ever more obvious. But if history has taught us anything, no country at the summit will agree to do more on climate change than it believes it can do at home. In other words, domestic politics is what drives international negotiations. The first COP, or Conference of Parties, was held in Berlin in 1995. About a quarter of a century later, it will meet for the 26th time. COP26 will determine the direction of key aspects of the fight against global warming. Chief HYPERLINK among them is how well nations have implemented their commitments under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2?, and the extent to which they will increase that ambition. Other issues on the agenda include climate finance to developing nations, adaptation to climate change and carbon trading rules. Starting on October 31, hundreds of government delegates will attend for two weeks of complex and intense negotiations over the specific text of the agreement. Typically, what delegates can't sort out is left to political leaders, who negotiate the thorniest issues. Historically, final agreement occurs in the wee hours of the final session. Outside the convention centre is the unofficial COP, which is more like a world climate expo. Thousands of representatives from business, civil society and elsewhere - from bankers and billionaires, to students and survivalists - gather for panel discussions, exhibitions and protests. Progress is slow Global climate talks involve people from all around the globe with different interests, preferences, and mandates (what negotiators sometimes call "red lines"). As you can imagine, progress can be slow. Almost 200 nations are signed up to the Paris Agreement, and agreement is by consensus. That means just one country can hold up progress for hours or even days. Cynics - more often than not, those wanting to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/fossil-fuel-misinformation-may-sideline-one-of-the-most-important-climate-change-reports-ever-released-165887 delay climate action It's true, talk is slow. But it's also much better than coercion, and without the negotiations countries would face much less pressure to act. It's also true that over the last 25 years, these negotiations have redefined how the world thinks and acts on climate change. After all, it was the COP in Paris that tasked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to provide a https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/ special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5? above pre-industrial levels. Its findings reverberated around the world.

Last year it was all about making promises. This year it is all about keeping them. Climate and sustainability consultants say six months ago the most frequently asked question by corporate Australia was what commitments they should be making in the lead-up to the United Nations climate change conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. Fast forward six months, under increasing scrutiny and pressure from internal and external stakeholders, the conversation and tone has changed. "It's all about delivery," says Andrew Charlton, who spearheads Accenture's sustainability services. Given that most environmental targets are long-term, companies are being pressured to chunk them down into near-term demonstrable milestones. "Investors, activists, customers and staff are demanding to know what a 2050 target looks like in two years' time," PwC ESG leader Liza Maimone says. To appreciate just how far the needle has moved on climate action, Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley points to Origin Energy boss Frank Calabria's decision in February to close the nation's biggest electricity generator, the Eraring coal-fired power plant, seven years early in 2025. The announcement generated a mere whimper of media attention and government response compared with the furore surrounding AGL's flagged closure of the Liddell power plant back in 2019. Energy Minister Angus Taylor was not even consulted. At the same time, energy security concerns arising from the Ukraine-Russia conflict have accelerated the decarbonisation plans of companies like Visy Industries, even as it sends oil and gas prices through the roof. "It's a real point of inflection as they make this shift from commitment to delivery and the first step is how do we get a handle on the picture of where we're at, how we're going to measure it, and then report," Charlton says. Once ESG commitments are ushered out of the boardroom onto the factory floor, execution gets granular and often boring. It entails tweaking or embedding a myriad of mundane changes into existing operations and transformation agendas. "We're entering a phase of realism," Charlton says. Companies are becoming more sophisticated in the way they think about ESG. Although climate is the sexy topic de jour and every CEO is expected to have a view, a position and a commitment, some companies, upon conducting their materiality matrix, are finding that climate does not necessarily occupy the top right-hand corner, or that it's not alone there. Healthcare companies, for example, may have a relatively low environmental footprint but a high social impact because of the size of their workforce and duty of care to vulnerable people. Maimone agrees that companies are becoming better at assessing material issues and being able to tell that story. But given the magnitude of the global energy transition, she's yet to encounter an entity for which climate didn't rank in the top three strategic priorities. "Climate is going to be an economy-wide impact, so it can't be discounted," Maimone says. "This is the next industrial revolution. [It will] shift our entire economy and way of doing things. "You very quickly get to a highly complex problem for which we don't have all the solutions today. It can only be solved with great collaboration and partnerships." Mainstream acceptance of climate change as a transformational economic disruption facing business and public policymakers has heightened calls for ESG expertise on boards. A cursory glance through the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report of the ASX 200 will show climate risk and ESG repeatedly raised as leading strategic risks and opportunities. Which begs the question, is there corresponding depth of boardroom experience? EY's climate change and sustainability services partner Adam Carrel says what is readily available is almost exclusively focused on disclosure. He is concerned about "a huge gap in ESG corporate education". Maimone agrees that a gap exists when it comes to base-level ESG skills and capability across corporate Australia. It will require significant investment to get it on par with current levels of digital competency. In the meantime, how companies respond to climate-related interrogations will have far-reaching consequences, according to Stewart Investors' senior investment specialist, Pablo Berrutti. "Many global investors right now see the ASX as a market highly exposed to climate change risks, and will be watching closely to see how companies, as well as our national policy settings, are responding," Berrutti says. Executives argue that a lack of globally consistent ESG reporting standards are preventing them from effectively articulating their climate transition plans and performance. It is directing money into the wrong assets, BHP boss Mike Henry warned The Australian Financial Review Business Summit earlier this month. In a scathing assessment of ESG reporting methodologies, Professor Robert Kaplan, a doyen of balanced scorecard reporting, points out that attempts to aggregate heterogeneous, diverse metrics into a common ESG performance statement introduces highly subjective judgments fraught with personal assumptions, bias, and error. "Each of ESG's three domains has unique measurement opportunities and challenges, a nuance that ESG advocates rarely acknowledge," he says. As a result, ESG in its current form is more a buzzword than a solution to expanded demands for information on corporate performance. Kaplan's warning is starting to resonate. At a meeting earlier this month, the International Federation of Accountants discussed the possibility of fast-tracking its COP26 commitment to develop a consistent and rigorous set of sustainability reporting standards from the current patchwork.AFR \</doc>

"We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe." UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a road map to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson "May I just say to all delegates I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry." COP26 President and British cabinet minister Alok Sharma, referring to a softening of language around coal. "All countries have signed up to this and at the end of the day this is an international agreement and each country will be judged by whether or not they stuck to the commitments they've made." Sharma, when asked by the Herald what the consequences would be for Australia if it did not lift its 2030 emissions cuts target "The COP26 is over. Here's a brief summary: blah, blah, blah. But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever." Climate activist Greta Thunberg "Obviously, we know the old adage that in negotiations you can't let perfect be the enemy of the good. And this is good. It's a powerful statement." US climate envoy John Kerry " COP26 Neville Nicholls, Emeritus Professor at the School of Earth, Atmosphere & Environment at Monash University and former IPCC lead author "By many measures, COP26 was a success. Governments provided more stringent mitigation commitments for short and long-term goals, agreed on new mechanisms to track on the delivery of those promises and further increased their ambition, and touched on many aspects of equity and financial flows, the latter having the biggest absence on new concrete commitments.

AUSTRALIA will be pressured to increase interim targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions next year after the final statement from the COP26 conference in Glasgow called on countries to "revisit and strengthen" their nationally determined contributions for 2030. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced in Glasgow that Australia would get to net zero by 2050, but offered no increase on the 2030 target of cutting emissions by 26-28 per cent. Instead, he provided projections showing Australia was on track to reduce its emissions by 30-35 per cent by 2030. The requirement for Australia to announce an increased 2030 target at the COP27 summit in Egypt in November 2022 is a headache for the government, which had expressed doubt the clause would make its way into the final version of the COP26 statement. Another clause invited the Secretary-General of the UN to convene a meeting of world leaders in 2023 to further consider 2030 targets. The final COP26 declaration also made a first-ever reference to coal and fossil fuel subsidies, although these clauses were watered down after lobbying from China and India. Countries were encouraged to "accelerate" efforts towards the "phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" in the final statement. Coal is Australia's second most valuable export, with $16.3bn earnings from the September quarter, up 80 per cent on the same period in 2020. Modelling that underpins the government's net zero strategy, released on Friday, presumed coal would remain a strong industry in Australia in 2050, albeit at half the value of today. Foreign Minister Marise Payne and the Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said their government "will always stand up for and make decisions in Australia's national interest, and we will do what's right for rural and regional communities". "Australia's economy is almost unique amongst developed countries, with an economy specialised in the production of energy and emissions-intensive commodities. We are the world's fourth largest energy exporter, after Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States," they said. Asked whether the government would increase its 2030 emissions targets as a result of the COP26 statement, Health Minister Greg Hunt told the Insiders program: "We'll continue to update our projections." \</doc>

The push to make it easier for investors to measure their exposure to climate change and its associated financial risks globally has gathered pace, with another key body pushing banks to disclose the full picture of their emissions. The International Sustainability Standards Board, set up on the sidelines of COP26 at Glasgow last year to align standards globally, has followed the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission in saying banks should have to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions produced as a result of what they are financing. Australian banks and other listed companies will have until July 29 to respond to the ISSB, which asks whether they agree with the proposed industry-based disclosure requirements for financed and facilitated emissions. "The biggest banks, the biggest insurers ... I think everybody realises in this industry that it is coming," he said. Indirect, or "scope 3" emissions, which come from a company's suppliers and customers, account for the vast bulk of the financial sector's carbon footprint, Mr Faber said. New Zealand has already said it would mandate climate disclosure, including the banks' financed emissions, from December this year. It is seeking feedback to this latest proposal by April 13. NZ's "external reporting board" analysis showed scope 3 emissions average around 11.5 times higher than direct accountable emissions. For financial institutions, scope 3 emissions account for an even higher share of overall emissions: on average, over 700 times higher than direct emissions. Mr Faber said the industry-specific requirements would be based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, with more concrete details expected by the end of the year. In late March, ISSB said it would also integrate the Global Reporting Initiative's standards into the initiative to help streamline work for corporates, as regulators, including APRA, said the sheer number of different standards was causing headaches. "We are working with international organisations and jurisdictions towards the incorporation of these global baseline proposals into jurisdictional requirements and we intend them to be compatible with jurisdiction-specific requirements to answer the needs of broader stakeholders in terms of sustainability information," Mr Faber said. Emma Newnham, a corporate lawyer specialising in climate disclosure with King & Wood Mallesons, said the draft release of the ISSB standards last week was a key step towards adoption, which would bring some much-needed comparability to sustainability disclosures in the market. "The ISSB's proposed climate standard is based on both the TCFD recommendations, and the industry-based SASB standards," she said said. "Companies that have already begun reporting against those frameworks will be well placed if the ISSB standard is endorsed by IOSCO, sowing the seeds for adoption around the world." A KWM report showed the top 50 ASX-listed companies have started to take a much more proactive approach to climate disclosures, with an increasing focus on measuring and setting interim milestones. It predicted Australia will make such disclosures mandatory - although such a decision will require legislation. Ms Newnham said there was an increasing wave of climate-related litigation emanating in Australia, which was now second only to the United States in the number of cases being filed. "The Santos 'greenwashing' case commenced in 2021 may also have prompted some entities to take a more rigorous approach to their climate reporting," she said in the report. \</doc>

This week's climate change conference in Glasgow offers Australia the prospect of a sunrise industry involving the generation and sale of credits from removing carbon from the atmosphere. If Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement is activated at COP26 , countries will have new opportunities to sell carbon credits abroad to help achieve emissions reduction targets. Australia has a comparative advantage in carbon removal. Its vast tracts of land, extensive coastline and low population density give it an edge, through such activities as forest regeneration and storing carbon in soil and marine environments, over geographically smaller countries with much higher population densities. Australia's sunrise industry in carbon removal would complement other emissions reduction activities on its pathway to net zero emissions - while also helping other countries make good on their commitments. Article 6.2 allows the parties to use "internationally transferred mitigation outcomes" towards achieving their targets. That is, countries would be able to trade in carbon credits generated from eligible emissions reduction activities. If activated at Glasgow, Article 6.2 could enable Australia to negotiate bilateral and regional agreements to trade in Australian carbon credit units issued and regulated by the Australian Clean Energy Regulator. Each ACCU issued represents one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent stored or avoided by a project. Non-government demand for ACCUs is increasing too. It helps explain the sharply rising prices of ACCUs, which have almost doubled in less than a year. This month, ACCUs traded in the spot market hit a record high of more than $33 a tonne. KPMG estimates that with current and foreseeable technologies, Australia could have long-term opportunities in carbon removal, capture and sequestration of up to 100 million tonnes a year by 2050 - about a quarter of current Australian emissions. Further, Australia's relatively well-developed institutional framework, administered by the Clean Energy Regulator, offers a level of integrity in its carbon reduction projects, representing a further competitive advantage in this emerging market. KPMG also estimates that up to three-quarters of global companies have committed to carbon targets. Specifically, 137 countries have signalled net zero emissions by 2050. China, responsible for an estimated 25 per cent of global emissions, has committed to net zero emissions by 2060. Many global companies will want to purchase ACCUs, offering even more opportunity for Australia in the carbon reduction market. This prospectively huge private sector market for carbon credits would supplement, or could even exceed, the value of government-to-government markets. Properly regulated ACCUs can be expected to command a price premium over low-integrity alternatives, whose purchase by companies committing to net zero emissions can give rise to accusations of greenwashing their carbon emissions. It should be said that vigilance will always be required to ensure the highest integrity of ACCUs, in the interests of both their generators and buyers. Moreover, the private sector is demonstrating a willingness to pay a further premium for carbon reduction activities, with associated co-benefits that contribute to their other environmental, social and corporate governance or ESG goals such as positive biodiversity and socio-economic outcomes. A good example is the generation of ACCUs through savanna fire management by Indigenous rangers in northern and central Australia, which command a premium price. Carbon removal activities earning ACCUs also offer new income-earning opportunities for Australian farmers, Indigenous communities and country towns, supplementing their incomes from more conventional activities. However, we offer a strong word of caution, too. The generation of carbon credits should not be used as an easy way out for Australia to reduce its direct emissions. Carbon credits should be seen as a complement to strong decarbonisation efforts, not as a substitute for them. All eyes will be on what happens at the Glasgow conference next week. Especially if Article 6.2 is activated, Australia will have an unsurpassed opportunity to create a sunrise industry for regional Australia in carbon credit generation, just as those areas have prospered from wool, wheat, clean and green agricultural produce and resources. This industry will meet its full potential only if Australia engages fully in global efforts to deal with the challenge of climate change.

The European Union has approved the marketing of a methane-reducing feed additive for dairy cows. The inclusion of the additive in the EU registry, expected in the coming weeks, will mark the first time a feed additive authorised in the EU for environmental benefits can be marketed. The additive, Bovaer, was developed in the past decade by Dutch-based multi-national health and nutrition company Royal DSM. Research includes more than 50 peer-reviewed studies published in independent scientific journals and 48 on-farm trials in 14 countries across four continents. DSM has begun engineering works for a large-scale Bovaer plant at its manufacturing site in Dalry, Scotland. "Bovaer has the power to truly revolutionise the global dairy industry," DSM co-CEO Geraldine Matchett said. "We are extremely proud that, after... research, trials and value-chain collaboration, its potential has been recognised with this historic market approval." Studies show a quarter-teaspoon of Bovaer per cow per day consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by about 30 per cent for dairy cows and up to 90pc for beef cows. Methane has a global warming potential 28 times greater than carbon dioxide, which is why reducing methane emissions was identified at COP26 as one of the most significant short-term means of tackling climate change. More than 100 governments pledged to cut methane emissions by 30pc by 2030, as part of the Global Methane Pledge. The European Commission's confirmation of approval noted the innovative feed additive was safe for use without impacting the quality of dairy products and was the first of its kind to be available within the EU. \</doc>

ABSTRACT The United Nations' latest climate change report catalogues the "empty pledges" that will make the world 'unliveable', says Secretary General Antonio Guterres. FULL TEXT United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has blasted politicians and businesses in the wake of a grave climate crisis assessment."It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world," Guterres said of the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released on Monday."Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness," he continued. "Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying." Addressing the world's population, he said, "Demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale."The IPCC report said actions such as drastically cutting fossil fuel use, growing forests and eating less meat were needed to contain global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history. The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2C by century's end."We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments," Guterres said."But current climate pledges would (still) mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises." At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity."It's now or never," IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement with the report \- the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions \- making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments.Some scientists described the process as "excruciating," and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday.Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording."Different countries have different interests," IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx.\~"Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word."with Reuters \</doc>

At the Glasgow COP26 climate talks overnight, Australia and 123 other countries signed an HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/ agreement promising to end deforestation by 2030. The declaration's signatories, which include global deforestation hotspots such as Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have committed to: working collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. This declaration should be welcomed for recognising how crucial forest loss and land degradation are to addressing climate change, biodiversity decline and sustainable development. But there have been many such declarations before, and it's hard to feel excited about yet another one. What really matters is changing policy domestically; if countries don't change what they are doing at home to bring emissions from fossil fuels to zero and restore degraded lands, declarations like this are meaningless. Read more: Want to beat climate change? Protect our natural forests The good parts The declaration does a good job of joining up interrelated issues that for too long have been treated as separate problems. Signatories say they will: emphasise the critical and interdependent roles of forests of all types, biodiversity and sustainable land use in enabling the world to meet its sustainable development goals; to help achieve a balance between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removal by sinks; to adapt to climate change; and to maintain other ecosystem services. Biodiversity is key to forest conservation and sustainable land use. From there, the signatories promise to: reaffirm our respective commitments, collective and individual, to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the Sustainable Development Goals; and other relevant initiatives. To see commitments under several UN declarations recognised in one place is somewhat of a breakthrough; forests, biodiversity and land-use are often siloed despite the critical links in dealing with these issues. A vast body of research shows planting new trees as a climate action pales in comparison to protecting existing forests. As I have HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/want-to-beat-climate-change-protect-our-natural-forests-121491 written before, restoring degraded forests and expanding them by 350 million hectares will store a comparable amount of carbon as 900 million hectares of new trees [...] Forest ecosystems (including the soil) store more carbon than the atmosphere. Their loss would trigger emissions that would exceed the remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to less than the 2? above pre-industrial levels, let alone 1.5?, threshold. Once intact forests are gone, we can't regain the carbon lost. It is known as HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0738-8 "irrecoverable carbon" The declaration also mentions trade, promising to: facilitate trade and development policies, internationally and domestically, that promote sustainable development, and sustainable commodity production and consumption, that work to countries' mutual benefit, and that do not drive deforestation and land degradation Here, we are starting to get to the real drivers of deforestation. For a long time, there has been too much focus on local drivers of deforestation including local communities. But HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3445 research shows the leading drivers of deforestation are internationally traded agricultural commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and timber. The overall rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined since 2001. We can't tackle forest loss without tackling the trade drivers behind it. Read more: Deforestation: why COP26 agreement will struggle to reverse global forest loss by 2030 The not-so-good parts The main deficiency in the text is that not enough attention is paid to the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities. It is mentioned the countries will "recognise" and "support" the rights of Indigenous peoples but many of these signatories do not have adequate - or, in some cases, any - legislation that actually recognises those rights. Subjugation of these rights to national law has been a problem in previous international agreements.

Following a decade of consultation and public debates, South Africa introduced a carbon tax in June 2019.

The rate was increased annually by inflation plus 2% and reached R134 (around US$8) per tCO?e by the end of 2021. The urgency of the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/un75/climate-crisis-race-we-can-win climate crisis was overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic for a while. Nevertheless, the South African government displayed a renewed climate focus over the past year. First, a HYPERLINK https://www.climatecommission.org.za/ Presidential Climate Commission HYPERLINK https://www.dffe.gov.za/draft_climate_change_bill_2021 National Climate Change Bill COP26 ) held in Glasgow in November 2021, South Africa raised its targets for greenhouse gas emissions. These are contained in the HYPERLINK https://pccommissionflow.imgix.net/uploads/images/1eb85a_75d745eb859d43c288f461810b336dd3-compressed.pdf revised Nationally Determined Contribution submitted under the Paris Climate Agreement. The climate negotiations held at COP26 resulted in a HYPERLINK "watershed" moment in South Africa's energy story. The European Union, France, the UK, the US and Germany HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/climate-finance-for-a-transition-away-from-coal-a-chance-to-change-history-in-south-africa-171680 pledged funding of R131 billion (US$8.5 billion) to South Africa. This climate financing is meant to help South Africa phase out its use of fossil fuels, especially its heavy reliance on coal, and phase in renewable energy. Policy developments HYPERLINK https://www.parliament.gov.za/bill/2300773 "effective climate change response and a long-term, just transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy" . Second, the HYPERLINK National Budget Speech Carbon tax rate increase: The finance minister announced an increase to the carbon tax rate to R144 (about US$9), effective from 1 January 2022. To uphold South Africa's HYPERLINK COP26 commitments , the rate will increase each year by at least US$1 until it reaches US$20. From 2026, government intends to escalate the carbon price more rapidly every year to reach at least US$30 by 2030, and US$120 beyond 2050. Delaying the roll-out of the second phase: The carbon tax is being implemented in three phases, with the second phase originally scheduled to start in January 2023. But the finance minister extended the first phase by three years until 31 December 2025. Until then, taxpayers will continue to enjoy sizeable tax-free allowances which reduce the carbon tax liability. Although the minister did not provide reasons for pushing back the next phase, this might have been done to give taxpayers more time to navigate the complex carbon tax regime. As a result of delaying the second phase, some sectors will remain beyond the reach of the carbon tax for now. These include HYPERLINK agriculture , forestry and other land use and waste sectors, as well as Eskom, the state-owned power utility. Eskom had factored in the projected cost of the carbon tax in its proposed HYPERLINK https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/affordability-concerns-come-to-fore-as-eskom-outlines-case-for-205-hike-2022-01-17 21% increase in electricity prices. It remains to be seen if Eskom will now accordingly reduce the price hike. Carbon budgets: The Climate Change Bill will make it compulsory for taxpayers to participate in the carbon budget system. This process allocates a greenhouse gas emissions allowance to an emitter for a specific period of time. The company's actual emissions arising from its operations should stay within the budgeted allowance. Emitters that have participated in the voluntary carbon budget system are entitled to an additional 5% tax free allowance. Once carbon budgets become mandatory, this allowance will fall away. Those who exceed their mandatory budgets will pay a tax penalty. The finance minister also announced the following tax changes: The tax incentive for energy efficiency will be extended to 31 December 2025. This tax benefit aims to encourage investment into cleaner technologies which improve energy usage. When the National Treasury introduced the carbon tax in 2019, the intent was to avoid passing on the added cost of the carbon tax to consumers through higher electricity prices and more expensive goods. The budget speech announcements have ensured that electricity prices will be buffered against the carbon tax until 31 December 2025. Industries or companies whose international competitiveness could be hampered by the carbon tax, especially when it comes to exports (the mining sector, for example), get a trade exposure allowance. It can reduce their liability by up to 10%. The minister has now increased the threshold for this to kick in, making it more difficult for some companies to achieve the maximum allowance. Going forward The finance minister warned companies that they would encounter "steep taxes" if they failed to put in place plans to reduce their emissions over the coming decade. Emitters would do well to heed the minister's warning, as the postponed deployment of the carbon tax only provides temporary relief. An estimated R1.3 billion in carbon tax revenues was HYPERLINK http://www.treasury.gov.za/comm_media/press/monthly/2201/Table%201.pdf collected in the period from 1 April 2021 to 30 November 2021. While this only makes up 0.15% of the total revenue collections, the carbon tax has the potential to become a significant contributor to the fiscus, especially when the second phase launches. South Africa's revised Nationally Determined Contribution targets are still HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/south-africa/ insufficient to limit global warming to 2\'b0C, not to mention the Paris Climate Agreement target of 1.5\'b0C. The carbon tax has a crucial role in achieving this. The Climate Change Bill needs to be enacted soon to put the country back on track to decarbonise on time.

DAVID Foote says there's one overwhelming reason why producers should be using pain relief on their cattle. "It works," the Australian Country Choice Group director said. "We're using Tri-Solfen and meloxicam as pain relief on all of our calves across all of our properties because they mother up faster and that reduces the chances of mismothering," Mr Foote said. "From a management point of view they're back on mum and back in the paddock faster, which is all about increased weight gain over time. "We've done it because it is good for our calves and it makes our cattle business more productive in addition to helping meet our responsibilities in terms of animal welfare." Mr Foote said he strongly believed the use of pain relief in cattle husbandry operations was essential to sustain community support for the beef industry. "At around $1.30 per or so per treatment when we're talking about what the value of an animal is today, particularly when there is a commercial gain to be made by using pain relief , it's not even a consideration," he said. "Animal welfare continues to be our community licence to operate. "If we don't meet society's expectations, we will struggle at the domestic counter, the export counter and the political counter. "Pain relief products have given the beef industry the opportunity and easy tools to overcome most of society's problems about how we deal with our animals at branding/marking time and at dehorning." Mr Foote said all of the 50,000 calves produced on ACC properties were treated with pain relief agents. With close to 2 million hectares of country and up to 300,000 cattle, ACC Group has grown to become the world's largest family-owned, vertically integrated cattle and beef supply chain organisation. Its whole-of-chain operations include cattle breeding, backgrounding, seedstock production, farming and lot-feeding to beef primary processing and multi-species further processing, value-adding, retail packing and distribution. The jewel in the crown of the Cannon Hill processing plant, which is capable of handling 350,000 head a year. ACC is also on a path to making the business carbon neutral by the red meat industry's target date of 2030. "With COP26 "Up until COP26 the figures were rubbery. Now Australia has an obligation and a responsibility to achieve carbon neutrality." He said ACC was in the process of "understanding, identifying and then managing the targets" needed to make the business carbon neutral, or preferably, carbon positive. \</doc>

The planet will face "doomsday" if world leaders do not pull off a "James-Bond" victory, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the official opening ceremony of the COP26 leaders summit. Mr Johnson opened his address to more than a hundred heads of state with a reference to the fictional spy\~and compared the struggle to stop global warming to a movie-like mission. "But the tragedy is, that this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real," Mr Johnson said. "And the clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines. "It's one minute to midnight on the doomsday clock, and we need to act now. As host\~of the UN\' s global climate change conference,\~the UK is trying to secure one key goal: global net-zero emissions by 2050. Mr Johnson's catchphrase for achieving this is: "coal, cars, cash and trees". "We can phase out the use of cars with hydrocarbon internal combustion (petrol-fuelled)\~engines by 2035," he said. "We can plant hundreds of millions of trees, a trillion. "It's not technologically difficult, and [we can] halt and reverse deforestation by 2030." Mr Johnson also put a definitive target for when he would\~like to see coal-fired power phased out  2040 for developing countries and 2030 in developed countries. Diplomats and negotiators are also working to secure $US100 billion ($132 billion) in annual\~climate funding to support poorer countries. Before official proceedings started, some of the world's most high-profile leaders were seen mingling  \~the first time many had been at such a large gathering since the outbreak of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden could be seen smiling at Saudi Arabian leaders, and Mr Johnson and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a brief, but warm embrace. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor were also seen working the room,\~just weeks after the government agreed to the net zero by 2050 target. Still, Australia has arrived at the conference with a reputation of being a "climate laggard", with critics HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-01/australia-has-suicidal-climate-policy-says-figueres/100584192 calling the country\' s climate policy "suicidal" . The UK had been pressuring Australia to reconsider its position on coal, but Mr Morrison made no mention of coal in his key address to the conference. \~He warned that any switch to renewables must be cost-effective. "This needs to work not just in the developed economies of the North Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo Pacific as well. "Cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies. Meanwhile, during his speech India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that his country would aim to reach net-zero by 2070, two decades behind the UN's global goal. India is the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States\~and continues to rely on coal for the majority of its power generation. 'Is this how our species is doomed to end?' The UK has asked all industrialised countries to adopt more ambitious mid-century targets too  ideally halving their emissions by 2030. Australia has not adopted this position  which UN scientists believe is critical if the world wants to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Any further warming would be catastrophic for the world, Mr Johnson said in his address. "We know what the scientists tell us  \~two degrees more and we jeopardise the food supply for hundreds of millions of people's crops," he said. "Three degrees and you can add more wildfires and cyclones twice as many five times as many droughts and 36 times as many heatwaves. "Four degrees,\~we say goodbye to whole cities  Miami, Alexandria, Shanghai all lost beneath the waves  \~and the longer we fail to act, the worse it gets and the higher the price." UN\~secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres warned that since delegates agreed to the historic 2015 Paris Climate Accord, the world had experienced\~"the six hottest years on record". "Our addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink," he said. "We face a stark choice: Either we stop it\~or it stops us." The outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel used her time at the summit's podium to call for a new global carbon pricing scheme, which were echoed by Candian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his address. Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean made one of the key addresses at the opening ceremony, and used it to put political leaders on notice. \~ "You all have the power to be better  \~you know what climate justice is doing to us, you don't need my pain or my tears to know that we are in a crisis," the 23-year-old said. \~ "Remember in your meetings rooms and drafting documents, they are more than black and white objects.\~ "Your words wield the weapons that could save us or sell us out. "The real question is: Do you have the political will do the right thing, to use the right words and follow up with much-needed action?" Other guests at the opening ceremony included members of the British royal family, and the world\' s best-known naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. The Prince of Wales urged governments to work more closely with the private sector, while Sir David urged all leaders to take urgent action. "Those who have contributed the least are feeling the impacts the most," Sir David said. "Is this how our species is doomed to end?" "In my lifetime I've witnessed a horrible decline. In your lifetime you should witness a wonderful recovery." Mr Johnson reminded delegates at COP26 they were not of the same generation that\~would witness the impacts of climate change.\~ "Half of the population of the world is under 30.\~The average age of this conclave of world leaders, I'm afraid to say, is over 60," he said. Earlier in the day, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met with some of the most high-profile youth activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate. They urged all delegates to consider the future of younger generations, and issued a pointed reminder their failure would\~cost their children, and their children.\~ \</doc>

It was the NASA scientist James Hansen who introduced the wider world to the threat of climate change. His testimony before a US Senate committee in 1988 shook Washington and became a driving force of the global movement to address the threat. That same year, the United Nations formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was to provide the world with detailed assessments of the science of climate change, to chart the risks and lay out possible responses. Its assessments of global warming were to become the largest scientific peer review process in history. Based on the IPCC's advice, the world negotiated the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was launched in Rio in 1992. Today, the UNFCCC has 195 national signatories, whose representatives normally gather annually at what is now known as the COP, the Conference of the Parties. COP1 was held in Berlin in 1995. This year COP26 will be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12, the event delayed for a year due to the pandemic. The meetings are usually attended by around 10,000 diplomats and negotiators, scientists, activists and people from civil society groups. The particularly significant COPS such as those held in 1997, 2009, 2015 and this year - those at which key commitments are to be renegotiated - generally attract world leaders as well. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced he will be going to Glasgow. This year's meeting will resemble something like a UN general assembly crossed with the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum. The COP has not yet said which leaders have confirmed their attendance but organisers expect more than 100 will be there, along with members of the British royal family, corporate heavyweights and celebrities. To many observers, COP26 is the most crucial yet because it will test whether or not the framework for co-operative emissions reductions agreed to in Paris can, in fact, curb climate change. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed more than 1 degree over pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, the parties to the COP undertook to hold warming to under 2 degrees. The same assessment says that to limit warming to 2 degrees we must achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and around 50 per cent by 2030. Thirty years on from Hanson's famous testimony in Washington, HYPERLINK https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/listening-to-james-hansen-on-climate-change-thirty-years-ago-and-now The New Yorker magazine asked him if he had a message for the next generation . His response was blunt. "The simple thing is, I'm sorry we're leaving such a f---ing mess." So, how did we get here? And what needs to be achieved at Glasgow? How did we get here? The first major climate treaty was thrashed out at the Second Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 - the meeting at which the Conference of the Parties was also created. The central aim of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system". While this aim has not been realised so far, the COPs were the forums to try to make it happen. The first agreement made under the auspices of the UNFCCC was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, in which 36 developed nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gasses during a set period (2008 to 2012) by 5 per cent compared to 1990 levels. Acknowledging that developed nations had already benefited from the process of industrialisation, it allowed for poorer nations to continue to build their carbon-intensive economies. As a result, while signatories to Kyoto managed to reduce their emissions in keeping with the agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, jumping by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010, according to a 2019 IPCC report. A new approach was needed. Have other COPs succeeded? By the most crucial measure - the rate at which the world is warming - the process has not yet worked, but it has seen the world agree on the scale of the problem and a course of action. Some meetings, such as the gathering in Copenhagen in 2009, have been standout failures. There, divisions between developed and developing nations became even more entrenched, with the former declining to set concrete reduction levels by 2020 and the latter insisting on their right to carbon-intensive growth. In the dying hours of two weeks of negotiations, the US delegation couldn't even find key players from the major developing nations bloc, let alone negotiate with them. At the last moment US president Barack Obama, still as much a global superstar as politician after his startling election victory the year before, flew in, hoping to force a useful outcome. In her memoir, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton recounts discovering that China was hosting a secret meeting attended by leaders of high-emitting emerging economies including from India, Brazil and South Africa. She recounts racing down long corridors with Obama, their staff in tow, before ducking into the meeting room as White House press secretary Robert Gibbs tangled himself up with Chinese security guards at the door. Those inside were stunned. Despite her breezy description of diplomatic derring-do, all that came of the Copenhagen COP was a political statement affirming the need to keep warming to 2 degrees, with no attendant commitments as to how that might be done. After Copenhagen, crucial years were lost as emissions continued to rise. COP meetings rolled on and something like a consensus formed that the replacement for the expiring Kyoto Protocol would be negotiated in Paris in 2015. What was agreed in Paris (and what's the \' ratchet effect')? Two principles were made central to the talks in Paris, both designed to help overcome the critical gulf between richer and poorer nations: all nations would commit to voluntary emissions cuts but wealthier countries would help pay for the developing world to meet their targets and adapt to a warmer world. Developed nations agreed to make their emissions peak as soon as possible, and then decline to net zero by 2050. To achieve the goal, all nations would set "ambitious" reductions targets that would be updated and increased over time. This is often described as the agreement's ratchet effect. The president of this year's COP, UK cabinet minister Alok Sharma, has noted that the Paris summit put the world on track for a rise of global temperatures of just under 4 degrees. Commitments made since, should they be met, have put us on course to 2.4 degrees. This level of warming would be catastrophic, and to critics it is evidence of a failure of the process. But the decline is the point. Loose language in the Paris agreement has also prompted criticism. The financial commitment of the developed nations was absolutely crucial to any agreement being secured at all. But the language of the Paris accord was deliberately muddy. Under the agreement, rich nations would create a Green Climate Fund to "mobilise" $100 billion for mitigation and adaptation projects by poorer ones. But what did "mobilise" mean? And which countries would be donors and which were recipients? In order to secure agreement, negotiators were not clear on these points. "Mobilise," one of Australia's former top climate diplomats Howard Bamsey has said, "is one of those UN verbs, so you have to parse it very carefully." Even the goalposts set by the IPCC shifted in Paris. In a last-minute change to language inserted as a result of a diplomatic push by small island states, Tony deBrum, a former president of the Marshall Islands (halfway between Australia and Hawaii), believed that while a 2 degree goal might be tolerable in some parts of the world, it would lead to the complete destruction of many small island nations. He quietly set about forming a bloc of nations that eventually became known as the High Ambition Coalition, which appeared as if out of nowhere moments before the talks' final session. Demonstrating the power of smart negotiators from small nations equipped with little more than moral authority and a sense of urgency, deBrum had secured 90 votes and reshaped the Paris accord. The agreement's intent would now be to limit global warming to "well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels." So, what's on the table at Glasgow? When the world met in Paris in 2015, nations accepted the IPCC's advice that it must massively reduce emissions to keep it on a path to holding warming to beneath 2 degrees, and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. In Glasgow, they must reset their ambitions reductions targets to make that goal possible. As Sharma puts it, Paris promised, Glasgow must deliver. For around two years now, Sharma has travelled the world pressing the need for nations to bring to the Glasgow conference emission reductions commitments in line with that target. For vulnerable countries, Sharma said in his last major speech before the conference, "\' 1.5 to stay alive' is not a hollow slogan. It is a matter of survival." Sharma and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been unequivocal about their terms for success. They say COP26 must result in nations committing to new emissions reductions targets that close the gap between our current warming trajectory and the 1.5 degree goal raised in Paris. To get to that point, the science suggests, most nations must not only commit to net zero emissions by 2050, but agree to 2030 reductions targets that collectively add up to 45 per cent. This would be a significant feat. It would mean securing increased ambitions from more than 70 countries accounting for 41 per cent of global emissions. They include China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and Australia, which has so far not committed to net zero nor raised its 2030 target beyond the 26 to 28 per cent reduction it committed to in Paris. There is also debate about the mushy language of the agreement. Some nations interpret the prime Paris goal to be 1.5 degrees warming, others 2 degrees. Former French prime minister Laurent Fabius, who was president of the Paris talks, HYPERLINK https://www.politico.eu/article/climate-summit-chief-sets-up-fight-over-paris-agreements-goal/ recently told Politico COP26 presidency into a battle, HYPERLINK https://www.politico.eu/article/climate-summit-chief-sets-up-fight-over-paris-agreements-goal/ Politico reported. ) The potential failure of the $100-billion Climate Fund could be used as an excuse for any number of reluctant nations to abandon the agreement, experts have warned. Sharma has confessed that the thought of the financial target being missed keeps him up at night. "We are now within touching distance of the $100 billion  please step forward now in these few days before COP," he said. Since Biden was elected in the US, the UK's Sharma has been joined by the US state department - the world's largest diplomatic machine - and US climate envoy John Kerry, an infamously relentless negotiator, in cajoling world leaders to commit to greater efforts. But success is far from assured. Well, what would success look like? "The measure of success at Glasgow is we will have the largest, most significant increase in ambition [on cutting emissions] by more countries than everyone ever imagined possible. A much larger group of people are stepping up," Kerry said HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/11/john-kerry-cop26-climate-summit-starting-line-rest-of-decade in a recent interview with the Guardian. But there are other markers of success. And some key decisions will be made on the sidelines of the meeting, with Johnson making it clear he wants nations to agree to "consign coal to history" by laying out a rapid phaseout of the world's dirtiest source of energy. That effort is being championed by a push known as the Powering Past Coal alliance. The cost of failure in Glasgow is unthinkable, says Sharma. "At 1.5 degrees warming, 700 million people would be at risk of extreme heat waves," he said in his recent speech. "At 2 degrees, it would be 2 billion. "At 1.5 degrees, 70 per cent of the world's coral reefs die. At 2 degrees, they are all gone. "If temperatures continue to rise we will step through a series of one-way doors, and the end destination of which is climate catastrophe." \</doc>

Glasgow | At COP summits, Australia's reputation as a stubborn defender of coal means it isn't always the most popular country in town. But this year, the government turned to another great Aussie export to win hearts and minds: the flat white. For the first time, Australia hosted a "pavilion", becoming one of 80-plus countries, organisations and campaigns to set up a showcase and meeting space in the venue's vast exhibition hall. The Australian pavilion was set up as a mini-cafe, with promotional videos dominating one wall, a few companies touting their wares around the edges, and - most importantly - a coffee machine and barista in one corner. It instantly became a magnet for the Aussie crowd. On a given morning, you might see OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann having a quiet coffee with Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, or globetrotting businessman Andrew Liveris bumping into Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher. When he wasn't meeting Joe Biden or Al Gore, Andrew Forrest and his Fortescue Future Industries team were a near-permanent fixture at one end of the pavilion, next to a Tardis-like installation they had produced to help promote Twiggy's green hydrogen campaign. Australia's band of COP-attending environmentalists, including Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, also dropped in, though some raised an eyebrow at Santos' carbon capture and storage exhibit. High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis kept a stately eye on proceedings, while Energy Minister Angus Taylor held meetings or gave presentations in the private room upstairs. Gradually, though, the Aussie secret got out: word crept out into the broader conference about the quality of the coffee. The choice was simple: you could stand in a queue elsewhere at COP for 20 minutes and buy a crap coffee for almost $5, or you could queue for five minutes and get an Australian-quality one for free. The queue was suddenly full of student representatives, Pacific Island negotiators, and random passers-by. It got longer and longer - and made Australia's pavilion one of the busiest on site. As they waited, the freebie-seekers' eyes might have fallen on promotional displays not just from Santos and Fortescue, but others such as Sun Cable and CO2-into-bricks start-up Mineral Carbonation International. "Good coffee, good company. But most important, this is Aussie companies doing amazing things. That's what I liked most of all," Taylor tells AFR Weekend. He's sold on the concept. "When we left Madrid [the 2019 COP], I said, \' Next time, this is what we're doing'. We have worked very closely to get this outcome, and I want to ramp it up in the future." In fact, he says he wants to "double down" next time. What could this mean? Smashed avocado on sourdough toast? Free cold beer? Roll on, Sharm El-Sheikh 2022.

As fracking looks set to make a comeback in Britain in the wake of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, it's worth reflecting on the role of Russian disinformation in the global environmental campaign against the hydraulic fracturing of underground gas-bearing shale and coal deposits. Several British newspapers have reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson is open to ending the ban on fracking, which was imposed in 2019. The London Daily Telegraph reported on March 10 that Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was pushing for the lifting of the ban and quoted a spokesman for Johnson saying "all options would be considered". Johnson had personally intervened "to stop the concreting in of England's only two viable shale gas wells", the newspaper said. And Russian disinformation? Matt Ridley reported in The Sun on March 15 that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest publicly listed gas company, had criticised fracking for years to protect the price of Russian gas being exported to Europe. The success of the fracking revolution in the US had put downward pressure on global gas prices. Lest anyone think Ridley was just doing the bidding of the Murdoch media, there is plenty of evidence from the US congress and from left-wing news sources that Russian trolls had been pumping out false information about fracking for years. The Guardian reported Russia was behind attempts to discredit fracking on June 20, 2014. It quoted former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen saying "as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations", Russia engaged with environmental organisations working "against shale gas to maintain European dependence on Russian gas". The Chicago Tribune went further, reporting on March 1, 2018, that Russian troll factories had used Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to inflame US political debate over climate change. It quoted a report from the House science, space and technology committee providing evidence Russia used social media to inflame concern about fracking. US political website The Hill noted on March 1 this year the Guardian's Rasmussen report, and said the US media and Democrats had ignored evidence of Russian disinformation attempting to distort the US energy market. The Hill reveals a 2017 letter by Texas Republicans Lamar Smith and Randy Weber to then Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin quoting former secretary of state Hillary Clinton telling a private gathering in 2016: "We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were being funded by the Russians." Much of the Western world's media is so tied up in environmental campaigning it can't even see the trap many democracies are sleepwalking towards. Here there has been little media mention of renewed interest in preserving old coal-fired power stations in Germany and Britain, or a wider push by the EU to open the way for new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. The London Telegraph reported on March 16 that the British government was looking at watering down "net zero" rules on North Sea exploration so the UK could wean itself off Russian gas. The gas shock comes after months of high energy prices over winter when renewables generation faltered across Britain and much of the EU. Reuters quoted German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on March 13 saying Germany should rethink its ban on new North Sea oil and gas drilling. "Against the changed geopolitical background, I think it is advisable to examine the entire energy strategy of our country without any prohibitions on thinking," Lindner said. Germany is Russia's biggest gas customer. The EURACTIV EU news website quoted several German politicians and energy specialists on March 10 confirming Germany would now need to keep some coal power stations - that were scheduled for closure - open and in reserve, as the nation started to wean itself off Russian gas. Germany has effectively bankrolled Putin's military with its gas purchases. It's no wonder neither Putin nor China's leader-for-life Xi Jinping attended the Glasgow COP26 climate conference last year. China and Russia, the biggest and fourth-biggest CO2 emitters respectively, will not be meeting net zero emissions targets by 2050. But they most certainly will be attempting to profit economically and politically from the decisions of other nations to do so. The Carnegie Foundation's Moscow Centre news site sets up Putin's view, in a piece published last September. "Worryingly, while Russia acknowledges the dangers of a rapidly warming world, it does not appear to be preparing for a transition. Putin has even hinted at a potential brighter future for Russia thanks to climate change: one in which it is an agricultural powerhouse in a famine-stricken world; and where the Arctic makes Russia's strategic position in trade routes indisputable." China was praised at COP26 for promising in September to stop building coal-fired power stations outside China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Media dupes accepted this as a face-value sign of Xi Jinping's commitment to net zero by 2060. Yet China signalled early this month a massive increase in its domestic coal production. Bloomberg reported on March 13 that China wants domestic coal production increased by 300 million tonnes a year. Total Australian annual thermal coal production is 550 million tonnes, so China's domestic increase is about 60 per cent of our total annual output, most of it exported. China depends on coal for about 60 per cent of its electricity. Meanwhile, our media continues with fraudulent reporting suggesting both China and India (the world's third-biggest emitter) are phasing out coal. Environment writers here applaud the early closure of coal-fired power plants as part of an energy transition that promises to produce far more challenges than most journalists understand. This column made those technical challenges clear in an interview with former Energy Security Board chief Kerry Schott, published on February 28. And the prissy ABC Media Watch program continues to police journalists straying from a strict climate change agenda as the national broadcaster, Guardian Australia and the Nine newspapers remain silent on the most important energy story out of Europe in our lifetimes. Energy will prove an enduring story from the invasion of Ukraine, and the bedrock upon which February's pact between Putin and Xi was built. The West has allowed its own industries and jobs to be exported to countries with rising CO2 emissions so it can reduce emissions in Europe and North America for no net benefit to the planet. US President Joe Biden is refusing to expand domestic oil and gas production to keep faith with the left of his Democratic Party on emissions, while reaching out to Russian client oil states Iran and Venezuela in the hope of winning a price reprieve for American motorists. Putin and Xi must be laughing as their own emissions soar. \</doc>

The Queen recently sent a pointed message to the heads of government meeting at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. She said, in all her years, she has met two types of leaders: those who play politics for short-term gain, and statesmen - those who see change coming and prepare their nations well for it. COP26 is all about setting realistic 2030 targets for a planet that will succumb to 1.5 per cent global warming by 2030 if we do not act decisively now. However, all the talk from the federal government before Scott Morrison left for Glasgow was about 2050. There is no time like the present. The federal government's stated goal of emissions at 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels is just not good enough. A bare minimum, like NSW's 2030 target of 50 per cent is required. More being done now means less to be done after 2030. However, doing more now does not seem politically or financially viable for the Liberals and the Nationals; nor does it seem for the Labor Party. Being a statesman is about risking losing elections while doing what is right for voters, regardless of what swinging voters might want. The last prime minister I saw being in any way statesman-like was John Howard as he stood in front of gun owners while wearing a bullet-proof vest after the Port Arthur massacre. I hope it's not too insensitive to say that COP26 was Scott Morrison's Port Arthur moment. Real leadership in times of crisis involves a willingness to sacrifice career and position in the cause of what is right. Did Scott Morrison do this? Reports speak of the Glasgow Exhibition Centre at COP26 being a place overflowing with possibility and hope about what is being done, and what can be done, for humankind and the environment in the next handful of years. Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like Australia is missing out. The next 10 years will show us just how much possibility Australia missed out on. As it stands now, our federal seat of Calare will miss out on $15 billion worth of green investment. In recent years he has contributed to analysis of 100 per cent renewable energy futures, including a global search for pumped hydro energy storage sites.

India and China have called on advanced economies to provide up to $US1 trillion ($1.33 trillion) now for developing countries to reduce emissions, rejected 2050 net-zero targets and offered no firm commitments to phase out coal-fired power at the Glasgow climate summit. The divide between developed and developing nations is again looming as the major obstacle to greater progress at COP26 , with Scott Morrison warning that getting the climate shift wrong would impact "those who can afford it least" as he promoted his "technology, not taxes" approach to reducing emissions. Mr Morrison, who was due to hold talks with Prince Charles ahead of a Commonwealth leaders' reception on Tuesday, told world leaders successful action on climate change must occur not only "in the developed economies of the North Atlantic but in the developing economies of the Indo-Pacific as well". Delivering Australia's national statement at COP26 in Glasgow, the Prime Minister said global momentum to tackle climate change was building and driving down emissions could be achieved without imposing economy wrecking policies. Speaking to a high-level group of Australian business leaders, Mr Morrison said he was "far more optimistic" about the future of global warming than the "depressing tone" at COP26 . "It is not all doom," Mr Morrison said after scores of global leaders including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the world was at "one minute to midnight" if it wanted to "save the planet". Mr Johnson, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron had hoped to use the UN conference as a launching pad for a new era of ambitious global co-operation on climate change, but failed to win the support of the world's biggest emitters including India, China, Brazil and Russia. In his keynote speech, Mr Johnson told more than 120 leaders and representatives of 191 countries that humanity had "long since run down the clock" on climate change. "It's one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock and we need to act now," the British Prime Minister said. The COP26 host, who likened world leaders to James Bond grappling with a "doomsday device", said he wanted clear COP26 outcomes around the ending of deforestation, the phasing out of coal, increasing electric vehicle take-up and strengthening the financial market's climate change focus. After the US President criticised China and Russia for snubbing the G20 and COP26 summits, Chinese President Xi Jinping was allowed to provide a written statement outlining Beijing's climate change agenda. In a message without any new commitments, Mr Xi told world leaders to "govern by reality" and boost support for developing nations, referencing an $US100bn-a-year pledge made by advanced economies in 2009 to support the global net-zero transition. Mr Xi, who submitted a video message to the conference, acknowledged the adverse effects of climate change were increasingly apparent. But he did not provide any detail on how the world's biggest polluter and coal-fired power consumer would meet its 2060 net-zero target and reduce its peak emissions, which make up more than a quarter of the globe's total carbon output, by 2030. He said countries should take a pragmatic approach "in accordance with national conditions", adding that "developed countries must not only do more themselves, but also provide support for developing countries to do better''. Mr Xi, who claimed China "resolutely curbs blindly high-energy-consuming and high-emission projects", said Beijing would pursue a green and low-carbon economic system that could "vigorously develop" renewable energy. Despite his government resisting a net-zero target, Mr Modi shocked COP26 delegates by declaring India would aim to reach the goal by 2070. The 50-year target, which most believe would be difficult for India to achieve unless low-emissions technologies were scalable, would be supported by an accelerated shift to "non-fossil energy" from 2030. After attending Mr Johnson's COP26 world leaders' dinner reception on Monday night, Mr Morrison hosted a breakfast roundtable on his final day in Glasgow with Australian business chiefs including Macquarie Group chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake, Fortescue's Andrew Forrest, Rio Tinto chair Simon Thompson, Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher and Sun Cable boss David Griffin. He said Australia had a "tremendous opportunity." "What works has to work in the North Atlantic and it has to work in the Indo-Pacific, the developed countries in the North Atlantic and developing countries in the Indo-Pacific and whether its speaking to Indonesia, Vietnam or particularly India, they understand the challenge and they are looking for the answer to their economies. The world is looking for solutions. I am far more optimistic when I come to these things and sometimes they can have a bit of a depressing tone about doom, about gloom. That's not my view. It's not our government view. "Eighteen months ago we were facing the abyss of a pandemic with no vaccine, and here we are, a vaccine has now been administered to billions around the world." Mr Morrison was expected to meet heads of the International Energy Agency and International Atomic Energy Agency overnight. In his COP26 "Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, particularly over time - and achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially in developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life," Mr Morrison said. Spruiking the government's target for net-zero emissions by 2050, Mr Morrison said Australia's success in slashing emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005 - driven by world-leading take-up of rooftop solar and accelerated deployment of renewables - had not come at an economic cost. "Over the same time, our economy has grown by 45 per cent, proving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions reduction," he said. "And by 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes that our emissions will fall by 35 per cent by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment. Australia meets and beats our commitments. And we are doubling our initial climate finance commitment for our Pacific family and Southeast Asian partners to $2bn." \</doc>

Before the pandemic began, Low Tuck Kwong tried - and failed - to sell a stake in his Indonesian mining company. Unable to find the right buyer, he decided to double down, adding shares instead of paring them. The bet paid off: PT Bayan Resources' stock has more than doubled since, making Low one of the wealthiest people in the industry, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His stake, now at 61 per cent, is worth $US6.1 billion ($8 billion). "It's very simple: If I can't sell part of my shares, I better buy more," Low said in a rare interview from Jakarta in March, the month he added another 199 million shares. Coal producers have been on a tear recently, an unexpected development for the industry most responsible for carbon emissions. At last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, more than 40 countries pledged to shift away from the fuel. Indonesia, its largest exporter, has boosted regulation to safeguard natural resources. Yet burning coal is still common, generating about 35 per cent of the world's electricity and twice as much in Indonesia. Post-pandemic economic activity has increased demand, as has the war in Ukraine. Nations including Japan have banned Russian fuel imports, further tightening supply and pushing prices even higher. For Bayan Resources, where Low serves as president, it's been a boon. Shares are trading near a record high. Revenue more than doubled to $US2.9 billion last year, and the company repaid all of its debt. Now the miner is building new infrastructure to boost its production capacity to as much as 60 million tonnes by 2026 from 37.6 million tonnes in 2021, according to chief financial officer Alastair McLeod. "There's still a very balanced, if not undersupplied market," McLeod said in the March interview. "Obviously we will still face a variety of challenges. But from the market price perspective, there's a demand for coal. We would anticipate healthy margins in 2022." Shares of coal miners have surged across the board, boosting the fortunes of other Indonesian tycoons. PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia, controlled by billionaire Garibaldi Thohir's PT Adaro Energy Indonesia, has shot up almost 2,800 per cent since its public debut in January. The 175 per cent jump in PT Harum Energy over the past year has sent the value of its founder's stake to $US2 billion. Environmental concerns have yet to tamp the world's demand for coal, said Shirley Zhang, principal analyst for Asia-Pacific coal market at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Even if the Russian-Ukraine conflict subsides, she said, "coal will still be needed by most of the Asian countries by 2050, and lack of financing at coal mines will provide price support". Bayan Resources has installed solar panels and solar-powered lighting at its projects, and its Tabang mine, which contributes to more than 80 per cent of its production, generates lower levels of sulphur, nitrogen and ash when it burns coal, according to a company presentation. But the limitations are obvious, McLeod said: "Inherently there's only a certain amount we can do if we still sell coal." Low moved to Indonesia more than five decades ago, ready to tap opportunities in south-East Asia's biggest economy. Initially, the Singapore native went into construction - his first project was to build a facility to store ice cream. But the sector was a constant hustle. "You still had to look for another project for our people to work on," he said. Mining looked more stable, and in the late 1980s and '90s, the construction company built its coal business. Bayan Resources was created in 2004, and Low also became the controlling shareholder of Singaporean coal shipper Manhattan Resources Ltd. Low says he's an animal lover, and he spends his free time strolling in the zoo and fruit plantations he established on the island of Borneo, near the site of his Tabang mine. He invested some $US4 million in the park, which is open to the public free of charge. Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

PRINCE Charles has met with Scott Morrison in Glasgow after appearing to be shocked last month to learn the Prime Minister was considering skipping the climate summit. The pair spoke on the sidelines of the COP26 meeting, with Mr Morrison saying it was "wonderful to see you again". He told Prince Charles of Australia's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. "Australia's done it here at COP26 ," Mr Morrison said. "We've doubled our climate finance commitments and we're working very closely with our Pacific family, with Prime Minister (Frank) Bainimarama and the whole team, which I know you have a great affection for the Pacific." Prince Charles replied: "Absolutely." Last month, when the PM was contemplating missing Glasgow, Prince Charles seemed surprised during a BBC interview to learn that the quarantine period was putting off Mr Morrison. "Is that what he says?" he asked. Prince Charles urged Mr Morrison and other world leaders to attend, declaring COP26 was a "last-chance saloon" to tackle global warming, adding it would be difficult to catch up if vital decisions weren't made now. "It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather," he said. \</doc>

The impact of climate change and how to respond to it is the defining political debate of our era. There are HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025739 two forms this response can take - reacting to environmental disasters by providing financial and technical assistance to affected areas, or adapting to the effects of global heating by preparing for future disasters. Adaptation efforts - building flood protections, early warning systems and investing in resilient infrastructure - are increasingly recognised as important tools in limiting the consequences of climate change. This was a HYPERLINK key focus of the UK's HYPERLINK COP26 presidency goals at the UN climate summit, which highlighted closing the "adaptation gap" and building resilience to climate change globally. Despite this, there are more political rewards for devoting attention and resources to disaster relief, rather than disaster preparedness. This means politicians have little incentive to introduce large-scale investment in climate change adaptation. Research finds that the public is HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055409990104 more supportive of policies that react to adverse climate events, rather than those that proactively minimise the potential for damage (like flood defences). Reacting to a disaster is clearer and more visible to voters than investing in disaster preparedness. These political incentives are clearly demonstrated in US presidential elections. HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055409990104 Research examining elections from 1988-2004 found that incumbent politicians received higher vote shares when they prioritised disaster relief spending while in office, compared to equivalent spending on disaster preparedness. HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-021-09738-2 Research published this year The global stage Action on climate adaptation also has a chequered history at the international level. It has long been HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1038/445597a considered a taboo due to concerns it would distract from efforts to mitigate climate change. Adaptation has only recently started to receive significant HYPERLINK https://sciencebusiness.net/climate-news/news/cop26-canada-and-uk-launch-new-research-alliance-climate-adaptation attention and HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-commits-new-support-to-african-led-projects-to-protect-vulnerable-communities-at-the-frontline-of-climate-change pledges from developed countries. These nations have the HYPERLINK https://unctad.org/news/scaling-climate-adaptation-finance-must-be-table-un-cop26 economic and technical resources HYPERLINK what exactly constitutes adaptation. There is often a lack of clarity for international bodies in knowing whether projects actually offer protection from climate disasters, or are instead broadly focused on economic development. The UN's Green Climate Fund recently chose HYPERLINK https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/07/02/row-erupts-green-climate-fund-defines-climate-adaptation/ not to submit for approval Global investment in adaptation does not have the same immediacy as disaster relief. This is compounded by the fact that those most responsible for global adaptation funding -- the advanced economies -- are less affected by the immediate consequences of climate change. Corruption v climate The current approach to adaptation projects also draws attention to corruption in developing countries. Often referred to as the "C-word", discussion of corruption has been avoided by policymakers and non-governmental organisations in order to avoid weakening political support for assistance. HYPERLINK https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67684/public-attitudes-april10.pdf A 2010 study by the UK government found that 57% of the British public considered it pointless to donate aid to poorer countries, due to government corruption in recipient countries. As a result, financing climate adaptation is likely hampered by public distrust in projects without clear immediate outcomes, compared to the highly visible response to disaster events. Governments of wealthier donor countries must more clearly identify both the economic and humanitarian benefits of investing in adaptation for developing countries. This will likely increase support for these investments. This has limitations, as citizens in developed countries may HYPERLINK https://bfpg.co.uk/2021/03/public-opinion-foreign-aid/ be wary of efforts to boost growth abroad at the expense of domestic growth. At the international level, interpersonal connections and experience have been shown to HYPERLINK https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=13957 increase humanitarian aid flows. Sadly, the increasing number of climate-related disasters such as HYPERLINK https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/23/europe/germany-floods-belgium-climate-change-intl/index.html flooding and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/30/california-wildfires-north-complex-record wildfires in economically developed countries may be the key to support for necessary adaptation efforts across borders.

Glasgow: Former Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann is urging world leaders to axe costly taxpayer-funded fossil fuel subsidies, as the Glasgow climate summit's goal of "consigning coal to history" was undermined by a watered-down deal which key countries refused to sign. Cormann, who has embarked on a green pivot since his election as secretary-general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, said winding back subsidies would be "difficult and sensitive" but crucial to neutralising carbon emissions by 2050. "Governments should remove distortions that divert investment away from the transition to net zero," he told the COP26 talks on Thursday local-time. "Too many policies still encourage emissions-intensive investment, production and consumption. And inefficient subsidies make no fiscal sense in an environment of seriously constrained public budgets, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic." The exact level of direct taxpayer support for fossil fuel companies in Australia is unclear but estimates range from the low billions to about $11 billion each year. Globally, government support across major economies totalled $US500 billion ($676 billion) a year before the pandemic hit. As finance minister under Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison, Cormann had direct influence over the level of support given to Australia's fossil fuel producers. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who is in Scotland for the climate talks, said Cormann's comments had "pulled the rug out from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's whole pitch here at Glasgow". "Mr Cormann is right - fossil fuel subsidies are environmentally harmful, costly and distortive," she said. "You can't be taken serious on climate if you keep subsidising coal and gas." Cormann reminded the Glasgow summit that G20 countries, of which Australia is a member, had pledged in 2009 to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies "over the medium term" but noted direct support for fossil fuel production actually rose by 5 per cent in 2020 as the world emerged from the pandemic. "If this support continues beyond COVID-related emergency funding, it will compromise the commitment to phase out inefficient fossil fuel support and create market distortions that will work against our efforts to achieve global net zero," he said. Cormann also called for inefficient support for industry, agriculture and fishing to be eliminated. He framed the removal of subsidies as an example of translating the COP26 summit into "real outcomes". The fourth day of the fortnight-long United Nations event focused on the energy system and the huge changes needed if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Organisers announced a new pact to phase out coal, but instead of hard deadlines the agreement only requires rich countries to get there by the "2030s, or as soon as possible thereafter", and developing nations by "the 2040s". While major coal nations like Poland, Vietnam and Indonesia signed on, the United States, China, India and Australia did not. Nearly 80 countries signed the agreement but most had already promised to ditch coal. COP26 president Alok Sharma insisted the headline-grabbing pact was a sign of progress. "I think we can say with confidence that coal is no longer king," he said. "We are talking about five of the world's top-20 coal power generating countries that have signed up to this," he said. Sharma conceded the coal pledge did not contain any mechanism to make sure signatories follow through on their Glasgow promises. Energy Minister Angus Taylor defended Australia's decision to not join the coal phase-out bandwagon. "The coal industry's not finishing overnight," he said. "The way to solve this problem isn't to focus on shutting things, it's to focus on getting the cost of low-emissions technologies down. Then people will choose them, they will invest in them and you will see the outcomes that will follow." Taylor will leave the summit on Friday before delivering a speech in London. The government's Ambassador for the Environment, Jamie Isbister, will lead Australia's negotiations for the duration of the Glasgow talks. COP26 president, warned on Thursday that "sticking points" would begin to surface as COP26 negotiators work to get a new climate deal on paper. In a sign of a potential gap between commitments at Glasgow and actions back home, Indonesia seemingly stepped back from a declaration it signed HYPERLINK just days ago to halt global deforestation by the end of the decade . Indonesian Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said on Twitter the agreement was "clearly inappropriate and unfair" and would threaten the country's growth. New analysis by the International Energy Agency suggests temperature rises could be limited to 1.8 degrees should every pledge at the COP26 summit be met - slightly down on the 1.9 degrees estimated by a team of Australian experts. The Paris climate accord aims to restrict temperatures increases to 2 degrees and preferably 1.5. "This is a landmark moment: it is the first time that governments have come forward with targets of sufficient ambition to hold global warming to below 2 degrees," said IEA executive director Dr Fatih Birol.

According to our recently released Business Guide to Climate Disputes, Australia will be a key market for strategic climate litigation for years to come. The urgency of climate change is brought home by Australia's diverse environment and its sensitivity to extreme weather events, which are more frequent and severe. The 2021 IPCC Physical Science Report emphasises advances in both the physical science and the strength of agreement between the world's scientists regarding human-induced climate change. The physical risks associated with climate change will increase and certain physical impacts are already locked in. Even with the deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions we should expect the effects of climate change to become increasingly disruptive for at least the next 20 years. The coming decades will see significant shifts in economic activities as a result of the build-up of physical and transition risks (policy, legal, market and technology changes) to meet increasing commitments and ambition. Activists have never been better organised and are increasingly holding boards and directors to account. For these reasons, among others, there has been a dramatic rise in climate change litigation in recent years, such that it is now an increasingly prominent feature of the international disputes landscape. In a growing number of markets, cases have been brought seeking to compel governments and businesses to act on climate change. Our Business Guide to Climate Disputes confirmed that, by the end of 2020, well over 1,700 climate-related court cases had been decided worldwide. The United States led the field on climate disputes (1,213), followed by Australia (98), United Kingdom (62), Canada (22), New Zealand (18), Spain (13), and France (11). Climate change risk is a real and pressing challenge for Australian companies and their boards, with the impacts of climate change on business extending beyond carbon-intensive industries and into industries such as financial services and technology. Monitoring and accountability of corporate and government efforts to address climate change continue to drive an exponential increase in climate disputes. Australian financial institutions and other corporates have faced action for failure to disclose climate risks in accordance with company law, in annual reports and public statements. Growing scrutiny of climate-related matters calls for meaningful and credible engagement with climate risk and opportunity and clear, careful and consistent communication with the market and other stakeholders. Businesses wanting to retain market share, and remain competitive and relevant must now develop credible near- and mid-term climate action plans or review and revise them if already prepared; implement plans with urgency and conviction; and create transparency and accountability frameworks to track progress and results.

The east coast flood emergency is the type of extreme weather event which would become more frequent as climate change worsens, according to authors of a major new report which has prompted warnings that time is running out to secure a "liveable future" for the planet. As parts of south-east Queensland and northern NSW remain under water following days of pounding rain, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has released a new report which says heavy rain events risk becoming more common in Australia amid rising global temperatures. The report, published late on Monday night, provides the most comprehensive scientific assessment of the far-reaching consequences of climate change in Australia and around the world. The panel has warned the world faces "unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades" if temperatures rise 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels - a threshold the planet is on track to far exceed, despite the promises made at last year's UN summit in Glasgow. The risks only grow as temperatures rise, with predictions that almost half of the Earth's species could become extinct if global warming reaches 5 degrees. "The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet," one of the panel's co-chairs, Hans-Otto Portner, said. "Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future." The panel said that in order to avoid a mounting human and ecological toll, urgent and ambitious action was needed to slash greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time adapting societies to live with a changing climate. The report features a chapter on Australia and New Zealand, and highlights nine climate-related risks the region will face as the planet warmed. This included the risk of more heat-related deaths of humans and wildlife, the loss of coral reefs and a decline in agricultural production in drought-affected parts of southern and eastern Australia. More extreme "fire weather" was projected across the same areas, while episodes of heavy rainfall were also expected to increase. In a briefing with reporters ahead of the report's public release, ANU professor and report co-author Mark Howden agreed that the east coast floods were the type of extreme events which would become more frequent as the planet continued to warm. Professor Howden said the weather pattern behind the flood emergency, the La Nina phenomenon, would grow stronger in the future as global temperatures rose. "Even though the frequency may not change, the strength of them will change. And that will increase the variability of climate in Australia, particularly in the north-east and down through the south-east," he said. Griffith University professor Brendan Mackey, who helped write the chapter on Australia and New Zealand, said the nine climate risks which threatened the region would be more significant if warming reached 2 degrees. ACT weather: Thunderstorms and rain forecast for Canberra COP26 is over. What now for the planet, Australia and Canberra? Striking agreement on a path to limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees was the main aim of last year's COP26 summit, which was promoted as a "last-chance saloon" to tackle climate change. But despite many countries making fresh pledges to cut pollution, and leadership from powerhouses the US and UK, emissions projections still have the planet on a path to exceeding 2 degrees of warming. Professor Howden anticipated carbon dioxide emissions would reach record levels this year as economies emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, flying in the face of the urgent calls for action to slash emissions which surrounded the UN summit. "We're not on track to even do what governments said they would do, let alone [the fact that] what government said they would do is [not] adequate to actually keep climate change down to manageable levels," he said. The report's release came as new figures showed Australia's emissions had fallen by 0.8 per cent in the 12 months to September. That means emissions are just under 20 per cent below 2005 levels, still on track to meet the Coalition's Tony Abbott-era target of cutting pollution by 26 to 28 per cent this decade. The Morrison government believes emissions could fall up to 35 per cent if its stretch targets for the development of low-emissions technologies, such as hydrogen, are met. A statement from Energy Minister Angus Taylor noted that the drop in emissions came as the Australian economy grew by 3.9 per cent over the same period.

The scale of the tragedy that is the ongoing flooding in NSW and Queensland is hard to comprehend. Although the ever-increasing insurance claim figures sit at well over $2 billion, this is the tip of the iceberg. The loss of lives, the damage to infrastructure, the loss of productivity and the physical and mental health toll taken on the nearly 10 million Australian's makes the true cost of the event devastatingly higher. This will involve a creative re-examination of Australia's climate change policy. With largely bi-partisan support for a net zero target by 2050, and after the noise of COP26 , one could be forgiven for thinking that the climate change debate is settled. However, the reality is that even limiting global temperature rises to around 1.5 degrees by 2050 will not stop Australians being hit by increasingly frequent catastrophic weather. Although the mitigation of our share of greenhouse gasses is crucial, we must also incorporate resilience into our climate change policy. Proactive action by industry, businesses, and governments to pursue climate resilience could deliver a $380 billion dividend over the next 30 years, according to our recent analysis with the Minderoo Foundation. This means of the estimated $1 trillion in economic costs from climate change over the next 30 years, more than one-third is avoidable through action that can be taken today. This won't be easy - the need for adaption is far reaching. It ranges from thinking about how to protect workers exposed to hotter conditions, to assessments we make on climate impacts when building new infrastructure, to reinforcing levees along our rivers and managing living in coastal regions, and to better asset management and investment decisions by business. Adaptation might mean different work hours and different schooling hours in some regions and could even impact when and where we play sport outside. Just as transforming to a net zero economy means widescale change, so too does becoming resilient. On a public policy level, this will involve drastically flipping the idea of natural disaster funding on its head. According to the Productivity Commission, just 3 per cent of the money committed to disaster recovery is used for preparation before an event occurs, while 97 per cent is committed to response and recovery after the event. This is not good enough: preparation must be a priority. On a private sector level, we need businesses in all sectors of the economy to treat adaptation as necessary insurance and build it into their business strategies and operations. Our modelling shows that adaptation strategies alone can add $120 billion in benefits to the Australian economy by 2050, and these strategies benefit the economy from the time of investment. Conversely, the cost of inaction will grow every year and by 2050 could cost Australia 3.6 per cent of its GDP and 137,000 jobs, according to our worst-case scenario. The climate change debate has, to date, been dominated by the important agenda of mitigation. The politics and urgency of the debate has been polarising and, perhaps, lent itself to partial analysis and partial solutions. Australia will not be physically or economically resilient to a changing climate unless adaptation is considered at the same time.

World leaders have been gathering at HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ COP26 , the UN climate summit in Glasgow, against a backdrop of flooded homes, closed roads and cancelled trains across the UK caused by HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-weather-news-flood-warnings-cumbria-b1947630.html extreme weather . These conditions are a stark reminder that as well as dramatically reducing our HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/net-zero-despite-the-greenwash-its-vital-for-tackling-climate-change-160329 carbon emissions , we must also begin adapting to a climate that is already irreversibly changing. Yet the UK's third climate change HYPERLINK https://www.ukclimaterisk.org/' risk assessment report warns of a growing "adaptation gap" between the risks the country faces and the action it's taking, while the Environment Agency states bluntly that the UK must " HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adapt-or-die-says-environment-agency adapt or die ". A problem with climate adaptation is that conventional engineering solutions are rapidly becoming unaffordable and unsustainable. We can't keep on building higher sea walls, extracting more groundwater from our land's depleted resources to irrigate crops, or installing energy-guzzling air conditioning to fight heat. Instead, HYPERLINK https://www.iucn.org/commissions/commission-ecosystem-management/our-work/nature-based-solutions#:%7E:text=Nature%2Dbased%20Solutions%20(NbS),%2Dbeing%20and%20biodiversity%20benefits%E2%80%9D. nature-based solutions For example, HYPERLINK https://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/news/unlocking-billion-pound-investment-restoration-saltmarshes restoring saltmarshes HYPERLINK https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/habitats/coastal/saltmarsh-and-mudflats wading birds . Further inland, HYPERLINK https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/flooding/ planting woodlands can help manage floods by intercepting rainfall, while restoring natural curves in artificially straightened rivers and recreating floodplain wetlands can slow floods. At HYPERLINK https://tweedforum.org/our-work/projects/the-eddleston-water-project/ Eddleston Water , a river valley in Scotland, these initiatives reduced flood peaks by 30%, protecting 500 properties downstream from damage. HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/peatlands-are-under-threat-heres-why-we-must-act-now-to-save-them/ Peatland degradation On the HYPERLINK https://www.niwater.com/garron-plateau-bog-restoration-project/ Garron Plateau in Northern Ireland, peat degradation contaminated water supplies for 12,000 people. But reducing the number of grazing sheep on peatland and blocking drainage channels to keep peat wet allowed peatland mosses to regrow, cutting water treatment costs and lowering carbon emissions. On farmland, techniques like adding more organic matter to soil can improve soil health and build resilience to pests, heatwaves, droughts and floods. And in urban areas, adding " HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/circular-cities-of-the-world-what-can-green-infrastructure-do-119273 green infrastructure Problems HYPERLINK https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/nature-based-solutions-in-uk-policy_dec2020.pdf Our research showed how governments could be missing opportunities to develop nature-based solutions. So in HYPERLINK https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/news/wwf-rspb-report-nature-based-solutions-uk-climate-adaptation-policy/ a recent review , commissioned by HYPERLINK https://www.wwf.org.uk/ WWF and HYPERLINK RSPB , we asked people working with nature-based solutions about the challenges they faced - to understand how we might better build these solutions into landscapes. We found that, despite growing recognition of the role nature-based solutions can play in climate adaptation, policy support is lacking. For example, HYPERLINK agroforestry (growing trees among crops or on grazing land) can protect livestock and crops in extreme weather. Yet it's not covered by woodland planting grants and farmers aren't trained in it, meaning that it's rarely practised in the UK. And adding green walls and roofs to buildings, especially outside of HYPERLINK https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2019_london_living_roofs_walls_report.pdf London , also lacks widespread policy support - so these are rarely installed by developers. We were surprised to find that some projects were struggling with regulations designed to control damaging activities, such as mineral extraction. Small HYPERLINK charity-led projects HYPERLINK Marine Management Organisation HYPERLINK https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/severe-weather/flooding/sustainable-drainage-systems Sustainable drainage systems HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/13/government-failing-to-stop-sewage-discharge-into-english-rivers-says-charity overloading sewers . However, standards for sustainable drainage systems in England focus on the amount of rainwater collected, so many new drainage systems simply use underground tanks and pipes rather than creating pleasant outdoor spaces that help wildlife to thrive. HYPERLINK https://www.suds-authority.org.uk/2021/06/recommendations-to-update-non-statutory-technical-standards-for-sustainable-drainage-systems-suds/ New standards drafted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would bring England up to the high standards in place in Wales. Similarly, when building developers are asked to boost sustainability by adding green roofs, the default option is often to unroll a cheap, thin, pre-grown vegetation mat that doesn't offer much insulation and may not survive a dry summer. In contrast, the HYPERLINK https://www.greenrooforganisation.org/2021/03/05/the-gro-code-of-best-practice-2021/ Green Roof Organisation Balancing act It's important to be careful when using techniques that could alter the balance of local ecosystems. For example, planting certain tree species in the "wrong place" can do more harm than good. Non-native tree species usually don't help wildlife flourish. And trees can dry out carbon-rich soils, deplete local water supplies, or crowd out native grasslands and the species that depend on them. Also, converting cropland to woodland in the UK will displace food production elsewhere, and could drive overseas deforestation to make space for new farmland: unless we HYPERLINK free up space by eating less meat and cutting food waste. To unlock the self-regulating power of our planet's environment, nature-based solutions need to go mainstream. For that to happen, governments need to provide more funding and design more supportive policies along the lines we suggest in HYPERLINK https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/policy-briefings/nature-based-solutions-adaption-report.pdf our review : helping people create resilient, healthy landscapes that dampen the effects of climate change.

TASMANIA is the nation's renewable energy champion, WWF-Australia's Renewable Superpower Scorecard has found. The scorecard ranks the progress of federal, state and territory governments in switching Australia's domestic energy systems to renewables and establishing renew-able export opportunities. It found that Tasmania remains in the lead because of its strong track record and world-leading renewable energy targets of 200 per cent by 2040. NSW was the most improved, moving from equal third with Victoria to second, while South Australia came in third. "In the wake of the COP26 , more and more countries are accelerating their shift to renewable energy and it's encouraging to see our states rising to the challenge through increased ambitions and strong action," WWF-Australia energy transition manager Nicky Ison said. "We need committed federal direction, policy and funding to enable all states and territories to realise their renewables ambitions." While states moved up the leaderboard, the federal -government fell further behind, at the bottom of the rankings after "missing the opportunity" at COP26 in Glasgow to announce an -expansion of its support for domestic renewables, elec-trification, and new renewable export industries, Ms Ison said. \</doc>

Scott Morrison will push for more financial support and stronger -action in supporting developing nations to reduce emissions at the UN climate change conference in Glasgow and call on G20 leaders to increase security and safety on social media platforms. The Prime Minister, who travels to Rome on Thursday, will meet with world leaders on the sidelines of both the G20 and COP26 summits but is not expected to hold formal talks with French President Emmanuel Macron following the fallout of the AUKUS submarine deal. The bulk of Mr Morrison's bilateral meetings on the seven-day trip are expected to take place in Glasgow, where he will speak with South Pacific leaders attending the COP26 summit amid concerns China is increasing its focus on climate diplomacy in the region. During the Glasgow visit, Mr Morrison will hold a roundtable meeting with Australian business leaders and attend an official COP26 reception hosted by Mr Johnson. Pending health advice, the Queen is expected to join Commonwealth leaders' at an -official event next Tuesday. Mr Johnson this week conceded he was "very worried" the COP26 summit might not secure agreements required to combat climate change. "It is going to be very, very tough \'e2\€ \£6 I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go \'e2\€ \£6 but I think it can be done," he said. Energy Minister Angus Taylor said last week the government would not sign up to any agreements or targets, including a British push to phase out coal-fired power stations by 2030, that would affect miners, manufacturers and farmers. Mr Morrison will deliver Australia's national statement at the COP26 leaders' summit early next week and co-host a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is expected to heavily focus on direct support for at-risk South Pacific nations. He will promote Australia's role at the forefront of climate and environmental innovation in a new global energy economy. At the G20 summit, Mr Morrison will advance his global advocacy on enhancing online security and push for tougher social media rules, ensuring stronger trans-national safeguards and systems are in place to protect children, families and communities. While the Italian government is yet to release the final list of world leaders attending the G20 summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida are not expected to travel to Rome. The Australian understands Mr Morrison's bilateral meetings will be focused on world leaders he has been unable to meet in person during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Morrison was not expected to hold formal bilateral talks with AUKUS partners US President Joe Biden and Mr Johnson, with his schedule slanted towards Indo-Pacific and European leaders and multilateral institutions represented at the G20 and COP26 summits. \</doc>

\~\~The Morrison government will show voters modelling underpinning Australia's 2050 net zero emissions target. \~\~ Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the modelling will be made public on Friday afternoon. \~\~ He has come under intense fire for declining to make it publicahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow. \~\~ "I was telling you (it) absolutely would be soon and, today, we'll be releasing that," Mr Morrison told reporters in Melbourne. \~\~ "We're getting on with the job of getting to net zero." \~\~ The federal government touts the private sector, as opposed to direct government intervention, as the way to tackle climate change. \~\~ "These are technologies we know we understand the key is the costs are coming down and will keep coming down," Energy Minister Angus Taylor said. \~\~ Earlier, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said Labor would release its mid-term emissions target after the COP26 climate summit which is drawing to a close in Glasgow. \~\~ "There'll be plenty of time for us to go through the detail of what medium-term objectives we have and for us to have a debate about that," Mr Albanese told ABC radio. \~\~ He would not be drawn on whether he supported a draft COP26 decision urging a 45 per cent reduction on emissions by 2030. \~\~ "If you're serious about policy and you're serious about being the alternative government - not some fringe group or minor party that can say whatever it likes - if you want to be held to account for what you say, you need to make sure that it's properly thought through," Mr Albanese said. \</doc>

Prince Charles has urged Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other world leaders to attend the UN's climate change conference, calling it a "last chance saloon" to save the planet. World leaders including Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, the Queen and the Pope will be at the event, but Mr Morrison https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-27/scott-morrison-decision-co26-climate-conference-glasgow/100493884 has not yet made a decision on whether he will attend . The Prince of Wales was giving an interview to the BBC when he was pressed about Australia's action on climate change ahead of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow at the end of this month. Prince Charles seemed genuinely surprised when told by the BBC's climate editor Justin Rowlatt that Mr Morrison was still on the fence about coming. "Is that what he says?" Charles asked. "He did say that, yeah, he said he's spent enough time in quarantine," Rowlatt said, before asking the prince what he would say to world leaders about why they should be coming to Glasgow. "Well, that's what I am trying to say all the time and the point being that this is a last chance saloon, literally," Charles said. "Because if we don't really take the decisions which are vital now it's going to be almost impossible to catch up. The prince said it would be a "disaster" if more action is not taken immediately. "It'll be catastrophic," he said. "It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather." Rowlatt also asked Prince Charles what he would say to the Australian government, saying it seemed to "be reluctant to take on board" the need for serious action on the issue. "I mean you gently try to suggest there may be other ways of doing things, in my case anyway, otherwise you lot (the media) accuse me of interfering and meddling, don't you?" Charles said. The prince also avoided a question put to him asking if the British government was doing enough, replying: "I couldn't possibly comment." Yesterday British MP Alok Sharma, the UK's COP president and host of the summit, also said he hoped Mr Morrison would attend in person and that Australia would set a net zero target. "Australia are our closest mates, and I want them to come to our party and sing the same songs  and that means making ambitious commitments on emission reductions by 2030 and, obviously, a net zero target," Mr Sharma told the Financial Times. COP26 is seen as the most important climate meeting since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed. "It is not a no-show at the conference," she said. "Australia will be strongly represented at the conference no matter by which senior representative and our commitment is very clear." 'They just talk' Prince Charles, 72, is a staunch environmentalist and has spent much of his life promoting and fundraising for green causes. He said he felt the concerns of younger generations and understood why climate campaigners took direct action when politicians failed to deliver on promises. "They just talk, and the problem is to get action on the ground," Charles said. The prince also said he could sympathise with groups such as Extinction Rebellion, but said protests which disrupt or anger people were not the way to go about change. "All these young feeling nothing is ever happening, so of course they're going to get frustrated," he said. "But it isn't helpful, I don't think, to do it in a way that alienates people. "So I totally understand the frustration, the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive rather than destructive. "The point is that people should really notice how despairing so many young people are." Prince Charles also revealed the personal changes he has made to his lifestyle to help combat climate change, including converting his vintage Aston Martin to run on "surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process". The 1970 DB6 convertible runs on blended E85 fuel, which is 85 per cent bioethanol and 15 per cent unleaded petrol. He has also sought to overhaul the way royal properties are heated and powered, including his London residence Clarence House and farm buildings at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. "I have tried for a very long time to make sure the heating is done in a way that is as sustainable as possible," he told the BBC. "So I put in biomass boiler systems and then the solar panels which I managed to get onto Clarence House and at Highgrove on some of the farm buildings, plus trying to reduce as much as possible." The prince has also altered his diet to lessen the impact on the environment, by stopping eating meat and fish on two days each week and having one day a week off dairy products. \</doc>

An Australian woman has confronted Hollywood mega star Leonardo DiCaprio at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, appealing for him to take on the fracking of Indigenous land as his next environmental cause. "Leo, talk to Indigenous women in Australia about fracking on their land," the woman, identified as Rikki Dank said in the video. "The government just gave $50 million to frack their Country. The Australian government is fracking their land!" Ms Dank, described as a Gudanji and Wakaja woman from Borroloola in the Northern Territory, was said to have been subtly pushed back by the actor's security as she tried to get close. As he approached an escalator to the main hall, she could be heard continuing to yell inaudibly in the background. Aboriginal artist Ryhia Dank wrote on Facebook that her sister travelled to Glasgow to represent Indigenous people from Australia. "You can hear her in this video calling on Leonardo DiCaprio to speak to Indigenous women about fracking on Country in Australia, let's hope he heard her," the artist wrote. "I am so incredibly proud my sister took time out of her life and business to travel from Dubai to Glasgow to represent us well done smelly." WHEN LEO MET CHARLES It came as DiCaprio met with Prince Charles and fashion designer Stella McCartney at the summit. The trio looked chummy as they spoke at the the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum to look on at a fashion installation created by the designer who is also the daughter of Beatles legend, Paul McCartney. Like the royal, DiCaprio is a long time environmental campaigner and describes himself as an "actor and environmentalist". Earlier, the Oscar-winner, who is a United Nations climate change representative, shunned a private jet and instead arrived in Glasgow for the COP26 summit on a commercial flight. DiCaprio wore a mask, suit and sported dark sunglasses as he arrived at the Glasgow SEC Centre. Other attendees including billionaire Jeff Bezos have been criticised for travelling to the event via private plane. DiCaprio attended the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit, in support of a campaign to protect the Ebo Forest of Cameroon from logging, and is expected to speak at other events held during the climate change conference. DiCaprio, 46, attended an event with other environmentalists at The Engine Works venue in Glasgow's Maryhill district. He was seen at the COP26 BlueZone at the SEC campus, surrounded by security guards. DiCaprio posed with Emmy-nominated producer Paul Goodenough, who founded the charity Rewriting Extinction, clutching a copy of The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World. The actor is a long-time climate change activist and launched The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation - described as dedicated to the long-term health and wellbeing of all Earth's inhabitant - in 1998. DiCaprio urged world leaders "to take crucial climate action" during COP26 , tweeting: "I join @antonioguterres in urging leaders at # COP26 to take crucial #ClimateAction, safeguard our future, and save humanity. Now is the time for ambition, solidarity, and action. @UN". \</doc>

A good negotiation is supposed to leave everyone feeling a little unsatisfied. The US presidential envoy on climate, John Kerry, said as much when the latest UN climate change conference - COP26 in Glasgow - drew to a close. The Glasgow Climate Pact it produced will have disappointed most countries for one reason or another. But the delegates who arrived in Glasgow hoping for a new financial settlement between rich and poor countries, to help the latter weather the climate crisis, will feel most let down of all. This is part five and the final episode of Climate fight: the world's biggest negotiations , a series on COP26 from HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/the-anthill-podcast-27460 The Anthill podcast As we heard HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-billions-are-being-spent-tackling-climate-change-where-is-it-all-going-climate-fight-podcast-part-1-169120 in the first episode But there's something else developing countries argue affluent countries owe them for: loss and damage. Lisa Vanhala, professor of political science at UCL, explains that this refers to the irreversible impacts of climate change which countries cannot adapt to, like sea level rise. Compensation for loss and damage was "really the big thing that developing countries came into [ COP26 ] united in asking for," Vanhala says. But the result was "no cash on the table", as the EU and US blocked the creation of a facility for delivering loss and damage finance. The fortnight in Glasgow passed with a flurry of pre-arranged deals and speeches by world leaders. In the negotiating rooms, delegates from 197 countries gathered to grind out an agreement, often haggling over lines in the draft text long into the night. COP26 was labelled HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/09/scottish-campaigners-condemn-cop26-as-the-most-exclusionary-ever-accommodation the least accessible In the first days of the summit, long lines kept delegates and observers waiting outside in the rain for hours. So how did all of this affect the eventual agreement? "I think a mistake that is commonly made is to assume that all these negotiation outcomes are rational," says Fran\'e7ois Gemenne, director of the Hugo Observatory at the University of Li\'e8ge in Belgium. Gemenne has studied the UN climate negotiation process for a long time, and saw how administrative blunders helped derail an agreement at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. While he says the UK's handling of the talks and the position of other rich countries on loss and damage will have sowed resentment among developing nations which came to hammer out a deal, "COP is not a one-shot event. It's a continuous process ... and it's important for countries of the global outh [especially] to keep the process rolling." Abhinay Muthoo, a professor of economics and expert in negotiating at the University of Warwick, says "trust is very important... in enriching deals." The Glasgow Climate Pact reaffirmed the desire of all countries to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C. But the discord of COP26 , which included a last-minute intervention by India and China to water down a resolution on coal power, showed how much work is still needed to bridge the divide between developed and developing countries. In this episode, we also speak to Hadeel Hisham Ikhmais, a climate negotiator from Palestine, who explains what it's like to be a negotiator behind closed doors at COP26 .

Late last year, as world leaders entered the final stages of negotiations for emissions targets they would make at COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, a small team had formed in Australia plotting what could turn out to be one of the single largest decarbonisation projects the world had yet seen. The team called itself Project Arise - a partnership between the Australian software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie's private investment vehicle Grok Ventures and Canadian asset manager Brookfield, a corporate behemoth with a track record of energy and infrastructure investing. Project Arise was secretly assessing making an offer to buy AGL, the largest Australian power company. Part of its proposal would be to fast-track the company's plans to close its coal-fired power stations and invest $10 billion to $20 billion in projects to replace them, including with wind farms and big batteries. For years, Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and Australia's third-richest person, had made his frustration at Australia's lumbering climate politics and lack of meaningful action clear. "We face the greatest human challenge for generations and we're not improving our targets? We are using trickery & misleading about our national emissions," he wrote in 2019. "In the past, I believe Australia has always stepped up when asked. We've never dodged our global responsibilities, until now." Cannon-Brookes has become a prominent investor in renewable energy, including plans to develop the world's largest solar farm in the Northern Territory and link it via a cable to Singapore. In 2021, he started thinking about what more his money could do for the planet. On the last day of June, AGL had unveiled a proposal to split itself into two: the first, AGL Australia, would own the group's power, gas and telecommunications retailing arm along with some cleaner generation assets. The other, Accel, would be created to hold AGL's fleet of giant coal and gas-fired power stations, which account for about 8 per cent of Australia's overall emissions. "There is no doubt the winds of change in the electricity market have been substantially faster than many people have anticipated," AGL chairman Peter Botten told investors. "We are very committed to turning this ship around." The influx of wind and solar into the electricity market has been gutting profits of the coal-fired generators that supply the bulk of Australia's power. In the six months to December 31, AGL had sunk to a $2.3 billion loss. But the proposed corporate split did little to address the company's carbon footprint or ensure a smooth transition from coal-fired power. Before long though, it caught the attention of Cannon-Brookes. "[It] didn't make any sense," he thought. It was "going in the opposite direction of what we expected". He assembled a team to consider a takeover bid. One of those advisers caught wind Brookfield was assessing a similar move on AGL. By October, Grok and Brookfield started talking. "Grok was always going to need a financial partner," said one source familiar with the two companies. "It made sense for them to come together." At first blush, Brookfield might seem a strange partner for Cannon-Brookes. The Toronto-listed company has extensive holdings in fossil fuel infrastructure, including in Australia's Dalrymple Bay coal terminal. What it also has, though, is deep expertise in the energy sector and four decades' experience investing in renewable energy. And, importantly it had recently raised a multibillion-dollar carbon fund for the kind of opportunities decarbonising AGL presented. The head of its transition fund is Mark Carney, who has served as governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, and has helped reshape the global financial sector's views on climate. At the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Carney chaired a coalition of banks, investors and insurers that collectively control $130 trillion in assets that it said would be committed to reaching net zero emissions across its portfolio by 2050. Cannon-Brookes became convinced the partnership with Brookfield made sense. "It made very logical sense to combine strengths and together we have built a far superior offer than had individually," he recalls. \</doc>

ABSTRACT Here's how the major parties plan to tackle the climate crisis and protect Australian businesses from worsening disasters. FULL TEXT What\' s going on? Climate change, driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense. In the long-term, unchecked climate change will fundamentally alter life on Earth. Why is it an issue? Experts say we must limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees to avoid devastating, irreversible consequences. Pursuing greener energy sources is a key way to cut the use of fossil fuels. Green energy sources are also rapidly decreasing in price, presenting new opportunities for small businesses. The impacts of climate change can be felt today. The costs of insurance and disaster resilience are rising, as businesses in storm-prone regions can attest. Beyond that, mounting cleanup bills are leading insurers to seek higher premiums; some businesses are simply going without coverage, risking both physical and financial ruin in case of disaster. What are the parties doing about it? What else should I know? Neither major party has flagged a quick retreat from oil, coal, and gas. In fact, Energy Minister Angus Taylor wants to stop operators from HYPERLINK https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/07/angus-taylor-coal-fired-power-plants-agl/ closing their coal plants ahead of schedule. The Coalition\' s enthusiasm for new  low emissions gas projects is backdropped by a stark warning from the International Energy Agency, which says the world can tolerate no new oil, gas or coal developments if we\' re to hit net zero emissions by 2050. Morrison was not keen to attend last year\' s COP26 climate summit, and his government\' s climate promises - predicated on a promise that yet-to-be developed technology will get Australia to net zero  received a frosty reception upon arrival.\~ And this year, the Coalition successfully appealed a ruling which found Environment Minister Sussan Ley HYPERLINK https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/03/15/kids-climate-case-sussan-ley-wins-federal-court/ had a duty of care to future generations when considering the approval of a new coal mine. Labor won\' t push for coal plant closures ahead of the industry\' s timeline, either. After all, Labor was punished at the polls in 2019 for its approach to coal, which some voters saw as a threat to jobs in regional Queensland. The Insurance Council of Australia has HYPERLINK https://www.smartcompany.com.au/finance/insurance/lismore-insurance-experts-smes-protect-business/ criticised the federal government\' s current disaster spending split , saying it assigns 97% on cleanup, and just 3% on disaster mitigation. Alexandra Hordern, director of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, described a sentiment of insurance  market failure among the SME sector. \</doc>

This is branded content for Driva. Increased consumer consciousness has forced companies to do better, driving up pressure for products that are conducive to a sustainable future. As society demands better environmental initiatives, companies have pivoted to include such values in their business plans, with big car brands setting ambitious sustainability targets. Volvo Cars has vowed to only offer electric vehicles by 2030, and are signatories to a COP26 agreement alongside Ford, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes Benz. The climate pledge commits the companies to work towards producing 100 percent zero emission vehicles by 2035. Combine environmental issues, with the squeeze that we're all feeling from the rising cost of living, and it begs the question, is it time to switch to an electric vehicle? Financial benefits With fuel prices at an all time high and cost of living pressures rising while wages remain stagnant, Australians are feeling the pinch. March saw record high dollars charged at the bowser and consumers started to wonder how they would continue to run their cars at such an expense. Electric vehicles could be the answer. According to Driva, the average electric vehicle costs $15 to fully charge and can drive approximately 450km on one full battery. They also cost much less to service and maintain, omitting the need for fuel filters, spark plugs and oil changes among other factors. Government incentives create even more opportunity for savings, with each state government introducing their own. Tasmania for example, announced a two year waiver on stamp duty for new and used EV purchases and a two year exemption on registration for rental car companies when they purchase EVs. Electric vehicles are more accessible than ever, with most reputable car companies offering models priced in the mid-range. Even lenders are incentivising car shoppers to consider an electric vehicle, with lower interest rates. Driva, an innovative car financing platform, is offering a 0.7% interest rate discount on electric car loans with select lenders. General Motors intends to add great affordability to the market with their electrified Equinox SUV, set to launch in 2023 at the reasonable price of $41,500. But for those in the market now, MG provides their ZS EV at $44,990 drive away. The environmental benefits Assessing emissions from EVs and comparing them against internal combustion engine vehicles is not straightforward. While EVs don't release tailpipe emissions, charging them via the electricity grid does generate carbon dioxide. Even with Australia's current grid being powered predominantly by coal and fossil fuels, the CO2 emissions from charging EVs are still substantially less than those generated by ICE vehicles. And as movement is made towards renewable energy, potential is high for even smaller emissions from EVs. An article published by Forbes pitted the Volkswagen Golf 1.0 TSI against its BEV (battery electric vehicle) counterpart, the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro Performance. After calculating the vehicle's own CO2 emissions and the emissions generated by fuel or electricity production, the BEV still came out on top, emitting 36.2% less CO2, even after using Australia's notoriously polluting grid as an example. Performance and convenience The greatest pushback preventing widespread acceptance of EVs is the misconception that they aren't as efficient in their performance and convenience as petrol fueled cars. When in fact, they can actually accelerate faster than ICE vehicles due to the reduction in moving parts and the uncomplicated engine. There is however the lack of charging stations nationwide to consider, with only 3000 public charging stations dotting mostly the perimeter of Australia. That's predicted to be a fleeting problem though, with the first round of the government's Future Fuels Fund funnelling $24.5million into fast charging stations in 2021, creating 403 EV fast charging stations across the country. The initiative includes three rounds of funding and $500million to build infrastructure in a bid to overcome barriers that prevent Australians purchasing EVs. With the driving range of EVs constantly improving, the charge in a full battery is often enough to last city drivers an entire week, and home charging stations are predominantly used unless drivers are travelling. Electric vehicle sales are rapidly increasing, with sales doubling within the months of January, February and March this year, in comparison to the same period last year. So with increased demand, Australia will surely follow suit of other countries more advanced in the EV market. This is branded content for Driva. \</doc>

Business and industry say the Morrison government needs to set a stronger 2030 emission reduction target to help companies lock in behind the government on the way to net zero by 2050. While Prime Minister Scott Morrison and federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor might have been hoping to draw a line under the issue following the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, business is keen to keep the pressure on the federal government to move towards a low-emissions economy. In a further sign climate policy will be a key battleground in next year's federal election, former Dow Chemical boss Andrew Liveris has called on the government to set stronger interim targets on the way to 2050. Mr Liveris said he considered the COP26 summit to have been a "mild success". While China and India were criticised for watering down the final text relating to the "phasing out" of coal, Mr Liveris said the business presence at the summit showed companies were working to deliver the technology solutions to shift away from fossil fuels. "We have to set some meaningful short-term targets for 2030 and business will align very quickly," he told The Australian Financial Review yesterday following a presentation to the UBS Australasia conference about the possibilities for business on the path to a low-emissions economy. "Business is tired of it and are going to go for it. Businesses are going to set internal books because they have to play global markets. "If business takes the bit between its teeth post-Glasgow and starts to lean in and focuses on the half-a-dozen technologies [including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage], then this will create wealth and jobs like no other decade." Mr Liveris said he was not surprised the Coalition government had backed away from setting stronger 2030 targets, but expected that after the federal election, which is due by May, Australia would go to next year's COP27 summit in Egypt with a stronger commitment. "As the new year turns into the election cycle, whoever wins - and I assume it's a Coalition win - I think it's time to go back to Egypt with firmer targets for 2030," he said. The Morrison government used COP26 to reaffirm its commitment to emission reductions of 26 per cent to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, but predicted it could be as high as 30 per cent to 35 per cent by the end of the decade. Ms Westacott - whose organisation had called for emission reduction targets of 46 per cent to 50 per cent by 2030 - said the COP26 summit showed momentum was continuing to build towards net zero. "The practical approach adopted means commitments are more likely to be delivered. Crucially, the Glasgow conference has set the scene for further negotiations on interim targets in Egypt next year," she said. "The government has rightly committed to net zero emissions, not because of a global conference, but because it is in our national interests. Our trading partners are demanding greener products and businesses are acting now to decarbonise rapidly, stay competitive and to keep and create jobs in Australia." Woodside Petroleum chief executive Meg O'Neill said the stated commitments from COP26 would still leave the globe warming, but "it's a significant improvement over where we've been in the past". "I think the world has greater visibility of the sorts of commitments that move the needle in terms of decarbonisation," she said. AGL Energy chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said he was "astonished" the United States and China found common ground on climate policy. "I think the final declaration when it switched from 'phase out', to 'phase down', somehow brought in by the Chinese and by the Indians, was a small, small compromise which needed to be done," he said. "But, in general, it's a clear sign of where the energy industry, in particular the carbon-heavy industry, has to go. And we are fully committed along these lines, as AGL Energy has shown." The Special Adviser to the Morrison government on low-emissions technology and former chief scientist, Alan Finkel, said there were not many "verifiable actions" from COP26 , but it did a good job of raising awareness about the issues. "The solution to reducing emissions is providing alternatives. I don't believe that anything in the Glasgow pact will dramatically reduce demand for coal just by asking countries to reduce their needs. You have to provide alternatives," he said. Mr Liveris, a key business adviser to the federal government on its gas-led recovery, said gas would play a crucial role in the transition to low-emissions technologies.

Ray's Reasoning Now that the COP26 UN climate talks in Glasgow have finished and the headlines have disappeared, it is time for some unhurried assessment of what the Glasgow Climate Pact actually achieved. Has it saved the planet from climate change disaster, or, in the words Greta Thunberg, was it just a lot of "Blah, blah, blah"? The United States climate envoy John Kerry said it will bring the world closer than it has ever been to the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C, while the Guardian columnist George Monbiot called the deal a "suicide pact". "This is not good enough", said Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. Climate Action Tracker revealed that even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1C. COP26 President Alok Sharma broke down during the last day of the conference, reported the ABC, apologising over a last-minute alteration to the text of the agreement. The change, which was led by India and China, watered down the commitments regarding coal, replacing "phase out" with "phase down". More on this issue below. So, are the nay-sayers right, or is John Kerry being overly optimistic? Let's analyse the actual outcomes to find out. Firstly, there was some progress on cutting emissions, but nowhere near enough. The Paris Agreement said temperatures should be limited to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and countries should "pursue efforts" to limit warming to 1.5C. Before COP26 Announcements at COP26 , including new pledges to cut emissions this decade, by some key countries, have however only reduced this to a best estimate of 2.4C, the New Daily reported. A world warming by 2.4C is still clearly very far from 1.5C, and will lead not just to higher temperatures and devastating climate disasters such as floods and fires, but to many parts of the world becoming uninhabitable. However, there is the possibility of further cuts in the near future, for the final text of the GCP requests that countries come back next year with new updated plans that will address toughening up targets for 2030, rather than focussing on 2050. The above-mentioned outcome that the use of coal should be phased down, as should subsidies for fossil fuels, is at least a step in the right direction. But the wording is weaker than the initial proposals, with the final text calling for only a "phase down" and not a "phase out" of coal, due to India's last-second intervention. However, this is the first time fossil fuels have been mentioned in a UN climate talks declaration. It is an important shift that breaks the taboo of talking about the end of fossil fuels. Nonetheless, phasing something down is a far cry from ending it, and the continued use of any fossil fuels, however 'phased down' they might be, would still keep the planet warming by 2.4C. Another problem with the GCP is that rich countries continued to ignore their historical responsibility. Small island states and climate-vulnerable countries say the historical emissions of the major polluters have caused these impacts, and therefore funding is needed. Developed countries, led by the USA and the EU, have resisted taking any liability for these losses and damages and vetoed the creation of a new "Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility" called for by most countries. To sum up, as The Guardian explained, "Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and the International Energy Agency has made clear that if it is not rapidly phased out, the world has no hope of staying within 1.5C of global heating". Unfortunately, Australia has welcomed this watered-down agreement. Resources Minister Keith Pitt called it an economic win, saying it meant Australian mines wouldn't have to close. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor issued a defiant statement making it clear the government would be committing to nothing more ambitious than its existing 2030 goal, which is a meagre 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels. Compare that with the US's cut of 50 per cent. No doubt Messrs Taylor and Pitt are beating the election drum already underway. Let's hope they get a rude awakening when the electorate votes to save the planet. After all, national polls show an overwhelming majority of Australians want a far stronger climate change policy. \</doc>

Scott Morrison has conducted a Royal family blitz on his final day in Glasgow, privately meeting with Prince Charles at COP26 to sell his net zero emissions by 2050 plan. Mr Morrison told Prince Charles, who has described COP26 as the world's "last chance saloon", it was "wonderful to see you again" before outlining his plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. Weeks ago when Mr Morrison was undecided whether he would attend the climate change conference, Prince Charles strongly urged him to participate after being asked in a BBC interview about whether the Prime Minister should travel to Glasgow. "Australia's done it here at COP26 . We've doubled our climate finance commitments and we're working very closely with our Pacific family, with Prime Minister (Frank) Bainimarama and the whole team, which I know you have a great affection for the Pacific," Mr Morrison told Prince Charles, who replied "absolutely" before the pair attended a Commonwealth leaders' reception. Mr Morrison also mingled with Prince Charles, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge at a world leaders' reception dinner hosted by Boris Johnson on Monday night. In his final event at the UN climate change conference, Mr Morrison joined Prince William to announce the COP26 Earthshot Prize. Prince Charles and Prince William have increased their roles at the UN climate change summit after the Queen was forced to stay away on doctors' orders. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who flew into Glasgow after his weekend election victory, also met with Mr Morrison on the sidelines of the COP26 summit on Tuesday., Mr Morrison - who worked closely with Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga to strengthen the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - congratulated Mr Kishida on his election victory and invited him to visit Australia, with the pair keen to sign a Reciprocal Access Agreement as soon as possible to further boost defence ties. A readout of the meeting released by Mr Morrison's office said the leaders spoke about their "strategic alignment and shared commitment to a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific region", and complementary roles of the ASEAN and Quad alliances. Mr Kishida told "ScoMo" that Japan wanted to "elevate our special strategic partnership to an even higher level". "Japan and Australia are at the heart of the engine that drives our efforts to realise a free and open Indo-Pacific," Mr Kishida said. Mr Morrison said Australia and Japan stood together "to address the great challenges of our region - a free and open Indo-Pacific". "Whether it is addressing climate change, whether it is dealing with security interests of our region, or indeed ensuring the broader economic prosperity of our region as so many people across the Indo-Pacific are lifted out of poverty and we're seeing the region realise its objectives," he said. "We're looking forward to our partnership and taking it to a new level - our partnership through the Quad but most importantly our partnership bilaterally." \</doc>

This assessment is based on current submitted climate pledges by each country, known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs, together with legally binding net-zero commitments.

But it's almost certain to include a strengthening of the language of the Paris Agreement, hopefully with a formal commitment that warming will be held to 1.5?. Reason for hope As with previous conferences, policy commitments at Glasgow will be insufficient to reach the 1.5? target. Most notably, the commitment to reduce methane emissions is, at this stage, merely an aspiration with no concrete policies attached. And as HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ analysis released on Tuesday found, real-world action is falling far short despite all the net-zero promises. If that "snail's pace" continues, a temperature rise of 2.4?, or even 2.7?, remains a distinct possibility. But the technologies and policies needed to hold warming to 1.5? are now HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/scott-morrison-is-hiding-behind-future-technologies-when-we-should-just-deploy-what-already-exists-169016 available to us . And they can be implemented without condemning developing countries to poverty or requiring a reduction in living standards for wealthier countries. The fact we have these options reflects both remarkable technological progress and the success of policies around the world, including emissions trading schemes and renewable energy mandates. Thanks largely to government support, advances in solar and wind technology kicked off in the early 2000s. This ultimately pushed the cost of carbon-free electricity HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea below that of new coal-fired and gas-fired plants. The biggest impact was felt in the European Union, where carbon prices and emissions trading drove a rapid transition. The EU has a HYPERLINK clear path to the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The most important requirement is to accelerate the transition to carbon-free electricity. This involves rapidly expanding solar and wind energy and replacing petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles with electric alternatives. These changes would incur a one-off cost in scrapping existing power plants and vehicles before the end of their operational life, but would reduce energy and transport costs in the HYPERLINK https://thedriven.io/2020/07/23/lifetime-cost-of-electric-cars-already-lower-than-comparable-ice-vehicles/ long run . Other important steps are already beginning. They include reducing methane emissions, and adopting carbon-free production methods for steel, cement and other industrial products. Hydrogen produced from water by electrolysis will be crucial here. There is no guarantee these outcomes will be achieved. The leading national emitters - China, India and the United States - have all been inconsistent in their pursuit of stabilising Earth's climate. China is currently HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-29/xi-wont-go-to-glasgow-as-china-struggles-with-coal-shortages/100567034 wavering as economic difficulties mount. In the US, Donald Trump has not ruled out a presidential bid in 2024 which, if successful, would almost certainly reverse progress there. Global action on climate change is still not nearly enough, but we're undeniably moving in the right direction. By the time of the next major COP, presumably in 2026, Earth could finally be on a path to a stable climate.

ANDY PARK, REPORTER: China is the elephant not in the room at COP26 . So what good are Glasgow agreements anyway if the leader whose country is responsible for around 28 per cent of the world's carbon emissions isn't even there, and what of the fossil fuel reliance and climate goals of China, India and Russia, who combined make up two-fifths of the world's emissions? TIM BUCKLEY, INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY ECONMICS: China is very coal dependent. China imports a lot of oil, they import even more gas, fossil gas. JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: I indicated that China and Russia not showing up in Saudi Arabia is a problem. I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China, with respect to China, not showing up. ANDY PARK: Despite an absence from Glasgow, President Xi Jinping submitted China's new 2030 targets to the UN last week. XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (translated): In the past 15 years, the cut of China's carbon emissions intensities has greatly exceeded the climate action goals of 2020. TIM BUCKLEY: President Xi has already committed to peak emissions before 2030. He has already committed to net zero before 2060 and so the fact he's absent from the actual in person COP discussions to me is largely immaterial. China has set the stage with enormous global ambition. ANDY PARK: Not only will China's carbon emissions peak before 2030, they intend to reduce something called carbon intensity, a measure of emissions per unit of gross domestic product, a key indicator for the world's economic powerhouse, by 65 per cent by 2030. Crucially, for a country in which coal accounts for around 60 per cent of energy supply, they plan on cutting all fossil fuels in energy to 75 per cent by 2030. A sign that China intends to continue its dominance in zero carbon emissions technologies. TIM BUCKLEY: China in my view is already the world's largest developer of zero emissions industries of the future. They're the largest investor and China is talking about building 1200 gigawatts of wind and solar and just to put that in an Australian context, that is 20 times the entire electricity generating capacity of Australia. ANDY PARK: Unlike all other participants at Glasgow, who have signed up to net zero by 2050, Russia only plans to reduce emissions by 80 per cent in that year. President Putin, absent from Glasgow, instead sent a pre-recorded message, affirming that Russia will strive for carbon neutrality by 2060. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (translated): We don't just want to reach carbon neutrality, but make it so that in the nearest three decades, the accumulated volume of greenhouse gas emissions in Russia is less than even for our neighbours in the European Union. JOE BIDEN: His tundra is burning, literally the tundra is burning. He has serious, serious climate problems. ANDY PARK: Russia intends to use its vast forests as a carbon sink and did sign up to Glasgow's agreement to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. But as a major gas supplier to Europe, Russia refused to join with more than 100 countries pledging methane cuts, as did Australia and India. NARENDRA MODI, INDIAN PRIME MINISTER (translated): India is the only big economy in the world that has delivered both in letter and spirit on its Paris commitments. ANDY PARK: India's announcement at Glasgow of a net zero target two decades after the US and 10 years later than China has been widely received as a strategic move. TIM BUCKLEY: So India's committed to net zero emissions by 2070, a very conservative target. They have also committed within that to a 45 per cent emissions intensity of economic growth, a 45 per cent reduction by 2030. That is really important to get on the path to decarbonisation. They committed to 500 gigawatts of renewables by 2030. ANDY PARK: The developing country, vulnerable to climate change with an emerging middle class, is seeking $1 trillion in climate finance, mainly from developed countries further down the decarbonisation pathway. ANDY PARK: Unlike China, which is relying on transition fuels, India could leapfrog to zero emissions industries. TIM BUCKLEY: We're seeing India building out its solar manufacturing capacity, talking about a green hydrogen strategy and electric vehicles, lithium ion batteries. ANDY PARK: With Glasgow coming to a pointy end of negotiations, the promises and actions of the world's developing nations and big polluters so far has been mixed - hedging their bets, not wanting or needing to lead in conquering emissions challenges, while the first world still grapples with theirs. \</doc>

Labor has unveiled its climate plan with a pledge to cut emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. The election promise comes after the Coalition reluctantly committed to a net zero by 2050 target before the COP26 global climate conference last month, but refused to update its 2030 target from 26 to 28 per cent. Despite this, the Morrison Government has forecast the nation will "beat" that target and achieve a 35 per cent cut to emissions on 2005 levels. Australia was ranked last in the COP26 climate index, and would not sign up to initiatives such as cutting methane. It also supported a push for the COP26 communique to urge for coal to be "phased down" rather than "phased out". Labor leader Anthony Albanese said his party's long-awaited climate plan was the "most comprehensive modelling ever done by any opposition in Australia's history since Federation" and that it was the "right plan for Australia". "Our plan will create 604,000 extra jobs by 2030. Five out of every six (jobs) will be in regional Australia," he said. "Our plan will create jobs, cut power bills, boost renewables and reduce emissions, which is the right plan for Australians." The Opposition Leader defended having a less ambitious 2030 target than the 46-to-50 per cent cut previously called for by the Business Council of Australia. "It is a modest policy. We do not pretend that it is a radical policy. It is a consistent policy with our approach," he said. "Business wants certainty. Major businesses and peak organisations all call for net zero by 2050 - well before this Government did." Shadow climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen slammed the Morrison Government's climate modelling, calling it a "fortune cookie". "This Government keeps missing opportunities ... our emissions are (not) coming down fast enough to protect our planet," Mr Bowen said. "The modelling shows that Labor's policy will reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. "Australia's electricity market will be 82 per cent renewable under the policies of an Albanese Labor government (and) 43 per cent will be Australia's new target medicated by the Albanese Labor government." Labor also wants to bid for Australia to host a future COP climate summit in an effort to rehabilitate the country's global environment reputation. The Opposition pledged to remove taxes on electric vehicles to make them between $2000 and $12,000 cheaper. But Labor will not mandate vehicle emissions standards designed to induce manufacturers to sell cleaner cars. \</doc>

Glasgow | The COP26 summit has injected fresh momentum into a global push to lay down intercontinental cables linking renewables-starved countries where demand is high to places with a strong solar supply. The "Green Grids Initiative" launched by COP26 host Britain and India, with Australian support, will deliver a fillip to Sun Cable, the Australian company planning to power Singapore with renewable energy from the Northern Territory. Sun Cable CEO David Griffin said he had spent his week in Glasgow meeting not only potential customers and investors, but with other industry players, mostly in Europe. Collaboration, as envisaged by the Green Grids Initiative, would be key to driving innovation and getting these projects off the ground, he said. "Our focus at the moment is in the Asia-Pacific, but we are aware of other opportunities out there. There are parties developing products of a similar nature," he said. "We've been approached by others to replicate what we've been developing with the Australia-Asia Power Link, and we're keen to work with them." The Green Grids Initiative aims to create "new transmission lines crossing frontiers and connecting different time zones, creating a global system of interconnected renewables that are shared for mutual benefit and global sustainability". Participating governments will co-ordinate on investment, and on developing new financial instruments, market structures and technical assistance to support the nascent industry. The steering group comprises Australia, France, India, the US and Britain, and some 80 countries have signed on. Sun Cable is an early starter, with a $30 billion-plus, 4200-kilometre cable planned to transmit up to 4 gigawatts of renewable power from a solar farm at Tennant Creek to Singapore, with battery storage in Darwin and Singapore, and a marine repair base in Indonesia. It is backed by Atlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest, and was one of the Australian government's business showcase partners at COP26 . Mr Griffin said the COP26 initiative would help those in the industry work together to overcome technological challenges and regulatory hurdles. "It just builds on a global scale, it builds up the industry knowledge of how to deliver the transmission systems in a more efficient manner and encourages the next stage of development for intercontinental transmission: higher voltages, new materials, scientific advances," he said. Other early starters are concentrated in Europe, which has high demand for renewable power but less access to solar generation in particular. Projects include Xlinks, to hook up Britain to Morocco; the EuroAsia interconnector between Israel, Cyprus and Greece; and the EuroAfrica cable from Egypt to Cyprus and Greece. "We're very keen to see these other European-based projects progress. That just builds more global capacity to deliver these ... projects, and establish intercontinental transmission as a brand-new industry," Mr Griffin said. He said innovation in intercontinental connectors could only come from building at "multi-gigawatt scale". "When you develop multi-gigawatt scale renewable energy projects, it does naturally lead to exciting innovation in design and delivery of those systems that hundreds-of-megawatt scale projects just can't justify putting that level of effort into," he said. Mr Griffin said his trip to Glasgow had been "a great opportunity to talk to suppliers, offtakers, multiple governments and investors all under one roof - it's very efficient". He described the challenge that COP26 was trying to address - "a total transition of the entire global energy system" - as "mind-blowing". "Am I confident that can happen? ... I am more confident than not," he said. \</doc>

As the Glasgow climate summits gets underway, New Zealand's government has announced a revised pledge, with a HYPERLINK headline figure of a 50% reduction on gross 2005 emissions by the end of this decade. This looks good on the surface, but the substance of this new commitment, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution ( https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs NDC ), is best assessed in emissions across decades. New Zealand's actual emissions in the 2010s were 701 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent. The carbon budget for the 2020s is 675Mt. The old pledge for the 2020s was 623Mt. The Climate Change Commission's advice was for "much less than" 593Mt, and the new NDC is 571Mt. So yes, the new pledge meets the commission's advice and is a step up on the old, but it does not meet our HYPERLINK https://www.lawyersforclimateaction.nz/news-events/press-release-creative-accounting-makes-ndc-look-better-than-it-is fair \~ HYPERLINK share under the Paris Agreement. It is also a HYPERLINK https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/climate-change-conference-emissions-to-be-cut-by-50-per-cent-below-2005-levels-by-2030/WRDDTBYBIRDSOTQSDP7UH6KWLI/ stretch to call the new NDC consistent with the goal of keeping global temperature rise under 1.5?. True 1.5? compliance would require halving fossil fuel burning over the next decade, while the current plan is for cuts of a quarter. Emissions need to halve this decade Countries' climate pledges are at the heart of the Paris Agreement. The initial round of pledges in 2016 added up to global warming of 3.5?, but it was always intended they would be ratcheted up over time. In the run-up to COP26 , a flurry of new announcements brought that figure down to 2.7? - better, but still a significant miss on 1.5?. As this graph from the UN's HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021 Emissions Gap Report 2021 New Zealand's first NDC, for net 2030 emissions to be 30% below gross 2005 emissions, was widely seen as inadequate. An update, reflecting the ambition of the 2019 Zero Carbon Act to keep warming below 1.5?, has been awaited eagerly. But several factors have combined to make a truly ambitious NDC particularly difficult. First, New Zealand's old climate strategy was based on tree planting and the purchase of offshore carbon credits. The tree planting came to and end in the early 2010s and is only now resuming, while the Emissions Trading Scheme was closed to international markets in 2015. The Paris Agreement was intended to allow a restart of international carbon trading, but this has not yet been possible. Second, New Zealand has a terrible record in cutting emissions so far. Burning of fossil fuels actually https://theconversation.com/lawyers-challenge-new-zealands-proposed-emissions-budgets-as-inconsistent-with-the-1-5-goal-162504 increased by 9% from 2016 to 2019. It's a challenge to turn around our high-emissions economy. Third, our new climate strategy, involving carbon budgets and pathways under advice from the Climate Change Commission, is only just kicking in. The government has made an in-principle agreement on carbon budgets out to 2030, and has begun HYPERLINK https://consult.environment.govt.nz/climate/emissions-reduction-plan/ consultation on how to meet them. The full emissions-reduction plan will not be ready until May 2022. Read more: COP26 Regarding a revised NDC, the government passed the buck and asked the commission for advice. The commission declined to give specific recommendations, but advised: We recommend that to make the NDC more likely to be compatible with contributing to global efforts under the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5? above pre-industrial levels, the contribution Aotearoa makes over the NDC period should reflect a reduction to net emissions of much more than 36% below 2005 gross levels by 2030, with the likelihood of compatibility increasing as the NDC is strengthened further. The government then received HYPERLINK https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news-media/reports/afair2030targetforaotearoareport/ advice on what would be a fair target for New Zealand. However, any consideration of historic or economic responsibility points to vastly increased cuts, essentially leading to net-zero emissions by 2030. Announcing the new NDC, Climate Change Minister James Shaw admitted it wasn't enough, HYPERLINK https://www.newsroom.co.nz/new-paris-target-might-actually-reduce-emissions-a-bit saying : I think we should be doing a whole lot more. But, the alternative is committing to something that we can't deliver on. What proper climate action could look like Only about a third of New Zealand's pledged emissions cuts will come from within the country. The rest will have to be purchased as carbon credits from offshore mitigation. That's the same amount (100Mt) that Japan, with an economy 25 times larger than New Zealand's, is HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Japan%20First/JAPAN_FIRST%20NDC%20(UPDATED%20SUBMISSION).pdf planning to include New Zealand has an impressive climate framework in place. Unfortunately, just as its institutions are beginning to bite, they are starting to falter against the scale of the challenge. The commission's advice to the minister was disappointing. It's being challenged in court by HYPERLINK https://www.lawyersforclimateaction.nz/news-events/ccc-jr Lawyers For Climate Action New Zealand , whose judicial review in relation to both the NDC and the domestic emissions budgets will be heard in February 2022. With only two months to go until 2022 and the official start of the carbon budgets, there is no plan how to meet them. The suggestions in the HYPERLINK https://consult.environment.govt.nz/climate/emissions-reduction-plan/ consultation document Read more: Electrifying transport: why New Zealand can't rely on battery-powered cars alone But industry needs to step up massively. The proposed 2037 end date for coal burning is far too late, while the milk cooperative Fonterra - poised to announce a HYPERLINK https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/agribusiness/126785114/fonterra-dairy-farmers-on-track-for-record-milk-price-with-13b-economic-boost record payout to farmers - intends to begin phasing out natural gas for milk drying only HYPERLINK https://www.fonterra.com/content/dam/fonterra-public-website/fonterra-new-zealand/documents/pdf/submission-climate-change-commission-draft-recommendations.pdf after that date. The potentially most far-reaching suggestion is to set a renewable energy target. A clear path to 100% renewable energy would provide a significant counterweight to the endless debates about trees and agricultural emissions, but it is still barely on the radar. Perhaps one outcome of the new NDC will be that, faced with the prospect of a NZ$5 billion bill for offshore mitigation, we might decide to spend the money on emissions cuts in Aotearoa instead.

ANALYSIS: Emmanuel Macron has been returned, so much of the world - and at least 58 per cent of France - will breathe a sigh of relief. His task of unifying the country, however, has only just begun and his victory cannot be viewed as justification for the past five years. It is clear many voters held their nose and voted for him - this time through gritted teeth. Marine Le Pen, defeated for a third time, is now a spent force. But the tens of millions who voted for her remain angry and disillusioned with the direction of their country, and they blame Macron for their woes. About one in three - more than 12 million - abstained or cast an invalid ballot. It is the highest number in a presidential election in 50 years. Macron's win is critical for democracy and a unified Europe and a hammer blow to those authoritarian states that despise those values. But the real danger for mainstream politics is that the perception that Macron is arrogant - and it is widespread - will be reinforced rather than tempered by his re-election which is, remarkably, the first by an incumbent in 20 years. It's why a triumphant Macron urged his supporters at the base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris's most famous landmark, to not jeer the mention of Le Pen. "Dear friends, we must also be careful and respectful because our country is full of division ... therefore we must be strong. No one will be left by the wayside," he said. France, like many Western democracies, is bearing witness to the destructive social forces unleashed by populist politicians from the fringes. It is a nation whose fault lines - economic, geographic and generational - run deeper than ever. They are turbo-charged by social media and a fragmented media market where political parties are adopted like football teams, and loyalty is sworn to policies just like team colours. Since her trouncing in 2017, Le Pen has added disenfranchised blue-collar workers and young families struggling to keep their heads above water to her hardcore far-right base. And the promise Macron made five years ago - to bring the people together rather than feed hate and demagoguery - must still be his aim. In 2017 Macron stunned the nation when, aged 39, he became France's youngest leader since Napoleon by demolishing the established post-war political parties only a year after setting up his own, now called La R&#xE9;publique En Marche. He has been, by any objective view, a good leader for France. He set out to transform through a big agenda. Domestically, he overhauled the labour market, making hiring and firing easier, and by doing so, unemployment fell to its lowest level in 13 years - from 10 per cent to 7.4 per cent. It's just shy of the ambitious target of 7 per cent set in his original manifesto. He is also viewed to have reduced corruption through his "moralisation of politics" law, which, among other things, stopped politicians hiring relatives or spending cash handouts as they chose. Macron's first term was hit by turbulence through two major external crises - the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine - but at home he had to wrestle with terror attacks, the longest French strike since May 1968, and the yellow-jacket protests against his policies. Although the freshness of his personality and his outsider qualities underpinned the appeal that vaulted him to his first election win, he entered this contest viewed as the establishment. Both the radical left and far-right loathe him. Even his most strident supporters would say the past five years haven't been perfect. His team was shaken by bad polls just a few weeks ago when he had only bothered to hold one election rally, instead telling voters he was preoccupied with Ukraine. He spent months promising enormous state spending on schools, security, energy and defence, and in the past week appealing to the green vote by spruiking action on climate change. But Macron's record doesn't really enthuse climate campaigners. His biggest advantage was that he was running against a right-wing nationalist who denounced net zero targets and pledged to dismantle wind farms and place a moratorium on new wind and solar power. And while he appeared at COP26 and a series of major summits as a climate warrior, successive assessments showed France wasn't reducing greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to meet its objectives under the Paris climate agreement. Like much of the world, Macron now faces a cost of living crisis which has been weaponised with great effect by his rival. His proposed pension reforms - lifting retirement age to 65 - look shaky, and the full threat of the war and the pandemic remain unknown. Macron's victory should not be misunderstood as an endorsement of him - it was perhaps more a rejection of what else was on offer. And now he must get to work on the global stage, as the undisputed leader of Europe, to ensure it remains united against Russian aggression and weans itself off Putin's oil and gas. Domestically, he must also remember that, sooner or later, if sensible people who promise change don't deliver it, then they will be discarded for any old snake oil salesman, or woman, who promises to throw out the old guard and start all over again. \</doc>

Emissions reduction Measuring the true value of investing in the oldest greenhouse gas reduction technology means farmers can reap the financial benefits of their land management. If there is one message from COP26 to date, it is that reducing the world's emissions is more necessary than ever, and that the geopolitical climate for achieving this is more complex than many like to suggest. COP26 in Glasgow has been about emissions targets, the technology needed to achieve them and their importance in protecting the environment. Less in focus has been the heavy lifting we will need from our environment to achieve those targets, and that is opening an international asset class that could attract trillions of dollars globally. It is why Australia's participation in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) announced during COP26 is so important. In simple terms, the world needs to better understand and measure the value of our natural capital - to help unlock investment in the world's oldest greenhouse gas reduction technology. Nobody gets to net zero without the environment, without what it can achieve in emissions reduction. Understanding the true value of our natural capital - our soils, water, oceans, biodiversity and spectacular landscapes - presents an enormous economic opportunity and a critical pathway for investment. Formally launched in June 2021, the TNFD is a global collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop a framework to support financial flows towards nature-positive outcomes. There is a TNFD forum of institutions and governments including Australia, the UK, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Peru, as well as a taskforce of 33 senior executives from financial institutions, corporates and market service providers, including three Australian members: Macquarie's Liz O'Leary, Scott Mesley from KPMG Australia, and Guy Williams from Deloitte Australia. While residential real estate accounts for our property boom, the growing realisation of what lies ahead in climate finance and Australia's unique wealth of natural capital assets could well emerge as a serious challenger. The natural capital metrics program announced in the 2021-22 budget will facilitate the development of approaches and tools that enable the measurement, integration and accounting of natural capital in financial decision-making, products and solutions. At COP26 The better we can identify and measure the true value of investing in the environment, the more we can encourage private sector funding that can generate environmental and economic returns, and the more environmental philanthropists can confidently contribute. This is not about locking up the farm and selling it to foreign investors to offset emissions - it is about identifying the economic benefits of modern agriculture and even urban design, and it is about identifying the wider economic contribution of our landscapes and oceans. It is about providing farmers and other landholders with the tools they need to attract investment by showcasing the true value of their environmental management. Only last month, The Australian Financial Review reported on Kilter Rural winning a $US50 million ($67 million) mandate from a US institutional investor for an Australian Farmlands Fund. The fund is repurposing underutilised farming properties with quality infrastructure to produce higher-value crops, while reforesting 30 per cent of the landscape. It was reported as targeting 12 per cent growth through organic and conventional crops, while providing carbon sequestration through soils. Growing our understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of these investments is the key, and that is work that Australia is already leading on. The government's commitment to blue carbon - the subject of another key COP26 announcement - is a prime area for the valuation of natural capital. Blue carbon includes the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses that absorb carbon and support marine species. As part of our $100 million Oceans Leadership commitment, we are investing $30 million in a Blue Carbon Conservation, Restoration and Accounting Program. At COP26 , Australia also launched the Blue Carbon Accelerator Fund that will focus on restoration and conservation projects. Whether it is governments, commercial investment or companies looking to extend their social licence through environmental philanthropy, the importance of grasping the economic value of assets remains. Again, natural capital is not a term for locking up or selling off the environment, nor for crippling one industry sector at the expense of another. It is an important tool in ensuring the environment is valued along with any other asset, and that the private sector can credibly invest in outcomes that can help us all. It is, in short, about creating opportunities to invest in our future. Sussan Ley is the Environment Minister. \</doc>

Mr Morrison's legacy at COP26 will not be one of effective diplomacy, nor of progressive climate ideas. Instead, it will be one of sloganeering. His recurrent use of "the Australian way" is embedding itself into common language - to denote a facade of supposed action, when in fact there isn't any. "The Australian way" is becoming a "drover's dog" saying for the English-speaking world. If COP26 In the past few days, the government has published its National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy 2021-2025, so as to be available for COP26 . This document appears to follow the "Australian way" of reacting to an urgent, complex issue by producing a colourful, well-constructed document with little substance. Cynically, it has been delivered by a minister who recently approved three new coal mines, and by a government refusing to sign the methane 30 per cent reduction pledge - an action which will compromise our resilience. Will this strategy document do anything to address the fact that Australia does not have policies and plans for adaptation, when at least 106 other countries do? The strategy has no defined policy on a range of issues, no legislative safeguards or targets, no comprehensive delivery of essentials such as health policy, and no clear funding. Prior to COP26 , US President Joe Biden announced $US105 billion for environmental resilience to address the impacts of extreme weather events. On a per capita basis, Australia would need to announce about $A10.9 billion to match this. To properly plan for effective resilience, every government department must commit to a co-ordinated approach. One of many areas requiring urgent attention is the wide range of health impacts brought on by climate change, recently detailed by Doctors for the Environment Australia. The past decade was the hottest on record for Australia, with the temperature almost 1 degree above average. Life becomes increasingly unliveable when temperatures soar above 40 degrees, and indeed infants and the elderly become physically stressed and in danger of collapse. Our heat-related mortality rate is about 2 per cent, causing more deaths than bushfires or any other environmental event. Already some locations in Australia regularly reach 40 degrees or more, and many regions will become progressively unliveable. Countless towns in regional and rural Australia will need heat shelters, just one of a host of health needs yet to have national help or policy. The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements detailed the urgent need for bushfire shelters, but these need to be multipurpose, for more long-term use by young and old in severe heat waves. This illustrates the need for national co-ordination and expertise on just one of countless resilience issues. Are local communities, councils and authorities expected to develop their shelter plan with local expertise on structural, heat-resistant architecture, or will there be a national blueprint they can vary for their own needs? The plan must include fire and heat-proof building regulations, secure energy with storage from a localised grid, first-aid facilities, secure communications, water security and capacity for local population requirements. READ MORE: Global carbon emissions will surge to pre-pandemic levels, but COP26 pledges bring hope COP26 pledges to cut methane emissions, halt and reverse deforestation Australia snubs global pact to end coal production Such co-ordination and delivery are interdepartmental necessities which appear to be beyond the federal government's capacity, as evidenced by national issues such as COVID vaccine delivery, renewable energy development, Murray River security and biodiversity protection. The government is hindered by the smoldering climate denial in the National Party. What we need is an independent body of expertise, a Sustainability Commission or an Independent Climate Change Commission as detailed in Zali Steggall's climate change bills. This would encompass all existing resilience measures, including the National Recovery and Resilience Agency. It is inconceivable that a federal government can deliver this co-ordination from the proposed National Adaptation Policy Office. My pointing out these national inadequacies should not be taken as downplaying the efforts and plans of states, territories, local authorities and the input from many groups, including the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action. Many will feel shamed by Australia's fellow-travelling with Russia and China in the coal and methane mining camp. Our government's choice amounts to a denial that global warming may become irreversible this decade, and may condemn millions to a terrible future. Unfortunately, the position of a Labor government may not be appreciably different. The confronting message from COP26 is for our nation to urgently build our resilience to coming disasters - and to avoid doing it "the Australian way".

Climate change is commonly discussed as though it's a uniquely atmospheric phenomena. But the crisis is deeply entwined with the ocean, and this has largely been neglected in international climate talks. The latest international climate negotiations made some progress by, for the first time, HYPERLINK https://www.becausetheocean.org/the-ocean-anchored-in-glasgow-climate-pact/ anchoring oceans permanently into the multilateral climate change regime. But the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021/outcomes-of-the-glasgow-climate-change-conference Glasgow Climate Pact Most countries have targets for land-based emissions - but there are no such targets for oceans. Yet the ocean plays a vital role in helping balance the conditions humans and most other species need to survive, while also offering a substantial part of the solution to stop the planet warming over the crucial limit of 1.5? this century. So how can oceans help us tackle the climate crisis? And what progress has been made in international negotiations? The ocean's incredible potential Since industrialisation, the ocean has absorbed HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar5/ 93% of human-generated heat HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5153 one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO?). The consequences of this are profound, including the thermal expansion of water (the key cause of sea level rise), ocean acidification, HYPERLINK deoxygenation (oxygen loss), and forcing marine life to redistribute to other places. Alarmingly, this may one day lead the ocean to reverse its role as a carbon sink and release CO?

Crucially, we must see changes to maritime industries. The shipping industry alone has a similar carbon footprint to Germany - if shipping were a country it would be the world's sixth-largest emitter.

Read more: To reach net zero, we must decarbonise shipping. But two big problems are getting in the way These include seafoods sourced from fisheries with sustainable management practices, such as avoiding overfishing and reducing carbon emissions. Markets and technologies should also be geared towards the large-scale production and consumption of aquatic plants such as seagrasses. There's also a wealth of opportunity in "blue carbon" - capturing CO? in the atmosphere by conserving and restoring marine ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes. However, the success of nature-based solutions depends on a healthy ocean ecosystem. For example, there are emerging concerns around the impact of HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/oil-companies-are-ploughing-money-into-fossil-fuelled-plastics-production-at-a-record-rate-new-research-169690 plastic pollution on plankton's ability to absorb CO?.

The International Energy Agency has estimated offshore wind could HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/offshore-wind-outlook-2019 power the world 18 times over its current consumption rate . Climate talks are making slow progress For more than a decade, the inclusion of oceans in climate talks has been piecemeal and inconsistent. Where they have been part of negotiations, including at COP26 , talk has focused on the potential for coastal areas to adapt to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, as first raised in international fora HYPERLINK http://www.islandvulnerability.org/slr1989/declaration.pdf in 1989 by small island states.

While these are positive measures, at this stage they don't require action by parties. Therefore, they're only a theoretical inclusion, not action-oriented.

It will depend on how the UNFCCC bodies respond to these directives, and their success in extending obligations to state parties.

Over 450 of the world's banks HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/8f7323c8-3197-4a69-9fcd-1965f3df40a7 have committed to a new initiative at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference which is designed to decarbonise their investments. Overseen by former Bank of England supremo Mark Carney, the banks and other financial institutions signing up to HYPERLINK https://www.gfanzero.com/ Gfanz (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) are pledging to report annually on the carbon emissions linked to the projects they lend to. They are also aiming to provide trillions of dollars in green finance, while committing to net zero emissions across the board by 2050. HYPERLINK Major signatories to the initiative, which was originally unveiled HYPERLINK https://racetozero.unfccc.int/net-zero-financial-alliance-launches/ in April , include Citi, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. While it's very encouraging to see many of the world's leading banks committing to sustainable lending, it's hard not to feel apprehensive. It certainly isn't the first opportunity that they have had to decarbonise their loan books, and so far the results have not been impressive. In 2019, the UN General Assembly exuberantly launched its HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/ principles of responsible banking (PRBs) with similar goals in mind. The banks that signed up agreed, among other things, to "work with their clients to encourage sustainable practices" and to "align their business strategy" to the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals UN sustainable development goals HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris climate agreement HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5 So far , many of the biggest banks in the world have not signed the PRBs, even though the principles have been the gold standard until now for committing to decarbonising lending. Leading signatories are also a long way from satisfying their requirements - not to mention those of Gfanz. Greening finance Banks can contribute to solving the climate crisis from two angles: their lending and their investments. On the investment side, we saw a tipping point in 2020 when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, HYPERLINK https://ukinvestormagazine.co.uk/blackrock-to-focus-on-esg-and-climate-change-in-2020/ announced that it would concentrate its investments on securities that were focused on sustainability. Lending is still in the nascent stages of its green transition, however. And since it is well accepted that it makes up the majority of corporate finance, this area is make or break for decarbonising the industry. HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/prbsignatories/ Well over 200 international banks have signed the principles of responsible banking in the past two years, but, many of the biggest banks are not among them. Of the HYPERLINK https://www.advratings.com/banking/worlds-top-banks-by-market-cap top ten banks (by market capitalisation), only Citi, Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China are signatories. A further six - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, China Construction Bank, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and China Merchants Bank - are not on the list. I should stress that being a signatory to the PRBs is a limited commitment. Signatories have four years to comply with the principles. Even then, everything is voluntary and non-binding, so signatories are not penalised or even named and shamed for failing to live up to the principles. To get a sense of the status quo, HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5 I looked at the lending practices of three major signatory banks - Citi, ICBC and Japan's MUFG - for the years 2016-19. This covers the period directly after the Paris Agreement to the year the PRBs were signed. You might have expected banks that were serious about their commitments to have been cutting back on carbon-heavy lending in this period. I focused on banks' lending to fossil fuels extraction, because data is readily available and because this is very much the top of the pyramid when it comes to carbon emissions. I also compared three other major banks who are not signatories to the PRBs: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. I found that Wells Fargo and JP Morgan were the world's largest financiers of such companies during that period (though Wells Fargo dropped to third HYPERLINK in 2020 ). Neither signed the PRBs, though both are now members of Gfanz. Both state in their annual reports that they are committed to the Paris climate agreement. Both did reduce their total fossil fuels lending each year from 2018 to 2020, by 57% and 23% respectively. Citi, meanwhile, was the third-biggest fossil fuel lender in 2016-19 despite being a signatory to the PRBs (and Gfanz), and reached second place in 2020. And MUFG and ICBC, who are also signatories to the PRBs, both grew their fossil-fuel lending over the period. MUFG is also a Gfanz member, though neither ICBC nor any of the other Chinese banks are part of the new initiative. Also note that HSBC was not a major lender to fossil fuel projects despite not being a signatory to the PRBs (though it too has signed up to Gfanz). Six banks and fossil-fuel finance 2016-19 From this, I see no discernible sign that the PRBs have so far made any difference to lending in this area. Despite the roar at the UN General Assembly, my worry is that this tiger is proving toothless - and there is reason to fear that Gfanz will go the same way. The way forward When signatories to the PRBs are lending money, they are supposed to carry out environmental-impact assessments and to measure the greenhouse gas emissions of projects. This is not a minor issue considering that such work is beyond the traditional competences of banks and will significantly affect their operational costs. Signatories are also supposed to ensure that loans go to projects that are carbon neutral. This means that borrowers have to commit to mitigation actions that last for the whole life-cycle of the project. It is part of each signatory's obligation to ensure that such mitigation actions are carried out, by monitoring the project throughout its duration. Yet the suspicion is that very little of this is happening on the ground at present. To change this, we would probably need to move to a scheme by which the PRBs are compulsory and binding. Unfortunately, Gfanz does not look like that scheme. Though the annual reporting requirements on carbon emissions are a step forward, nothing in the initiative is mandatory either. It was HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/9105cc47-58fb-47dc-8233-6b622fb56ae2 also criticised in the weeks leading up to COP26 because the members refused to agree to end lending to fossil fuel projects this year. Instead they aim to halve their carbon emissions in a decade. My own view is that it wouldn't make sense to abruptly forbid lending to non-green projects now, since we need to avoid hitting hardest the banks that are traditionally most involved in carbon-heavy sectors. Instead, loan books need to be treated as a portfolio of projects in different tones of green, with a defined trajectory towards greener - but it needs to be mandatory for signatories. It's a pity that Mark Carney and other banking leaders did not work towards strengthening the PRBs rather than come up with yet another initiative. I also worry that Gfanz muddies the waters by combining investing and lending rather than focusing purely on lending. We don't need more roaring; we need a tiger that actually has some teeth. We invited the banks referred to in the article to comment on their lending activities in this area. MUFG sent us links to its carbon neutrality declaration and environmental and social policy framework.

If there is one message from COP26 to date, it is that reducing the world's emissions is more necessary than ever, and that the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/world-leaders-playing-to-different-audiences-in-glasgow-20211031-p594qt geopolitical climate HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/glasgow-grinding-in-the-right-direction-says-carbon-market-ceo-20211104-p5961k COP26 in Glasgow has been about emissions targets, the technology needed to achieve them and their importance in protecting the environment. Of lesser focus has been the heavy lifting we will need from our environment to achieve those targets, and that is opening an international asset class that could attract trillions of dollars globally. It is why Australia's participation in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) announced during COP26 is so important. In simple terms, the world needs to better understand and measure the value of our natural capital - to help unlock investment in the world's oldest greenhouse gas reduction technology. Nobody gets to net zero without the environment, without what it can achieve in emissions reduction. Understanding the true value of our natural capital - our soils, water, oceans, biodiversity and spectacular landscapes - presents an enormous economic opportunity and a critical pathway for investment. Formally launched in June 2021, the TNFD is a global collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop a framework to support financial flows towards nature-positive outcomes. There is a TNFD forum of institutions and governments including Australia, the UK, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Peru, as well as a taskforce of 33 senior executives from financial institutions, corporates and market service providers, including three Australian members: Macquarie's Liz O'Leary, Scott Mesley from KPMG Australia, and Guy Williams from Deloitte Australia. While residential real estate has been Australia's property boom, the growing realisation of what lies ahead in climate finance and Australia's unique wealth of natural capital assets could well emerge as a serious challenger. The Natural Capital Metrics Program announced in the 2021-22 budget will facilitate the development of approaches and tools that enable the measurement, integration and accounting for natural capital in financial decision-making, products and solutions. At COP26 Natural Capital: Unlocking Private Sector Investment, which outlines our key initiatives to support the development of a new global asset class of environmental investment markets and to increase private investment in Australia's natural capital. It showcases work already taking place within the finance sector to value how we manage and assess natural capital. The better we can identify and measure the true value of investing in the environment, the more we can encourage private sector funding that can generate environmental and economic returns, and the more environmental philanthropists can confidently contribute. This is not about locking up the farm and selling it to foreign investors to off-set emissions - it is about identifying the economic benefits of modern agriculture and even urban design, and it is about identifying the wider economic contribution of our landscapes and oceans. It is about providing farmers and other landholders with the tools they need to attract investment by showcasing the true value of their environmental management. Only last month, https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/kilter-rural-snaps-up-us50m-insto-mandate-20211025-p592wd The Australian Financial Review reported on Kilter Rural winning a $US50 million ($67 million) mandate from a US institutional investor for an Australian Farmlands Fund. The fund is repurposing underutilised farming properties with quality infrastructure to produce higher value crops, while reforesting 30 per cent of the landscape. It was reported as targeting 12 per cent growth through organic and conventional crops, while providing carbon sequestration through soils. Growing our understanding of the environmental and economic benefit of these investments is the key, and that is work that Australia is already leading on. The Australian government's commitment to blue carbon - the subject of another key COP26 announcement - is a prime area for the valuation of natural capital. Blue carbon includes the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses that absorb carbon, and support marine species. As part of our $100 million Oceans Leadership commitment we are investing $30 million in a new Blue Carbon Conservation, Restoration and Accounting Program. At COP26 Whether it is governments, commercial investment or companies looking to extend their social licence through environmental philanthropy, the importance of understanding the economic value of assets remains. Again, natural capital is not a term for locking up or selling off the environment, nor for crippling one industry sector at the expense of another. It is an important tool in ensuring the environment is valued along with any other asset, and that the private sector can credibly invest in outcomes that can help us all. It is, in short, about creating opportunities to invest in our future. \</doc>

Woodside Petroleum says it has completed the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the Pluto LNG Train 2 processing facility to Global Infrastructure Partners, a deal first announced in November. The sale of the stake in the joint venture - for $4.9bn - paved the way for the biggest Australian resources project in almost a decade. The processing unit will be used to treat low-carbon gas from the offshore Scarborough field in Western Australia for 30 years. But funding for the deal has angered environmental campaigners, who on Tuesday accused National Australia Bank, ANZ and Westpac of "trashing any net zero commitments they have" by being part of a consortium lending to GIP. "The International Energy Agency has made it clear there is no room for new fossil fuel supply projects if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement," said Jack Bertolus, a campaigner with Market Forces. "Yet, despite a clear commitment to net zero, NAB has just led a global banking consortium to enable a 1.6 billion-tonne carbon bomb, with ANZ and Westpac as part of the deal." The banks are among 18 global financial firms to back GIP in the deal, including Japanese bank Mizuho, Britain's HSBC and Standard Chartered, and the Bank of China. In a statement on Tuesday, Woodside chief executive Meg O'Neill said she looked forward to the development of the Pluto LNG Train 2 project with GIP. "GIP brings established, global capabilities to the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture which will support delivery of a world-class project," Ms O'Neill said. "The development of Scarborough gas through Pluto Train 2 is expected to deliver significant value to our shareholders, create thousands of jobs and deliver energy to domestic and international customers for decades to come." The estimated capital expenditure on the project from October is $US5.6bn ($7.8bn), and the first LNG cargo will be in 2026. The joint venture requires GIP to fund its 49 per cent share of capital expenditure and an additional amount of construction capital expenditure of $US822m. Ms O'Neill in November was critical of activists calling for the end of fossil fuels during the UN's COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow. "We think the rhetoric associated with COP26 is grossly -divorced from the reality of the world's energy needs," Ms O'Neill said at the time. "When you look at the amount of energy the world needs to keep lights on, keep homes heated and cooled and keep food refrigerated, it's tremendous." GIP had been in exclusive due diligence and pole position to buy the asset after Brookfield and CKI had earlier fallen away in the long-running competition. The acquisition comes after GIP in December agreed to buy a 26.25 per cent ownership interest in the infrastructure of Shell's Queensland LNG project for $US2.5bn. It manages more than $US71bn in assets. In November, Woodside cut its oil and gas reserves for its Greater Pluto fields just weeks after surprising the market with a major downgrade of its minority reserves at the Wheatstone project. The company's shares closed 4c lower on Tuesday at $25.20. \</doc>

SCOTT Morrison has been thanked for being a "dear friend" to India on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday morning took to Twitter to declare there is never "a dull mom-ent" when he's with his friend Mr Morrison. It came just hours after he praised the Australian medical regulator's decision to recognise India's locally produced Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin. Mr Morrison (pictured with Mr Modi) tweeted it was "wonderful" to see his friend at COP26 . As the G20 leaders' summit kicked off last week, Australia and India were joined only by China to resist a global bid to phase out coal-fired power and mining. In his address to the COP26 summit, Mr Modi committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2070 - two decades later than the rest of the world. The announcement falls short of a key goal of the climate summit, which is for -nations to agree to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. India is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon -dioxide after China, the US and the EU. It is the fifth largest export market for Australian coal, and imports into the country have risen off the back of Australian trade woes with China. Mr Modi also promised his nation would transition to generating 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030. The Indian leader made the most of his time at the UN leaders' summit, meeting with several of his international counterparts. Earlier, he met with Prince Charles, thanking the royal for his commitment to sustainable development. \</doc>

Zimbabwe is HYPERLINK ranked in the top 20 countries https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/southern-africa-special-report-january-7-2021 three to six bad rainfall seasons They also come against a background of HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349138874_Revision_of_Zimbabwe%27s_Agro-Ecological_Zones_Government_of_Zimbabwe_under_Zimbabwe_National_Geospatial_and_Space_Agency_ZINGSA_for_the_Ministry_of_Higher_and_Tertiary_Education_Innovation_Science_and_ a drying climate trend in Zimbabwe What's happening in Zimbabwe holds important lessons for the global community ahead of the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ COP26 global climate change talks . The first is that climate change, with other factors, is already putting lives and livelihoods around the world on the brink. Much focus has been on how small the window of opportunity is for global action - as if the world still had a couple more years before things really get bad. In Zimbabwe, for some of the poorest farmers, growing a potentially lucrative cash crop like tobacco has already become unviable. For many, the crisis is now. Second, heavily commercialised agriculture, especially livestock production, is HYPERLINK https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/13715 amongst the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions . It's a bitter irony that it therefore contributes to the precarity of farmers, like those in Zimbabwe, who bear little or no responsibility for climate change. And yet agriculture has not historically been a high priority on COP agendas. The research These lessons are drawn from our HYPERLINK https://www.future-agricultures.org/publications/apra-working-paper-64-commercial-tobacco-production-and-climate-change-adaptation-in-mazowe-zimbabwe/ research in Zimbabwe, conducted as part of of the HYPERLINK https://www.future-agricultures.org/apra/#intro Future Agricultures Consortium Due to high mortality rates of smoking, tobacco isn't everyone's choice of cash crop to promote. But it's seen by some as HYPERLINK a route out of poverty HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837719303291 "success story" for the HYPERLINK https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/fast-track-land-reform-zimbabwe fast-track land reform programme In the 1920s, 96% of the precolonial population were dispossessed of their land. Roughly 50% of the land, including all the best agricultural land, was given over to the 4% of the white settler population. Communal lands were the agriculturally marginal areas into which the black population was resettled. The fast-track land reform programme established land leases for two types of plots. The first were plots of between 5 and 10 hectares intended for small scale black farmers aiming to start or increase commercial production. The second were plots of between 50 and 200 hectares for farmers who already had established commercial credentials. Many of these recipients have taken up tobacco, such that production levels have almost recovered to above the pre-land reform levels, in particular owing to its HYPERLINK take-up by small-and medium-scale farmers . But climate impacts threaten the viability of tobacco production. Our key finding was that when rain-fed rather than irrigated, tobacco is one of the riskiest crops, even on land well-suited to growing it. This is both from a climate and a commercial perspective. Predictably, the higher the level of access to irrigation and other resources, the better able farmers are to weather the impacts and reduce climate-related production risks. And beneficiaries of land reform in Mazowe do seem, to varying degrees, better able to adapt to the new climate realities. Access to better land seems to have been crucial to building an asset base, itself an important component of adaptive capacity. Yet the risks are greatest among farmers predominantly in communal land, for whom the crop is already a marginal and precarious undertaking. These farmers are often amongst those most in need of the cash, assets and stability that tobacco can provide. The majority of communal land farmers in the area we worked in were, at the time, on food aid, experiencing the opposite of poverty reduction via income from tobacco. Climate change and social injustice Increasingly, farmers who don't have access to irrigation and inputs are HYPERLINK abandoning the crop As we found through our research, these difficulties aren't solely caused by climate change. Its effects coexist with an ongoing array of processes, including: chronic economic instability and recurring bouts of inflation over four decades, the sharp reduction in agricultural extension provision in recent decades,   the linking of the provision of input subsidies to political support, the low placing of Zimbabwean farmers in international tobacco value chains. At the same time, the inputs provided for tobacco produced under contract farming no longer include fuel, such as gum trees and coal, for curing tobacco. This displacement of a production cost onto the farmer has led to tree cutting, and is implicated in larger patterns of HYPERLINK https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/16428 deforestation . It's no coincidence that tobacco, as with much agricultural production, HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319143816_A_History_of_the_World_in_Seven_Cheap_Things promotes unsustainable modes of commodification and consumption of nature . Markets continue to function as if the real costs of environmental change did not need to be priced in to agricultural produce, and the deeply inequitable distribution of revenues from global agricultural produce did not matter. Implications for the negotiators Against this background, the https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2020/11/food-and-farming-reform-key-to-tackling-climate-change relatively low profile of agriculture at the global climate talks is hard to understand. But the implications from Zimbabwe for the climate change negotiators are clear. First, if we are to see meaningful change, these underlying dynamics need to be a focus for the negotiations. Yet, in the run-up to COP26 it doesn't appear that they are. Second, if things don't change, the people least responsible for climate change, in Zimbabwe and far beyond, will continue to be amongst those most exposed to and suffering from its accelerating intense impacts.

Regions dissatisfied with the Nats Many regional voters are dissatisfied with the extreme elements of the National Party (Re: Southern Nationals unrest, 14/10). There are now more than 30 'voices' groups in electorates across the country. This view is supported by Australian National University political science emeritus professor John Warhurst quoted in the NQR (14/10) as saying the moderate Nationals seem to be overwhelmed by "the voices of Matt Canavan, George Christensen and others". There are 21 marginal coalition seats across the country, and the government is so worried that NSW Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has written to the Australian Electoral Commission asking it to investigate the voices groups. This action smacks of sour grapes and will not win votes. What will win votes is honesty, establishing a federal ICAC, standing for strong action on climate change, and listening to local people. The next election is one of the most important in our history. We owe it to young Australians to get it right. - Ray Peck, Hawthorn, Vic PM should take Aussie coal to chilly Glasgow PM Morrison should not attend COP26 unless he also takes some high-energy Australian black coal to show the energy-starved Europeans the best source of stored solar energy. As European winter approaches, just a few days of cold weather will see electricity rationing or blackouts. Already, old coal plants are being fired up as wind, biomass and solar underperform and gas supply is limited. What happens to COP26 if France cuts the nuclear extension cord to UK? Many energy-consuming notables plan to attend COP26 including Pope Francis, British royals, Greta Thunberg, Joe Biden, John Kerry and Sir David Attenborough. Not one of them will bring a bucket of coal, so it is up to Scott Morrison to keep the European home-fires burning. Boris Johnson should also get a fracking expert from Colorado to attend COP26 to teach UK and Europe how to frack their abundant gas deposits instead of paying ransom prices for Russian gas. - Viv Forbes, Washpool \</doc>

From an early age, most of us are encouraged to read the fine print in any contract or agreement. With this maxim in mind, it is interesting to consider the numerous pledges and proclamations made at the recent climate change Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow and question their validity. Because as official observers to COP26 , the World Coal Association is wondering what was really achieved. Take for example, the non-binding pledge to "phase out" coal by 2030 championed so pugnaciously by COP26 president Alok Sharma, and agreed to by an eclectic coalition of countries. According to Sharma, and a coterie of other leaders, the Glasgow summit was going to be the "COP to end Coal". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Glasgow would "consign coal to history." Jotters and magic markers in hand, most attendees generally agreed: coal would be "phased out". Fourteen days later, in Saturday overtime, as the wording of the final consensus document was being hotly debated, it was left to India's Climate Minister Bhupender Yadav to argue (rightly) that developing countries could not phase out coal and other fossil fuels when they still have serious economic agendas to pursue and poverty to eradicate. Thanks to that intervention - with support from China's delegation head, Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who said it was time for developed countries to honour their commitments and enhance support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions - it was agreed that unabated coal (as specifically referenced in the fine print of the Paris Agreement) could be phased down - but not out. So, what really happened? Climate leaders, especially those from the noble Global North - the UK, US, EU - have conveniently ignored the fine print in the Paris Agreement - particularly Article 10.2, which calls for all fuels and all technologies to be deployed in mitigating emissions. Similarly, countries have failed to undertake the "cooperative action" which the Paris Agreement specifically demanded. It is no wonder that countries across the coal-relevant Global South (including China, India, South Africa, Indonesia), are reluctant to make pledges because they simply have no basis in the fine print of the Paris Agreement. These nations and other supporting coal-producing nations, including Russia and Australia, understand that energy security is fundamental to economic, social and environmental survival - the needs of billions of people. In a time of clean technological choice, it would simply be irresponsible for a nation to put all their eggs in one (energy) basket. Nor should they. And why would they? The failure of $US100bn ($140bn) pledged at COP22 in Milan in 2020 to help developing countries decarbonise was the subject of much heated debate. A subsequent pledge was made to increase the amount. The details are nebulous and non-binding. It is no wonder that countries with a significant coal footprint are dubious about the commitments they are being asked or forced to make. They are naturally sceptical given the failure of leaders to adhere to the minutiae of the Paris mandate. If the world is really serious about the Paris Agreement, it should agree to "phase in" all clean technologies, including clean coal technologies such as High Efficiency Low Emissions (HELE), Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Coal-to-Hydrogen - technologies which are already recognised by climate science as essential to reaching a net zero emissions future. The fine print is about abatement and diversity - the capacity for coal and other fossil fuels to be included in the different energy pathways individual countries choose. It is their sovereign right to make their own decisions, and each has a different footprint. If global climate change soirees are the way forward, the debate is lost in semantics. It has still not been recognised that coal remains essential to electricity supply in 80 countries, and it will still represent almost 40 per cent of Asia's electricity supply by 2040 (according to the International Energy Association). It remains crucial to Australia's economy as our second-largest export, worth about $50bn, and employing more than 350,000 Australians (direct and indirect). Throughout the world, coal will remain the backbone and building block of economic progress, responsible for the supply of 90 per cent of the world's cement, and 70 per cent of world steel (and the 170 tonnes of coking coal which goes into every wind turbine). So, what happened at COP26 ? Today's bizarre geopolitical climate has driven a wedge between reality and dogma. Until the Global North appreciates the differentiated responsibilities and decarbonisation pathways of the Global South, and appreciates the Paris fine print, we should not expect too much from roving conventions. To recall an old idiom: we all need to walk a kilometre in the other's shoes. In the case for coal, we need to appreciate that all sizes and styles are necessary if we want to reach the same destination together.

\~\~Australia's plan to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 assumes soaring export values while potentially creating more than 100,000 jobs. \~\~ Modelling underpinning the target anticipates all of Australia's export markets to increase in value by mid-century, including mining by five per cent. \~\~ This is despite the value of Australia's coal production halving because of changing global demand. \~\~ The value of agriculture is also projected to grow by 30 per cent and heavy industries by 110 per cent by 2050. \~\~ Modellingforeshadows the potential creation of more than 100,000 jobs, including up to62,000 in mining and heavy industries. \~\~ Prime Minister Scott Morrison released the modelling on Friday afternoon as international COP26 \~\~ He was criticised for not making the detail public before Glasgow. \~\~ The share of electric or zero emissions vehicles on Australia's roads is also expected to skyrocket to 90 per cent. \~\~ This corresponds with road transport emissions falling by more than 70 per cent by mid-century. \~\~ Electricity generation is projected to be around two-and-a-half times 2020 levels by then, with variable renewables accounting for about 80 per cent of generation. \~\~ The modelling anticipates Australia's net zero emissions reducing by 85 per cent by 2050, with "further technological improvements" relied on to make up the gap. \~\~ "The department considers it likely that further technology breakthroughs and cost reductions beyond those modelled could close the remaining gap to net zero emissions by or before 2050," it said. \~\~ It assumes an average global temperature rise of 2C and does not consider the economic consequences of climate change itself. \~\~ "The modelling and analysis is not a precise prediction of how trends in technology or the Australian economy will unfold over the next three decades," it said. \~\~ "In particular, the quantity of emissions reduction or offsets generated in the model should not be interpreted as requiring a specific reduction or output from that sector." \~\~ Energy Minister Angus Taylor insisted the modelling set out a credible pathway to net zero emissions while preserving existing industries. \~\~ ?The modelling shows that a clear focus on driving down technology costs will enable Australia to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 without putting industries, regions or jobs at risk,? he said. \~\~ Meanwhile, Opposition LeaderAnthony Albanese maintained Labor would release its mid-term emissions target after the COP26 climate summit. \~\~ "There'll be plenty of time for us to go through the detail of what medium-term objectives we have and for us to have a debate about that," he said. \~\~ Mr Albanese would not be drawn on whether he supported a draft COP26 decision urging a 45 per cent reduction on emissions by 2030. \~\~ Climate Council senior researcher Tim Baxter said the 2C temperature scenario would mean the death of the Great Barrier Reef and serious problems for Pacific islands. \~\~ ?At COP26 in Glasgow, our Pacific island neighbours have been mobilising around the mantra of ?1.5 to stay alive?," he said. \</doc>

COP26 About 30,000 people attending the UN's Conference of the Parties world leaders' climate summit for a fortnight of talks from October 31 face an expensive and logistic nightmare. Glaswegians are moving out of the city to rent their apartments for more than \'c2\£31500 ($2800) a night to well-heeled government representatives. Most of the 120 world leaders and their entourages attending have found rooms in Glasgow or Edinburgh, although there are reports some delegations are staying nearly 150km away. But everyone else has been scrambling. Glasgow has had the house-full sign out for more than a year and for months Edinburgh has also been full, with the only rooms available in that city - a 45-minute train commute - around $600 a night. But climate activists and -others on more modest budgets, have been securing rooms in towns a 100km away, relying on train and bus transport to attend official events. However, those plans have been thrown into disarray after the RMT union, which represents train drivers at ScotRail, have voted 86 per cent for strike action during COP26 over pay and conditions. Garbage collectors are also preparing a strike during the summit fortnight, which could leave the city, controlled by the Scottish Nationalists, looking like a rubbish dump. Labour politician Neil Bibby told the Daily Record the situation facing COP26 was an -embarrassment. " COP26 is falling into sheer chaos as the SNP's industrial relations collapse," he said. "It is an embarrassment to Scotland that the SNP can't even keep the trains running when the world's eyes are upon us. "This conference is supposed to be about preventing environmental catastrophe - and the SNP are setting the stage by -letting trains grind to a halt and litter fill the streets. "Rail workers were on the frontline right through the pandemic and the way they have been treated in return is disgraceful. "The SNP must intervene to deliver a fair pay deal before their contempt for workers brings COP26 to its knees." Glasgow residents have been bracing for transport gridlock for months, as officials begin to close off major arterial roads, pedestrian routes and bicycle lanes all around the city this week. Major tourist attractions in the city are also closing. But organisers are concerned that the traffic situation will -become utterly unworkable if the many thousands of delegates staying in Edinburgh cannot -arrive by train. One collective called The Human Hotel network has set up a home stay, couch-surfing style website for activists to source a cheap bed during the summit. While they have helped find beds for about 700 people, they say -another 3000 people are still trying to find rooms. \</doc>

Details of the Paris climate change deal are overlooked From an early age, most of us are encouraged to read the fine print in any contract or agreement. That's where the truth resides and how any significant commitment ultimately lives or dies.

Washington: When Joe Biden arrives at the Glasgow climate conference in a fortnight, the US President will be accompanied by a high-powered delegation. Biden's entourage will feature 13 cabinet members and other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The show of force is intended to send a message to the world that his administration regards HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/biden-and-the-eu-can-forge-a-new-path-on-global-warming-20210107-p56scp.html tackling climate change as a top priority . Adding to the star power, former President Barack Obama is travelling to COP26 as well. What is far less assured is whether Biden will be bringing a realistic plan to turn his bold climate promises into reality. HYPERLINK deliver on the pledge If the US President shows up to Glasgow empty-handed, as climate activists increasingly fear he will, it will dramatically weaken his credibility and undermine his efforts to convince other world leaders to raise their climate ambitions. Just as Scott Morrison has to placate Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce to adopt a 2050 net zero target before Glasgow, Biden has his own complex party conflicts to reconcile before landing in Scotland. Biden's hopes of signing significant climate legislation into law rest on a single member of the US Senate: Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia. Manchin represents one of the country's top coal-producing regions and his state overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump at the last election. Like in north Queensland or the Hunter Valley, the prospect of a rapid shift towards renewable energy is a frightening one for many West Virginians. Manchin, who positions himself as a champion of the coal industry, is also a significant investor in fossil fuel companies. That's a massive problem for Biden given he needs the support of all 50 Democratic senators - including Manchin - to pass any legislation through Congress. A sweeping US$3.5 trillion bill currently before Congress contains an array of climate measures that would go a long way towards meeting Biden's 2030 emissions reduction target. But Manchin has reportedly said he will block the climate centrepiece of the bill: the US$150 billion Clean Electricity Performance Program, a mechanism that would reward electricity generators that transition to renewable energy and penalise those which don't. Manchin's stance, first reported in The New York Times, has infuriated environmentalists, who regard the clean electricity program as a highly effective way to drive down greenhouse gas pollution. Michael Mann, one of America's most prominent climatologists, said on Twitter that Manchin had "just launched a hand grenade at Glasgow". Mann said that without the clean electricity program, the Biden administration cannot meet its 2030 carbon reduction target. "And international climate negotiations begin to collapse," he wrote. Environmentalist Bill McKibben was equally alarmed by Manchin's threat to "gut" Biden's climate agenda. "This is high on the list of most consequential actions ever taken by an individual Senator; you'll be able to see the impact of this vain man in the geologic record," McKibben said on Twitter. Manchin's opposition to the clean energy program has set Democrats scrambling to find a way to rewrite the bill in a way that could pass the Senate without squibbing on climate change. There is talk of inserting a form of a carbon tax into the bill, but it's far from clear this would win Manchin's support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants a bill to pass Congress by October 31 so the US can serve as "a model for the world" to follow at Glasgow. The fate of Biden's climate agenda - and quite possibly the Glasgow summit itself - are at stake. But time is rapidly running out and there's no sign the Democrats have found a way through the impasse. Get a note direct from our foreign correspondents on what's making headlines around the world.

Three outstanding Illawarra woman who have spent countless hours advocating for their community have been recognised on International Women's Day. Keira - Cath Daly Cath Daly has been recognised as Keira's Woman of the Year for her work with the Bellambi Neighbourhood Centre. Ms Daly works tirelessly for her community as the co-ordinator of the Bellambi's neighbourhood centre. The past year has been particularly challenging due to the pandemic, but Ms Daly has provided outstanding leadership to her community through the Covid lockdown and was also integral in co-ordinating a pop-up vaccination hub together with NSW Health at the neighbourhood centre. "Cath has made a wonderful contribution to our community, in particular the community of Bellambi," Keira MP Ryan Park said. "She has a genuine want to help and assist those community members who are less fortunate." Wollongong - Moemoana Schwenke Moemoana Schwenke made headlines last year for travelling to the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow. The 21-year-old Samoan-born Wollongong resident addressed the conference as part of The Pacific Climate Warriors. The University of Wollongong student wants to bring Pacific Islands culture to her community and raise awareness of the impact climate change is having on Pacific Island nations. "Wollongong has a rich history of activism that has had national and international influence and helped create change," Wollongong MP Paul Scully said. "Moemoana has again put Wollongong on a world-stage with her activism and advocacy on behalf of the Pacific Island nations, and her dedication to promoting Samoan and Pacific Island culture among our community." Indigenous woman Dr Jodi Edwards has been named Shellharbour's Woman of the Year for her ongoing contributions to the Shellharbour community and the broader Illawarra region. Dr Edwards has been a longstanding member of a number of culturally significant committees over the years, and is responsible for helping to establish Gumaraa Aboriginal Cultural Education and the Illawarra Flame Trees Aboriginal Performing Arts Group. She currently works as a curriculum advisor for Aboriginal Education with the NSW Education Standards Authority, providing expertise and advice to support the curriculum reform and delivery process. "She continues to make incredible contributions to our community with an unwavering passion towards revitalising the Dharawal language in the Illawarra," Shellharbour MP Anna Watson said. "Her ultimate goal is for the Dharawal language to be taught and spoken in Illawarra schools. "Jodi has dedicated her life to ensuring that local Aboriginal people have access to quality services, continuation and understanding of cultural practices and language, and educating the public on the history and significance of our local area." \</doc>

PRINCE Charles and Sir David Attenborough opened the Glasgow climate summit with an urgent call to action as Boris Johnson warned COP26 loomed as a disastrous failure. The UK Prime Minister, who is hosting the critical talks, said the emissions reduction pledges of world leaders were "drops in a rapidly warming ocean". After some of the world's biggest emitters, including China and Russia torpedoed plans for an ambitious G20 climate declaration, Mr Johnson said "if Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails". Prince Charles told more than 100 world leaders they needed to be on a "warlike footing". Sir David Attenborough also demanded action, declaring: "There is no negotiating with nature, no way to greenwash physics, no moment more precious and important than now." Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, defended the G20 outcome and said it was "naive" to expect all countries would take the same path to net zero. Having rejected a commitment to phase out coal-fired power, the Prime Minister said there "will be progress" from COP26 . The Australia Institute's climate program director Richie Merzian, a former Australian COP representative, said Mr Morrison's protection of coal meant he would "rightly share the blame" if Glasgow failed to deliver. US President Joe Biden said it was "disappointing" Russia and China "basically didn't show up" at the G20 in Rome, as pressure mounted on him to help land a global deal. In Mr Morrison's statement to COP26 , he confirmed even though Australia was maintaining its target of a 26-28 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, the country was on track to deliver a 35 per cent cut. He pushed his "technology not taxes" approach, declaring that raising the cost of energy would otherwise harm "those who can least afford it". "Cleaner technology solutions must out-compete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies," Mr Morrison said. "This needs to work not just in the developed economies of the North Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo Pacific as well." With a key goal of the summit to deliver a $100bn climate finance fund for developing countries, Mr Morrison announced Australia would lift its $1.5bn commitment over the next five years to $2bn. Mr Johnson said future generations of children would "not forgive us" if COP26 was the "historic turning point where history failed to turn". \</doc>

The recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-deal-how-rich-countries-failed-to-meet-their-obligations-to-the-rest-of-the-world-171804 served the interests of rich, industrialised nations over those of the poor and climate vulnerable countries. This was another missed opportunity. While most of the countries most vulnerable to climate change sought urgent emission reductions and compensation for damages, their voices were either HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59206814 ignored explicitly or turned away in favour of potential investment deals with rich countries and aligned institutions. Like many others, we kept our fingers crossed for any realistic progress on emission targets. But the summit only increased our fear that rich governments and corporations will continue to opt for fossil fuel extraction instead of preservation. Our home nation, Bangladesh, is one of those most vulnerable countries. Two-thirds of it is HYPERLINK https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2016/10/07/bangladesh-building-resilience-to-climate-change less than five metres above sea level . Rising seas will instantly displace between one and three million people while many millions more will be hit by stronger cyclones, HYPERLINK flooding , failing crops, desertification, droughts and dangerous heatwaves. And all this is despite the fact that, on a per capita basis, Bangladesh is one of the very lowest emitters of greenhouse gases outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. We spoke with some of Bangladesh's delegates at the COP26 summit. Based on these conversations and our own expertise, we reveal what matters most for super vulnerable countries like Bangladesh - and how these issues were sidetracked in the negotiation process. Bangladesh's position was that major greenhouse gas emitters, mostly developed nations, should commit to financial support for those countries which are at most risk yet will have a much smaller role in the reduction of CO? emissions globally. Much of this money will be required simply to adapt to climate changes that are already locked in. Bangladesh, for instance, needs to fortify its river banks against floods; it needs to conserve soil that is being washed away; it needs high-yield water sensitive crops, and it needs more HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200910-the-remarkable-floating-gardens-of-bangladesh floating gardens in flooded areas. These adaptations, and many more besides, will cost HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/10/climate-change-talks-bangladesh-donors billions of dollars Most vulnerable countries find it difficult to provide these things through internal self-finance. The UN does have an https://www.adaptation-fund.org adaptation fund which is reliant on voluntary contributions from developed countries and received HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/adaptation-fund-raises-record-us-356-million-in-new-pledges-at-cop26-for-its-concrete-actions-to US$356 million in pledges at HYPERLINK COP26 , an increase on the COP25 pledges of US$129 million. But this is still far from enough. Bangladeshi delegates we spoke with warned that the amount needed is growing far faster than the amount available. Indeed, one recent report said adaptation costs in developing countries are HYPERLINK https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/adaptation-gap-report-2021/ ten times greater than the money they currently receive. One problem is that climate finance is still mostly geared towards mitigation, funding things like solar farms or hydropower plants that might help countries like Bangladesh cut their own emissions. One of the delegates told us that Bangladesh wanted a 50:50 mix of support for adaptation and mitigation. Bangladesh, like other climate-vulnerable nations, also wanted more grants, rather than loans, which leave them indebted. Instead, with rich countries unwilling to offer the required support, funding was often offered through market-based instruments such as public-private partnerships (PPP). But this kind of private sector investment is constrained by HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20430795.2021.1917929 long term uncertainty or perceived high risks associated with climate change and natural hazards. As one civil society representative of Bangladesh at COP told us, private financing will mainly prioritise business interests and will hardly meet the dire adaptation needs of poor and marginalised people. Loss and damage According to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/mondays-ipcc-report-is-a-really-big-deal-for-climate-change-so-what-is-it-and-why-should-we-trust-it-165614 the IPCC , some impacts of climate change are unavoidable and so serious that things cannot be restored through adaptation. In the language of international climate policy, this is known as "loss and damage". A good example here is land lost due to salinity and sea level rise, which is already displacing thousands of people in Bangladesh.

What a nice symbolic bow BHP would tie if over the next ten days it could sign the sale contract for the last of its thermal coal mines, while world leaders take centre stage on climate in Glasgow. It would be a welcome announceable for Prime Minister Scott Morrison whose COP26 recital has highlighted the major role businesses, financiers and technologists, rather than the government, would play in reducing Australia's emissions. Even though insurers like IAG forensically assess the risks of \' natural perils' the company's net claim costs for the first four months have exceeded its previous assumptions by approximately $280 million. The revised expectation for financial year 2022 also includes around $510 million for perils for the remainder of the financial year. This climate cost will ultimately flow back to consumers in higher premiums and to shareholder returns. IAG's downgrade and BHP's impending asset sale both reinforce the Prime Minister's assertion that market forces will continue to do the heavy lifting on Australia's decarbonising push. But a lot of that is down to the policy vacuum created by the federal government No clearer example of the business-led climate charge is there than billionaire Andrew Forrest, the iron ore baron-turned climate evangelist, who will be fighting for his share of the microphone in Glasgow. But timing, as they say, is everything in business. BHP's thermal coal exit is a deal that has been pregnant for a while, with the market anticipating a near-term delivery. The company's chief executive Mike Henry declared the miner's position last year - that its suite of assets would move to a lower-carbon future footing with no space for thermal coal on the portfolio. The first leg of this coal divestment happened in June when BHP offloaded its stake in a Colombian project, Cerrej\'f3n, for $387 million. The second leg will be the soon-to-be transacted sale of Mt Arthur in NSW. Neither sale moves the dial on BHP's earnings but send a meaningful message The Mt Arthur asset was written down in BHP's books twice this year and thanks to the costs of rehabilitation, it is accounted for as a liability on the balance sheet. In recent months valuations have been complicated by a surge in the price of thermal coal which is used to generate electricity. This has been on the back of a post-COVID surge in the international economy and the resultant shortages of supply. The price spurt has given voice to views that Australia is moving too quickly on the transition to renewable energy. However, it's unlikely to deter BHP from getting a thermal coal deal across the line soon. The desire to reposition itself as a more climate-responsible corporate citizen and the understanding that longer term structural forces will reduce the value of coal will outweigh the coal's current moment of clover. As Henry told BHP investors last month the decision to exit thermal coal, "was simply a cold-eyed assessment of how those commodities fit with the BHP portfolio, how we saw long-term value in their ability to compete for capital within the BHP portfolio and, like many of the other decisions that we have taken, we decided that those assets were probably best owned by somebody else." There is a view that companies like BHP, with responsible targets on reducing emissions, should manage the closure of higher emitting assets rather than sell them. But this is not the route chosen by BHP - with Glencore picking up BHP's stake in Cerrej\'f3n and Peabody considered the most likely buyer of Mt Arthur. The real tectonic shift in BHP's fossil fuel portfolio was the recently announced sale of its oil and gas assets to Woodside Petroleum. While major resource companies, and certainly the iron ore producers, don't want to characterise their race for green as a competition, there is a distinct air of one-upmanship to the various measures and targets announced so far. Rio has committed to spend $10 billion on de-carbonising investments by the end of the decade and half its direct carbon footprint by 2030 - overtaking BHP's carbon reduction targets but remaining behind Fortescue's more aggressive targets. For all it will involve significant investment in technology - particularly in their quest to ultimately move towards clean energy sources for their customers' manufacture of steel. And all of it plays well for the Australian government, which can sit back and praise the power of market forces while taking a back seat on the push to lower emissions.

Much has been made of the HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/net-zero-by-2050-plan-uniquely-australian-morrison-20211026-p5937b.html Prime Minister's plan for 2050 And so many countries, businesses as well as the public are shifting their focus to the next 10 years of opportunity and action. Bringing a 2050 target to COP is like bringing a $10 bottle of wine to the third date. At her house. When she is cooking. On climate change and at Glasgow, the Prime Minister is missing something more than just an effective plan to address climate change. He is missing a compelling and emotional story about why action matters. That, as much as anything, is leaving him isolated in the rooms and halls of the COP26 conference. On the first full day of COP26 global leaders gave their set speeches on climate action. Boris Johnston, more comfortable being jovial and optimistic, was grave, even dramatic in his address. The world is at HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59114871 "one minute to midnight" The rhetoric of the leaders of countries feeling the full force of climate effects - including some of our closest neighbours in the Pacific - also gave speeches full of emotion and an appeal not just to the wellbeing of future generations but people living today. Their words carry a huge moral authority to match the moral responsibility of the nations who have caused most of the climate damage through their carbon pollution. In and around the COP26 leaders like President Biden speak of their personal disappointment that Russia and China haven't shown up with any substantive commitments to deal with climate change. The Pope tweeted that COP26 was our moment to "dream big" and "replan our future". And Prince Charles got in touch with his inner Churchill with a speech arguing we must put ourselves on a war-like footing to tackle climate because "the future of humanity and nature herself are at stake". From Scott Morrison at COP we got a HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-outlines-2-billion-funding-pledge-to-un-climate-summit-20211102-p59545.html speech about technology Good leaders understand that effective storytelling that is personal and emotional can be critical to winning people over, whether they be world leaders, the media or voters. Effective leadership is a lot about reading the moment and seizing it, knowing when to push or fall back. And how to weave a credible and genuine story around the decisions you are making. Almost all of our prime ministers, at their best, have done this. John Howard on gun control and Kevin Rudd on the apology to the Stolen Generation are good examples. Scott Morrison's problem is when the big events have happened to us during his term, ones that offered him a chance to step up, he failed to do so in a way that showed either emotional intelligence or an ability to read the mood of "the mob". In the Black Summer fires, our images of him are on holiday or in awkward exchanges with bushfire survivors. And despite a strong performance throughout 2020, in the second wave of lockdown our images of him in action are, well, missing in action. Scott Morrison undoubtedly has a policy problem and persona problem. Scott from Marketing can ill afford to graduate to Scott the Liar. He has the capacity to talk with feeling about the things that matter to him. He has spoken on more than one occasion about his wife and kids being the centre of his life. It's believable to me, as a mother who feels the same way about her children who are not much younger than his girls. And who knows what politicians give up when they step into office, all that precious, never-to-be-reclaimed time with loved ones. When it comes to climate change, he has an opportunity to talk with genuine feeling and facts about the threat it poses to the wellbeing of his children, their friends and their generation.

Australia will side with developing countries at the Glasgow climate summit, with Scott Morrison pushing world leaders to accept a process of "transition, not abolition" to net zero. The Prime Minister will declare "the Australian way" of reducing the cost of low emissions technology is the best option to limit global warming and not "entrench the disadvantage" of nations in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and South America. In his final message to the G20 in Rome on Sunday, ahead of the Glasgow summit starting on Monday night, Mr Morrison warned: "Too much of our global response to climate change has been seen through the prism of the developed world." The summit will be opened by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Prince Charles, Sir David Attenborough and UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, who warned there was a risk it "will not deliver". "Even if recent pledges were clear and credible - and there are major questions about some of them - we are still careening towards climate catastrophe," he said. But Glasgow's COP26 summit suffered a major blow on Sunday night when an ambitious communique drafted for G20 leaders was substantially watered down. A planned commitment to reach net zero by 2050 was adjusted to "by or around mid-century", suggesting China was unwilling to accelerate its decarbonisation, and the leaders failed to agree on an end-date for the domestic use of coal-fired power. Mr Morrison had pushed back against "mandates and bans" on coal and methane emissions. "The if, the why and even the when, of taking action on climate change, has been settled," he said. The Prime Minister, who will deliver Australia's national statement to COP26 in the early hours of Tuesday, said "taxes and heavy-handed regulation" were not the right solution. He offered to partner with countries prioritising technological advancements, having struck a deal with Korea on the sidelines of the G20. Another partnership with India is almost finalised. The Korea partnership, signed in Mr Morrison's meeting with President Moon Jae-in, will focus on hydrogen, green steel and iron ore, and carbon capture and storage. The Prime Minister said the deal would position both countries to "play a leadership role in the global response to climate change". "Together, we share the ambition of accelerating the development and commercialisation of low and zero emissions technologies, both existing and emerging, to achieve cost parity with high emitting technologies as soon as possible," he said. Appearing at the Rome summit, Prince Charles urged world leaders to put aside their differences on tackling climate change. He said COP26 was "the last-chance saloon" with the "future of humanity and nature herself at stake". "It is surely time to set aside our differences and grasp this unique opportunity to launch a substantial green recovery," Prince Charles said. On the eve of Glasgow, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed the past seven years ranked as the warmest seven-year period on record, with a La Ni\'f1a pattern this year not cooling temperatures enough to stop 2021 being one of the hottest. Sea levels rose 4.4mm per year between 2013 and 2021, compared to 2.1mm per year between 1993 and 2002, as heating accelerated the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas said extreme weather events were the "new norm", pointing to temperatures of 54.4C in California, rain instead of snow falling for the first time at the Greenland ice sheet peak, and severe flooding in China and Europe. He said COP26 Mr Guterres declared: "We must act now - with ambition and solidarity - to safeguard our future and save humanity." COP26 president Alok Sharma said the changing climate was "sounding an alarm to the world". "We know that this COP, COP26 , is our last best hope to keep 1.5C in reach," he said. "And I know that we have an unprecedented negotiations agenda ahead of us. But I believe this international system can deliver. It must deliver."

"The window is still open, scientifically, to act," according to Professor Johan Rockstr&#xF6;m, architect of the nine planetary boundaries - environmental thresholds for humanity recently popularised by the Netflix documentary, Breaking Boundaries. During the Zero-Hour Sessions, an event convened by Lombard Odier during the COP26 climate summit, Rockstr&#xF6;m stressed that our planet - "a complex, adaptive, self-regulating biophysical system" - has tipping points which, if triggered, cause "self-enforced drift in the wrong direction". While the stability of our planet, and the economic activity it supports, depends on humanity keeping within these science-based thresholds and avoiding the "no-go zones" beyond them, we have already broken through four limits: toxic waste, air pollution, freshwater overuse and agrochemical pollution - and are on course for transgressing a critical fifth boundary: keeping global warming within 1.5 &#xB0;C above pre-industrial levels. According to the IEA, COP26 commitments reduced the forecast global temperature rise from 2.7 &#xB0;C to 1.8 &#xB0;C. While further policy impetus is essential in directing real decarbonisation throughout the economy, private sector resources must be marshalled to realise the required emissions reductions. The financing gap to put the world on a path to net zero is estimated to be $US32 trillion ($44 trillion) in the next decade. As illustrated below, economy-wide decarbonisation presents new variables to consider in evaluating risk-adjusted returns as transitional, physical and liability risks increasingly factor into corporate profitability and valuations: - Transitional risk includes shifts in demand among climate-aware consumers, companies' ability to reduce emissions and the impact of higher carbon costs and regulation. - Physical risk includes the damage caused by more frequent extreme weather events and the associated degradation of agricultural yields and less-productive labour forces. - Liability risk includes historical responsibility for climate change among companies and sovereigns, as well as mitigation and adaptation costs. Forward-looking investors may identify public and private businesses that are mitigating climate risk and acting on the opportunities generated by the transition. Lombard Odier believes there are significant opportunities available to advance the transition to net zero ("NZ") through not just traditional public equity and debt markets, but also through private markets. While private equity capital has been well-deployed towards sustainable finance, we believe the broad versatility of solutions-oriented private credit is positioned to play an important role in accelerating the transition into a low-carbon carbon-resilient economy. The broader consensus move to NZ creates investment opportunities in select sectors targeted as priorities by large asset owners and corporations. While many large companies are creating meaningful in-house contributions to the climate transition, some of the most impactful solutions are coming from entrepreneurs within fragmented, under-financed markets working directly with corporate partners. Such corporate consumers of sustainable goods and services often find it more accretive to purchase and scale an externally sourced product or service than to allocate such development to balance sheet. While equity is a necessary component of business development, particularly in funding earlier stage technological and business development activities, properly structured private credit capital can help catalyse growth. Drawing on structured, specialty and infrastructure finance methodologies, private lenders can provide well-covenanted tailored liquidity to borrowers not typically available in public markets. As enterprises seek to scale disruptive climate solutions, access to low-cost capital will remain a key driver of a virtuous cycle of asset creation. Sustainable private asset managers have an obligation to be more than simply capital providers to their partners; they can help create mutual value through influencing corporate behaviours and actions. Managers can provide guidance and technical support to growing enterprises seeking to overcome various challenges, including United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG) alignment; regulatory frameworks compliance; key performance indicator (KPI) transparency and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk management. Lombard Odier today sees increasingly active conversations around the issues of stewardship and engagement among its investee and investor partners, and we expect that collaboration to grow in 2022 and beyond. COP26 provided further evidence of policy and social tipping points for recommitting to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 &#xB0;C threshold. The private sector is delivering novel solutions today to profitably adapt and reduce carbon emissions, while improving resilience. Frameworks such as Rockstr&#xF6;m's planetary boundaries provide a guide for investors who seek businesses that are adapting their business models to be profitable in a sustainable future. "There is no question about the direction of travel anymore," Rockstr&#xF6;m said. "The question is: can we act fast enough in order to land in a safe operating space for humanity? " Much of the answer lies in action within the real economy, where private credit is essential to catalysing and scaling additional impact.

Brandis crash driver reassigned AUSTRALIA'S High Commissioner to London George Brandis is set to be quizzed by investigators over his role in a crash involving Prime Minister Scott Morrison's official motorcade. Legal firm Ashurst has been hired to investigate the incident during the COP26 summit in Glasgow that resulted in a collision involving two Metropolitan Police cars. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) secretary Kathryn Campbell yesterday told a Senate Estimates hearing an initial report into the incident was "quite narrow" in scope and focused "about the drivers and the actual incident". She said Ashurst had been hired because the original report "didn't talk to a number of other parties who were involved in the incident". It is understood one of those parties is Mr Brandis. The Daily Telegraph last month -exclusively revealed a late-running Mr Brandis had refused to go on the staff bus and insisted on his driver catching up with the official motorcade that is off limits to all but the Prime Minister. Metropolitan Police drivers took evasive action to head of the perceived threat until they recognised the diplomatic plates and braked, resulting in two police cars colliding. Mr Brandis and his driver were stopped at the scene and were late to -attend an official stakeholder breakfast where Mr Brandis was supposed to have introduced Mr Morrison. "George was late and was telling his driver to hurry up and catch up with the motorcade," a diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph at the time. "One of the police cars then braked causing the other to crash into it." Ms Campbell confirmed Australia had offered to pay for the damage to the cars but the offer was declined by the Metropolitan Police. But she repeatedly refused to answer questions about exactly what happened and what driving duties the driver had been on the night before the incident. Labor Senator Tim Ayres said: "It's pretty extraordinary that we're not in a position to understand some of the basic details." A spokesman for DFAT confirmed the driver had since been moved to other duties pending an investigation. \</doc>

Australian companies should find it easier to measure and report their efforts to achieve better environmental, social and governance outcomes, with the convergence of key standards announced late on Thursday. One of the most widely used standards that help to guide investor capital towards companies that are meant to be helping the world, the Global Reporting Initiative, agreed to integrate with the International Sustainability Standards Board in a move that should make the world of ESG ratings much less chaotic. The ISSB and GRI said they would "seek to co-ordinate their work programs and standard-setting activities" just days after the US regulator proposed mandatory climate disclosures. "The agreement reflects the importance of ensuring compatibility and interconnectedness of investor-focused baseline sustainability information that meets the needs of the capital markets, with information intended to serve the needs of a broader range of stakeholders," the ISSB and GRI said. Although many companies in the Asia-Pacific already report according to the GRI standards, ASIC and the Council for Financial Regulators had been looking to the ISSB as the basis for Australian standards. The ISSB was formed at COP26 in Glasgow last year. GRI chief executive Eelco van der Enden said aligning GRI's widely adopted standards for sustainability with the investor-focused standards being developed by the ISSB would benefit companies and investors globally. The ISSB said it would publish the Climate and General Sustainability-related Disclosure requirements that, once finalised, "will form the global baseline for climate-related disclosures". Given the significance of how this will guide global capital allocation, Australia has been pressing for European leaders to recognise the country's energy mix and higher emissions' intensity in its electricity generation as part of its consideration of what constitutes "green". Ahead of ISSB's publication of its proposed climate disclosure requirements next week, ratings agencies say the move to strengthen reporting for companies is positive for investors. "Having additional disclosure requirements is always better because it gives us more data to work with," said ISS-ESG analyst Joseph Arns. He said the standardisation should lead to a more even playing field, given gaps in reporting from smaller companies skews higher ratings towards bigger companies. "One aspect is that larger companies tend to be able to report better information because they have larger staffs and ability to report. These requirements could level the playing field for smaller companies," Mr Arns said. "In the near term as a rating provider it gives us more information to work with and reduces the bias toward larger cap companies. Within the rating we do make an effort to mitigate this impact by not requiring as much from small companies, but still, it's an advantage larger companies have." Mr Arns said the mere fact that companies report and disclose their efforts to solve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals helps them to rate more highly. "If you're a pure play with a product offering that ties to an SDG objective, it tends to boost the overall rating," he said. "It's easier with companies that are effectively pure plays, or they disclose data that are relevant." The SEC is following the lead of Hong Kong and Singapore regulators, as well as New Zealand, in demanding companies measure their scope 3 emissions, largely the emissions created by the products they sell. Asked what this might mean for companies like Sims, which is Australia's second-highest rated stock in the ISS ranking, Mr Arns said this was unlikely to drastically alter ISS-ESG's ratings given they are already forward-looking. \</doc>

\~ Australians might one day be unable to play sports outside if temperatures continue to rise, experts have warned. It's one of several serious scenarios coming out of the latest report from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report, released as major flooding affects Queensland and NSW, said while actions to reduce climate risks had increased worldwide, much more was required. "Successful adaptation requires urgent, more ambitious and accelerated action and, at the same time, rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions," the report said. But many species - including human beings - risk eventually reaching the limit of their ability to adapt to climate change. Report co-author and IPCC vice chair Professor Mark Howden said coral reefs were just one well-documented example. However, he warned Australians could also be nearing their own physiological limits. "Our bodies can cope with hot, hot temperatures outside up to a point," Professor Howden said. "But then we can't do that without some sort of active cooling. If you get very high temperatures and humidity, you either have to pull back on your exercise or you overheat. "If you're still wanting to be active, you actually have to find some way of having active cooling in that environment. "So we reach a limit to where our adaptive capacity can go." He added Australian workdays might also need a rethink - with options including a nap during the day to avoid the hottest temperatures. The IPCC reports, which are published roughly every six to seven years, are considered an authoritative study of climate science, guided and agreed to by scientists and governments across the globe. The report also warned that changes in temperature, rainfall and extreme weather were having a major impact on the spread of disease in wildlife, agriculture and people. Its release comes just months after world leaders were unable to reach agreement on strengthening their climate commitments at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. At the summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries to keep the goal of global warming increases to just 1.5C, speed up the decarbonisation of the global economy and phase out coal. But asked if commitments made at the summit would slow climate change, lead author Dr Johanna Nalau's response was sobering. "A lot of talk, a lot of commitments, but I think the overall sense is that we are just not on track," she said. Professor Howden said a major concern was how emissions would track as the world bounced back from Covid. But he said that while the government knew what it needed to do, it was a matter of political will. "Climate change is here. In Australia it's mostly negative, and it really matters to pretty much everything we value here in Australia," Professor Howden said. "Listen to the people ... 90 per cent of Australians want more action on climate change. "If there was any other issue that had 90 per cent of people wanting more action on it, you'd have the politicians running for the policy development process immediately. "Yet we don't see that ... climate change should not be a political issue." Among the report's key messages was the intertwined fates of human and natural systems. It stressed that climate change cannot be tamed unless degraded forests and oceans that stock carbon are restored and protected, because they are the ecosystems on which human beings and other life forms depend for clean water, air and soil.

It's a common scene across many African countries' rural areas: cows grazing peacefully. But, by 2050, heat stress induced by climate change may drastically alter this familiar picture. New HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15825 findings from the International Livestock Research Institute show that, unless massive adaptation measures are put in place, the number of extreme heat events driven by climate change - especially in the continent's tropics - will increase. Poultry and pigs HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15825 already face major heat stress challenges in many regions of the tropics where they are currently raised. The same is true for all five major domesticated species in large swathes of West Africa, where heat stress is likely to make it nearly impossible for livestock to be kept outdoors. Heat stress is likely to be only the beginning of the problems. Not enough is known about likely future impacts of increased climate variability on feed and forages, grazing area and water, or about shifts in climate-sensitive diseases and disease vectors and their impacts on livestock. Even HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15825 under relatively mild but realistic climate scenarios, it will be necessary to reconfigure and relocate agricultural systems. This will have profound consequences for people's nutrition and well-being. Livelihoods will be threatened. The livestock sector HYPERLINK https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/Future%20scenarios%20for%20livestock%20systems%20in%20Africa_CCAFS_2020.pdf contributes about 30-50% of agricultural GDP and supports the food security and livelihoods of about one-third of Africa's population, or about 350 million people. Livestock tends to be viewed merely as part of the climate change problem. Research focuses on mitigating the harms livestock causes. Some of these harms are very real: livestock emissions, particularly from cattle, HYPERLINK https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/ are responsible for HYPERLINK https://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/ accounts for only a small part of those emissions. In the developing world, these harms are more than balanced by the good they do. Livestock provides livelihoods, nutrition and cultural capital. How, then, do we adapt to the challenges the sector faces and capitalise on the opportunities it presents? The UN climate change conference, or COP26 , in Glasgow offers an opportunity to highlight these problems - and to put forward solutions. Threats to livestock HYPERLINK https://hdl.handle.net/10568/111738 show that, in the coming years, heat stress in animals will occur more frequently and for longer periods. This will affect milk and meat productivity for cattle, small ruminants (like goats and sheep), pigs and poultry across East Africa. This will make much of the region unsuitable for exotic pig, poultry and cattle production - animals whose productivity is easily compromised by heat stress. Rising heat and humidity are already HYPERLINK https://hdl.handle.net/10568/106482 causing a drop in Tanzanian dairy cattle's milk yields, hitting the income of smallholder dairy farmers. In Uganda, HYPERLINK https://hdl.handle.net/10568/110342 heat stress levels are high and increasing. By the end of the century over 90% of Ugandan districts will experience severe heat stress, putting the livelihoods of pig producers and sustainability of the pig sector as a whole at risk. The pig sector HYPERLINK https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/115255 provides a source of income to more than 2 million households in Uganda, and the country has the highest per capita consumption of pork in east Africa. Addressing the risks The Index Based Livestock Insurance programme protects livestock keepers in drought-prone arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya and Ethiopia from climate-related losses. Unlike traditional insurance programmes, which pay out on the loss of the animal, it is tied to climatic conditions - such as the amount of rainfall and distribution of pasture availability - over a season. By tying the payouts to objective criteria, the programme avoids the moral hazards of traditional insurance programmes while giving herders the resources to help their animals survive periods of sustained crisis. Rangeland ecology in East and West Africa rationalises land use and protect livelihoods. Community land management programmes help resolve conflicts between land users. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Recent modelling of heat stress impacts is one of our efforts to understand the impacts of climate change. Farmers we're working with are also making the necessary local adaptations. In Ethiopia's arid pastoral Afar region, pastoralists are experiencing increased flooding and drought and an overall shift in seasonal weather patterns. In response, they are shifting from large to small ruminants, and changing their grazing and feed management systems. In Kenya's central rift valley, farmers who practise mixed crop and dairy farming have begun to experiment with different feed production and preservation strategies to overcome feed shortages in the prolonged dry seasons. But this is a fraction of what is needed. More must be done to work with governments and help livestock keepers across the continent meet the challenge of adaptation. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Moving forward Building climate-resilient livestock systems to cope with these challenges requires concerted, coordinated action from investors and policymakers at the national and global levels. This will need to be informed by a solid research base that scientists have only started to assemble with the minimal funds allocated so far. Unfortunately, because of donor priorities, most research attention to date has focused on mitigating the contributions of livestock production to climate change rather than HYPERLINK adapting to its consequences https://hdl.handle.net/10568/101605 primarily on climate-induced impacts on cropping systems rather than on livestock. Researchers need to develop a toolbox of effective adaptation practices, technologies and policies that are robust across different scales, priorities and climate futures. They must also work with funders and governments to prioritise investments in the livestock sector. It's not just technical inputs that are needed, but institutional change in the way that livestock are viewed by funders and governments. This will require a considerable evidence base. Unfortunately, we are very far from these goals and not nearly enough resources are being devoted to achieving them. Consider that between 2012 and 2017, US$185.8 billion was dedicated to climate-related development projects worldwide, HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35495 with only 0.57% (about US$1 billion) devoted to the livestock sector. The cost of livestock mitigation and adaptation actions for the next five years is estimated in the billions of dollars, much of that to be supported by partners in the form of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building. COP26 provides a rare opportunity to address some of those funding gaps. To protect Africa's livestock and the millions who rely on it, the time for action is now.

\~\~ -- Adaptation investments urgently needed for agriculture-dependent regions like Africa that have done the least to cause the climate crisis but suffer the most \~\~\~\~Facing mounting evidence ( HYPERLINK https://reliefweb.int/report/world/what-can-smallholder-farmers-grow-warmer-world-climate-change-and-future-crop https://reliefweb.int/report/world/what-can-smallholder-farmers-grow-warmer-world-climate-change-and-future-crop ) that climate change will fall hardest on agriculture-dependent regions like sub-Saharan Africa, a coalition of funders at the United Nations climate summit pledged $575 million today to deliver climate-smart solutions to farmers in low-income countries via the CGIAR global network of agricultural research partnerships. Combined with the $256 million recently pledged at the Global Citizen Live event, and other commitments from Sweden and Belgium, CGIAR now has secured $863 million this year to confront a host of rapidly intensifying climate challenges that could upend the global fight against hunger and poverty. \~\~ Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1677024/COP26.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1677024/ HYPERLINK COP26 .jpg \~\~ There is also the potential for significant additional investments in CGIAR to emerge later this week at COP26 . \~\~ CGIAR is the world's largest public sector research partnership serving the needs of more than 500 million smallholder farmers who are responsible for feeding billions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The effect of climate change on crops, fish and livestock is a key factor behind a steady rise in hunger that is eroding years of progress. \~\~ The trajectory of the climate threat is particularly daunting in sub-Saharan Africa, where most people work in agriculture and impacts on food production are a key reason climate change could cost African countries up to 15 percent of their GDP ( HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X1930347X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X1930347X ) by 2030. There are also fears that absent aggressive efforts to help farmers adapt, climate impacts on agriculture in regions already suffering high rates of poverty and malnutrition will make it impossible to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pledging zero hunger and an end to extreme poverty ( HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/34555/Revised-Estimates-of-the-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Extreme-Poverty-by-2030.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/34555/Revised-Estimates-of-the-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Extreme-Poverty-by-2030.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y ) by 2030. \~\~ In today's funding announcement, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $315 million over the next three years to support CGIAR's climate-related work. Half of the US $315 million investment from the Gates Foundation will support climate adaptation initiatives undertaken through the new CGIAR portfolio, which is streamlining CGIAR partnerships, knowledge and assets to accelerate the pace of innovation flowing to smallholder farmers. \~\~ In addition, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) pledged $215 million over the next five years and Canada $45 million. \~\~ They were joined by other funders who also have committed to support CGIAR's Research and Innovation strategy for 2022 onwards. Sweden has pledged $18 million and Belgium, noting that it wants to continue its strong partnership with CGIAR, put forth plans to release an additional $14 million pending approval of the 2022 budget by its federal parliament. \~\~ The investments announced today are on top of $256 million pledged to CGIAR by the European Commission, the Netherlands and Belgium at the September Global Citizen Live event. That pledge included $162.4 million from European Commission; $87 million from the Netherlands; and $7 million from Belgium. \~\~ "Climate impacts on food production are an existential threat for several hundred million people who depend on agriculture to support their families," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "CGIAR has been delivering high-impact solutions to smallholder farmers for half a century ( HYPERLINK https://www.cgiar.org/cgiar-at-50 https://www.cgiar.org/cgiar-at-50 \~\~ "As one of CGIAR's founding donors, USAID is proud to continue our longstanding partnership by committing at least $215 million over five years to CGIAR's critical agriculture research and innovation," said Dr. Jim Barnhart, Assistant to the Administrator at USAID's Bureau for Resilience and Food Security. "Climate change is threatening the lives and livelihoods of families and communities, particularly in the least developed countries. This funding will contribute to raising agricultural productivity for 200 million people in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa by 25 percent by 2030. CGIAR is an important partner in our work to build a food secure, climate-resilient future." \~\~ "For 50 years, CGIAR has delivered critical research and innovation to address hunger," said Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, Minister of International Development and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada. "Canada has been a partner since the very beginning because we believe scientific research and innovation is necessary in making food, land and water systems more sustainable, equitable and efficient. Today, we are pleased to further support the work of CGIAR by contributing CAD $55 million over three years to help end hunger and build climate smart and sustainable food systems, and put gender equality at the forefront of global agricultural research for development." \~\~ The new investments are building on an already strong foundation of CGIAR-supported climate work. For example, in recent years, CGIAR partnerships have provided about eight million farming households with 200 varieties of climate-smart maize ( HYPERLINK https://www.cgiar.org/innovations/climate-smart-maize/ https://www.cgiar.org/innovations/climate-smart-maize/ ) and some 18 million farmers with new varieties of flood and salt-tolerant rice ( HYPERLINK https://www.cgiar.org/innovations/climate-smart-rice/ https://www.cgiar.org/innovations/climate-smart-rice/ ). CGIAR is also leading efforts to integrate a host of climate-smart food production practices across a network of climate-smart villages and valleys ( HYPERLINK https://www.cgiar.org/innovations/climate-smart-villages-and-valleys/ ) in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are home to millions of farming families. In addition, CGIAR's pioneering work on low-emission, high-nutrition ( HYPERLINK https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/diversifying-aquaculture-systems-to-nour ish-nations/ ) food production like aquaculture is opening up new sustainable pathways for improving diets and incomes in rural communities. \~\~ The quest at COP26 to secure more support for smallholder farmers is getting a significant lift from the launch of the new Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate or AIM4C ( HYPERLINK https://aimforclimate.org https://aimforclimate.org \~\~ A $40 million innovation sprint led by CGIAR, in partnership with the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR) and the Gates Foundation, will unlock key climate-resilient traits from CGIAR's vast global collections of crop diversity. This sprint will supply crop breeders with the raw materials they need to provide farmers with a wide array of climate-smart crop varieties. \~\~ "The urgency is clear: if the global community is truly committed to ending hunger and poverty, then it must act now to support smallholder farming communities that are already being hit hard by climate change," said Claudia Sadoff, Executive Management Team Convener, and Managing Director, Research Delivery and Impact at CGIAR. "There are many exciting innovations available. But even with today's announcements there is still a large gap between the magnitude of the climate threat to smallholder farmers and investments required to help them adapt." \~\~ Sadoff noted that investing in adaptation is also a "historic opportunity to implement nature-positive approaches to food production across some of the world's most valuable and vulnerable ecosystems." \~\~ "Adaptation in agriculture is about pursuing a greener pathway," she said. "That includes providing technologies that help farmers grow more food with less water and revitalizing degraded landscapes through holistic strategies that support both food production and ecosystem services." \~\~ Notes to editor: \~\~ About CGIAR \~\~ CGIAR is a global research partnership for a food-secure future.

On colour-coded temperature charts, the Indian subcontinent is currently a sickly mauve. With summer still months away, an unusually intense heatwave is threatening millions of people there. Temperatures are expected to exceed 48\'b0C on the border between Pakistan and India this week. A month ago, the heat broke a 122-year-old record. What can people do to weather the worst and prepare for a future of extreme heat? Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like? Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead. Every Wednesday, The Conversation's environment editor writes Imagine, a short email that goes a little deeper into just one climate issue. Join the 10,000+ readers who've subscribed so far. For many Indians and Pakistanis, particularly in rural areas, the intolerable heat will slash the valuable hours available to work outdoors. According to research published by the Lancet, more than 150 billion work hours were lost in 2018 due to extreme temperature and humidity. This trend will have global consequences. "Half of the world's food is produced by smallholder farms with most of the energy input from physical labour carried out by the farmers," says Mark Maslin, professor of Earth system science at UCL. "As the world warms, there will be more and more days when it will be HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/will-three-billion-people-really-live-in-temperatures-as-hot-as-the-sahara-by-2070-137776 physically impossible to work outside , reducing productivity and food security." In cities, where an increasing share of the global population lives, there are opportunities to make streets more comfortable during bouts of extreme heat. One of the most popular, with wider potential benefits for wildlife seeking habitat, is urban greening - or making more space for trees and other vegetation amid the concrete sprawl. But a study led by Cardiff University's Mark O. Cuthbert, published in February, found that carpeting roofs and walls with greenery and weaving green corridors between expanded parkland can either HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/why-urban-greening-isnt-a-panacea-for-extreme-weather-under-climate-change-176556 subdue floods or mitigate heat According to Cuthbert and his co-authors, Denis O'Carroll of UNSW Sydney in Australia and Gabriel C Rau of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, the reason cities tend to overheat in hot weather and flood during heavy rainfall is the same. The abundance of concrete and steel absorb and retain heat, while those same sealed surfaces "can't act like a sponge to soak up and store rain, unlike the soil they've replaced". The researchers argue that greener cities in areas of high rainfall - such as around the northern Europe and around the equator - are likely to offset stronger heatwaves because plants release water vapour during photosynthesis, which has a cooling effect. The research team expects the benefits of urban greening to be less pronounced in drier areas where there's plenty of energy from sunshine, but rainfall is more limited, like cities in India and Pakistan. But expanding green spaces in these places is still worthwhile, as this is where there is the greatest potential for water retention by soils, which can help to prevent floods. A report published during COP26 , the most recent UN climate change summit in November 2021, suggested that Africa is HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/extreme-heat-hurts-human-health-its-effects-must-be-mitigated-urgently-171327 heating faster than other regions Mohiddin says the continent needs immediate financial and technological assistance to adapt to the warming environment, as well as research funding to assess who and where is most vulnerable. In these regions and others, designs and building techniques sourced from traditional architecture can offer some of the cheapest and most sustainable forms of relief. Amin Al-Habaibeh, a professor of intelligent engineering systems at Nottingham Trent University, studies the ways builders have HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/could-traditional-architecture-offer-relief-from-soaring-temperatures-in-the-gulf-49760 helped keep people cool for centuries in the Persian Gulf (another hotspot for intensifying heatwaves). Here, homes built with limestone and other natural materials absorb moisture when it's humid and release it through evaporation on hot and sunny days. This provides a slight cooling effect, Al-Habaibeh says. The sandy texture and colour of the buildings also reflects a lot of solar radiation. Narrow roads and alleys maximise shadows, while glass is scarce and windows small to maintain air flow but keep out the Sun's heat. Internal courtyards funnel hot air upwards at midday (when the sun is at its peak) and replace it with cooler air from the surroundings rooms, he says. While ingenuity and solidarity can help communities adapt to increasingly brutal heatwaves, there is a limit, say Tom Matthews and Colin Raymond, climate scientists at King's College London and California Institute of Technology, respectively. "The range of weather humans can encounter on Earth - the 'climate envelope' - is shifting as the planet warms," they warn. " HYPERLINK Conditions entirely new to civilisation could emerge in the coming decades." That means heat extremes that exceed what humans can survive. A 2021 study reported that HYPERLINK one in three deaths caused by extreme heat since 1991 can be linked to climate change. If you find yourself in a heat wave, Chloe Brimicombe, a PhD candidate studying climate change and its consequences for human health at the University of Reading, has some advice for staying safe: "Keep cool. If indoors, trying bathing your feet in cold water or have a shower ... Close the curtains and open windows on the side not facing the sun," she says. Other measures that keep air flowing throughout the building include opening doors and turning on fans. Brimicombe stresses that it's very important to stay hydrated, as you lose a lot of water through sweat during heatwaves. "Drink more often than you usually would, even when you don't feel thirsty," she says. And don't forget to check on people who may need extra help. "Look out for over 65s, pregnant women, children under five and those with medical conditions. These groups are all more vulnerable to heat. You should also avoid being in direct sunlight between 12pm and 3pm when the Sun is at its strongest." \</doc>

There are many good reasons why the major parties would rather not talk about climate, writes Nick O'Malley. The disconnect is jarring when you look closely. After years of drought, fire and flood - and in the wake of a series of United Nations reports spelling out in terrible detail the catastrophic costs of inaction - Australia's major political parties are running cold on climate action. On Wednesday, in the first leaders' debate of this election campaign, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese did not mention climate change once. The issue was raised only in oblique terms after an audience member asked about electric cars. Both parties have embraced emissions reductions targets out of step with Paris targets, although Labor's remains more ambitious. It is not that Australians don't want more ambitious action on the climate crisis. Polls have shown for years that the overwhelming majority of Australians want action and are willing to pay for it. In its most recent poll on the issue, the Lowy Institute found that 61 per cent of Australians agreed with the statement: "Global warming is a serious and pressing problem" and the government should begin to take steps now, "even if this involves significant costs". This compared with 10 per cent who agreed that: "Until we are sure that global warming is really a problem, we should not take any steps that would have economic costs." And in choosing not to act, Australian political leaders are ignoring the increasingly strident pleas of the nation's neighbours and allies. Dr Ian Fry, an Australia climate specialist and diplomat who was recently appointed to be the UN's first Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, says Australia's influence in the Pacific has been diluted because of its reluctance to embrace climate action. During last year's world climate talks in Glasgow, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama told The Age that he had again asked Morrison for more action. "It is no secret that we expect more from Australia on climate," Bainimarama said. "We've informed them before and we will continue to inform them. "Opening coal plants shuts the door on the future of low-lying Pacific nations; whether you burn it yourself or you export it to others, coal has no place in this century." Environment Minister Sussan Ley approved three coal mines in the lead-up to the talks. In a public forum last month, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took the unusual step of calling out Australia specifically. "A growing number of G20 developed economies have announced meaningful emissions reductions by 2030 - with a handful of holdouts, such as Australia," he said. Nor are the main parties restrained by the business sector. The Business Council of Australia, which once opposed ambitious action, is now calling for more of it. Boardrooms across the country want more action, Anna Skarbek told The Age last year. Skarbek is the former investment banker who is now executive director of the non-profit climate change advisory ClimateWorks Australia. Banks, insurance companies and investment houses are abandoning the same fossil energy companies that Australia's two main parties champion. Australian business leaders such as Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes are pumping billions of dollars into renewable projects, not (only) because of concern about the climate, but because they see money to be made in new industries that are already exploding around the world. So, why the Australian silence? Climate change has long been a political graveyard for Australian politics. The nation was made rich by its abundant resources, particularly coal and gas. As a result, powerful incumbent industries, backed by media allies, have used their political might to turn public opinion against leaders who dared heed the warnings of scientists too closely. And while public sentiment has today shifted, it has not yet shifted in the right places, one long-time Labor strategist said this week. In other words, the main parties want to take key coal seats in places such as the Hunter Valley and around Gladstone without losing others in places like Sydney and Melbourne. Which means both parties are happy not to discuss climate policies that some voters will believe go too far, and others not far enough. At the heart of any climate policy is an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of holding global warming to beneath 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. According to the UN's chief climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this means the world needs to cut emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. But the IPCC pathway allows for developing nations to emit greenhouse gasses for longer than advanced economies to allow for the fact that they have lower historical and per capita emissions. As a result, some experts say that Australia's reduction targets must be higher than the global average. The Climate Targets Panel, a group of independent experts working with the University of Melbourne's Climate and Energy College, last year found that for Australia to do its share in holding global warming to 2 degrees, it must reduce emissions by 50 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2045. To remain on track for 1.5 degrees, the targets would be 74 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2035. But targets, however ambitious they might be, are meaningless without a plan to reach them. Any plan to achieve such a sweeping change in Australia involves a few common steps. First, the coal-fired energy system must be rapidly replaced with a mix of new renewable-energy generation backed by new transition lines and energy storage. The states are already making headway on this, but experts say the process should be driven by the federal government. "I can't believe I am saying this in 2022," says Associate Professor Christian Downie, a governance expert at the Australian National University. "But the first thing we need is a national climate policy to reduce pollution across all sectors of the economy. If we have leadership at the federal level rather than individual states doing their own thing, we will do this faster and more effectively." As the energy system is decarbonised, an effective federal climate policy would then speed up the process of electrifying industry and households. But there are other elements that climate policies should include, no matter which side of politics introduces them, Downie says. "Legislative targets would be much stronger," he says. "They would show a strong commitment both from the government and the parliament. Of course, that requires negotiating through both houses of parliament, which can create its own complications, but that's something that the next government should be aiming to do." And he says "serious" climate policy would be consistent across government. This would mean ending fossil fuel subsidies. "You can't continue to support gas-fired recoveries at the same time as we're claiming to be taking action on climate change. The two propositions are just inconsistent." Finally, a government determined to move fast on climate would introduce an independent body to set Australian targets and ensure that the government is working towards meeting them. "The benefit of having an independent agency is that it's insulated from the kind of political volatility we've seen characterise climate policy," Downie says. "A good way to think about it is like an independent central bank. If the government set interest rates, they'd be moved around to suit election cycles, but we have a central bank, which is largely independent from the political process and can set interest rates based on fundamentals." Such a body, similar to the Climate Commission created by Julia Gillard in 2011 and scrapped by Tony Abbott two years later, would ensure that the government was acting in concert on climate, with environmental, energy, agriculture and industry policy all set to support emission reduction efforts. The Coalition's climate policy was largely finalised last year as Morrison prepared to attend the COP26 with Nationals, Morrison confirmed that the government would set net zero by 2050 as a firm target rather than a "preferred target". Despite intense international pressure it did not increase its 2030 reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent. The policy relies on effort to reduce emissions using "technology not taxes". Rather than mandating the use of cleaner technologies or setting targets, it seeks to make their use more commercially viable. According to its climate change policy paper, The Plan to Deliver Net Zero: The Australian Way, 20 per cent of reductions required to reach the 2050 goal have already been achieved since 2005 and 40 per cent would come from its plan to invest in new clean technologies. Another 15 per cent would come from international technology trends, and, it believes, 15 per cent more would be delivered by technologies not yet invented. Labor has promised a 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, or 2 per cent less than it took to the last election. Its Rewiring the Nation package would back state government efforts to support green energy with $20 billion to modernise and improve the grid to use more renewables, in line with a blueprint already drafted by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Labor says the plan would decrease prices and increase the amount of renewables flowing through the grid used by the east coast states and South Australia to 82 per cent. Its plan includes funding the creation of "community batteries" for groups of homes to share and the introduction of incentives for EVs. Controversially in climate circles, it supports an ongoing role for coal exports. "Coal will be a part of Australia's energy and export mix for years to come," Labor's resources spokeswoman, Madeleine King, told The Age this week. "If new projects stack up environmentally and commercially then they will of course go ahead. And if they stack up, we welcome the jobs." The Greens policy has by far the most ambitious emissions reduction target: 75 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2035. It includes measures to support households and small businesses get off gas through grants of up to $25,000 and loans of up to $100,000. It would offer grants for households to buy batteries and work with states and territories to ban gas in new housing developments. The so-called Teal independents, who could share a crossbench with the Greens, do not have a common climate policy, but their various proposals are largely more ambitious than Labor's and not quite as ambitious as the Greens'. Richie Merzian, who heads the energy and climate program at progressive think tank the Australia Institute, says of the three plans, only the Greens' emissions reduction target is in line with what climate science demands. "It's based on Australia's historical responsibilities and current capacity to do so much more," Merzian says. "This level of ambition would align with the upper guardrail of the Paris agreement to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees." He says Labor's short-term emissions reduction target of minus 43 per cent announced in December 2021 would put Australia alongside the updated targets of similar economies the US and Canada. Collectively, they would see global warming to exceed 2 degrees. Merzian criticises the Coalition's short-term target of 26 to 28 per cent, set in 2015, as outdated, saying if the rest of the world followed suit we would be on track for 3 to 4 degrees of global warming. In an annual assessment of climate action published by leading US university MIT last month, Australia's ranking slipped from 35th to 52nd, to sit neatly behind Saudi Arabia, whose oil minister Abdulaziz bin Salman vowed last year to drill "every last molecule" of hydrocarbon from the ground. Christiana Figueres, one of the world's leading climate diplomats and a former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told The Age yesterday that so far Australia's climate plans were among the least ambitious on earth. "While the rest of the world stood up at COP26 , Australia stood back," she said. "As a result, Australia has increasingly been pushed to the margins of the international community and seen as a blocker, a country willing to expand polluting industries at the expense of the planet. "Government administrations have repeatedly stalled on climate action, while the Australian people overwhelmingly support environmental responsibility." \</doc>

Both parties have embraced emissions reductions targets out of step with Paris targets, although Labor's remains more ambitious. It is not that Australians don't want more ambitious action on the climate crisis. Polls have shown for years that the overwhelming majority of Australians want action and are willing to pay for it. In its most recent poll on the issue, the Lowy Institute found that 61 per cent of Australians agreed with the statement: "global warming is a serious and pressing problem" and the government should begin to take steps now, "even if this involves significant costs". This compared with 10 per cent who agreed that: "Until we are sure that global warming is really a problem, we should not take any steps that would have economic costs." And in choosing not to act, Australian political leaders are ignoring the increasingly strident pleas of the nation's neighbours and allies. Dr Ian Fry, an Australia climate specialist and diplomat who was recently appointed to be the UN's first Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, says Australia's influence in the Pacific has been diluted due to reluctance to embrace climate action. Is Australia a \' holdout'? During last year's world climate talks in Glasgow, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama HYPERLINK told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that he had again asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison for more action . "It is no secret that we expect more from Australia on climate," he said. "We've informed them before and we will continue to inform them. "Opening coal plants shuts the door on the future of low-lying Pacific nations; whether you burn it yourself or you export it to others, coal has no place in this century." Environment Minister Sussan Ley approved three coal mines in the lead up to the talks. In a public forum last month, HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/un-boss-madness-to-back-fossil-fuels-as-global-energy-crunch-bites-20220321-p5a6j9.html UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took the unusual step of calling out Australia specifically . "A growing number of G20 developed economies have announced meaningful emissions reductions by 2030 - with a handful of holdouts, such as Australia," he said Banks, insurance companies and investment houses are abandoning the same fossil energy companies that Australia's two main parties champion. Australian business leaders such as Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes are pumping billions of dollars into renewable projects, not (only) because of concern about the climate, but because they see money to be made in new industries that are already exploding around the world. So, why the Australian silence? Climate change has long been a political graveyard for Australian politics. The nation was made rich by its abundant resources, particularly coal and gas. As a result, powerful incumbent industries, backed by media allies, have used their political might to turn public opinion against leaders who dared heed the warnings of scientists too closely. And while public sentiment has today shifted, it has not yet shifted in the right places, said one long-time Labor strategist this week. In other words, the main parties want to take key coal seats in places such as the Hunter Valley and around Gladstone without losing others in places like Sydney and Melbourne. Which means both parties are happy not to discuss climate policies which some voters will believe go too far, and others not far enough. What would an ideal climate policy look like? According to the UN's chief climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this means the world needs to cut emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. But the IPCC pathway allows for developing nations to emit greenhouse gasses for longer than advanced economies to allow for the fact that they have lower historical and per capita emissions. As a result, some experts say that Australia's reduction targets must be higher than the global average. The Climate Targets Panel, a group of independent experts working with the University of Melbourne's Climate and Energy College, last year found that for Australia to do its share in holding global warming to 2 degrees, it must reduce emissions by 50 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2045. To remain on track for 1.5 degrees, the targets would be 74 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2035. But targets, however ambitious they might be, are meaningless without a plan to reach them. Any plan to achieve such a sweeping change in Australia involves a few common steps. First, the coal-fired energy system must be rapidly replaced with a mix of new renewable-energy generation backed by new transition lines and energy storage. The states are already making headway on this, but experts say the process should be driven by the federal government. "I can't believe I am saying this in 2022," says Associate Professor Christian Downie, a governance expert at the Australian National University. "But the first thing we need is a national climate policy to reduce pollution across all sectors of the economy. If we have leadership at the federal level rather than individual states doing their own thing, we will do this faster and more effectively." As the energy system is decarbonised, an effective federal climate policy would then speed up the process of electrifying industry and households. But there are other elements that climate policies should include, no matter which side of politics introduces them, Downie says. "Legislative targets would be much stronger," he says. "They would show a strong commitment both from the government and the parliament. Of course, that requires negotiating through both houses of parliament, which can create its own complications, but that's something that the next government should be aiming to do." And he says "serious" climate policy would be consistent across government. This would mean ending fossil fuel subsidies. "You can't continue to support gas-fired recoveries at the same time as we're claiming to be taking action on climate change. The two propositions are just inconsistent." Finally, a government determined to move fast on climate would introduce an independent body to set Australian targets and ensure that the government is working towards meeting them. "The benefit of having an independent agency is that it's insulated from the kind of political volatility we've seen characterise climate policy," Downie says. "A good way to think about it is like an independent central bank. If the government set interest rates, they'd be moved around to suit election cycles, but we have a central bank, which is largely independent from the political process and can set interest rates based on fundamentals." Such a body, similar to the Climate Commission created by Julia Gillard in 2011 and scrapped by Tony Abbott two years later, would ensure that the government was acting in concert on climate, with environmental, energy, agriculture and industry policy all set to support emission reduction efforts. What are the parties offering? The Coalition's climate policy was largely finalised last year as Prime Minister Scott Morrison prepared to attend the COP26 climate talks. After prolonged negotiations with Nationals, Morrison confirmed that the government would set net zero by 2050 as a firm target rather than a "preferred target". Despite intense international pressure it did not increase its 2030 reduction target of 26-28 per cent. The policy relies on effort to reduce emissions using "technology not taxes". Rather than mandating the use of cleaner technologies or setting targets, it seeks to make their use more commercially viable. According to its climate change policy paper, HYPERLINK https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/australias-long-term-emissions-reduction-plan The Plan to Deliver Net Zero: HYPERLINK https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/australias-long-term-emissions-reduction-plan The Australian Way , 20 per cent of reductions required to reach the 2050 goal have already been achieved since 2005 and 40 per cent would come from its plan to invest in new clean technologies. Another 15 per cent would come from international technology trends, and, it believes, 15 per cent more would be delivered by technologies not yet invented. Labor has promised a 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, or 2 per cent less than it took to the last election. It's Rewiring the Nation package would back state government efforts to support green energy with $20 billion to modernise and improve the grid to use more renewables, in line with a blueprint already drafted by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Labor says the plan would decrease prices and increase the amount of renewables flowing through the grid used by the east coast states and South Australia to 82 per cent. Its plan includes funding the creation of "community batteries" for groups of homes to share and the introduction of incentives for EVs. Controversially in climate circles, it supports an ongoing role for coal exports. "Coal will be a part of Australia's energy and export mix for years to come," Labor's resources spokeswoman, Madeleine King, told the Herald and The Age this week. "If new projects stack up environmentally and commercially then they will of course go ahead. And if they stack up, we welcome the jobs." The Greens policy has by far the most ambitious emissions reduction target: 75 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2035. It includes measures to support households and small businesses get off gas through grants of up to $25,000 and loans of up to $100,000. It would offer grants for households to buy batteries and work with states and territories to ban gas in new housing developments. The so-called Teal independents, who could share a crossbench with the Greens, do not have a common climate policy, but their various proposals are largely more ambitious than Labor's and not quite as ambitious as the Greens'. Richie Merzian, who heads the energy and climate program at progressive think tank the Australia Institute, says of the three plans, only the Greens' emissions reduction target is in line with what climate science demands. "It's based on Australia's historical responsibilities and current capacity to do so much more," Merzian says. "This level of ambition would align with the upper guardrail of the Paris agreement to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees." He says Labor's short-term emissions reduction target of minus 43 per cent announced in December 2021 would put Australia alongside the updated targets of similar economies the US and Canada. Collectively, they would see global warming to exceed 2 degrees. Merzian criticises the Coalition's short-term target of 26 to 28 per cent, set in 2015, as outdated, saying if the rest of the world followed suit we would be on track for 3 to 4 degrees of global warming. In an annual assessment of climate action published by leading US university MIT last month, Australia's ranking slipped from 35th to 52nd, to sit neatly behind Saudi Arabia, whose oil minister Abdulaziz bin Salman HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-22/saudi-prince-abdulaziz-bin-salman-seeks-to-tame-oil-prices-opec-russia vowed last year to drill "every last molecule" of hydrocarbon from the ground . Christiana Figueres, one of the world's leading climate diplomats and a former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told The Age and the Herald on Friday that so far Australia's climate plans were among the least ambitious on earth. "While the rest of the world stood up at COP26 , Australia stood back," she said. "As a result, Australia has increasingly been pushed to the margins of the international community and seen as a blocker, a country willing to expand polluting industries at the expense of the planet. "Government administrations have repeatedly stalled on climate action, while the Australian people overwhelmingly support environmental responsibility." \</doc>

The world's climate goals are clear, but our federal leaders' shooting is astray, writes Nick O'Malley. The disconnect is jarring when you look closely. After years of drought, fire and flood - and in the wake of a series of United Nations reports spelling out in terrible detail the catastrophic costs of inaction - Australia's major political parties are running cold on climate action. On Wednesday, in the first leaders' debate of this election campaign, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese did not mention climate change once. The issue was raised only in oblique terms after an audience member asked about electric cars. The main parties have embraced emissions reductions targets out of step with Paris targets, though Labor's remains more ambitious.

This compared with 10 per cent who agreed that: "Until we are sure that global warming is really a problem, we should not take any steps that would have economic costs." And in choosing not to act, Australian political leaders are ignoring the strident pleas of the nation's neighbours and allies.

"A growing number of G20 developed economies have announced meaningful emissions reductions by 2030 - with a handful of holdouts, such as Australia," he said. Nor are the main parties restrained by the business sector. The Business Council of Australia, which once opposed ambitious action, is now calling for more of it. Boardrooms across the country want more action, said Anna Skarbek last year. She is a former investment banker who is now executive director of non-profit ClimateWorks Australia. Banks, insurance companies and investment houses are abandoning the same fossil energy companies that Australia's two main parties champion. Australian business leaders such as Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes are pumping billions of dollars into renewable projects, not (only) because of concern about the climate, but because they see money to be made in new industries that are already exploding around the world.

Which means the parties are happy not to discuss climate policies that some voters will believe go too far, others not far enough. At the heart of any climate policy is an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding global warming to below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. According to the UN's chief climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this means the world needs to cut emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Could a global carbon price be the only way to secure gas's role in the green energy transition? Charlotte Grieve and Peter Milne report. On the sidelines of the global climate summit COP26 last year, Australian business tycoon Andrew Liveris began spruiking the benefits of carbon pricing. The politically toxic 'carbon tax' has ended prime ministerial careers and divided the nation, but Liveris said the government's technology roadmap was insufficient and a carbon price was the "next logical step". The COP26 The Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a rush for fossil fuel supplies, as the world cuts off Russian exports. Energy and petrol prices are soaring, prompting a global discussion around energy security and the role of oil and gas. There is consensus among analysts that the current spike in energy prices does not reflect long-term demand, with dependence on fossil fuels waning as global economies switch to cheaper renewable energy sources in pursuing net-zero targets. But the comments by Liveris, who was the architect of Australia's gas-led recovery policy, have now taken on new meaning. Could a global carbon price be the only way to secure gas's role in the energy transition? Or will these companies need to reinvent core operations to keep investors on board? Last week, this masthead revealed Woodside had commissioned the national science agency to model the impact of exporting gas on global emissions. The CSIRO report, which was released after a lengthy freedom of information request, found increasing gas exports could only reduce emissions if there was a high carbon price in every region around the world by 2025. Without this, increasing gas supply could displace renewables, prolong coal and increase emissions - undermining the gas industry's key environmental justification for new projects, that global emissions will be reduced by gas displacing coal in Asia. Oil and gas majors, including Santos and Woodside, are under unprecedented pressure to develop credible climate plans to secure not only a social licence to operate but investor capital. Chief executives from both companies have said it is now harder than ever to secure funding for new projects, as scrutiny mounts from shareholders, regulators, banks and activists that want to see fossil fuels phased out faster. Both companies have recently gained approval for major new projects, Scarborough and Barossa, despite the International Energy Agency's declaration last year there can be no new fossil fuel projects if the world is to keep global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees. Fund manager Allan Gray's Simon Mawhinney says increasing production is vital to avoiding "astronomical" price spikes and social upheaval. "Are these projects needed? Absolutely. Will they get funded? You bet. Who's going to do it? Somebody," he says. "If people want hydrocarbons to stop by 2035, fine, don't invest in them now. But make sure we all know what the consequences are." Mawhinney says Santos and Woodside can largely self-fund new projects, and high commodities prices will help build buffers for capital expenditure in the future. "If the oil and gas companies don't invest in their businesses between now and 2035, they won't have anything to produce," he says. "It's a difficult thing to admit but the world is not ready for no new oil and gas developments." But these companies are also increasingly at the whim of large investors, who are demanding greater action on a range of environment, social and governance factors. Australia's superannuation funds have become vocal advocates for corporate action on climate change, holding large stakes in companies such as Woodside and Santos to agitate for change. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ASCI), which represents more than $1 trillion in assets, says the now-public CSIRO report raises a key question investors have been focused on for some time. Davidson says this will be considered in the lead up to Woodside's annual general meeting in May where investors will vote on a resolution seeking to force better reporting on emissions and plans to reduce them. However, Janus Henderson's head of global natural resources Daniel Sullivan says companies like Woodside need to do a lot more than displace coal or report emissions to win the support of long-term capital. "In the big picture, the hardest industry to mitigate is oil and gas because that's all they do," he says. "They literally have to mitigate everything or change their business line entirely." Sullivan says companies like Woodside cannot offset their way into the future, and short-term plans to curb carbon emissions will only cause more pain for investors. He provides the example of the Spanish energy company Repsol, which recently introduced a voluntary cap on the number of barrels it produces per day to reduce its carbon footprint. "It's good for the climate but not for equity holders," he says. "You're now deliberately stopping your core activity which involves bringing on new projects and making good margin and growing the company." And he says short-term price surges, like the current rally, can also hurt investors by triggering "knee-jerk" reactions from governments to protect consumers from essential products becoming unaffordable. "I know this is an extraordinary circumstance of having a war but if governments are going to intervene and tax your profits, ad hoc, just because they think you're making too much money - that's very bad for equity markets and ratings." Investors need to see long-term plans to diversify core operations which is difficult but not impossible, he says, providing examples of Dutch companies DSM and Vestas which executed strategic overhauls over 15 to 30 year periods. "Nearly everyone you look at is anti-oil now. And all those forces will basically come together to stop your projects, increase your cost of capital, lower returns to shareholders, super tax you out of big events - it's a much harder area. "They can't just give it up in a day. If you wake up tomorrow and say we're going to make cornflakes, most people would be horrified. You need to come up with a credible plan which is acceptable to the shareholders in the sense that they're there for a reason." Both Woodside and Santos have released climate plans in recent years which include commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and 2040 respectively. These plans feature prominently across the companies' websites and branding. But drilling into the details provides a more cynical picture. The focus is always on their own operational, or Scope 1, emissions rather than their Scope 3 emissions from their customers burning the oil and gas they buy. To decarbonise their operations companies have three difficult options and one unpalatable one. Eliminating emissions in the first place is the obvious starting point. However, a Woodside proposal for a million solar panels will reduce emissions from its Pluto LNG plant by just 1.5 per cent. As an alternative, Santos is spending $220 million to capture emissions at its Moomba gas field for storage in depleted oil and gas fields. Carbon capture and storage (CSS) has a poor track record, with Chevron's $3.1 billion effort at its Gorgon LNG project in WA falling 9.5 million tonnes short of its target in the first five years of operation. If emissions are difficult to eliminate, capture or offset at scale and cost effectively then fossil fuel producers have one last unpalatable lever to achieve net-zero emissions: produce fewer fossil fuels. Woodside declined to answer questions from this masthead about its longer-term plans but last week told trade publication Energy News Bulletin that after 2030, "we have an aspiration not a target for now, which reflects that we don't have detailed business plans that far ahead". Mawhinney says Woodside and Santos are only at the start of executing transition strategies and urges investors to be patient. But in time, he says genuine transition plans mean addressing Scope 3 emissions. Alternatively, Mawhinney says the companies could continue producing oil and gas until all the reserves are burnt. "That is a credible business model to follow as well. But it's one with significantly less longevity attached to it." Atlas Funds Management chief investment officer Hugh Dive says it is unlikely that Woodside could reinvent itself. It's a company specialising in drilling wells and that's not going to change anytime soon. \</doc>

I've never thought calling a politician a liar to be an effective insult. Of course, you don't want to be singled out as being particularly untrustworthy in a class of people generally regarded as untrustworthy. The least reputable used car dealer on the wrong side of town. Scott Morrison was always going to have a tough time at COP but now the headlines here and around the world are calling him a liar. It might be worth wearing a mask to protect himself from both Delta and the cold shoulder. Much has been made of the HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/net-zero-by-2050-plan-uniquely-australian-morrison-20211026-p5937b.html Prime Minister's plan for 2050 And so many countries, businesses as well as the public are shifting their focus to the next 10 years of opportunity and action. Bringing a 2050 target to COP is like bringing a $10 bottle of wine to the third date. At her house. When she is cooking. On climate change and at Glasgow, the Prime Minister is missing something more than just an effective plan to address climate change. He is missing a compelling and emotional story about why action matters. That, as much as anything, is leaving him isolated in the rooms and halls of the COP26 conference. On the first full day of COP26 global leaders gave their set speeches on climate action. Boris Johnston, more comfortable being jovial and optimistic, was grave, even dramatic in his address. The world is at HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59114871 "one minute to midnight" The rhetoric of the leaders of countries feeling the full force of climate effects - including some of our closest neighbours in the Pacific - also gave speeches full of emotion and an appeal not just to the wellbeing of future generations but people living today. Their words carry a huge moral authority to match the moral responsibility of the nations who have caused most of the climate damage through their carbon pollution. In and around the COP26 leaders like President Biden speak of their personal disappointment that Russia and China haven't shown up with any substantive commitments to deal with climate change. The Pope tweeted that COP26 was our moment to "dream big" and "replan our future". And Prince Charles got in touch with his inner Churchill with a speech arguing we must put ourselves on a war-like footing to tackle climate because "the future of humanity and nature herself are at stake". From Scott Morrison at COP we got a HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-outlines-2-billion-funding-pledge-to-un-climate-summit-20211102-p59545.html speech about technology Good leaders understand that effective storytelling that is personal and emotional can be critical to winning people over, whether they be world leaders, the media or voters. Effective leadership is a lot about reading the moment and seizing it, knowing when to push or fall back. And how to weave a credible and genuine story around the decisions you are making. Almost all of our prime ministers, at their best, have done this. John Howard on gun control and Kevin Rudd on the apology to the Stolen Generation are good examples. Scott Morrison's problem is when the big events have happened to us during his term, ones that offered him a chance to step up, he failed to do so in a way that showed either emotional intelligence or an ability to read the mood of "the mob". In the Black Summer fires, our images of him are on holiday or in awkward exchanges with bushfire survivors. And despite a strong performance throughout 2020, in the second wave of lockdown our images of him in action are, well, missing in action. Scott Morrison undoubtedly has a policy problem and persona problem. Scott from Marketing can ill afford to graduate to Scott the Liar. He has the capacity to talk with feeling about the things that matter to him. He has spoken on more than one occasion about his wife and kids being the centre of his life. It's believable to me, as a mother who feels the same way about her children who are not much younger than his girls. And who knows what politicians give up when they step into office, all that precious, never-to-be-reclaimed time with loved ones. When it comes to climate change, he has an opportunity to talk with genuine feeling and facts about the threat it poses to the wellbeing of his children, their friends and their generation. Matched with concrete action, that might look like a prime ministership worth renewing. Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future.

Australia's job was to get in and out of the Glasgow fiasco, an absolute circus of spivs and activists, with politicians cast to the side - and in one case, left on the side of the road for two hours because, in all the fuss about our changing climate, they forgot about wheelchair access. Our reward for showing up to the COP26 UN Climate Summit was billionaires, carpet baggers and virtue-signalling celebrities eminent of a modern-day Marie Antoinette blasting us. The last queen of France before the French Revolution famously gorged on handmade sweets, draped in diamonds and dresses of silk and velvet, while at the same time, financially-drained peasants starved and a bloated aristocratic, royal and privileged class refused to relinquish their entitlements. Like Marie Antoinette in her Versailles palace, at COP26 , they favoured buttery croissants for breakfast. It turns out billionaires and global elites don't stick to 'vegan alternatives' either. After listening to delegates, you would expect that the Glasgow Port would be crowded with sailboats made of recycled timber and plastic for COP26 , but it was Scotland's airports in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick clogged with more than 400 private jets. Where was Extinction Rebellion when you need them? Just like the former Queen of France ran into trouble for taxing the poor, while sucking on the teat of the state, the modern-day Antoinette class can mount the stage and say: "When it comes to tackling climate change, words without action, without deeds are absolutely pointless." That was UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before he took a private jet home, and after he and Prince Charles each took a separate private jet from Rome, effectively forcing the British taxpayers to fund two separate private jets, and the climate to take twice the emissions, to go to the very same conference. And despite Malcolm Turnbull's protests that he is just a mere ordinary citizen - when a flat-bed business class seat on Qantas QF1 wasn't available because they weren't flying he just hitched a ride on Andrew Forrest's private jet. You'd think after his hydrogen hype, the iron-ore magnate might opt to fly in using the same planet-saving technology that powered the Hindenberg. The Antoinette class spruiked slashing emissions while creating a bigger carbon footprint than the entire neighbourhood suburbs they entered with motorcades taking VIPs to events in chauffeured cars, which waited in side streets with engines idling, rubbish overflowed from Glasgow's street bins, and all the while they were mounting the stage to lecture the masses to stop eating meat, drinking milk, or burning wood. But the lowest point of COP26 wasn't the grotesque display of public resources used on private aircraft or even the overflowing rubbish. In the glare of saving the world, they forgot to include the most basic of human needs that even bush post offices feature. Wheelchair access. A minister with muscular dystrophy, Israel's energy minister Karine Elharrar, was left to wait for two hours outside COP26 , and then offered a shuttle without wheelchair access, and then forced to return to her hotel. That in itself paints a bleak picture of what climate activists really care about - and it's not people. The left-wing European news source, Euronews, which recommends buying second-hand sex toys, using a reusable washcloth instead of toilet paper and claims pollution is causing penises to shrink, took aim at countries that refused to bow down to pledges which would destroy their development, such as Indonesia refusing to commit to zero deforestation by 2030. The single benefit to Australia being at COP26 was intimate access to 130 world leaders, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison was smashed with back-to-back meetings on trade, the global economy, the economic rebuild and vaccinating the world. Australia helped calm the hyperventilation spurned by fear-mongering carpet baggers indulging in greenwash to drive the reality that socialism and giving trillions of dollars of taxes to China is not the answer. Australia led a solid bloc of countries, with Japan, Korea, India, Brazil, China and Indonesia to delete extreme pledges from the final communique, including a timeline on zero coal, signing up to a methane pledge and ceasing fossil fuels. Even net-zero by 2050 was removed in the end to be in favour of net-zero "by or around mid-century". But in the end, Australia's presence was slammed by the climate-Antoinettes, representatives from Hollywood, art galleries, climate, renewable energy and environmental groups. You will never make the climate-Antoinettes happy with any goal or commitment - not even when you are blaming your penis size on climate change. \</doc>

Exports The Australian pavilion had a secret weapon in Glasgow. Glasgow | At COP summits, Australia's reputation as a stubborn defender of coal means it isn't always the most popular country in town. But this year, the government turned to another great Aussie export to win hearts and minds: the flat white. For the first time, Australia hosted a "pavilion", becoming one of about 40 countries, organisations and campaigns to set up a showcase and meeting space in the venue's vast exhibition hall. The Australian pavilion was set up as a mini-cafe, with promotional videos dominating one wall, a few companies touting their wares around the edges, and - most importantly - a coffee machine and barista in one corner. It instantly became a magnet for the Aussie crowd. On a given morning, you might see OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann having a quiet coffee with Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, or globetrotting businessman Andrew Liveris bumping into Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher. When he wasn't meeting Joe Biden or Al Gore, Andrew Forrest and his Fortescue Future Industries team were a near-permanent fixture at one end of the pavilion, next to a Tardis-like installation they had produced to help promote Twiggy's green hydrogen campaign. Australia's band of COP-attending environmentalists, including Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, also dropped in, though some raised an eyebrow at Santos' carbon capture and storage exhibit. High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis kept a stately eye on proceedings, while Energy Minister Angus Taylor held meetings or gave presentations in the private room upstairs. Gradually, though, the Aussie secret got out: word crept out into the broader conference about the quality of the coffee. The choice was simple: you could stand in a queue elsewhere at COP for 20 minutes and buy a crap coffee for almost $5, or you could queue for five minutes and get an Australian-quality one for free. The queue was suddenly full of student representatives, Pacific Island negotiators, and random passers-by. It got longer and longer - and made Australia's pavilion one of the busiest on site. "Good coffee, good company. But most important, this is Aussie companies doing amazing things. That's what I liked most of all," Taylor tells AFR Weekend. He's sold on the concept. "When we left Madrid [the 2019 COP], I said, 'Next time, this is what we're doing'. We have worked very closely to get this outcome, and I want to ramp it up in the future." In fact, he says he wants to "double down". What could this mean? Smashed avocado on sourdough toast? Free cold beer? Roll on, Cairo 2022. \</doc>

Gangster states Under Putin, Moscow has steadily revealed its disdain for the rules of international diplomacy , writes Phillip Coorey. When Scott Morrison attended the G20 summit in Rome last November, followed by the COP26 summit in Glasgow, much of the attention back home was on the adequacy or otherwise of Australia's contribution to combat climate change. What most chose to overlook, especially the Prime Minister's army of critics, was that the leaders of two of the world's biggest polluters, Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, didn't even bother showing up. The representatives each country did send were openly dismissive of both conferences. This was writ large at the G20 which ended in disagreement over whether there should be a joint commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. At the urging of China and Russia, and backed by India and Saudi Arabia, the G20 communiqu&#xE9; was stripped of any reference to 2050 as the deadline for net zero emissions. It was replaced with recognising the "key relevance" of achieving net zero "by or around mid-century". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the net-zero push as a plot by the G7, a body once known as the G8 before Russia was expelled in 2014 for its invasion and occupation of Crimea, inside Ukraine. COP26 summit, leaving host Boris Johnson trying to spin victory out of scraps and US President Joe Biden, who turned up with nothing but talk after being defied by Congress, looking weak. What happened last November was about a lot more than climate change. To those of us who attend and observe such summits, the disdain for the post-war global order by the gangster states of Russia and China and their fellow travellers had been evident for some time. A most telling and sinister moment came at the G20 leaders' summit in Buenos Aires in December 2018 when, in full view of the international media, Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman openly smiled, laughed and greeted each other with a high five. Bin Salman had been implicated in the grisly murder of Saudi/American journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Putin, who in recent years had annexed Crimea, backed those who used chemical weapons in Syria, poisoned or jailed his political opponents, and whose country had its fingerprints all over the MH-17 massacre, used that G20 moment to show that he and his mates would do as they pleased. Looking on, not with disdain but envy, was Donald Trump, who admired the strongmen dictators. He gave every indication he would like to join them if it weren't for the inconvenience of US democracy. His chief criticism of the murder of Khashoggi was not the crime but that the Saudis had botched the cover-up. Last week he described as "genius" Putin traducing the notion of peacekeeping to justify the Ukraine invasion. America's global influence took a downturn when it invaded Iraq in 2003, and it declined further under Trump's policy of economic and military isolationism, and his disdain for America's institutions, democracy foremost among them. On Thursday, as Russian tanks rolled across the border into Ukraine, Trump was live on Fox News in the United States, blaming Joe Biden for the invasion and subverting democracy again by claiming the 2020 US election was rigged. One was again reminded of a speech John Howard gave to a foreign policy forum in Chicago in 2006, at a time when the US was being roundly condemned for the mess it had created in Iraq. Some were calling for a new world order. Howard warned those baying loudest to "be careful what you wish for". If the US retreated into its shell, darker and more sinister forces would start influencing the world. "Without American leadership, the trials and tragedies of recent years could be but a prelude of darker days to come," he said. With the invasion of Ukraine this week, along with China's acquiescence, Morrison said those dark days had arrived. "We are now living in a world where authoritarian autocracies are seeking to have their way and the only defence against that is those countries that favour a world order that favours freedom and liberal democracies have to stand together." On Friday, Morrison vented his fury at China, not just for staying quiet about the invasion but for throwing Russia a lifeline by agreeing to buy more of its wheat to help mitigate the effect of sanctions. Defence Minister Peter Dutton stated openly that China was watching the reaction to the Ukraine invasion, for its own sinister purposes. "They're probably watching to see what the world reaction is so that they can make their own calculations down the track in relation to Taiwan," he said. The government also has an eye on the forthcoming federal election, something it wants to fight on its core strengths of the economy and national security. With the Ukraine invasion posing an existential threat to the post-war order, especially if it spills into the Indo-Pacific, Morrison sought vindication against all those who had criticised him for being alarmist against China or dumping the French submarine deal for the AUKUS pact. These critics include former Labor prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating, as well as Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, and Federal Labor, all of whom gave succour to the French over AUKUS. Morrison hit back on Friday: "This is not a new point I have been making about the alignment of authoritarian and autocratic regimes in our world. I have been saying this for years. "That is why our government has taken the strong actions that we have, whether it has been the formation of AUKUS ... or the elevation of the (quadrilateral security dialogue) to a leaders' level dialogue." Suddenly, the domestic political dynamic feels as though it is shifting as well.P \</doc>

PRIME Minister Scott Morrison says he believes climate change will be solved by "can-do capitalism, not don't-do governments", arguing the Glasgow summit should pave the way for private enterprise to take over from politicians. His comments came as the first draft of the Glasgow COP26 agreement was released by the United Nations Climate Summit last night - and called on countries such as Australia to "revisit and strengthen" the 2030 carbon emissions targets by the end of next year. Having returned from Glasgow last week, Mr Morrison spoke out against "governments seeking to control people's lives", in a major speech that he also used to set out the terms of his re-election strategy. Mr Morrison said critics of his view should "follow the money" with governments putting $100bn into climate finance and private capital delivering as much as $100 trillion to reduce emissions. "In many respects, Glasgow has marked the passing of the baton from political diktats of targets and timetables, which have had their place and are necessary, to private enterprise and the millions of dispersed decisions, choices and flashes of inspiration that make up consumer-led technological progress," Mr Morrison said. "Of course, summits have their place \'e2\€ \£6 but we believe climate change will ultimately be solved by can-do capitalism, not don't-do governments seeking to control people's lives and tell them what to do, with interventionist regulation and taxes." The vital point contained in the COP26 agreement, which is expected to be approved in coming days, is for countries like Australia, China and India to have a set of fresh plans on the table that "align with Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Mr Morrison said that the world did not "need to be punished for climate change" and instead needed to fix it with the innovation of entrepreneurs, scientists, technologists, financiers and industrialists. Labor leader Anthony Albanese accused Mr Morrison of returning from Glasgow and going "into a spin cycle". Summit president Alok Sharma, speaking prior to the release of COP26 's "cover decision", said the collective commitments of world leaders went "some way but certainly not all the way" to keeping global warming within 1.5C this century. . \</doc>

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES SCOTT Morrison has made a flying visit to the Middle East to thank the Australian troops who rescued thousands of people during the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. The Prime Minister stopped at the Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday as he returned from the G20 and COP26 summits in Europe. The base is Australia's defence hub in the region and processed 4100 Afghans who Mr Morrison said were now Australians living in their new home. Speaking to the troops at Camp Baird, he said it was a "great honour" to thank them in person for their efforts in Australia's largest-ever airlift from "one of the most dangerous places in the world". Australian authorities had initially only expected to be able to evacuate 1000 people as the Taliban took control of the capital of Kabul. "It was, I think, some of Australia's proudest days," Mr Morrison said. "It was the innovation, it was the determination, it was the professionalism, it was the training, it was the dedication that you have spent all of your service preparing yourselves for a time such as that. "In that moment, our defence forces and all of those who served were not found wanting. What we found is you excelled, you exceeded the expectations." Among the troops Mr Morrison met was Akram Saleh, who came to Australia as a refugee from Eritrea in 2006 and now lives in Melbourne. He said he had been stationed at Al Minhad since May, and that being involved in the Afghanistan rescue mission was "very special". "There is no word to describe it," the 38-year-old said. "To reflect on my life 10 years ago \'e2\€ \£6 I was glad to be a part of this mission." Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade crisis response team chief Trudy McGowan told Mr Morrison how one group of 89 Afghans brought only six bags between them. "This shows just how little they brought and how fast they left," she said. Mr Morrison is expected to land in Sydney on Thursday morning despite the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow running until the end of next week, as world leaders try to thrash out a deal to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C by the end of this century. Summit host and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was "cautiously optimistic" after the first two days of the summit, in a change of tune from the end of the G20 in which major polluters - including China, Russia and India - rejected key commitments for stronger action. But Mr Johnson said there was still "a long way to go", particularly on persuading China to bring forward its pledge for emissions to peak in 2030. "You bet we need more progress from China \'e2\€ \£6 and everyone here at this gathering," he said. US President Joe Biden was more pointed, declaring it was a "big mistake" for China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin to snub the summit attended by more than 120 world leaders. "We showed up," Mr Biden said. "They didn't show up \'e2\€ \£6 It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away." Asked if he shared that view, Mr Morrison said Australia was not at COP26 "to lecture others". "The approach Australia took to COP26 was to talk about what we were going to do and how we were going to particularly work with other countries to meet the technology challenge of addressing climate change," he said. "Whether it's in China or whether it's in Indonesia or Australia, indeed in the North Atlantic developed countries, unless you get the cost of this technology down, rather than focusing on putting the prices of energy up everywhere else, then you are not going to get countries actually achieving the things they say they want to achieve." Labor leader Anthony Albanese criticised Mr Morrison for having "nothing to say of value" at COP26 "compared with the challenge that the world faces from climate change". "What we need is global action and Australia should be a part of that process rather than being a handbrake," he said. TOM MINEAR, PAGE 22 \</doc>

As eyes around the world were turning to Scotland for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), research house Morningstar revealed the extent of demand for financial products with an environmental focus. At September 30, "sustainable funds" around the world had a total of $US3.9 trillion ($5.3 trillion) in assets under management. In Australia, these green investment products are now worth a collective $38 billion, up 11 per cent over the September quarter. Superannuation and investment manager Australian Ethical accounts for 18 per cent of that pool of sustainably managed assets. It says it has seen rising demand for its funds in the lead-up to and during COP26 , as climate change was thrust back onto the news agenda with the imminent summit and easing of coronavirus restrictions. Nathan Fradley, of Lime Financial Planning, a certified ethical investment adviser, says the response to COP26 from clients and investors is not just a heightened interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues but "frustration" at the lack of progress from governments. "Investors feel it is another let-down that does not do enough," Fradley says. "What is refreshing, though, is that the frustration is visible and widespread. I feel this will put further pressure on business to lead the way, with a larger focus on carbon emissions by super funds, and climate change risk as a thematic for investment." A deal between the world's nations proved elusive in the conference's first week after big emitters China, India and Russia led efforts to oppose a hard deadline of 2050 for net zero. The heightened focus on climate change - having been largely absent from mainstream news headlines during the pandemic - is expected to drive even further demand for ESG investments. " COP26 "In this way ESG investing sets itself apart as a truly unique investment model, where the investment community works together for a desired outcome, making it particularly attractive to Australian investor." Of those that are already investing with an ESG lens, 41.7 per cent said such an approach allowed them to align their investments with their personal values, while 38.1 per cent said they did so in order to "support the environment". More than one-third (34.5 per cent) responded that they believed ESG funds had similar or better performance than other non-ESG investment products. Half agreed with the proposition that they have a "responsibility to help fix societal issues through my investments". "It's clear that ESG has finally moved into mainstream investment management because it is no longer possible to ignore the science of climate change, nor deny the conclusion that we are at a tipping point in terms of the global environment," says Pierre Lenders, head of ESG at Capital Fund Management in Paris. Ethical engagement But while more and more investors are allocating all or some of their portfolio to ESG investment products, they also increasingly expect more from their fund managers than just screening out fossil fuel companies and pocketing a performance fee. The Natixis survey found the vast majority of Australian respondents (69.5 per cent) believed fund managers should be "actively engaging with companies they invest in". The same number said they expected fund managers to look at "more than just the financial aspects of a company", while 67 per cent said they expected fund managers to vote on all the shares they own. Globally, 60 per cent of the 8550 investors surveyed rejected the idea that companies were responsible only for creating shareholder value - once a widely held and uncontroversial principle of free market enterprise. The findings represent a recent cultural shift whereby investors are no longer satisfied to simply deploy capital to niche investment products to satisfy their personal moral obligations. Instead, they demand that all companies improve their ESG standing and commit to reducing carbon emissions or other environmental and social goals. And, crucially for the financial services industry, they expect the professionals managing their money to play a role in ensuring that actually happens. In other words, they expect investment managers to effectively become environmental activists. Fradley agrees this is an increasing expectation of his financial planning clients and says this has only heightened since COP26 . "A big issue right now is genuine engagement and voting," he says. "Divestment-only approaches mean companies may dump assets to private equity firms, which can be mismanaged and result in worse outcomes." For investors who genuinely want to make a difference to climate change, therefore, just selling stock or buying into a fund that avoids certain sectors isn't enough because a new owner may not apply an ESG lens, allowing a high-polluting company to continue its practices. Stewards and signatures Fradley points to $100 billion-plus mega-funds AustralianSuper and Aware Super as examples of investment managers with good track records on ESG engagement. "While record amounts of money are pouring into \' sustainable' and ESG funds, capital continues to flow into companies that are harming people, planet and animals," he says. "Ethical investing considers the impact of these investments and avoids investments in non-aligned industries, as well as actively engaging with companies to influence the shifts necessary to avoid the worst of climate change." And, many companies have themselves committed to decarbonisation or other ESG outcomes. Alongside the politicians and diplomats at COP26 in Glasgow was a HYPERLINK star-studded line-up of listed company executives , including mining sector bosses such as Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher and iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, Australia's richest man. Doug McNamee, chief executive and founder of Jolt, an electric vehicle charging network, says: " COP26 has been a catalyst for the business community in recognising the significant growth opportunities to be realised by investing in zero emissions technologies." To help give them a nudge, AustralianEthical took out a wrap-around ad on the cover of the Financial Times newspaper urging powerful governments and companies to act on climate change. It featured 7500 signatures of regular investors adding their names to the cause, as well as celebrity advocates such as Atlassian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Hollywood superstar Russell Crowe. Perhaps India or China will be next. \</doc>

Impacts of the Black Summer bushfires on our community are to be shared with the world at the upcoming United Nations summit in Glasgow. Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action President Jo Dodds has been allocated one of the badges issued by the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to represent community members impacted by the fires that ravaged the region. The conference is scheduled to be held in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, between October 31 and November 12, 2021. Due to COVID, the ability for world leaders to meet and discuss climate change policy has largely been put on hold, but COP26 will provide the opportunity to take the issue to the world stage once more. " COP26 is particularly urgent given that we're sort of two years behind the setting of international targets and the checking in to see where each of the more than 200 countries represented there have ended up," Ms Dodds said. On October 15 Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he will attend the event, but his government's position on its plan to reduce Australia's emissions to take to COP26 has not yet been finalised Earlier this year, Mr Morrison said the government's goal was to reach net zero as soon as possible, "preferably" by 2050. His goal stands behind the rest of the world according to a report released on October 21 by the Climate Council of Australia ranking Australia "dead last" on climate action of all developed countries, even with the net zero target by 2050. "It's great that he's now going, but if he goes to Glasgow and doesn't commit to urgent reduction of emissions then he is basically committing to more homes burning down," Ms Dodds said. The UN summit invitation was a bit of a shock for Ms Dodds though, she only received the invitation on Monday, October 18, just 14 days before the event. Although getting an exemption and and tests to travel during a pandemic was a complex endeavour, Ms Dodds was confident she would be able to travel and had already booked accommodation. "I haven't even been to Eurobodalla [during the pandemic lockdown] and now suddenly I'm going to Europe! It's mind-blowingly odd." Ms Dodds will be speaking at the event to represent, "the people who have been impacted by bushfires or will be in future and the communities who are suffering and living in fear of the next fire". She said when it came to costs of climate mitigation that ordinary people were paying for it now. \</doc>

MADIGAN: Yes. I think he had to. To not attend would send a churlish message to the world that Australia is simply not interested in reducing emissions. I really don't think this Glasgow meeting is the "last chance saloon" as Prince Charles suggested. But global communication about what to do about carbon emissions is important. I just wish there was less emotion around this issue. Too much carbon in the atmosphere may create serious problems in the decades ahead. MCCORMACK: It depends on how he wants to frame his priorities and whether the government's reading of the room warrants it. Is action on climate change an urgent matter? Absolutely. Is his presence at a climate summit in Glasgow the most important thing? It's certainly not as important as concrete policy implementation and a legitimate roadmap on how we're going to fix the issue. His attendance in Glasgow will matter to the voters in seats like Warringah, or Brisbane. For people in Townsville or Gladstone, hearing from him directly, in person, on how the government plans to transition them away from fossil fuel industries will matter more. JOHNSON: A Prime Minister has a minister responsible for emissions he could send in his place, but the politics made a ScoMo no-show almost impossible. Australia's Prime Minister must have a seat at the table with world leaders. The climate is a thorn in the side of the Coalition and Morrison can't be seen to dismiss its importance to the public. VERDICT: Prime Minister Scott Morrison made the right decision to attend. \</doc>

London | Billionaire miner Andrew Forrest has added another green hydrogen deal to his sheaf, promising to supply up to 100,000 tonnes a year to a German chemicals giant as soon as 2024. The deal with Leverkusen-based Covestro, which Mr Forrest will announce today, is one of several supply commitments that his green energy unit Fortescue Future Industries has signed in Europe, even though FFI's capability is largely still on the drawing board. The two companies' memorandum of understanding is a precursor to a formal deal, but envisages FFI shipping 100,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia to Covestro plants in Asia, North America and Europe. "This collaboration reinforces that green hydrogen is a practical, implementable solution for a range of difficult-to-decarbonise industries," said FFI chief executive Julie Shuttleworth. FFI, the green energy arm of Mr Forrest's iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, will spend up to $US600 million ($820 million) this financial year on building an end-to-end supply chain for hydrogen and ammonia produced using only renewable energy. In recent months Mr Forrest has been on a relentless campaign to promote this form of hydrogen over the "grey" and "blue" alternatives, which rely on fossil fuels, with carbon sequestration for the latter. During a visit to Britain for the COP26 climate conference, he signed an MoU with British construction-equipment giant JCB for 10 per cent of FFI's output, which he has estimated will reach 15 million tonnes a year by 2030. He also signed MoUs with Jordan and Papua New Guinea to build renewable energy projects that could power green hydrogen production. After COP26 he went to Berlin and led a roundtable with senior bureaucrats and corporate executives at the German government's ministry for economic affairs and energy. The companies involved in the roundtable reportedly included chemicals companies Covestro and BASF, energy giant RWE, engineer and steelmaker Thyssenkrupp and Deutsche Bank. Dr Forrest's move into Germany adds a new private-sector strut to the hydrogen partnership deal signed by the Australian and German governments in June last year. That initiative has produced a joint report on the hydrogen supply chain, and will this year launch a hydrogen innovation and technology incubator, with $50 million in funding from Canberra and (EURO)50 million ($78.5 million) from Berlin. Assistant energy minister Tim Wilson recently said collaborating with countries such as Germany would help "achieve the technological breakthroughs required to lower the price of hydrogen and drive its widespread adoption". By 2030, German hydrogen demand could be eight times higher than the green supply, making Europe's largest economy one of several hydrogen-hungry countries that are looking to Australia as a potential supplier. FFI said it was also participating in some of Germany's government-funded hydrogen projects, including the H2Giga project that is looking at how to manufacture electrolysers at scale, and the TransHyDE initiative that is piloting hydrogen transport projects. FFI's putative customer Covestro, a manufacturer of polymer materials, says it could cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tonnes a year through switching from grey hydrogen to green. "Green hydrogen and its derivatives play a key role for the chemical industry, both as an alternative feedstock and a source of clean energy," said Covestro CEO Markus Steilemann. \</doc>

Six in 10 people will be HYPERLINK https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3799524/files/the_worlds_cities_in_2018_data_booklet.pdf living in cities by 2030. This is concerning. Cities are responsible for HYPERLINK https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/brief/climate-action-through-an-urban-lens over 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities can also do a lot to mitigate climate change and help people adapt to its impacts. Cities can use renewable energy sources, promote greener transport, and get industries to cut pollution and adopt cleaner production techniques. Also, they can form or use existing networks and partnerships to strengthen these efforts. Almost HYPERLINK https://data.unicef.org/resources/childrens-climate-risk-index-report/ 1 billion children - nearly half of the world's children - live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children's rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displaces people, and limits access to schools, adequate water and nutrition. UNICEF has drawn attention to the fact that " HYPERLINK https://www.unicef.org/reports/climate-crisis-child-rights-crisis the climate crisis is a child rights crisis ". Recently children have taken the lead in global campaigns like School Strike for Climate and HYPERLINK Fridays for Future in over 7,500 cities. Children are calling on political leaders to see the crisis from their perspective and take action. Central governments are often criticised as too distant and detached from everyday realities. Whereas, city governments are closer to, and in a better position to deal with local challenges, needs and priorities. Cities are empowered by national and local laws to govern on issues concerning children and in climate-related areas. Thus, they can plan and deliver what's needed to address local climate challenges. In a recent HYPERLINK https://brill.com/view/journals/chil/29/4/article-p872_872.xml study , I explored how city-level climate law and policy protects children in the context of climate change. The study used Kenya and South Africa as key examples. In many countries, and in these two countries specifically, I observed that city governments have the constitutional and legislative autonomy and obligations in climate-related functional areas such as water and sanitation. These laws and policies don't always specifically mention children, which means the concerns of children could escape attention. I argue that cities can do more to protect children from the impacts of climate change. Are children at the centre of climate action? The Climate Change HYPERLINK Act (2016) of Kenya is very clear on the obligations of institutions at the city level in relation to climate governance. It empowers county governments to enact laws and policies that promote city-level climate governance and to take robust climate action. Also, it obligates cities to make climate change responses an important part of their plans. The South African Climate Change HYPERLINK https://www.parliament.gov.za/storage/app/media/Bills/2022/B9_2022_Climate_Change_Bill/B9_2022_Climate_Change_Bill.pdf Bill empowers municipalities to adopt climate change response plans at the local level. In particular, municipalities must coordinate climate action within their jurisdiction, including mainstream climate change responses in their development plans. The constitutions of Kenya and South Africa have explicit provisions dedicated to children's rights. Although these constitutional children's rights do not speak to climate change directly, the spectrum of rights guarantees children protection from the impacts of the climate crisis. Despite these obligations of city authorities over climate action on one hand, and children on the other hand, in reality the challenges of children do not always get attention in plans, budgets and interventions at the city level. This is a reality in many other cities in Africa, apart from the cities in Kenya and South Africa. The gains of child-led climate action In 2019, for the first time, children filed a HYPERLINK legal complaint to a UN human rights treaty body - the HYPERLINK https://www.ohchr.org/en/treaty-bodies/crc Committee on the Rights of the Child - about the failure of their governments to take firm climate action. The children pointed out that they lived in cities such as Cape Town (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria) and Tabarka (Tunisia) where the impacts of climate change are on the rise. The communication was considered HYPERLINK https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2021/10/un-child-rights-committee-rules-countries-bear-cross-border-responsibility inadmissible , meaning it could not be heard on the merits. Yet it was ground-breaking in making it clear that children are key actors in climate change action, deserving a seat at the table of decision-making. The acceptance of children as key co-decision makers in climate governance is evident in their participation in global forums such as the 2021 climate conference - HYPERLINK COP26 . This is commendable. But, without robust action and engagement of children at the local sphere of government, the commitments become empty noise. Considering the trends in urbanisation, child urban population, and the climate crisis, I would urge cities to:   Expressly provide for the rights of children in climate action, particularly in law, policy and strategies. This acts as a strong legal tool to ensure the protection and participation of children in cities. Open or expand institutional spaces for children to participate and contribute to climate action at the city level. This could include sporting and fun activities, forums and other opportunities for children to be engaged on the climate discourse at community level. Invest technical and financial resources to ensure that children have access to updated climate change educational material in child-friendly versions, and in languages that they understand. Support child-led initiatives and campaigns. This could include capacity building, resource mobilisation, and guidance for children to contribute to climate action. Up-scale leadership and coordination of action and responses in a child-responsive and child-sensitive approach, including in climate-induced disasters. The best interests of children should be the guiding principle.

In just over two weeks, more than 100 world leaders will gather in the Scottish industrial city of Glasgow for United Nations climate change negotiations known as HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org COP26 . Their task, no less, is to decide the fate of our planet. This characterisation may sound dramatic. After all, UN climate talks are held every year, and they're usually pretty staid affairs. But next month's COP26 summit is, without doubt, vitally important. In the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, each nation pledged to ramp up their emissions reduction pledges every five years. We've reached that deadline - in fact, a one-year delay due to the COVID pandemic means six years have passed. This five-yearly requirement set a framework for countries to reach net-zero emissions across the global economy by mid-century. The Glasgow summit is the first real stress test of whether the world can meet that goal. The Paris Agreement was the world's first truly global treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It set a shared goal for countries to limit global warming to 1.5? above the long-term average. The agreement has been signed and ratified by 191 of the world's 195 countries, giving it near-universal legitimacy. But the actual emissions-reduction commitments countries brought to Paris, known as "Nationally Determined Contributions", left the world heading toward HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1052171 3? of warming this century. This outcome would be cataclysmic for ecosystems and human societies. That's why, every five years, countries must bring progressively stronger pledges to reduce emissions. The years since the Paris summit have seen a dramatic shift towards climate action. Today, countries representing more than HYPERLINK https://ca1-eci.edcdn.com/reports/ECIU-Oxford_Taking_Stock.pdf?mtime=20210323005817&focal=none two-thirds of the global economy have set a firm date for achieving net-zero emissions. More importantly many jurisdictions - including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and Canada - have substantially strengthened their 2030 targets. This constitutes a powerful market signal, driving a global reallocation of private and public investment from fossil fuels toward clean energy solutions. Read more: 5 reasons why the Morrison government needs a net-zero target, not just a flimsy plan What's at stake in Glasgow? While the world is moving fast, there remains a crucial gap between current pledges and the goals of the Paris Agreement. Glasgow is seen as the last chance to close that gap and keep the 1.5? goal within reach. Without stronger national commitments, we risk crossing irreversible " HYPERLINK https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aim-high-go-fast-why-emissions-must-plummet-climate-council-report.pdf tipping points " in the Earth's climate system, locking in uncontrollable global warming. The Australian government has inched toward announcing net-zero emissions by 2050. But such a commitment will not be seen as particularly helpful in Glasgow. Read more: The net-zero bandwagon is gathering steam, and resistant MPs are about to be run over In reality, such announcements are merely the summit's entry ticket. Discussions have moved on, to ensuring much deeper cuts this decade. Barring Australia, almost all advanced economies have set new 2030 targets to slash carbon pollution. By 2030 the UK, the summit's host nation, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/03/uk-vows-outdo-other-major-economies-emissions-cuts-by-2030 plans to cut emissions by 68% below 1990 levels. Meanwhile, the US HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/ will cut emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels. The G7 countries have announced they will collectively HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57461670 halve emissions by 2030. There are clear expectations Australia will follow suit. At present, Australia plans to take to Glasgow the same 2030 target it took to Paris six years ago - a 26-28% cut by 2030, from 2005 levels. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has HYPERLINK hinted he will take an upgraded 2030 projection (rather than target), but this ruse won't pass muster. The Paris Agreement is about targets, and countries are HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf required to set new targets representing "highest possible ambition". If projections suggest we will outperform our target, a new 2030 target is clearly needed. Global diplomatic pressure is driving a sea change in Australia's climate politics. Just this month, the Business Council of Australia HYPERLINK backed cuts to emissions by 46-50% by 2030. The Murdoch press has thrown HYPERLINK https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/environment/mission-zero-putting-australia-on-a-path-to-a-net-zero-future/news-story/83f521bfd9d592ab6defdab7d3b81ce8 its weight behind net-zero emissions. Even many conservative Nationals MPs appear to have dropped opposition to a net-zero target. There is also dawning recognition within the Morrison government that the global energy transition is underway, and it will significantly boost Australia's economy. Thriving in a net-zero world Australia's economy is shaped by trends in the global marketplace. The international car market is switching rapidly to electric vehicles. And around the world, wind and solar energy are HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea now cheaper than coal and gas. Our export markets are changing too. As growing economies in Asia meet their climate targets, they will no longer want to buy coal and gas. Instead they'll want renewable energy, delivered directly via undersea cable or stored as renewable hydrogen. Such nations will still want Australian iron ore. But increasingly, they will want " HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/green-steel-is-hailed-as-the-next-big-thing-in-australian-industry-heres-what-the-hype-is-all-about-160282 green steel " made using hydrogen instead of coking coal. Global demand for batteries, electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies will drive Australian exports of critical minerals - including lithium, cobalt and rare earths. Globally, these minerals will be HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/bonanza-for-australian-minerals-under-net-zero-imf-20211012-p58z4n worth A$17.6 trillion over the next two decades. With the right policy settings, Australia could grow a clean export mix HYPERLINK https://bze.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Beyond-Zero-Emissions-Export-Powerhouse-Summary-Report.pdf worth A$333 billion annually, almost triple the value of existing fossil fuel exports. Getting to net-zero HYPERLINK https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/environment/australias-21-trillion-future-with-672000-jobs-and-net-zero-emissions/news-story/c1c943fc13ce526be2533d896f6ff9e8 could also create 672,000 jobs, and generate A$2.1 trillion in economic activity by mid-century. Commitments in Glasgow will spark a global race toward net-zero. But it is not a race we should be scared of. If we embrace the transition, Australia will prosper.

Not so long ago, it was easy for public banks to fund new fossil fuel projects. But now, as the world faces a worsening climate crisis, the tide may be turning. HYPERLINK reconsider its financial support. "Environmental and legal risks" is one reason given by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) for the delay in deciding on a loan of up to US$330 million for the project. The move could threaten its financial viability. Public financial institutions are under renewed pressure to change lending practices after the world's leading https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/its-over-for-fossil-fuels-ipcc-spells-out-whats-needed-to-avert-climate-disaster climate scientists strongly warned against any new fossil fuel infrastructure. In our region, public banks in China, Japan, and South Korea now face HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/asias-energy-pivot-is-a-warning-to-australia-clinging-to-coal-is-bad-for-the-economy-169541 unprecedented scrutiny Not only that, but the Tiwi injunction has again shone a spotlight on the role played by export credit agencies like Kexim in pumping funds into new coal, gas and oil projects. What are export credit agencies and why do they matter? The Kexim loan was intended to go to the Korean energy group SK E&S, which had HYPERLINK planned to export gas from the project to Asia. Without funding, there may be no project. That's why Kexim's move is so important. While export credit agencies are not the only funders of oil, gas and coal infrastructure, and not the largest either, they have been instrumental in developing many of the world's most carbon intensive sectors. Read more: Green lending: world's biggest banks' latest initiative at COP26 is a step backwards How? By locking in fossil fuel energy systems, leveraging private finance by reducing risk premiums, and shaping international standards which influence private bank policies. In short, they have played a key role in enabling fossil fuel expansion. For decades, these state supported agencies have gone under the radar. No longer. Scrutiny is increasing of their work borrowing from national treasuries or public capital markets to finance export-oriented fossil fuel projects. That's not to criticise all the work these agencies do. They've proven invaluable for nations like South Korea as they industrialised. By providing direct loans, insurance and guarantees to foreign buyers, they have helped improve the competitiveness of their exports. Ending lending: why export credit agencies must fund clean alternatives If the world is to achieve the rapid energy transition necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we will need a revolution in global finance. We have to drain funding from fossil fuels and pump it into clean energy. Until recently, efforts to cut international public funding for fossil fuel projects have focused on multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In response, both have slowly started to HYPERLINK shift their financing While that's a positive step, bilateral funding bodies like export credit agencies are still stuck at square one. Research estimates these public banks are now financing fossil fuel projects more than the multilateral development banks. Between 2013 and 2015, for instance, these agencies HYPERLINK https://1bps6437gg8c169i0y1drtgz-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.16_FinancingClimateDisaster_final.pdf financed oil and gas Australia's equivalent - Export Finance Australia - is hardly blameless. Between 2009 and 2020, our HYPERLINK https://www.jubileeaustralia.org/resources/publications/hot-money-2021 agency loaned an estimated A$1.5 billion to new coal, oil and gas projects, dwarfing the funding it gave to renewable projects. The pressure is mounting As governments belatedly swing into action, it is likely we will see an end to the historical support given by these banks to highly polluting sectors. In turn, this will hinder corporate efforts to mobilise public and private finance alike. That's not to say there won't be holdouts. At the Glasgow UN climate conference in late 2021, developed countries including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom HYPERLINK committed to ending public funding for "unabated fossil fuel energy". Australia, Japan and South Korea were not among the signatories. Read more: Why banning financing for fossil fuel projects in Africa isn't a climate solution The Glasgow announcement came only a month after the OECD HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/agreement-reached-at-oecd-to-end-export-credit-support-for-unabated-coal-fired-power-plants.htm announced it would end export credit support for coal-fired power plants built without the ability to capture and store carbon dioxide. While important, these steps are nowhere near enough. To date, only the Canadian export credit agency has committed to aligning funding with the goal of net zero by 2050. That means the lending policies of almost all of these agencies remain glaringly inconsistent with Paris Agreement goals and renewed warnings from climate scientists. In a year when unprecedented floodwaters have taken lives and livelihoods up and down Australia's east coast, it is time for governments to revise the mandates of their export credit agencies. They can be a force for good by helping to leverage billions of dollars into clean energy projects, rather than fossil fuel ones. Without government action, it will be left to local communities like the traditional owners in the Northern Territory and environmental organisations to fight uphill battles against these taxpayer funded banks. \</doc>

John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has defended China's participation at the COP26 , saying that China has specifically put forward a willingness to announce a climate action plan that is ambitious. Mr Kerry said the US co-operation agreement with China, one of the most surprising announcements during the fortnight of the climate talks in Glasgow, was "crystal clear" to reduce emissions and create goals, targets and numbers. He hailed the agreement because "we are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade''. The absence of Chinese president Xi Jinping at the leaders' summit during the opening days of COP26 But Mr Kerry said experts from the two countries would now come together and be able to accelerate technology to reduce emissions and the two countries would work together to raise climate ambition this decade. "That's certainty, " he said, adding that China still signed up to the final COP26 Glasgow Pact even with last minute change of wording regarding coal. "China still signed up to the COP decision to phase-down coal and move to accelerate the transition, and announced a specific time frame to commence best efforts, and they say they will accelerate that and do it early," Mr Kerry said. Mr Kerry said the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80 per cent of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He noted that there were nations who had never considered having the word "coal'' in the climate plans, but yet the Glasgow Pact has the phase-down of coal on the books. Mr Kerry was displeased how the wording about coal had been reworked in the final minutes of the conference, but said "you have to phase down coal before you can end coal, so this is the beginning of something. Paris built the arena (in 2015) and Glasgow starts the race and tonight the starting gun was fired, we have nine years to make critical decisions". \</doc>

"I don't want to tell my kids and grandkids later that I was too busy to take action," says Blue Mountains Extinction Rebellion member and Leura resident Rick Madigan of his involvement in the group's recent "pram" protests around the Mountains. "I'm raising my voice for their future now. That's my duty of care." The most recent street action was held in Springwood. It was part of a national campaign to express outrage over what the group says is: "the government's failure to do enough about the climate emergency, particularly their resistance to the global agreements on climate action proposed for COP26 (26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties)". Similar events were also held in Katoomba and Leura through October and more are planned for this month. The activists have been seen pushing empty prams covered in white, they say, "to symbolise the lost life opportunities of younger and future generations". Elsewhere, prams have included images of flames to represent the bushfires and other risks of climate change. The group wants strong global targets set at COP26 , which started in Glasgow on October 31 and runs to November 12.

\~\~ Countries around the world need to urgently scale up deployment of wind power in order to address the climate emergency, according to the Global Wind Coalition for COP26 , which officially launches today on Global Wind Day. \~\~ Logo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1532054/Global_Wind_Energy_Council_Logo.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1532054/Global_Wind_Energy_Council_Logo.jpg \~\~ The world is in a 'make or break' decade for climate action, and it is against this backdrop that the wind sector is intensifying its call for urgent climate action leading up to COP26 in November. Holding the most decarbonisation potential of any renewable energy source, wind power is an indispensable part of the solution to climate change while generating significant socioeconomic benefits. \~\~ But the world is not installing wind power at the pace needed to achieve net zero, and much more needs to be done to unleash its potential. According to recently released roadmap reports on reaching Net Zero by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the world needs to be installing wind power at around 3-4 times the level of 2020, which saw a record 93 GW installed. \~\~ The wind industry's new campaign for COP26 asks governments, companies, and people across the world one critical question: Wind. Are You In? \~\~ "We need to move from talking to action, and work together to massively scale up wind power around the world if we want to get to net zero by 2050. We need to be installing wind energy three to four times the current pace, which means we need governments to urgently raise their ambition, simplify red tape, invest in grid and revamp energy markets," said Ben Backwell, CEO at GWEC. \~\~ "The wind industry has the technology, and there is huge appetite from investors and companies to switch to clean energy, but we need governments to stop holding us back and be all in for wind", he added. \~\~ The record-breaking deployment of global wind energy has been driven by a virtuous cycle of innovation, cost reduction, and increased scale. The result of this immense growth is that wind energy is now a mainstream energy source and has proven to be reliable and affordable while being a sustainable engine for economic growth. \~\~ "Investing in wind power is a win-win for countries to create new local jobs and investment today to power a green recovery, while building more resilient infrastructure and economies for tomorrow. Governments are missing their golden opportunity to achieve their parallel goals of climate action and boosting economies after the COVID-19 crisis if they don't take urgent action to drive wind power growth. We need them to get serious about wind", commented Rebecca Williams, Director of COP26 at GWEC. COP26 , and governments need to use this critical moment to put the world on the right track to achieve net zero. We don't have time left to go on 'business-as-usual' - the climate emergency is already here. Luckily, we already have the solution that can significantly reduce the world's carbon emissions, but we need governments to join us now or risk getting left behind", she added. \~\~ The Global Wind Energy Coalition for COP26 is an initiative led by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), and is a multi-stakeholder group of leading wind power companies and associations from across the globe committed to ramping up wind power capacity to limit the dangerous impacts of climate change.

The goal of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees is no longer likely to be achieved, the latest report of the United Nations chief climate body says, though scientists still believe warming may be stabilised and returned under the Paris Agreement's more ambitious warming target after a period of "overshoot". The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published yesterday, was evidence of a damning "litany of broken promises" and a "file of shame", the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a speech after the release of the report. Mr Guterres, whose language on climate has become increasingly strong since the lead-up to the COP26 Secretary General Guterres criticised Australia as recently as last month as being among a handful of "holdouts" on short-term emission reduction targets. But federal Assistant Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Tim Wilson said the report showed the world should follow Australia's approach. "What we actually need is other countries to follow our lead. While we've committed to net zero by 2050, we've got the UK now asking for wriggle room and backsliding on their commitment. China hasn't even committed to net zero by 2050," Mr Wilson told ABC Radio National yesterday. Other countries should adopt Australia's approach to "technological innovation and deployment", Mr Wilson said. The federal government is committed to its Paris Agreement target to reduce emissions by at least 26 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels of greenhouse pollution, and hit net zero by 2050. It has pledged billions in financial support to expand fossil fuel production under a "gas-fired recovery" to the COVID economic downturn. According to the report's 65-page summary for world governments, its models show that if the world was to hold warming to 1.5 degrees, we would need to have greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025 and have "rapid and deep [greenhouse gas] emissions reductions follow throughout 2030, 2040 and 2050". It says that "without a strengthening of policies beyond those that are implemented by the end of 2020, [greenhouse gas emissions] are projected to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2 degrees". The report shows that if used on current trends the world's existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone would release enough greenhouse gas emissions to drive us past 1.5 degrees. One of the report's lead authors, Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at Australian National University, said that he believed it was no longer "plausible" that the world could take the actions needed to hold warming to 1.5 degrees without overshoot. But he said it was positive news that the report showed the pathways to 2 degrees of warming were open, achievable and readily affordable. This would mean having emissions peak in 2025 and reduce by a quarter by 2030. He said the impacts of 2 degrees were far worse than 1.5 degrees, but that until recent changes in policy around the world and reductions in the cost of renewables, that target appeared out of reach too. "The reference point here is what is realistically achievable," he said. The report showed that policies already adopted were having a significant impact on emissions, but also in protecting ecosystems while helping create new jobs. "[The report] shows that a one-quarter reduction in global emissions would be possible and costs below $US20 dollars ($A27) per tonne. So now we're talking costs that are far below for example, the current European Union emissions trading price," he said. Limiting warming to about 1.5 degrees required global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030; at the same time, methane would also need to be reduced by about a third, the IPCC said in a statement. "Even if we do this, it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century." "It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees," said Jim Skea, co-chair of the IPCC working group that wrote the report. "Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible. " The report is the third part of a series that make up the IPCC's sixth assessment of climate change.

The momentum for companies to tackle climate change is unstoppable and is now a prerequisite for investors, especially after COP26 , according to the Queensland Investment Corporation's head of global infrastructure, Ross Israel. While both major political parties argue about HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/labor-pushed-to-adopt-credible-policies-on-climate-change-20211123-p59bcy increasing their interim emissions reduction targets by 2030 , QIC will on Thursday pledge to accelerate its net zero emissions commitment in $5 billion worth of infrastructure funds it manages for its clients. The decision by QIC is further evidence of companies stepping up their actions to chart a pathway to decarbonise the economy by 2050 following the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) will also invest $72 million with QIC's $3.4 billion Global Infrastructure Fund to help the state-owned company lift its emissions reduction ambitions across its portfolio. Mr Israel said capital and investors had mobilised behind tackling global warming. "They have made it clear. Business wants to make it happen," Mr Israel said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review. "The momentum is huge for investors and now for the market, particularly after COP26 , these things have become very important for new investors. "For us, we've been on a journey to create pathways for each of our portfolio companies. This commitment furthers our objective to proactively prepare for the escalating risks of climate change and to capture the emerging opportunities from decarbonisation." Its new commitments for its Global Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure Portfolio - worth more than $5 billion - include at least a 50 per cent reduction in scope one and scope two carbon emissions by 2030. There is also a commitment to reach net zero in scope three emissions, which include those by end users. Across the two QIC funds that are tackling the net zero commitments, there are 17 assets across six countries. The assets include Port of Melbourne, Brussels airport, Hobart Airport as well as some renewable assets such as Tilt Renewables in Australia and CenTrio in the United States. Mr Israel said there would be a "longer tail" trying to decarbonise some of the asset classes such as shipping and aviation. CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said it was important to take action in difficult-to-abate infrastructure, including "bolt-on" emission reduction opportunities for existing assets as well the acquisition of new assets, including those that have a focus on reducing carbon emissions. Some 70 per cent of Australia's emissions are associated with infrastructure projects. "With assets spanning energy, transport and social infrastructure, the QGIF portfolio provides an exciting opportunity to deliver meaningful action on climate change," he said. "These assets are critical to our economic growth and QGIF is demonstrating how they can play a leading role in our transition to a low-emissions economy." The Ashurst survey found the top three strategies for reaching net zero were to reduce the company's own emissions (57 per cent), acquire carbon offsets (48 per cent) or directly invest in development projects (48 per cent). A total of 72 respondents to the survey said their strategies for the energy transition had changed in the past year. Some 63 per cent of organisations believed their shift in investing in traditional energy sources, such as coal, gas and oil, to renewable technologies would accelerate in the next 12 months. While hydrogen was the buzz word at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the survey found company investors interest in hydrogen had slowed in the past year as it was seen in the early stages of development. "Respondents' sentiment that the technology will take longer to mature reflects the current cost estimates for hydrogen which are not yet economically competitive," the Ashurst report found. "There is also lack of clarity about how quickly domestic and international demand for hydrogen - whether as ammonia or liquified - will emerge." Ashurst said it had seen some private groups beginning to invest larger amounts in hydrogen-related businesses which is expected to increase as government regulation and support becomes clearer. \</doc>

\~\~Climate modelling underpinning Australia's path to net-zero emissions by 2050 will be released before parliament resumes later in the month, according to the prime minister. \~\~ Scott Morrison said the long-awaited modelling would be unveiled before MPs return to Canberra for the next sitting session, which begins on November 22. \~\~ "(The modelling will be released) before we get back to parliament. We will see it soon," he told the Nine Network on Thursday. \~\~ The prime minister has been under pressure to release the modelling and had not previously committed to a time frame. \~\~ It comes as Australia became one of a handful of countries trying to water down a draft decision made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit urging nations to strengthen 2030 emissions reduction targets. \~\~ The draft had asked countries to revisit their 2030 targets by the end of next year. \~\~ Meanwhile, the US and China made a surprise announcement at COP26 to work together to reduce emissions and accelerate the phasing out of coal. \~\~ Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the announcement was welcome news, despite China being one of Australia's largest markets for coal. \~\~ "It's great to see both of them committing to his action and we will look forward to seeing the detail around what it proposes," Mr Tehan told ABC Radio. \~\~ "We understand the world is moving and transitioning." \~\~ While the draft communique out of the climate summit was urging stronger action on 2030 targets, Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia was on track to reduce emissions. \~\~ "Australia is an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26 ," Mr Taylor said in a statement. \~\~ "Australia is projected to reduce emissions by 35 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels, or up to 38 per cent point-in-time reduction in 2030." \~\~ The prime minister on Wednesday unveiled plans for a $1 billion fund to back low emissions technology. \~\~ The fund, partly backed by private investment, would aim to back technology such as carbon capture and storage. \~\~ However, legislation to set up the fund needs the support of crossbenchers to pass parliament, with some government MPs indicating they will cross the floor on the matter. \~\~ "It's important that we do it and Labor should support it," Mr Morrison said on Thursday. \~\~ "This is an important technology .... these are the technologies that will get you to net-zero by 2050." \</doc>

Australia will have to strengthen its 2030 targets on carbon emission by the end of next year if the first draft of the Glasgow COP26 agreement is approved in the coming days. The first official draft, a seven-page document of technical commitments, was released by the United Nations climate summit on Wednesday and will form the basis of tense negotiations in the coming days. The key point that affects Australia urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". It is clearly directed at countries such as Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh plans on the table by the end of next year, which, for Australia, falls after the federal election. Australia had come into the COP26 meeting with a new net-zero commitment for 2050, but had kept its more immediate plans for 2030 the same: pledging reductions of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. These commitments were well below those of other developed nations. The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fight to keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set time frames or specific targets. Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia should be judged on action and outcomes. He stressed that Australia was projected to reduce emissions by a greater amount than the target: 35 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels. Between 2005 and 2021, Australia's emissions fell by 20.8 per cent, and he pointed out that this outpaced the reductions of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and every other major commodity exporting nation. COP26 which highlighted our strong record of achievement," Mr Taylor said. "While ambition is important, action and outcomes are what matters." Once Canberra has analysed and responded to the draft - like the near 200 COP member countries - specific emphasis and wor-ding can change and the final "cover statement" could be -watered down. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has returned to the COP26 summit in Glasgow to urge nations to "pull out all the stops" as the final negotiations begin. The UN wants to keep countries on track to try to prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4C higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels. The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century. Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally -determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to finetune their pre-2030 ambitions. Money for developing countries to try to mitigate climate change is to go beyond the current target of $US100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025. India had asked that there be $US1 trillion a year support for -developing countries. The draft says that developed countries are to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to -developing countries. \</doc>

Business and industry say the Morrison government needs to set a stronger HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/pm-s-plan-for-net-zero-emissions-fails-to-win-over-afr-readers-20211101-p594xt 2030 emissions reduction target While Prime Minister Scott Morrison and federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor might have been hoping to draw a line under the issue following the end of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, business is keen to keep the pressure on the federal government to move towards a low-emissions economy. In a further sign climate policy will be a key battleground in next year's federal election, former Dow Chemical boss Andrew Liveris has called on the Morrison government to set stronger interim targets on the way to 2050. It comes as Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said more work needed to be done on Australia's climate targets. Mr Liveris said he considered the COP26 summit in Glasgow to have been a "mild success". While China and India were criticised for HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/pm-won-t-budge-on-2030-target-despite-cop26-deal-20211114-p598qi watering down the final text relating to the "phasing out" of coal , Mr Liveris said the business presence at the summit showed companies were working to deliver the technology solutions to shift away from fossil fuels. "We have to set some meaningful short-term targets for 2030 and business will align very quickly," he said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review following a presentation to the UBS Australasia conference about the possibilities for business in the pathway to a low-emissions economy. "Business is tired of it and are going to go for it. Businesses are going to set internal books because they have to play global markets. "If business takes the bit between its teeth post-Glasgow and starts to lean in and focuses on the half a dozen technologies [including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage] then this will create wealth and jobs like no other decade." Assuming a Coalition win Mr Liveris said he was not surprised the Coalition government had backed away from setting stronger 2030 targets, but expected that after the federal election that is due by May, Australia would go to HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/egypt-host-cop27-international-climate-conference-2022-ministry-2021-11-11/ next year's COP meeting in Egypt "As the new year turns into the election cycle, whoever wins - and I assume it's a Coalition win - I think it's time to go back to Egypt with firmer targets for 2030." The Morrison government used the COP26 summit in Glasgow to reaffirm its commitment to 26 per cent to 28 per cent emission reductions on 2005 levels by 2030, but predicted it could be as high as 30 per cent to 35 per cent by the end of the decade. Ms Westacott - whose organisation had called for emissions reduction targets of 46 to 50 per cent by 2030 - said the COP26 summit showed momentum was continuing to build towards net zero. "The practical approach adopted means commitments are more likely to be delivered. Crucially, the Glasgow conference has set the scene for further negotiations on interim targets in Egypt next year," she said. "The government has rightly committed to net zero emissions, not because of a global conference but because it is in our national interests. Our trading partners are demanding greener products and businesses are acting now to decarbonise rapidly, stay competitive and to keep and create jobs in Australia." Woodside Petroleum chief executive Meg O'Neill said the stated commitments from COP26 would still leave the globe warming, but "it's a significant improvement over where we've been in the past". "I think the world has greater visibility of the sorts of commitments that move the needle in terms of decarbonisation. So it's positive to see movement in that space," she said. AGL Energy chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said he was "astonished" the United States and China found common ground on climate policy. "I think the final declaration when it switched from phase-out to phase-down, somehow brought in by the Chinese and by the Indians, was a small, small compromise which needed to be done," he said. "But in general it's a clear sign of where the energy industry, in particular the carbon-heavy industry has to go. And we are fully committed along these lines, as AGL Energy has shown." The special adviser to the Morrison government on low emissions technology and former chief scientist Alan Finkel admitted there were not many "verifiable actions" from COP26 but it did a good job of raising awareness about the issues. "The solution to reducing emissions is providing alternatives. I don't believe that anything in the Glasgow pact will dramatically reduce demand for coal just by asking countries to reduce their needs, you have to provide alternatives." A portfolio of options Mr Liveris, a key business adviser to the federal government on its gas-led recovery, said gas would play a crucial role in the transition to low-emissions technologies. "Gas is crucial. We can't be base and firming power off renewables. We will one day, I hope, that's what we're working on," he said. "I'm a supporter of gas as a bridge, or we are going to lose all our gas-based industries". Mr Liveris said hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technologies will be crucial to help the world reach net zero by 2050. "Infinite resources eventually crack the goal. Is it technologically possible? The answer is yes. Is it technologically possible as the only solution, the answer is no. It's a portfolio of options," he said. Mr Liveris used his speech to the UBS conference to renew his calls for HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/only-nuclear-lets-australia-have-it-all-in-clean-energy-policy-20211017-p590py a nuclear power industry in Australia , including repurposing old coal-fired power stations, as well as setting a carbon price to help with the transition to net zero by 2050. Last week the Morrison government released its HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-will-have-a-coal-and-gas-economy-beyond-2050-20211112-p598j5 modelling for net zero But Mr Liveris said he found Australian boardrooms to be "risk averse" with tackling climate change.

Scott Morrison will touch down in Glasgow on Monday ahead of the all-important United Nations Climate Conference and tell world leaders that developed nations cannot carry the burden of combating climate change alone. Mr Morrison said that just like vaccinating the whole world against COVID-19, emissions reduction needed a global effort. "The biggest technological changes of our lifetime - smartphones, microchips, analogue to digital, the COVID-19 vaccine, just to name a few, all provide a lesson as to where we must now focus our attention as we address the real challenge of climate change," he said. "Any solution on climate change that is geared only to developed countries does not solve climate change." Mr Morrison said developing countries must be empowered to "industrialise and lift their incomes and standard of living in a new decarbonised energy economy" and the task cannot be "seen through the prism of the developed world". Mr Morrison will spend a whirlwind 48 hours in Glasgow at the COP26 conference, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Last month, during a flight home from the US, he indicated to The West Australian he may not attend the important talks. The COP26 conference will attempt to ramp up targets on climate action for 2030 and ensure the world is on the same page when it comes to hitting net zero emissions by 2050. Mr Morrison will address world leaders on day one of the summit. He will host a round table of business leaders connected to Australia, including Fortescue Metals Group boss Andrew Forrest and Rio Tinto global chief executive Jakob Stausholm. And Mr Morrison will meet Pacific leaders including Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. Pacific leaders want to ensure their regional partner Australia is doing enough to protect their environments which are most at risk from rising sea levels and global warming. Mr Morrison will tell leaders at his address that having conferences such as COP26 will not provide the answers to reduced global emissions. "We've got to get past the why, the if, and the when if we are really going to tackle climate change, and get to the how," he will say. "Those outcomes will not be found by those of us sitting in this room, but our scientists, technologists, researchers, entrepreneurs and financiers. "They're the same types of people who developed the COVID-19 vaccines." Mr Morrison's attendance at COP26 came as new modelling from EY released on Monday found 64 per cent of Australia's Gross Domestic Product, the value of all goods and services within the economy, was exposed by moving towards net zero emissions by 2050. It said investment in new technologies, commercialising research and maximising advantages in clean and new energy sources was crucial to offset industries - such as the resources sector - that contributed to GDP through exports. \</doc>

Scott Morrison says Australia's coal industry will remain strong for decades under climate policies that protect the nation's economic interests, slapping down Boris Johnson's claim that the COP26 pact sounded a "death knell" for coal power. Facing pressure from Nationals MPs to protect coal exports and moderate Liberal MPs who want a 2035 emissions-reduction target, Mr Morrison said he would not "make rural and regional Australians pay" for the country's net- zero emissions by 2050 target. The Prime Minister also -refused to commit to a new 2030 emissions-reduction target, despite the Glasgow climate pact urging countries to outline greater ambition before the COP27 summit in Egypt next year. Speaking in the marginal western Sydney seat of Lindsay on Monday, Mr Morrison said Australians employed by the coal sector would "continue to be working in that industry for -decades to come" because the transition to new low-emissions technologies would happen over a long time. After India and China successfully changed the final COP26 text from "phase out" to "phase down" coal, Mr Morrison said he would not apologise for "Australia standing up for our national interests". "Whether they be our security interests or our economic interests. We're going to do this in a balanced way focusing on the technological advances that we know will actually see us solve this problem," he said. "We're not going to tax Australians to do that. We're not going to legislate them, and regulate them and force them to do things." Mr Johnson, a close ally of Mr Morrison, on Monday said the COP26 climate pact was a "game-changing agreement" that sounded the "death knell for coal power". Adani Australia chief executive Lucas Dow said "coal cannot simply be wished out of the -energy mix". "Developing nations in our -region will require a mix of energy sources and technologies, including coal generation, to meet their economic and social aspirations and challenges," Mr Dow said. The Adani coalmine emerged as a key issue at the 2019 election, with the Coalition's support for the project credited with holding seats in central Queensland. Mr Dow said "removing Australian coal from the global seaborne market will only see other jurisdictions with more inferior quality coals, and less stringent environmental regulations fill the gap". OECD secretary-general -Mathias Cormann said Australia must deliver a "steeper" cut in emissions across the economy to ensure it meets its net-zero goals. Mr Cormann, the nation's longest serving finance minister, said it was integral for Australia's economy to emerge from the pandemic with a strong focus on net-zero alignment. "Ensuring the economic recovery is consistent with a path to net-zero emissions by 2050. Emissions will need to continue to decline and on a steeper trajectory right across the economy," Mr Cormann told the UBS Australasia conference on Monday. He said greater international co-ordination was needed to -ensure ambitious action on climate change is pursued "in a way that is both effective and fair", with emissions not shifted from one part of the world to another. With Mr Morrison refusing to budge on Australia's 2030 pledge to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent under 2005 levels, moderate Liberal MPs led by Dave Sharma and Jason Falinski called for a 2035 target. Mr Sharma said a 2035 emissions reduction target of between 40-45 per cent was achievable, given Australia's performance to date and the uptake of low-emissions technologies. "It's a modest stretch but it's not a big stretch. If we're serious about reducing our emissions, we need to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels," Mr Sharma said. Mr Morrison, who has not ruled out a more ambitious target after next year's election, said while the government was "happy to see emissions reduce" he would not "tell Australians what to do through climate policy". "All that happened at COP26 was all countries noted a request to revisit these things. But I've been very clear about what our target is and that we will meet and beat it. We are going to achieve a 35 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. That's what we're going to achieve and that's what actually matters," he said. Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who led the Coalition's pro-Adani campaign, said he opposed changes to existing medium-term targets. "I hope we don't reduce our emissions by more than 26 per cent because I think we should focus on bringing manufacturing jobs back to Australia first. All the evidence shows that the lower our carbon emissions go the more manufacturing jobs we lose," Senator Canavan said. Former Dow Chemicals chief executive Andrew Liveris, who promoted the government's "gas-led recovery" as Covid-19 Commission special adviser, said Australia should set a carbon price of -between $US40 to $US80 a tonne. Vicki Treadell, the British high commissioner to Australia, said COP26 locked in "the trajectory for unabated coal power" and every nation must make a judgment on balancing economic interests with the "wellbeing of the planet". "All the countries who have committed to net zero by 2050 to switching over the next 20 to 30 years to renewable energy and phasing down, if you prefer that language, coal," Ms Treadell said. "That's the reality of the next 30 to 40 years that we're facing and in that time it is about the investment in the new technology and the new industries and the huge opportunity for Australia as a net exporter of renewable energy and the materials that we will need." Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce distanced the Nationals from the Glasgow climate pact on Monday, claiming the country party did not sign up to the COP26 agreement. Pushing back against changes to the 2030 target, Mr Joyce said while Britain and other leading economies discussed fossil fuels they were "very unwilling \'e2\€ \£6 to talk about theirs". "Other countries with less to lose than Australia can be more righteous, but we have to actually balance the books, pay for everything from the ABC to pensions," Mr Joyce said.

Australians strongly back policies to increase clean energy use and protect natural ecosystems but are more cautious on committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, new polling suggests. The survey by JWS Research following the Glasgow climate conference last month found while most adults were aware of the COP26 summit, barely one in 10 followed it closely. The poll of more than 1000 people found nearly three quarters of respondents were concerned about climate change, with almost half of respondents declaring they were extremely or very concerned. Under pressure from key allies and capital markets seeking investment certainty, Scott Morrison adopted a net-zero emissions by 2050 target in the lead-up to the Glasgow climate conference. But as the battle lines are drawn ahead of a 2022 election, the Prime Minister is preparing to attack Labor's 43 per cent emissions cut by 2030, arguing it will cost jobs and destroy regional economies. The majority of those surveyed agreed that Australia should be addressing global warming by working to limit the average temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and committing to reduce carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. Despite limited knowledge about the issue of net-zero emissions, 53 per cent supported the Coalition's commitment to achieve the target of net-zero emissions by the year 2050, including 30 per cent who strongly support this goal. The majority of those polled were aware of net-zero emissions but their knowledge was limited and "lowest" among 18-34s and women. "Support for achieving net-zero emissions is even higher among those who know at least a little about this issue (65 per cent, including 41 per cent strong support)," JWS said. "Knowledge about net-zero emissions is significantly higher among those aged 55 years and over, and lower among 18 to 34 year olds, who are also less likely to support committing to the 2050 target." The survey showed that awareness of COP26 was highest among those aged 55 years and over, and this group was most likely to claim to know a lot about it. More than six in 10 of those surveyed agreed Australia should be taking measures to reduce emissions such as protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity (69 per cent), developing and deploying technologies (64 per cent) and adopting policies to transition towards low-emission energies (62 per cent). \</doc>

Young people HYPERLINK https://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/presscenter/articles/2019/climate-change-in-asia-and-the-pacific.html in our region will endure an increase in severe weather events, a rise in food insecurity, challenges to their health from poorer air quality and pollution, and the impact of species' extinction and biodiversity change. In the face of these challenges, education for all young people is crucial. But in particular, education, empowerment and leadership of girls and young women is the key to climate resilience. HYPERLINK https://drawdown.org/solutions/health-and-education global research project shores up resilience and equips girls and women to face the impacts of climate change. They can be more effective stewards of food, soil, trees, and water, even as nature's cycles change. Education for girls can be a pathway for fighting the climate crisis in three key ways:   education in both the sciences and social sciences is necessary to address climate change. Girls' participation in these fields will drive innovation in green technologies as well as a social approach to resilience built on equality formal education can build on women and girls' existing community-based knowledge regarding disaster risk reduction and help them respond to climate emergencies education creates pathways to more independent decision-making for women and girls around work, family planning and community engagement. It also creates opportunities for leadership and participation in formal decision-making. Girls and young women are already leading the way in climate responses in the region. For example, 17-year-old Anjali Sharma led a HYPERLINK landmark class action Read more: These Aussie teens have launched a landmark climate case against the government.

By prioritising girls' education in its funding and partnerships for regional development, Australia can promote gender equitable climate leadership. Political leaders have a responsibility not only to engage and respond to young people, but also to build their capacity to face climate change, now and in the future. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Betty Barkha is currently the co-chair of the International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) and serves as an advisor to FRIDA Young Feminist Fund and the Global Resilience Fund.

The war in Ukraine has resulted in many of the world's biggest companies deciding to stop doing business with Russia. McDonald's, IKEA, Apple are HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/from-netflix-to-samsung-the-exodus-from-russia-becomes-a-rout just some of the well known corporations making a stand. But why have they done this? After all, a famous rule of economics HYPERLINK https://hbr.org/2012/04/you-might-disagree-with-milton#:%7E:text=There%20is%20one%20and%20only%20one%20social%20responsibility,open%20and%20free%20competition%20without%20deception%20or%20fraud states that the social responsibility of business is to "increase its profits". Surely by closing themselves off from such a large country, these companies will take a financial hit? Perhaps then, the social role of business has changed, and the professional duty to maximise shareholders' interests and keep businesses growing is no longer all encompassing. After all, the leaders of these large organisations are also citizens of the world; moral beings who want to do the right thing. And employees who feel anguish over the images coming from Ukraine will also expect their bosses to respond appropriately. Of course, we could also interpret such a "moral stance" as having no altruistic motivation whatsoever. Withdrawing from the Russian market may be nothing more than an attempt to minimise potential damage to a company's global reputation and brand - particularly if they are seen as being out of step with a competitor. For, as the Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith HYPERLINK https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/68664-it-is-not-from-the-benevolence-of-the-butcher-the proclaimed back in 1776: "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest." According to this view, the purpose of supplying what a customer needs is no more (or less) than an exchange process designed to generate profit. But there is an alternative explanation for McDonald's, Starbucks and the rest closing their outlets in Russia - something called "enlightened self-interest". This is where acting to enhance the interests of others will eventually benefit your own interests. Put simply, it means a business doing well by doing good. I am part of a HYPERLINK https://www.purpose.gooddividends.com/ research group examining this approach, with the aim of showing how a sense of responsibility and purpose can be both financially profitable and also generate what we refer to as " HYPERLINK https://www.routledge.com/Good-Dividends-Responsible-Leadership-of-Business-Purpose/Kempster-Maak-Parry/p/book/9780367497354 good dividends " - developing a new theory of business which integrates profit, people and the planet. This does not mean the idea of acting solely in the interest of shareholders is dead. But we are in a very different context now. Corporations are involved in climate change conferences like COP26 ; they respond to sustainable development goals set by the UN; they invest in and report on their environmental and social responsibilities. We have found that a developing moral awareness from corporate decision makers is helping to undo a traditional "us and them" HYPERLINK form of leadership which is being replaced with a sense of "us with them". Businesses of all sizes and in all sectors - coffee sales, metal manufacture, house building, public relations - are raising the value of their business while making a positive social impact at the same time. Profit and power Decisions about doing business in Russia show how this works at a global level, where many corporations are as large as countries. Indeed, comparing the value of the largest companies (revenue) to countries (GDP), 150 out of the 200 HYPERLINK https://www.accountancydaily.co/corporations-dominate-worlds-top-100-economic-entities richest global entities The US retail giant Walmart is wealthier than Australia. The "economies" of Shell and Toyota are each larger than those of Mexico or Sweden or Russia. So alongside a country's political sanctions, many large companies have the financial muscle with which to make an impact; when they walk away from doing business with a country, the citizens (and politicians) of that country cannot fail to notice. This is why I'm inclined to see corporate actions against Russia as more than just good PR. Business leaders are not immune from society's concerns, and nor do many of them want to be. So maybe the business world has turned an important page, and the stand it is taking is evidence of a new way of understanding its purpose and role in society. For away from the horrors of Ukraine, there are many issues - climate change, poverty, oppression - which demand the business world's urgent attention. Perhaps future generations will point to the early 2020s as a time when the relationship between business and society fundamentally changed. For humanity's sake, let's hope so.

A DIPLOMATIC investigation is under way after two police security cars crashed as Australia's high commissioner to London, George Brandis, tried to catch up to and join the Prime Minister's official motorcade at the Glasgow COP26 climate summit. The minor bingle left two cop cars badly dinged and Mr Brandis red faced with an official London Metropolitan Police report completed into the incident and a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade investigation ongoing. It can be revealed Mr Brandis, being driven in his diplomatic vehicle, was trying to catch up with Scott Morrison's official motorcade on his final day at the summit in November, en route to a stakeholder breakfast. A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said it does not comment on "security matters" but an official report into the incident seen by The Advertiser confirmed the chain of events. As Mr Brandis's official car tried to join the motorcade the police officers realised the car had Australian diplomatic plates and was not a security threat. "George was late and was telling his driver to hurry up and catch up with the motorcade," a diplomatic source told The Advertiser. "One of the police cars then braked causing the other to crash into it. No one was injured but it was highly embarrassing for the commissioner." Mr Morrison was on his way to a breakfast meeting with representatives of some of Australia's biggest energy companies including Fortescue Future Industries, Rio Tinto and Santos. Mr Brandis had originally been slated to travel by bus with the staff to the breakfast meeting where he was due to make the opening remarks and introduce Mr Morrison. Instead he ordered his official car to come to the hotel to take him. By the time it arrived he was late and to catch up it is understood he ordered his driver to try and join the official motorcade, which are reserved for heads of government. Clearing up the bingle by the Scottish roadside meant Mr Brandis's seat at the business breakfast table remained conspicuously empty. An Australian official had to step in and make the opening -remarks introducing the PM. "George finally arrived at the breakfast looking very sheepish indeed," the source said. Mr Brandis, 64, is a lawyer and former attorney-general who courted controversy during his time in parliament for spending $15,000 of taxpayer money on custom-built bookshelves for his parliamentary office. An earlier shelf that cost $7000 was too big to move. The Advertiser submitted a series of questions to Mr Brandis including whether Australia would be paying for the damage to two Metropolitan Police cars, why he did not want to travel on the bus and why he was unable to inform security teams that he was trying to join them. A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman said: "DFAT is aware of an incident involving a convoy for Australian official vehicles during COP26 . "Nobody was injured in the incident and no Australian vehicle was damaged," he said. "DFAT is investigating the incident in accordance with the secretary's work, health and safety responsibilities." \</doc>

The jury has reached a verdict. And it is damning. This report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unlivable world. We are on a fast track to climate disaster: Major cities underwater. Unprecedented heatwaves.Terrifying storms. Widespread water shortages. The extinction of a million species of plants and animals. This is not fiction or exaggeration. It is what science tells us will result from our current energy policies. We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris. Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic. This is a climate emergency. Climate scientists warn that we are already perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate impacts. They are choking our planet, based on their vested interests and historic investments in fossil fuels, when cheaper, renewable solutions provide green jobs, energy security, and greater price stability.We left COP26 in Glasgow with a na\'efve optimism, based on new promises and commitments.But the main problem - the enormous, growing emissions gap - was all but ignored. The science is clear. To keep the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45 per cent this decade. But current climate pledges would mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises. Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. Such investments will soon be stranded assets - a blot on the landscape, and a blight on investment portfolios. But it doesn't have to be this way. Today's report is focused on mitigation - cutting emissions.It sets out viable, financially sound options in every sector that can keep the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees alive. First and foremost, we must triple the speed of the shift to renewable energy. That means moving investments and subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables - now. In most cases, renewables are already far cheaper. It means governments ending the funding of coal, not just abroad, but at home. It means climate coalitions, made up of developed countries, multilateral development banks, private financial institutions, and corporations, supporting major emerging economies in making this shift. It means protecting forests and ecosystems as powerful climate solutions. It means rapid progress in reducing methane emissions. And it means implementing the pledges made in Paris and Glasgow. Leaders must lead.But all of us can do our part. We owe a debt to young people, civil society and indigenous communities for sounding the alarm and holding leaders accountable. We need to build on their work to create a grassroots movement that cannot be ignored. If you live in a big city, a rural area, or a small island state; if you invest in the stock market; if you care about justice, and our children's future; I am appealing directly to you: demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale. Demand an end to coal-fired power. Demand an end to all fossil-fuel subsidies. Today's report comes at a time of global turbulence. Inequalities are at unprecedented levels. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is scandalously uneven. Inflation is rising, and the war in Ukraine is causing food and energy prices to skyrocket. But increasing fossil fuel production will only make matters worse. Choices made by countries now will make or break the commitment to 1.5 degrees. A shift to renewables will mend our broken global energy mix and offer hope to millions of people suffering climate impacts today. Climate promises and plans must be turned into reality and action - now. It is time to stop burning our planet, and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.

CLIMATE change has been rated the fourth most important issue overall by Australian voters, while a majority say they would be happy to pay extra each year to help fight it. And of the 54 per cent in support, half said they would be prepared to commit up to $300 annually. However a hefty minority - 46 per cent - said they did not want to pay anything at all. COP26 conference in Glasgow. But ANU political scientist Dr Jill Sheppard (inset) said claims this would be a "climate change election" should be treated with scepticism. "As much as we can walk and chew gum in everyday life, when we turn up at the ballot box, usually what we're thinking about is which party we feel closest to generally, which leader we prefer, and who feels the most competent in terms of economic management," Dr Sheppard said. "Those other considerations like climate change \'e2\€ \£6 are not forefront for most voters." Dr Sheppard said she was surprised by the proportion of survey respondents who admitted they didn't want to pay anything extra to tackle climate change, as people were frequently susceptible to virtue signalling in such situations. Macquarie University climate policy expert Dr Jonathan Symons said the YouGov poll "reflects a long-term trend where Australian voters are viewing climate change as an increasingly important issue". He said while younger voters felt the most strongly, concern was rising among all age groups. \</doc>

GLASGOW SWEDISH campaigner Greta Thunberg branded the UN climate summit in Glasgow a "failure" during a mass protest in the Scottish city demanding swifter action from leaders. Ms Thunberg said pledges from some nations made during COP26 amounted to little more than "a two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah". "It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure," she told the crowd of thousands. "This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival." Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C. The first week of talks saw countries announce plans to phase out coal use and to end foreign fossil fuel funding, but there were few details on how they plan the mass decarbonisation that scientists say is needed. "They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us," Ms Thunberg said. Two days of demonstrations are planned by activist groups to highlight the disconnect between the glacial pace of emissions reductions and the climate emergency already swamping countries across the world. \</doc>

FULL TEXT During the much-anticipated COP26 meetings in Glasgow, there will be one necessary climate solution missing from discussions: reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by transforming our economic model. Instead there will be talk of, and reliance on, risky yet-to-be-proven-at-the-scale-required technologies and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/16/half-of-emissions-cuts-will-come-from-future-tech-says-john-kerry technologies that have not been invented that can save us from the emissions we continue to create in the name of economic growth. There will also be talk of the wonderful "green growth" that investment in renewable energy can generate. Anything, as long as there is growth. Yet this much-prized economic growth is a key reason why we have HYPERLINK https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-011104#_i26 released more GHG emissions HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/news/global-electricity-demand-is-growing-faster-than-renewables-driving-strong-increase-in-generation-from-fossil-fuels#:~:text=New%20IEA%20report%20sees%205%25%20rise%20in%20electricity,the%20power%20sector%20to%20record%20levels%20in%202022 International Energy Agency This will take emissions from the electricity sector to an all-time high. Not only is economic growth a key cause of our GHG emissions, it's also hampering our ability to reduce GHG emissions in line with HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ science-based targets HYPERLINK https://mronline.org/2019/08/30/degrowth-a-theory-of-radical-abundance/ deploying renewable energy HYPERLINK https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2021/06/growing-pains sums it up nicely when he says growth keeps outstripping our best efforts to decarbonise.

Hickel is not alone in his concern. In November 2019, more than 11,000 scientists declared a HYPERLINK https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/1/8/5610806 climate emergency , and advised: Our goals need to shift from GDP growth and the pursuit of affluence toward sustaining ecosystems and improving human well-being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality. More recently https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/parisi/facts/ Giorgio Parisi , 2021 physics Nobel Prize laureate, echoed similar sentiments at a pre- COP26 meeting of parliamentarians earlier this month. HYPERLINK https://www-italy24news-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.italy24news.com/local/amp/216311 He advised : The gross domestic product of individual countries is the basis of political decisions, and the mission of governments seems to be to increase GDP as much as possible, an objective that is in profound contrast with the arrest of climate change ... If gross national product remains the center of attention, our future will be grim. But don't we need GDP growth to improve our lives? In short, no. Since the 1970s, increases in GDP have, on average, failed to translate into increases in HYPERLINK well-being and happiness. It is entirely possible to live happy, healthy lives within smaller economies. HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy Robert F Kennedy eloquently summed up the inadequacy of GDP as a metric of well-being in a speech in 1968: The gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.

Societies may decide to instigate rapid and radical changes in their emissions at rates and in ways incompatible with the Zeitgeist, or climate change will impose sufficiently chaotic impacts that are also beyond the stability of the Zeitgeist. The economy is a construct of human agency -- it can, and should, be changed because the laws of nature are not negotiable. Leaders should treat the climate crisis with the urgency it deserves and implement policies to immediately reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring that the well-being of people and the planet are prioritised, over and above the impact on GDP. \</doc>

The COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, is in danger of not producing any meaningful outcome. Leaders at the summit say climate change is a serious issue with potentially drastic consequences for all humanity. Yet some of the optics emerging from Glasgow appear at odds with their stated goals. It can be hard to believe, even a country such as the United States, which talks the climate change talk, is taking it seriously when the President sweeps into Glasgow at the head of a 20-car entourage. How's them emissions? Then we have the private jets. Almost 400 political and business leaders made the journey to Scotland by private jet. It is estimated the jets would have added another 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide to the global atmosphere. It's also a bad look when US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appear to fall asleep during the conference. But of more pressing concern, and a bigger reason, why COP26 may not deliver on expectations, is the absence of China and Russia. China is the world's biggest polluter, accounting for about 30 per cent of global emissions, yet its president Xi Jinping declined to make the journey to Glasgow. China's commitment is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060, a decade later than the target being pushed at COP26 . Another major polluter, India, has pushed its net zero target to 2070. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has now committed to net-zero by 2050 with a tech, not a tax, plan but in the national interest he has resisted suggestions to make deeper cuts by 2030 as well as global deadlines to phase out coal. Leaders failed to deliver any strong climate action at the G20 in Rome, Glasgow is now troubled and the ability of the West to assert itself on the world after decades in the ascendancy is in doubt.

Boris Johnson has told world leaders to "pick up the phone and give negotiators the space to manoeuvre'' and agree to the most ambitious COP26 statement possible. In a veiled criticism of Australia, as well as other nations like China, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia who have been less than forthcoming in agreeing to urgent new 2030 targets, the British Prime Minister said some countries were "conspicuously patting themselves on the back" for signing up to the Paris climate accord but doing too little at Glasgow to improve their offer. Negotiators from 197 countries are currently debating the wording and emphasis of the "cover statement' to be delivered at the end of COP26 , possibly on Friday evening or over the weekend. In the first draft, the seven-page document urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". The request for new targets are aimed at countries like Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh short term plans on the table by the end of next year, which for Australia, falls after the general election. The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fiercely try and keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set any time frames or specific targets on this point. Australia, like the United States, has refused to sign up to a pledge to phase out coal mining. Australia's position is to continue to export coal and that the wind down of coal-fired power generation will develop over time. Federal politicians have reassured Australians that the lights won't go out. Australia also bypassed another big push at COP26 , the pledge to cut methane gases. Mr Johnson returned to Glasgow by train on Wednesday to build momentum for the consensus cover document and said: "Here in Glasgow the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change, and it's the greatest gift we can possibly bestow on our children and our grandchildren and generations unborn''. He added: "We just need to reach out together and grasp it. And so my question to my fellow world leaders this afternoon as we enter the last hours of COP is - will you help us do that, will you help us graph that opportunity, or will you stand in the way?" Mr Johnson said the world knows what a mess our planet is in and people will "find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver". He warned the the backlash from people "will be immense and it will be long-lasting'', adding, "frankly we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium. Because we know what needs to be done, and we all agree what needs to be done. We just need the courage, actually, to get on and do it." The draft text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5 \'b0C by 2100 requires "rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions", including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century. On Thursday the COP created an International Aviation Climate Ambition Coalition to reduce emissions from global air travel. Twenty countries, including the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Norway, France and Japan signed up to the coalition. Australia didn't sign. COP26 deal to put Australia in the gun Australia will have to revisit and strengthen its carbon emission 2030 targets by the end of next year if the first draft of the Glasgow COP26 agreement is approved in the coming days. The first official draft, a seven-page document of technical commitments, was released by the United Nations Climate summit on Wednesday and will form the basis of tense negotiations in the coming days. The key point that affects Australia urges parties to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022". It is clearly directed at countries such as Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh plans on the table by the end of next year, which, for Australia, falls after the general election. Australia had come into the COP with a new net zero commitment for 2050, but had kept its more immediate plans for 2030 the same: pledging reductions of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. These commitments were well below those of other developed nations. The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fight to keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set time frames or specific targets. COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations for a final push to "pull out all the stops" as the final negotiations begin. Energy Minister Angus Taylor has made it clear that the government is supportive of coal and fossil fuels and blue hydrogen - using hydrogen from fossil fuels - as well as renewable energy. Once Canberra has analysed and responded to the draft - like the near 200 COP member countries - specific emphasis and wor\£dding can change and the final "cover statement", could be watered down. The UN wants to keep countries on track to try and prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels. The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century. Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to fine tune their pre-2030 ambitions. Money for developing countries to try and mitigate climate change and make them more resilient is to go beyond the current target of $100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025. India had asked that there be $1 trillion a year support for developing countries. The draft says that developed countries are to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries. \</doc>

As COP26 The heavy rainfalls recorded in areas of South Australia, Victoria and NSW over the past fortnight totally undermine former Australian of the Year and Climate Council chief Tim Flannery's 2005 predictions that drought conditions would become "permanent in eastern Australia" and that "the rain that comes won't fill our dams". On Saturday, WaterNSW's website showed Sydney's main dam, Warragamba, was filled to 97.8 per cent of capacity and the dams in the greater Sydney catchment were at 94.6 per cent. The palaeontologist is still regarded as something of a guru by the unthinking fully paid-up members of the climate cult however, and he and the left-wing Climate Council are go-to commentators on the COP talks for the ABC and the Nine media. Last month, Peter FitzSimons, ignored the evidence and asked Flannery whether he felt "tragically vindicated". "Most sensible people will now concede you were right on warning of the dangers of climate change and the denialists were wrong" said the author, best known for the red bandana he used to wear to distinguish himself from the rest of the bizarrely garbed activists. In reality, no sensible person could concede that any of Flannery's doomsday predictions about climate change had any validity. Glasgow's COP26 brought out the false prophets by the thousands and the Nine media and "our" ABC couldn't get enough of them. Outgoing Radio National activist Fran Kelly conducted a long and sympathetic interview with Simon Kofe, Tuvalu's foreign minister, who had presented a video address to the Glasgow gabfest from a podium where he stood knee-deep in the waters of the Pacific. Promoting the notion that Tuvalu is sinking because of global warming has been a constant theme of the Pacific nations' attempts to blackmail the West to send more cash to their leaders, even though the ABC's own (rarely used) fact-check department found in December 2018 that Tuvalu's total land area grew by 2.9 per cent in the four decades to 2014. Kelly didn't mention her own organisation's findings during her sharing-caring luvvy discussion. Instead, she focused on how much money would be needed to bail out Tuvalu in the (unlikely) event its islands sank. Like Flannery, Kelly is long on doom but short on facts and the default position of both and all in the global warming activists' camp is to demand that Western nations suspend the powerhouses of their economies - the coal and gas-fired plants - and inflict brutally high prices for unreliable solar and wind energy on their citizens. China, meanwhile, is building more coal-fired plants to power manufacturing, outsourced from the West because energy prices have made it too expensive, to build things in nations that have drunk the green Kool-Aid. Humans - whom the Extinction Rebellion mob would like to see become extinct - are responsible for about 0.0016 per\~cent. If anyone at COP26 Not only was COP26 But what the heck, COP27 will be held at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort next year, an altogether more pleasant place than Glasgow and COP28 is scheduled to take place in the UAE (not such a great place). So, fuel up the private jets, ramp up the rhetoric and strap yourselves in for more crap from the world masters - the global warming catastrophists. \</doc>

ACTING Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce says the rise of a "more totalitarian" China is a greater "existential risk" than climate change. The National Party leader, member for New England and Deputy Prime Minister was in Taree and Forster-Tuncurry yesterday with his party colleague David Gillespie, the member for Lyne. In charge of the country while Prime Minister Scott Morrison is in Europe for the G20 and Glasgow COP26 meetings, Mr Joyce told the Newcastle Herald about the National Party view of the climate change debate and why he believes it's the world of renewable energy - and not coal and nuclear supporters such as himself - who are building their "net zero by 2050" policies on "technological pipe dreams". IN THE NEWS: Hunter hospital numbers fall as COVID-19 case numbers dip to 35 Cleo Smith found alive, man in custody Waste firm says Hunter must raise recycling rates "With wind and solar you need firming, you need storage," Mr Joyce said yesterday. "At the moment they're like a car that is going downhill and they say 'look at my car, it's not using any petrol, look how efficient it is!'. "Well, cars need to go uphill as well, and it's gas (firming) that drives the electricity up the hill." He endorsed gas but warned against a UK-style reliance that had contributed to their energy problems: 800,000 people a night losing power, and a six-fold price increase forcing people to decide whether to "eat or heat" going into Winter. The Coalition has only confirmed broad aspects of negotiations with the Nationals during "net zero" negotiations but Mr Joyce confirmed a fund to help build "headworks so other companies can come in" to what he called "parallel industry" needed to replace the jobs lost coal jobs. He also confirmed "explicit" ruling out of methane penalties, with Mr Morrison saying at Glasgow that Australia would not join a global pledge to cut methane emissions. Mr Joyce defended "targets" rather than "legislation", saying people needed to "go willingly, not be dragged by the nose" into costly change. He named five towns - Walcha, Crookwell and three New England villages of Nundle, Kentucky and Ben Lomond - as "split in two" by fights over wind turbines. "In my area it's between where the wind towers are, and the people nearby, who don't want them there," Mr Joyce said. "I'm trying to manage that problem and it's getting worse. "Everything in small number is a novelty, people are okay with it. "But when it's all over the landscape the political landscape changes. "Everyone loves wind turbines, but see if (Labor's Shortland MP) Pat Conroy wants one at Nobbys." Mr Joyce said the people who earned income from turbines on their land liked them, but landowners forced into hosting the resultant high-voltage transmission towers were not so happy. Asked his view on climate change, Mr Joyce said he agreed "there is an effect by people on the climate". "But I temper that by saying there is nothing we can do in Australia to change that by ourselves and there is not a thing we can do without China, India and Russia on board, with emissions so vastly in excess of other countries that you have to be very careful not to sign up to something that absolutely tears you apart but has no effect," Mr Joyce said. The IPCC could not achieve its aims without China, India and Russia cooperating. He said Labor talked about climate change as an "existential risk" but would not back nuclear energy to keep emissions down. "If I'm rating risk in this region I'm saying geopolitical change is the biggest risk by far," Mr Joyce said. "Climate change is an issue but the one that could completely and utterly change the freedoms you took for granted - that you can say what you want, do what you want, control your nation in the form you want - well, the one thing that will change that will be the change in the geopolitics of our region, the rise of China, especially if it goes into a more totalitarian regime without the tempering capacity of a range of people in positions of power. "A unitary power under one leader. That's always very, very concerning no matter where you are in the world." When the Herald described Australia's refusal to count Scope 3 emissions from its coal burned overseas as "the drug dealer's defence of I didn't use the drugs, I simply sold them", Mr Joyce said the argument did not apply because drugs killed people and ruined families, while coal generated power that kept people warm and had helped pull countless people out of dire poverty. It was "a moral good". He said he still supported new coal-fired power stations if needed. During his tour through the electorate of Lyne, Mr Joyce was taken to see four federally funded projects: Figtrees on the Manning, the Taree Universities Campus, Forster Main Beach foreshore and the Forster civic precinct. Dr Gillespie said the Figtrees on the Manning development was almost half finished and would encourage hundreds of millions of dollars worth of residential and commercial real estate development and a pedestrian and cycle corridor connecting Taree CBD with the city's regional sports facilities. Dr Gillespie said Mr Joyce was also shown around Taree Universities Campus, which was looking at the former council office building as a potential long-term home. He said the Forster civic precinct project was under way and Forster Surf Club was being redeveloped with the federal government having contributed $3.59 million towards a $6.3 million project.

Glasgow: What optimists hoped would be the final day of the COP26 talks began with the release of another draft of the conference's "cover decision" which in turn prompted a mass bout of textual analysis in the UN campus on the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow. At issue was a debate over which word is stronger: "urges" or "requests". The point mattered because the more recent draft "requests" that nations submit new and improved 2030 climate plans by the end of 2022, whereas the previous day's used the verb "urges". This goes to the heart of the climate summit's goal of securing commitments from governments to reduce emissions in line with stabilising the climate at a maximum 1.5-degree-rise in global temperatures. To do this we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030, and commitments made so far don't reach that mark. If nations with weak short-term targets, like Australia, can be dragged back to the table next year with improvements, the world has a better chance of correcting its course. So a close reading of the text was not bureaucratic niggling. It was significant that some read "requests" as weaker than "urges". By lunchtime Ed King, head of international communications for the European Climate Foundation, shared a screenshot of the UNFCCC style guide section regarding the use of "invitations and requests" listed in order of strength from strongest to weakest. "Requests" is stronger than "strongly urges" and "urged". "Active verbs, commas and colons. This is apparently how we save the planet at COP26 ," King tweeted. Shortly afterwards at an update session, COP president Alok Sharma reminded delegates that history was watching and requested they go back to the work of pursuing resolution and consensus. "This is our time to deliver on the high ambition set by our leaders at the start of this summit. We must rise to the occasion." By nightfall the battle over text had kicked the talks into overtime. In the section on mitigation - how we might reduce emissions - language on phasing out coal had been softened but remained in place, to the happy surprise of many. An emphasis on pursuing 1.5 degrees remained in place too. The real fight was over finance, and in particular over finance for loss and damage incurred by developing nations vulnerable to the worst impacts of climate change. This was a particularly contentious point. For years vulnerable nations had tried to force this matter to the centre of the COP agenda and for years they had failed. Advanced economies sought to keep the focus on reducing emissions rather than creating a mechanism to pay the poor to fix damage largely caused by the wealthy. Advanced economies feared not just the cost of paying for damage and loss, but the tacit acceptance of culpability. Talk in the corridors was that the EU and the US, climate progressives in other aspects of these negotiations, were not budging. But with the backing of India and China, the developing world was not budging either. The Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege, a stateswoman who carries real weight in these talks for her firm moral advocacy and as a chair of the High Ambition Coalition, a bloc of both wealthy and developing states that helped reshape the Paris Agreement, made the point with typical power. "Small island states are always the ones who are asked to compromise our interests in order to reach consensus," she said as tensions increased over the finance showdown. "These are not just words that we are conceding, it is our lives, livelihoods and our future." Some hours after dark the presidency accepted that COP26 would not end on Friday as scheduled, tweeting that a new draft would be released the following morning, and setting up another day of negotiations, of close reading of texts, of testing and pushing words.

Glasgow: Australia is one of a handful of countries that will be urged to set a new and more ambitious 2030 emissions reductions target by next November under a draft decision paper released at the COP26 climate change summit. The document, which works as a blueprint for final negotiations over the next few days, also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. The COP26 There is also a resolution to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees and recognises that this "requires meaningful and effective action" by all nations in the coming "critical decade". In the lead up to this meeting, Australia committed to reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, but declined to increase its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent, the same goal it set in 2015. It also calls for additional finance from wealthy nations to help pay for loss and damage due to climate change in the developing world, a point that has been hard fought during these negotiations. Ahead of his return to the summit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do." The Prime Minister said he would meet ministers and negotiators to hear about the progress made and where gaps must be bridged. "This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people," he said. "We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp." Bill Hare, a senior climate scientist and founder at Climate Analytics, said the draft decision did not put enough emphasis on the extremely urgent need to close the huge 2030 emission gap, and to establish a high level political process in 2020 to do so. "At this stage the draft only urges parties who have not yet submitted new or updated commitments to do so before 2022," Mr Hare said. "Yet many have submitted NDCs [nationally determined contributions] that are not at all improved or enhanced, and are nowhere near sufficient for the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree limit." He urged the UK COP presidency to call this out and not push this issue forward until 2023, which is implied in the text. "This needs to go well beyond simply reminding countries of the relevant articles of the Paris Agreement which to date quite a lot of countries have studiously ignored." University of Melbourne climate scientist Malte Meinshausen said draft decisions relating to climate mitigation contained a number of clauses that would advance previous decisions considerably, including calls upon parties to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. There were also clear pointers for countries like Australia to come forward with stronger measures, "not empty pamphlets", he said, pointing to a clause urging parties to return by 2022 to return with long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies. "There's a push, given what we know about impacts, for the international community to adopt the 1.5 degree goal even though it's very hard and we might overshoot it," associate professor Meinshausen said. "The end text could be remarkably strengthened if it sets 1.5 degrees as the agreed target." An updated United Nations analysis released on Wednesday AEDT shows that the world was still on track for 2.7 degrees warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 despite dozens of new emissions reductions pledges already made as part of the Glasgow climate talks. The projection is far worse than earlier estimates published late last week because it does not take into consideration some of the pledges made outside the formal COP process, such as promises to speed up the HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/narendra-modi-surprises-cop26-summit-with-2070-net-zero-vow-for-india-20211102-p5954c.html abandonment of coal HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/if-pledges-already-made-at-glasgow-are-met-warming-to-peak-below-2-degrees-20211104-p595tk.html methane emissions . The 2.7-degree assessment by the United Nations Environmental Program is based on 2030 targets, rather than more ambitious 2050 pledges, as they are viewed as more credible. If temperatures do rise by an average of 2.7 degrees, the consequences for the earth's climate have been predicted by the HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be catastrophic. COP26 President Alok Sharma warned before the Glasgow summit that any warming above two degrees would kill off all the world's coral reefs and expose 2 billion people to extreme heatwaves. "If temperatures continue to rise we will step through a series of one-way doors, the end destination of which is climate catastrophe." Taryn Fransen, international climate change policy specialist with the World Resources Institute, said the wide variance in the projections reflected the different methodologies used. "All of these studies are using slightly different assumptions about which pledges they should include," she said. She said when you sift through the reports and "compare apples and apples", a clearer picture emerges. Analyses that cite a median warming figure based on 2030 targets project warming will reach a range of 2.4 degrees to 2.5 degrees. Those that include 2050 targets show warming being held just beneath 2 degrees. COP26 goal, according to its UK hosts, is to keep "1.5 alive".

RESISTING pressure during global climate talks to set more ambitious emissions reduction goals, the federal government has insisted its 2030 target is "fixed". The United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow finalised a deal more than 24 hours after the official deadline on the weekend after India secured a last-minute amendment to water down the wording around the phasing out of coal. The summit's agreement included calls for countries such as Australia that have not increased their 2030 targets to do so before the next COP summit in Egypt at the end of 2022. But in a joint statement, Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor did not acknowledge the demand, instead reiterating the government's stance Australia would achieve its 2030 target and net zero by 2050 through technology. Australia's current target is for a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 emission levels by 2030, but modelling presented by the government has estimated the country is on track to actually achieve between 30 to 35 per cent. The modelling, made public by the government on Friday, was based partly on technology that does not exist yet. Ms Payne and Mr Taylor said Australia "particularly welcomes" the agreements from COP26 on carbon markets, and standardised transparency framework. "Transparency is the key to accountability and to translating ambition into achievement," Mr Taylor said. "Australia's emissions reporting and transparency is the gold standard and we expect all major emitters to display similar levels of transparency." World page 18 \</doc>

International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol told a gathering of Australian government officials that global heating would be restricted to 1.8 degrees Celsius if all of the pledges being made at the United National climate conference COP26 were implemented. Mr Birol revealed the heartening news to Australian energy minister Angus Taylor at a side meeting at the Australia pavilion on Thursday. He said if all the recent pledges to cut carbon emissions made to COP26 were enacted, especially those pledged by one of the world's biggest carbon emitters India, as well as the promised reductions in methane emissions, the temperature trajectory would be 1.8 degrees Celsius "which is much better than the trajectory was only a few months ago". Leading into the Glasgow summit the IEA had calculated that the temperature increase would be as much as 2.7 degrees Celsius. Mr Birol added a caveat, noting "there is a big if, here" that the pledges will all have to be carried out to see the slowing of the warming rate, and some of the pledged measures were dependent on funding from richer countries. Selwin Hart, UN Special Adviser and Assistant Secretary-General for climate change, challenged the IEA numbers and said the battle to reduce global heating was "far from over". "Fatih, I heard your numbers, but based on the Nationally Determined Contributions that have been submitted, the world is on a 2.7 degree pathway, a catastrophic pathway, and therefore we are a long way away from keeping the 1.3 degree goal of the Paris Agreement alive," he said. Mr Birol told the Australian government that he agreed with Canberra's position that blue hydrogen, made using gas and having the carbon emissions captured and stored underground, was worth pursuing. He added: "There is a huge discussion about what is low carbon hydrogen. In our view, natural gas and CCS can be a very good source of hydrogen if it is abated in the right ways. Of course the green hydrogen (using renewables) is the quality ... we also don't care about the colours if they are clean, if they are cost effective and if they are helping us to reach our energy level cost." Mr Fatih said the key to hydrogen success would be to give demand a boost to reduce production costs. Meanwhile, Australia has agreed to double the energy efficiency of four key products - industrial motor systems, air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting - in a COP26 Product Efficiency Call to Action led by the British government and the IEA. \</doc>

The election campaign is being conducted as if Australia has no fundamental problems, and can afford to squabble over personality and trivia. The contest has headed in the wrong direction, with endless commitments to debt-funded increases in public expenditure and subsidisation of unsustainable emissions-intensive industry. It is good that we are starting to face up to the failure of development knowledge and support, and of diplomacy that has led to China filling the vacuum of influence in Solomon Islands. But we have hardly noticed the more consequential failure of influence in the much larger country closer to home. Why did it take a Papua New Guinea royal commission to show that Australian authorities were asleep at the wheel as some Australian professional and corporate interests undermined fragile democratic governance in PNG? Climate change connects these and other crucial Australian interests. We are the developed country that has most to lose from climate disruption. Failure of the global effort would impose greater cost on Australia than any other developed economy. Failure would damage profoundly our geostrategic interests, including from the displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents of the Western and Gulf provinces just across the water from Far North Queensland and in the populous Sepik provinces of Papua New Guinea. Despite our large economic interests in coal and LNG exports, Australia - more than any other country - would receive large net economic benefits from an early and complete global transition to zero net emissions. In the high-carbon economy, Australian coal is available to industries in Shanghai, Kobe and Pusan as cheaply as it is in Australian cities. Development of the LNG export industry in Gladstone lifted the cost of Australian gas in our eastern industrial cities to that in north-east Asia. Thus, despite being a net energy exporter, Australian energy-intensive manufacturing receives no competitive advantage. By contrast, Australia's potential to generate and firm renewable energy more cheaply than other countries confers large and sustainable advantages on domestic industry in the new low-carbon world. Yes, Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes will sell large quantities of solar energy to South-East Asia, transported by submarine cable. Many producers using renewable electricity will export zero-emissions hydrogen and its carriers to Asian and European markets. But unlike coal and gas, Australian renewable electricity and hydrogen will be more than twice as expensive in Singapore, Pusan, Kobe, Shanghai and Hamburg as they are at home. Submarine cables and preparation for export and transport of hydrogen and its chemical carriers cost more than the renewable products themselves. It will not be economically sensible to process Australian materials in other countries using Australian zero-emissions energy. Australia will be the economically rational location for at least the early stages of processing. Using Australian renewable hydrogen at home to process the Australian iron ore that currently goes overseas would reduce global emissions by more than twice as much as Australia reducing its own domestic emissions to zero. Unlike the old industry, the zero-emissions economic opportunities of the future are overwhelmingly concentrated in rural and provincial Australia. And yet at the COP26 meeting of the UN in Glasgow last year, we joined Russia, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia in opposition to the US, Britain, the European Union and other developed democracies on 2030 emissions reduction targets, reduction of methane emissions, and early phasing out of coal in power generation. We were noticed. A senior American official close to US President Joe Biden told veteran Sydney Morning Herald journalist Peter Hartcher: "We were looking to a close ally for support at Glasgow on a key policy and Morrison gave us just f---ing bullshit." As I wrote in five articles in The Australian Financial Review late last year, our government was kidding itself on climate policy at Glasgow. We were relying on a "road map" that had a different destination from other developed countries, no engine to drive us across the landscape, and no steering mechanism. The kidding has shifted to more emphatic denial as we have doubled down on a "gas-led recovery", expanding coal and gas capacity as prices rose at first with restrictions on investment for climate reasons in other countries, and temporarily more with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Uniquely in the developed democratic world, we avoided significant support for the energy and climate transition in a spending spree that will leave us with a trillion dollars of Commonwealth debt. The kidding has taken new shapes during the election campaign. The Commonwealth government has told coal and gas exporters who are benefiting from historically high prices and profits that they have no responsibility to remove or offset fugitive emissions. This promise jeopardises the current government's woefully inadequate emissions reduction commitments. With the OECD's Australia secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, leading efforts to introduce a carbon price throughout the developed world, our government has promised during this election campaign to never ever join this global effort. The COP27 meeting in Egypt late this year gives Australia a second chance. Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the 2019 election rejected the opposition's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. He cared enough for the national interest to break that promise. If he is still prime minister at the time of COP27 and still cares for the national interest, he needs to desist from holding out against the heads of government of the US, Britain and other developed democracies, and take Australia's 2030 commitment into the range of developed countries. That means beating South Korea's minus 42 per cent. If whoever is prime minister cares for the national interest, he needs to add a commitment to reduce emissions by three quarters by 2035, accept Biden's leadership by joining the global pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, and join the US president and other leaders of the developed democratic world in committing to phase out coal in power generation by 2035. Australians face interrelated policy challenges of historic dimension. Fail to deal with them well, and we irretrievably disrupt climate and environmental conditions that underpin Australian lives, lose the chance to regain effective influence in our neighbourhood, continue the last decade's stagnation and decline in living standards for ordinary Australians, and continue our slide down the global league tables for democracy and integrity. Australia's shifting from spoiler to full participant in the global effort to contain damage from climate change matters in every corner of Australian lives.

Glasgow: The shock new pact between China and the United States unveiled in Glasgow has been hailed as a breakthrough as the deadline looms for the climate summit's negotiations. The world's two largest emitters declared global warming an existential crisis which demands co-operation between the superpowers. In a boost to the flagging COP26 talks and sign of a possible thawing in the fractured relationship between both countries, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry stunned observers by unveiling the joint declaration pledging tougher action this decade. The agreement between the world's two largest emitters was negotiated in secret for months during about 30 virtual meetings and negotiation sessions in Shanghai, London and Washington before final terms were settled in Glasgow on Wednesday night local-time. "Co-operation is the only choice for both China and the United States," Xie told reporters via a translator. "By working together, our two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries, but to the world as a whole. As two major powers in the world, China and the US shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations. "We need to think big and feel responsible. We need to work ... hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world." The announcement appeared to take Britain, the host of the COP26 summit, by surprise given Prime Minister Boris Johnson had only hours earlier warned momentum at the talks was slowing. The Glasgow declaration was released a week after US President Joe Biden attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for not attending the summit in person, describing it as a "big mistake". "The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, 'what value added are they providing?"' Mr Biden said last week. "They've lost the ability to influence the people around the world and all the people here at COP." The document released on Wednesday promises the US and China will work together on emissions reductions and an accelerated phase-out of unabated coal, however timelines were not listed. The statement also binds China to tackle damaging methane emissions and deforestation, while both countries have agreed to share technology and expertise on clean energy, decarbonisation and electrification. The statement notes both countries are committed to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and conceded there was a "gap" between current policies and meeting that core target. Mr Xie described climate change as an "existential crisis" and said agreement between the US and China on how to deal with global warming far outweighed their differences on the issue. Mr Kerry, a former US secretary of state under Barack Obama, framed the surprise agreement as much-needed momentum for the COP26 talks. "The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade," Mr Kerry told reporters in Glasgow. "Our teams have worked together for months, and we have worked in good faith. We have found common ground." Mr Kerry described the joint declaration, titled the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, as a "road map for our present and future collaboration" on climate change. "It declares specifically and identifies the need to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy," Mr Kerry said. "Secondly, it commits to a series of important actions, not out in the long term but now, in this decade where it's needed. "We could leave [Glasgow] on Friday not working together, the world wondering where the future is going," he said. "Or we can leave here with people working together in order to raise the ambition and move down a better road. "What President Biden wanted to do, and President Xi agreed we should do, is join together to work at trying to solve this. And I am convinced that's a better road to pursue." Mr Xie and Mr Kerry noted that the US had developed a plan to reduce methane emissions and said China would follow suit. "Climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity. It bears on the wellbeing of future generations," Mr Xie said. "Climate change is becoming increasingly urgent and severe." "The methane and forests commitments are good news, now they must co-operate on ensuring an ambitious outcome to COP26 ," she said. "That means putting us on track to 1.5 degrees and delivering the vital support needed to those most vulnerable. The success of that co-operation will be judged on the outcome of this vital meeting." Bernice Lee, the research director at the Chatham House think tank in London, also sounded a note of caution. "It can only be good news that the US and China are working closely on climate change and slashing methane emissions," Ms Lee said. "Details remain patchy but this declaration should dissolve any fears that US-China tensions will stand in the way of success at COP26 . But the statement is not enough to close the deal." \</doc>

Australia's High Commissioner to London George Brandis is set to be quizzed by investigators over his role in a crash involving Prime Minister Scott Morrison's official motorcade. Legal firm Ashurst has been hired to investigate the incident during the COP26 Summit in Glasgow that resulted in a collision involving two Metropolitan Police cars. Yesterday in Senate Estimates Kathryn Campbell, secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), said an initial report into the incident was "quite narrow" in scope and focused "about the drivers and the actual incident". She said Ashurst had been hired because the original report "didn't talk to a number of other parties who were involved in the incident". It is understood one of those parties will be Mr Brandis. The Daily Telegraph HYPERLINK https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/london-high-commissioner-george-brandis-in-diplomstic-crash-in-scotland/news-story/39f2e6b0bed75bd13ce8dad55cc93798 last month exclusively revealed Mr Brandis had refused to go on the staff bus and insisted on his driver catching up with the official motorcade that is off limits to all but the Prime Minister. Metropolitan Police drivers took evasive action until they recognised the diplomatic plates and braked, resulting in two police cars colliding. Mr Brandis and his driver were stopped at the scene and were late to attend an official stakeholder breakfast where Mr Brandis was supposed to have introduced Mr Morrison. "George was late and was telling his driver to hurry up and catch up with the motorcade," a diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph at the time. "One of the police cars then braked causing the other to crash into it," the source said. "No one was injured but it was highly embarrassing for the Commissioner." Ms Campbell confirmed Australia had offered to pay for the damage to the police cars. "The Deputy Commissioner contacted the Metropolitan Police the day after the incident and offered to compensate them. They declined the offer," she said. But she repeatedly refused to answer questions about exactly what happened and what driving duties the driver had been on the night before the incident. Labor Senator Tim Ayres said: "It's pretty extraordinary that we're not in a position to understand some of the basic details." A spokesman for DFAT confirmed the driver had since been moved to other duties. "The High Commissioner did not ask for the driver to be reassigned. The Deputy High Commissioner made the decision to reassign the drivers duties pending an investigation," he said. "The investigation into these matters remains ongoing. It would not be appropriate for the department to provide further comment at this time." \</doc>

LEONARDO DiCaprio shunned a private jet and instead arrived in Glasgow for the COP26 summit on a commercial flight. The Oscar-winner, who is a United Nations climate change representative, was seen boarding a connecting commercial flight in London en route to Glasgow. DiCaprio wore a mask, suit and sported dark sunglasses as he arrived at the Glasgow SEC Centre. Other attendees including billionaire Jeff Bezos have been criticised for travelling to the event via private plane. DiCaprio attended the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit, in support of a campaign to protect the Ebo Forest of Cameroon from logging, and is expected to speak at other events held during the climate change conference. He was seen at the COP26 BlueZone at the SEC campus, surrounded by security guards. DiCaprio posed with Emmy-nominated producer Paul Goodenough, who founded the charity Rewriting Extinction, clutching a copy of The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World. The actor is a long-time climate change activist and launched The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation - described as dedicated to the long-term health and wellbeing of all Earth's inhabitant - in 1998. He urged world leaders to take action. \</doc>

Health Minister Greg Hunt has refused to say whether Australia will return to international climate talks late next year with an updated 2030 emission reduction target as the concluded UN Glasgow summit demanded. The UN Climate Change Conference known as COP26 ended on Sunday morning AEDT with a pact urging a faster "phase down" of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The final pact now returns the focus onto the 2030 targets ahead of the federal election, which is widely expected to be held in the first half of 2022, and ratchets up pressure on both major parties. The current Australian target is for a 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 emission levels by 2030 but government modelling has projected up to a 35 per cent reduction in that time frame. "We've set our target," said Mr Hunt, who was environment minister from 2013 to 2016. "But what we'll continue to do is update our projections." Labor has not declared a 2030 target but the party has signalled it wants more ambitious action than the Coalition while the Greens have demanded a 75 per cent cut in emissions. Mr Hunt broadly welcomed the outcome of the summit, saying it was important progress for the world but repeatedly declined to say whether Australia would update its 2030 goals. Instead, Mr Hunt quoted Shakespeare while on the ABC's Insiders program. "It reminds me of Prince Hal to Hotspur in Henry IV: \' I never never promised to pay thee but now that I'm here, I'll pay thee double'." The Glasgow pact calls for rapid reductions in emissions this decade if 2050 targets are to work, and completes key elements of the so-called Paris rule book, governing how a global carbon market can operate. Asked what the consequences should be if a country like Australia ignored the request to come back in 2022 with higher 2030 emissions reductions targets, COP26 president Alok Sharma said: "All countries have signed up to this and at the end of the day this is an international agreement and every country will be judged by whether or not they stuck to the commitments they've made." Reaction to the final agreement was mixed. Councillor with the Climate Council and Macquarie University biology professor Lesley Hughes said the pact was a step in the right direction but not as strong as many had hoped. "We've got some of the weakest targets in the world," she said. "The Australian government is letting the world down and certainly letting Australia down, they are out of step with global action and certainly out of step with the community." Greenpeace Australia Pacific chief executive officer David Ritter said the pact's message to Australia and other fossil fuel producers was clear: "This is not the deal the world needed, but it is what has been delivered and the momentum is in the right direction," he said. "Make no mistake. One clear positive is that the governments of the world have agreed for the first time that the age of coal is over." Former prime minister Kevin Rudd said COP26 was always going to be judged about whether it changed the emissions curve. "While Glasgow has shown that the ambition mechanism at the heart of the Paris Agreement is beating, survival for those on the frontline of this climate crisis is still not certain," he said. "Countries like my own which refused to update their 2030 targets have not simply been granted a leave pass to do nothing for another five years  and they will now need to come back to the table by COP27 next year. "While the official text might have stopped short of agreeing to phase out coal, the statements made by world leaders in Glasgow leave no doubt that coal is on its way to being consigned to history," Rudd said. COP26 would continue. "Everyone here is exhausted, it's been tiring both physically and emotionally," he said. "It's tough that after all this we are left with something beyond subpar. I hope we can take some of the ambition that was shown here and take it forward." "Lot of people saw COP26 as this silver bullet to fix everything, but it was never going to be that. We hoped in some sense it would be better than what we thought, but we were let down once again." Climate Analytics chief executive Bill Hare said if countries did not step up in the next few years to take substantial action, including phasing out coal and addressing the role of gas, then the future looked bleak. "There is a sense of urgency with the accelerated timeline for action. There is consensus that this is a critical decade for accelerated action. It is a race against time," he said. There was a disappointing outcome for loss and damage, but with some encouraging signals that it is possible to come back to the table to do additional work. "COP27 will be very important for making good on the solidarity that was expressed at this COP for moving forward on loss and damage."

Pacific Island leaders at the Glasgow climate conference have pressed Scott Morrison to make sharper cuts to Australia's emissions this decade as they grapple with the impacts of global warming. The Prime Minister used his speech to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and to again stress that technological developments will be key to driving down pollution. He\~also announced that the government would boost Australia's climate finance commitment,\~to help Pacific and South-East Asian neighbours with the effects of climate change,\~by $500 million to a total of $2 billion.\~ But in a pointed post on social media, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama called Mr Morrison's net zero commitment "a start."\~ Mr Bainimarama said he used his meeting with Mr Morrison in Glasgow to press him to slash Australia's emissions by 2030. \~ "I've now urged Scott Morrison to show us a concrete plan to halve emissions by 2030," he said on Twitter.\~ Mr Morrison used his speech at Glasgow to point to Australia's uptake of solar and other renewable energy technologies. \~ But he also said that the Glasgow climate change conference  which has been billed as one of the most important in a generation  could only achieve so much. The Prime Minister argued the challenge of achieving any progress on cutting carbon emissions would be "met by those who are frankly largely not in this room". "It will be our scientists, our technologists, our engineers, our entrepreneurs, our industrialists and our financiers that will actually chart the path to net zero  and it is up to us as leaders of governments to back them in," Mr Morrison said. "Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, particularly over time." While Australia has adopted the net zero by 2050 pledge, it has not increased its short-term 2030 targets. Mr Morrison said during his speech that Australia would "meet and beat" that promise  even though Australia had made no formal commitment to do so.\~ "By 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes that our emissions in Australia will fall by 35 per cent by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment," he said\~ When reporters asked him if Pacific leaders had asked Australia to make sharper cuts by 2030, Mr Morrison confirmed they had.\~ "Well, they always have. In every discussion I've ever had with Pacific Island leaders, that is something they've always encouraged us to do," he said.\~ But he argued that the net zero commitment Australia has made would still be enough to meet the expectations and "passion" embodied in the Kainaki Declaration on climate change, which was delivered at the 2019 Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Tuvalu. The federal Opposition accused Mr Morrison of embarrassing Australia on the world stage. "It's just a continuation of the steaming pile of nothingness that we had in Australia before he left," Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen said. "It is a speech devoid of substance, it's more slogans, more spin. "Just talking about technology and saying technology over and over is not a framework for the development and adaption, or the adoption, of that technology." Boost to 'climate resilience' funding Mr Morrison's climate finance promise will see\~Australia increase its funding for "climate resilience" projects over the next five years, with money going towards infrastructure projects such as roads, schools and bridges. The extra $500 million comes on top of the$1.5 billion commitment that was announced in December 2020. Mr Bowen said: "While any support for South-East Asian and Pacific nations is welcome, it comes off the back of the government removing Australia from the global climate change fund, and also billions of dollars of cuts to foreign aid over six successive budgets  which have impacted our region very severely. "Scott Morrison wants a pat on the back for this announcement  he won't be getting one from us, and I doubt it he'll be getting one from Pacific nations." Pacific leaders have not just been ramping up pressure on Australia  Mr Bainimarama also criticised countries such as China and Russia for unveiling a\~2060 net zero goal without giving specific plans to cut down emissions this decade. "We have fallen so far off-course that only bold and courageous action will suffice," he said. "2060 is too late, empty promises of mid-century ambition are not enough.\~ "All high-emitting countries must halve\~global emissions by 2030." He argued the future of some nations was at stake. "The existence of our low-lying neighbours is not on the negotiating table. "Humanity does not lack the resources, technology, projects, innovative potential to achieve it  all that is missing, ladies and gentlemen, is the courage to act." \</doc>

Glasgow | British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ability to pull off a HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/what-is-the-least-we-need-from-cop26-20211027-p593jx successful COP26 summit looks to be resting precariously on hopes that the big hold-out countries such as China and India might pull surprise new commitments out of the bag. Stepping up his pre-summit rhetoric as he stood in front of the semi-ruined Roman Colosseum in Italy on Saturday (AEDT), Mr Johnson warned that a HYPERLINK global failure to avert climate change could plunge modern society into the kind of civilisational collapse seen in antiquity. "Unless you can make sure next week at COP in Glasgow that we keep alive this prospect of restricting the growth in the temperature of the planet, then we really face a real problem for humanity," he said. The commitments made by countries so far would only keep global warming to about 2.4 degrees Celsius, not the 1.5C that is now agreed to be the threshold for avoiding catastrophic environmental impact. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though, have been reluctant to put their big-emitting countries behind Mr Johnson's call for higher ambition in the past week - leaving the British host hoping they may have kept something in reserve for Glasgow. Mr Xi is now expected to address the summit in virtual form, making a statement during the initial two days of set-piece speeches from the 100-plus leaders gathered in Scotland. China submitted its COP26 road map, or "nationally determined contribution" (NDC) late last week. But it went no further than Mr Xi's pledge last December to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and barely advanced the country's previous NDC in 2016. Mr Johnson's team will be hoping the Chinese leader pulls a rabbit from the hat during his on-screen address in Glasgow, such as bringing forward the "peak" of China's greenhouse gas emissions from 2030 to 2026. COP26 and taking concrete action to cut emissions and expedite the transition to renewable energy, including phasing out coal". French President Emmanuel Macron has also been on the phone to Mr Xi, telling him to lift his game. "There is still a lot Beijing could do outside of its targets in the next two weeks, at the G20 summit in Rome and COP26 in Glasgow," said Byford Tsang, a senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G. This could include "supporting a political commitment to keep 1.5 Celsius within reach, and putting an expiry date on coal in its coal power system, and showing the world that it's serious about being a global leader on climate". But any change announced at Glasgow would represent a substantial handbrake turn from Mr Xi. Although the country is ramping up its renewables base, Global Energy Monitor reported that last year China commissioned 38 gigawatts of new coal-fired power, triple the rest of the world combined, and initiated another 73.5 GW of new proposals. Indian intransigence India's Mr Modi, meanwhile, has been resisting Johnson's efforts to lock him into tougher net-zero targets. His ministers have said India's focus will be on "climate justice": getting rich countries to transfer green technology to the developing world and unlocking more money from the West. The Indian press has been quoting government sources as saying that net-zero targets serve to push the burden onto emerging economies - which will particularly hit coal-dependent India, the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US. Mr Modi has not yet made any new pledges for COP26 . According to the Climate Action Tracker website, his government subsidises coal at a higher rate than renewables, and has opened the sector to private investors. India's coal capacity is thus expected to climb from 200 GW now to almost 266 GW by 2030. Its pipeline of coal-fired power is the world's second largest and has been increasing since the Paris Agreement. Home front hobbles Biden It is also unclear if Mr Johnson will be able to leverage the strong personal commitment of US President Joe Biden to taking faster, more far-reaching action. "His approval ratings have slid to 42 per cent from 57 at the start of his presidency. He has neither the political capital nor the financial wherewithal to pull any rabbits from his hat at COP." But an E3G analysis said Mr Biden's fiscal stimulus package was almost complete, and although some key climate measures may be lost - leaving it as an "all carrots, no sticks" approach - the Build Back Better bill still contained about $US550 billion ($730 billion) in climate investments. This would give him "some credibility" in Glasgow, but "Congress must follow through on Biden's pledge of $US11.4 billion in climate financing for developing countries per year by 2024", E3G's analysts said. The European Union, which has one of the developed world's most ambitious emissions reductions plans, will swing in behind Mr Johnson. But spiralling gas prices have turned energy bills into a significant domestic political issue, which could chip away at some of the Europeans' resolve. \</doc>

\~\~ China and the UK have expressed willingness to strengthen dialogue and cooperation in tackling global climate change and achieve positive results at the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference and the Global Biodiversity Summit. \~\~ Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng and Alok Sharma, president-designate of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), made the assurance during a video meeting on Tuesday. \~\~ COP26 will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, while the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) will be held in south China's Kunming City online in October 2021 and offline in October 2022. \~\~ Han stressed that global solidarity and cooperation are needed to tackle climate change. \~\~ Expressing expectations for COP26 , Han hopes that the climate conference will send a strong political signal for firmly upholding multilateralism, respecting multilateral rules and promoting actions. He also expects that the delegates at COP26 will actively transform climate goals into specific policies and actions, and complete the negotiations to meet the Paris Agreement. \~\~ Both countries have maintained good cooperation in dealing with climate change and have set stronger carbon emission reduction targets to meet carbon neutrality, Han said, also calling both sides to exploit their advantages and strengthen dialogue related to climate change. \~\~ China, which holds the presidency of COP15, is willing to work with the UK to promote the success of the two conferences, Han said. \~\~ Hailing China's efforts in tackling climate change, Sharma said the UK looks forward to expanding exchanges and cooperation in areas such as climate finance, energy and carbon trading and is willing to strengthen dialogue and coordination with China to achieve positive outcomes at COP26 and COP15. \~\~ Image Attachments Links:: HYPERLINK http://asianetnews.net/ViewImage.asp?ID=400261 http://asianetnews.net/ViewImage.asp?ID=400261 ASIANET \</doc>

Kate Middleton has turned heads at the Glasgow climate summit wearing a striking coat dress as she attended with husband Prince William. Wearing the cobalt outfit - a hue often sported by the late Princess Diana - the Duchess of Cambridge rubbed shoulders with fellow royals and world leaders at the COP26 . Kate, 39, sported the ankle-skimming \£32400 ($A4,357) dress with power shoulders from London-based label Eponine's spring/summer 2020 collection. She teamed the dress - from a range that was released about 18 months ago - with a pair of \£3425 ($A771) pumps that she's worn about a dozen times before heels from British designer Rupert Sanderson, per the HYPERLINK https://www.dailymail.co.uk/auhome/index.html Daily Mail . In a candid moment, Kate jokingly offered husband Prince William a tub of dead insects, used to feed livestock. "Fantastic to finally meet the @EarthshotPrize Finalists in person at @COP26UK," Wills and Kate wrote in an Instagram post about the summit. "This week at COP we will showcase their incredible innovations to repair our planet. "The #EarthshotPrize finalists will also meet members of the Prize's Global Alliance, some of the world's largest corporations, philanthropists, and not for profits - who will provide unparalleled support to the Prize Finalists to help scale their solutions. # COP26 ." PRINCE CHARLES STUMBLES Prince Charles, who stumbled as he walked on stage at COP26 , said climate change posed "an even greater existential threat" than the Covid pandemic. "We know what we must do ... We have to reduce emissions urgently and take action to tackle the carbon already in the atmosphere." Prince Charles said trillions of dollars were required to realise the solutions, and that governments needed to co-ordinate with the private sector to make that happen. "The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global systems-level solution based on radically transforming our fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable," he said. "The private sector is ready to play its part and to work with governments to find a way forward." - With Tom Minear \</doc>

\~\~New Zealand has carved off a sizeable chunk of its foreign aid budget towards combating climate change in vulnerable nations, committing $NZ1.3 billion ($A1.2 billion). \~\~ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also confirmed New Zealand will up its climate change pledge atNovember's climate change conference in Glasgow, known as COP26 . \~\~ Ms Ardern is a firm climate advocate, calling the passing of the Zero Carbon Act her generation's nuclear-free moment, and supporting a parliamentary declaration of a climate emergency. \~\~ She also travelled by boat to the tiny Pacific territory of Tokelau in her first term in office. \~\~ Ms Ardern - who is not attending COP26 - says New Zealand will release its"Nationally Determined Contribution" (NDC) in the next fortnight. \~\~ "We asked the Climate Commission to give us advice, they gave us a steer that it needed to increase, and now we're doing the work to see what that looks like." \~\~ Half of New Zealand's climate aidcommitment will go towards Pacific nations. \~\~ Ms Ardern said the funding would "assist lower income countries to protect lives, livelihoods and infrastructure from the impacts of climate change". \~\~ "I have seen and heard first-hand the impact of climate change in our region," she said. \~\~ "We need to continue to step up our support for our Pacific family and neighbours who are on the front line of climate change and need our support most." \~\~ Ms Ardern is not heading to COP26 as New Zealand has hosting duties of the overlapping APEC leaders summit. \~\~ Climate Change Minister James Shaw will attend on her behalf, undertaking 14 days of quarantine on return to New Zealand. \</doc>

The West's move away from our own power sources gives a massive advantage to Russia and China As we wake to daily news of Russian attacks on Ukraine's hospitals and homes and on women, children and the elderly while they shelter or flee, last year's COP26 commitment to net zero seems a faint memory. In modern Europe, you'd think the invasion of a sovereign nation wouldn't be tolerated - that European democracies would at least cease trade with the aggressor. The EU and UK have imposed some sanctions on Russia. But they won't do the one thing that would hurt most: ban Russian energy imports. Nearly half Russia's oil, gas and mineral exports go to the EU and UK. In 2020, Russia's revenue from these exports exceeded its total military spending. The UK, reliant on Russia for eight per cent of oil and four per cent of gas, will phase out Russian oil imports this year and -"explore options" to reduce gas imports. The EU, dependent on Russia for 40 per cent of gas and 25 per cent of oil, has baulked at this. Instead, it has proposed "an outline of a plan" for independence from Russian fossil fuels before 2030. The EU resisted banning Russian banks from SWIFT, eventually agreeing to exclude just seven banks but not those handling most oil and gas payments. So, for now, the EU and UK continue to pay Russia circa $US400 ($A530) million a day for energy and, as a result, fund Moscow's war crimes in Ukraine. This is what happens when you're beholden to a rogue state for energy. Ending Russian energy imports would cripple European industry, send energy prices soaring and leave millions vulnerable to hypothermia and death next winter. The EU and UK are also increasingly reliant on gas power. In 1990, gas accounted for eight per cent of EU electricity production and under two per cent for UK compared to around 20 per cent and 40 per cent today. Gas provides baseload power as countries increase intermittent, weather-dependent wind and solar. This isn't a theoretical issue. In 2021, wind power production in the EU and UK slumped markedly due to a wind drought. Meanwhile, EU and UK domestic gas and oil production has plunged with bans on new North Sea exploration and on fracking. The EU imports 90 per cent of its gas and 97 per cent of its oil products. Fifty years ago, the EU countries and UK produced nearly as much gas as Russia. Now Russia produces around seven times more. And replacing Russian gas is extremely difficult -because it's delivered through fixed pipelines that can't just be redirected to ports. Fracking enables extraction of hard-to-reach gas and oil from rocks, providing resources for countries without conventional reserves. In the United States, fracking and gas power delivered energy independence and falling emissions. Scientists say fracking is completely safe if properly regulated. But fracking has been demonised by a campaign of lies; with serious claims this campaign has been supported by Russian disinformation and funding to stifle competing gas production. The EU's move away from nuclear power is crazy. Nuclear provides safe, abundant, reliable electricity with zero emissions. The International Energy Agency estimates 812gw of nuclear power is required to achieve net zero by 2050. On current projections, this will fall 33gw short. Non-OECD countries lead new nuclear power, with China and Russia dominating. But the UK is embracing nuclear power with the first new plant to open in 2026 and a second in advanced approval stage. The UK government and private sector have also provided \'c3 \'c2\£3450 million to fund the design of small modular reactor technology. There's a hard lesson here for Australia. We're moving to greater solar and wind power and rely on China for renewable and battery products and the minerals required to manufacture them. Fracking is subject to protests and bans, and nuclear power is banned nationally. Australian governments should encourage mining of rare earth elements and other minerals for renewables and batteries. We have the third largest global reserves of rare earth elements but mine almost none. We should also manufacture new energy technologies, which means having all options on the table for -reliable electricity. We should lift the ban on nuclear power, not least to support high--energy industries and electrified land transport. We should reject the unscientific bans and other hurdles on fracking. And environmental groups should be subject to stringent transparency and accountability rules to confirm they're not funded by foreign states. To Russia and China, net zero means increasing their own fossil fuel and nuclear energy while mining and manufacturing to supply -Western democracies with gas and renewables. Europe's response to Ukraine exposes the fantasy of net zero rhetoric that's less about reducing emissions and more about dependence on Russian gas. Australia must avoid the same relationship with China. Nyunggai Warren Mundine AO is author of Speaking My Mind and Warren Mundine - In Black and White @nyunggai \</doc>

The German linguist Heinrich Zimmer once described the ocean as "limitless and immortal ... the beginning and end of all things on Earth". Standing on the shores of any ocean, one can easily sense this. Yet, the more we reveal about the myriad processes within the world's oceans, the more we begin to HYPERLINK question just how limitless and immortal the ocean truly is. The ocean is one of the Earth's greatest climate regulators. It absorbs almost a third of emitted carbon dioxide and more than 90% of excess heat. But the latest scientific report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/ IPCC ) revealed the ocean may be nearing a HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report-on-climate-science tipping point . Historic levels of ocean acidification, warming and HYPERLINK https://www.iucn.org/theme/marine-and-polar/our-work/climate-change-and-oceans/ocean-deoxygenation deoxygenation (oxygen loss) are irreversibly affecting marine biodiversity and critical ecosystem functions. Despite a critical need to incorporate the ocean into climate policies, a connection between climate, ocean and biodiversity regimes has been slow to form. Read more: The ocean is essential to tackling climate change. So why has it been neglected in global climate talks? The HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/14/what-are-the-key-points-of-the-glasgow-climate-pact-cop26 Glasgow Climate Pact COP26 A request was also made for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( https://unfccc.int/ UNFCCC ) to hold an annual HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/event/ocean-and-climate-change-dialogue-to-consider-how-to-strengthen-adaptation-and-mitigation-action Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue Oceans and climate change This annual meeting will build on the first Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, which was requested by COP25 in Madrid in 2019 and held virtually as part of UNFCCC discussions in 2020. Prior to this meeting, submissions were sought on priorities and perspectives for ocean-related climate mitigation and adaptation. In HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2021.1990004 our paper , we share in-depth analysis of these submissions and the first Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, providing a baseline for continued progress. This analysis also informs the UN HYPERLINK https://www.oceandecade.org/ Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the HYPERLINK https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/ UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration HYPERLINK https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/governing-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction beyond national jurisdiction In total, there were 47 submissions, from governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Governmental submissions represented 120 of the 197 nations within the UNFCCC, from largely coastal or island nations with a strong history of ocean management and policy. However, several major coastal nations were absent (including the US, China, India, Brazil and the Russian Federation). Read more: COP26 The COP26 summit highlighted the HYPERLINK lack of inclusion for all groups in the negotiations, particularly limited access for developing countries, observers and NGOs. The very format of the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue allowed for a more inclusive process. It revealed different perspectives between governmental and NGO submissions on several key issues. For example, NGOs more frequently considered ocean ecosystem impacts (such as changes to species distribution and ocean circulation), the deep sea and vulnerabilities to saltwater intrusion into drinking water reserves. The differences in focus highlighted by the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue underscore the need to ensure HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/cop26-why-climate-action-must-be-inclusive/ all global concerns Linking climate and biodiversity crises All submissions reflected the intrinsic ties between society and the services the ocean provides, from fisheries to carbon sequestration. They also highlighted the many intersections between climate adaptation and mitigation and respective policies. As seen in the Glasgow Climate Pact, many submissions joined ocean, climate and biodiversity issues. This reflects the growing emphasis on actions and policies that consider the climate crisis holistically, instead of focusing just on atmospheric or terrestrial components. Most submissions highlighted the need for policies that promote ecosystem resilience and include biodiversity management to support crucial ecosystem functions, such as trapping carbon. This included https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/12/24/working-with-nature-is-the-best-way-to-tackle-climate-change-impacts/?sh=1da8aa83615e nature-based solutions HYPERLINK https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/blue-carbon blue carbon ", capable of trapping more carbon per unit area than forests. Finance and human rights A focus was seen in the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue on ensuring adequate funding to achieve climate goals. More than half of all submissions referred to finance, but it was more strongly considered by NGOs than by governments. Finance was a HYPERLINK https://www.politico.eu/article/cop26-draft-deal-text-struggles-over-climate-finance/ pivotal issue at HYPERLINK COP26 , reported as one of the most challenging plans to agree on. This includes issues such as how much finance goes to adaptation over mitigation, and the degree to which rich nations support developing countries HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/climate-change-blended-finance-least-developed-countries/ bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, despite being the least responsible. Human rights issues and the importance of transparent, inclusive, fair governance ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/159_Talanoa%20Dialogue%20Input%20April%202018%20-Mercy%20Corps%20Asia%20Submission.pdf good governance ) were mentioned frequently in the submissions in relation to ocean management, mitigation and adaptation measures. The continued evolution towards integrated climate action through the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue and the Glasgow Climate Pact is a major victory. However, high ambition was elusive at COP26 and it will require more work to prevent severe climate impacts on sensitive marine ecosystems and the people who rely on them. The Dialogue highlighted several next steps, including featuring the ocean in the UNFCCC HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake global stocktake , addressing gaps in ocean finance and increasing ocean science in (and produced by) developing countries. The ocean has been buffering the impacts of climate change since the industrial revolution, but we are now reaching the limits of this capacity.

As the world gathers for the COP26 conference, many experts are worried it is cooked before it even begins. David Mills reports It's been hyped as 2021's hot ticket, and Prince Charles dubbed it the "last chance saloon" for the environment. But in the weeks leading up to Sunday's COP26 conference in Glasgow, could momentum on climate action be slipping away? In April, the UK, US, Japan and Canada updated their emissions targets in one whirlwind week, offering tantalising hope some progress might finally be made on climate change. But in the past week, that ebullience has faded. Russia and Saudi Arabia committed to net zero, but pegged it on the never-never date of 2060. Australia opted for 2050 but announced it would not update its interim target for 2030. The two-week COP26 COP26 will fail. Further blows came when the Queen and the Pope had to withdraw because of health issues. Could COP26 Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie doesn't think so. "The Saudis, the Russians and the Australians have all been considered laggards in this regard, so it's not surprising those three countries have advanced a longer term target," she said. "I think it's actually a really good sign that even the laggards are coming to the table." Momentum shouldn't just be measured by the actions of countries, Ms McKenzie said, predicting Glasgow would feature a plethora of announcements from businesses, as well as state, provincial and local governments. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor arrive in Glasgow with a policy to reach net zero by 2050, but no increase on the existing goal of cutting emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030. They will, however, produce projections showing Australia will likely reduce its greenhouse gases by 30-35 per cent by then anyway. The Morrison government's position has divided opinions. Boris Johnson heralded the 2050 goal as "heroic". CNN said the lack of an updated 2030 goal made Australia "the rich world's weakest link". John Connor, CEO of the Carbon Market Institute, said the lack of a stronger 2030 target would expose Australia to "potential carbon tariffs and higher capital costs". The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Emissions Gap report, released on Wednesday, argued the Paris Agreement signatory countries would need to cut emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C. Alok Sharma, the incoming COP26 President, said there had been "progress, but not enough" on cutting emissions. "We especially need the biggest emitters, the G20 nations, to come forward with stronger commitments to 2030 if we are to keep 1.5C in reach over this critical decade," Mr Sharma said. The UNEP report stated current climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for 2.7C of warming by the end of the 21st century - a catastrophic rise that one recent Australian report claimed would almost certainly wipe out Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Mr Morrison appears unlikely to be moved by international pressure over 2030 targets. "We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia," he said while launching the government's net zero plan on Tuesday. "The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It's about getting it done." But the Australian Government will be seeking to influence negotiations in Glasgow, particularly in the area of transparency of reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Ms McKenzie said the Australian government's focus on this area was "very welcome" and there were high hopes progress could be made at Glasgow. But it's a contested topic. Countries cling to their baseline years and reporting quirks to give themselves maximum advantage. Some nations like to sell carbon offsets to other nations, but then claim them against their own efforts - a double counting mechanism that Brazil in particular is reportedly fond of. According to Professor Frank Jotzo, Director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at ANU, transparency would be one of the "defining issues" in climate negotiations over the next few years, but currently "the default position is one of distrust between countries." "For example, with China, emissions data is in general not as transparent as it is for other countries," he said. "But conversely those concerns are also voiced with regard to Australia, because in our case the land sector and land-based emissions are an important part of the national emissions balance - and the estimation of those emissions is necessarily subject to much greater uncertainty than emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry." With Russia and Saudia Arabia joining China and Indonesia in adopting a net zero goal for 2060, some commentators have expressed concern this could act as a global drag on progress. All eyes will be on India, which has yet to announce its strategy for cutting emissions. Prof Jotzo said the world could eventually settle into three streams of climate ambition. "We're already seeing in the EU attempts to go for earlier net zero targets than 2050," he said. "So in due course we might well wind up with a group of countries that takes 2040 or 2045 as a target, one that takes 2050 and one that takes 2060." \</doc>

\~\~ The 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP26 ) opened on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015. \~\~ Chinese President Xi Jinping has on many occasions highlighted China's view on tackling the climate challenge, expressed China's firm support for the Paris Agreement and announced the country's concrete actions to protect the planet. \~\~ In his written statement to the World Leaders Summit at COP26 released on Monday, Xi reiterated a call for global unity and actions to address climate change and put forward three suggestions. \~\~ Uphold multilateral consensus \~\~ "When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription," Xi said in the statement, calling on all parties to build on the existing consensus, increase mutual trust and step up cooperation to deliver a successful COP26 . \~\~ At the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020, President Xi announced China's further commitments for 2030, making steady progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. \~\~ Earlier this month, he underscored the importance of sharing the fruits of green development among all countries when addressing the leaders' summit of the China-hosted 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15). \~\~ Focusing on concrete action \~\~ "Visions will come true only when we act on them," said Xi on Monday as he urged all countries to honor their commitment, set realistic targets and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures. \~\~ As the Chinese president has said, China always honors its words with actions. According to a climate change white paper released last week, the country's carbon emissions intensity in 2020 came down by 48.8 percent compared to 2005 and by 18.8 percent on the 2015 level, showing China takes the Paris Agreement seriously. \~\~ By the end of 2020, non-fossil fuels accounted for 16 percent of primary energy consumption in China and the country also phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity during the past decade. \~\~ China has launched green action initiatives that encourage green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework as well. In 2020, 57 percent of China's investment in BRI partner countries went to renewable energy projects, up from 38 percent in 2019. \~\~ Accelerating green transition \~\~ Xi on Monday highlighted the role of innovation in science and technology and called for the promotion of a greener economy and society and exploration of a new pathway that coordinates development with conservation. \~\~ China recently has published two key directives: a top-level design document for peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, and an action plan for peaking carbon emissions before 2030. \~\~ According to Xi, the country will further roll out specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement, coupled with supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, fiscal and taxation, and financial incentives. \~\~ These plans together will form China's "1+N" policy framework for helping the nation fulfill its pledge to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 with a clearly defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint. \~\~ HYPERLINK https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to- HYPERLINK COP26 -China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html \~\~\~\~SOURCE:CGTN \</doc>

As far as political debate goes, this federal election seems to be less about climate change than any in the past 15 years. Unlike in 2010, 2013 and 2016 - when governments were elected and leaders deposed over climate policy - this time there's no brutal contest over the issue. There are no calls for emissions trading schemes, no Greens HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/bob-brown-s-convoy-hurt-labor-says-richard-di-natale-20191006-p52y1e.html cavalcade into Queensland's coal-mining hinterland, and no Labor HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/adani-could-cost-labor-victory-on-may-18-20190509-p51lk5 prevarication over the Adani coal mine. The election is shaping up as a contest over other issues - leadership integrity, crisis management, economic nous and the cost of living. Even so, and although overshadowed by the COVID pandemic, the current term of government has been framed by extreme climate events - first the Black Summer bushfires and, more recently, floods. In 2019, climate change determined how HYPERLINK https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248268 about 13% of Australians voted. And while it's early days in the campaign, HYPERLINK https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7633277/climate-health-top-your-concerns-going-into-federal-election-campaign/ several \~ HYPERLINK polls suggest climate change remains a defining issue for voters this time around. If they're right, the Coalition is in trouble. Climate emergencies fuel climate anxiety Public anxiety over future climate damage is growing. The Lowy Institute HYPERLINK has found 60% of Australians now say global warming is a significant and pressing problem. The same poll showed 55% of Australians say the government's energy policy should prioritise "reducing carbon emissions" - up eight points since 2019. We can expect the climate vote to be driven by several factors. They include: personal experience of disaster and recovery, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's leadership on the issue, the government's performance in reducing emissions, power prices and energy security, and competing parties' credibility and promises on climate action. There is mixed evidence on how extreme weather affects voting intentions. For example, while HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358447878_Climate_change_experiences_raise_environmental_concerns_and_promote_Green_voting some studies say it benefits parties with greener policies, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/research-shows-voters-favour-financial-relief-after-disasters-but-we-need-climate-action-too-179028 others indicate voters prioritise economic security after a disaster. But the Morrison government has also been accused of HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-accept-the-criticism-scott-morrison-apologises-for-family-holiday-20191222-p53m6o.html weak leadership during recent disasters and being HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/history-repeating-morrison-too-slow-on-a-natural-disaster-20220309-p5a37f.html too slow to deliver assistance afterwards. Such perceptions, particularly in disaster-hit areas, are likely to weigh heavily against the government. The election, of course, will not be decided on the overall swing, but what happens in marginal seats and those where credible independent candidates - many of them with climate action high on their agendas - pose a real threat to incumbents. Some 25 electorates are likely to determine the next government. The 2019 election was only narrowly won by the Coalition and it HYPERLINK currently holds nine seats on a margin of less than 4%. Labor holds 14 marginal seats and independents hold two. Seven of these seats were hard hit by the Black Summer fires and this year's floods. Five are marginal seats held by the ALP - Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Macquarie and Gilmore in NSW, and Lilley in Queensland. If the fires and floods do swing votes this election, they're likely to secure Labor incumbents in these seats. The other two - Page in NSW and Gippsland in Victoria - are safe Nationals seats and likely to remain so. Independents campaigning on climate policy look set to challenge Liberal supremacy in three urban seats: HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-chill-winds-of-change-and-the-battle-for-goldstein-s-golden-mile-20220407-p5absh.html Goldstein in Victoria, and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/27/allegra-spender-wentworth-independent-hopeful-says-climate-action-is-vital-for-economy Wentworth and HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/meet-the-liberal-party-s-latest-problem-a-climate-driven-independent-20210917-p58sjz.html North Sydney in NSW.

A credibility problem Scott Morrison has a climate credibility problem. Having defined himself while treasurer by brandishing a HYPERLINK lump of coal in Parliament, as prime minister he's been accused of lacking empathy for victims of climate disasters. Morrison's trip to Hawaii during the Black Summer fires continues to haunt his reputation. And given the ongoing sensitivities around his disaster responsiveness, his government's assistance after the recent floods was surprisingly sluggish. Australia's low climate policy ambition and persistent refusal to increase its 2030 emissions target saw it branded a https://theconversation.com/the-australian-way-how-morrison-trashed-brand-australia-at-cop26-171670 laggard at last year's crucial United Nations climate summit in Glasgow.

But most momentum derives from HYPERLINK state and territory HYPERLINK https://www.routledge.com/The-Political-Economy-of-Coal-Obstacles-to-Clean-Energy-Transitions/Jakob-Steckel/p/book/9780367491024 dynamism and market competitiveness of the renewable energy sector itself.

The crucial indicator is the short-term national emissions target. The Coalition is sticking with a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Labor is aiming for a 43% cut in the same period. The Greens and independents want more, and would legislate their targets. While the Coalition has no renewable energy target, Labor is promising renewables will comprise 82% of the national grid by 2030. But how will they get there? This year's federal budget - which barely mentioned climate change - outline the Coalition's express commitments. It provides funding for liquified natural gas production, HYPERLINK https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/news/federal-budget-fails-to-prioritise-rapid-transition-to-renewable-energy but no declining funding for renewable energy. The budget also HYPERLINK https://budget.gov.au/2022-23/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs5.pdf offers $12.3 billion for road infrastructure and $3.7 billion for rail next year.

Labor is promising HYPERLINK https://alp.org.au/policies/rewiring_the_nation $20 billion for powergrid upgrades and renewables, HYPERLINK https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/labor-solar-batteries-mb2262/ $200 million for solar banks and community batteries, and a HYPERLINK https://www.alp.org.au/policies/electric_car_discount/ discount scheme for electric cars.

What will the next term bring? Obviously, we don't yet know the persuasion of the next government - nor whether it will rely on support from minor parties and independents.

At last Australia has a target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. It has taken a long time to reach this point and many fraught negotiations. But if ever there was a prime minister suited to understanding the significance of presenting at COP26 , it is the man who is disparaged as "Scotty from Marketing". He is now winging his way to the Glasgow meeting. He has a plan, which has been denigrated as merely a pamphlet. Even a planphlet by the wits and the wordsmiths. Despite their cynicism, it is the right document for the meeting he is about to attend. The UN Conference of Parties has never managed to fulfil the original vision of a serious forum in which countries negotiate and commit to achievable emissions-reduction targets to which they are able to hold one another accountable. For many years, renewable technology wasn't capable of powering a developed economy. It still isn't and countries remain unwilling to take an economic hit by relying too heavily on it . As a result, developed countries routinely fall short of their targets. The UN's 2021 Emissions Gap Report notes, for instance, that "Canada and the United States of America have submitted strengthened NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] targets, while independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their previous NDC targets with currently implemented policies". Consequently, they will be subjected to the sternest peer pressure. The UN gave up any pretence that there would be HYPERLINK https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/sanctions-and-punishment-barred-from-cop21-vocabulary/ sanctions or punishment Instead, the COP has become an enormous annual collaborative marketing campaign at which concerned parties advertise the climate crisis and their heartfelt desire to mitigate climate change by hosting a kind of international reality game show. Governments strive to agree to goals that may or may not be possible, depending on the technology they're willing to deploy. "Ambition" - the yearning rather than the completion - is highly prized. There is theoretically a pot of money to help poorer countries also sign up to ambitions, but most of it has yet to materialise. Part of the game is sledging each other for not being ambitious enough - that's the peer pressure part. When this is done well, it distracts from the fact that the most ambitious of the ambitions remain unfulfilled. Morrison and his Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, have understood there are no significant barriers or downsides to joining the game. Anybody can have ambition. They have also grasped that the gathering that accompanies the colossal marketing campaign has morphed into a technology trade expo. This makes it very worthwhile attending for a country with the ambition to secure technology investment. As such, Taylor will attend to "promote Australia as a safe and reliable destination to invest in gas, hydrogen and new energy technologies" and "advance Australia's low emissions partnerships". Some might call this a cynical use of the Conference of Parties. They would be right. It may also be the most realistic way to extract an outcome from COP26 and subsequent meetings - courting investment to develop technology that could help countries realise their climate ambitions is at least a tangible step towards transforming ambition into action. Australia committed to successful COP26 Summit in Glasgow @AngusTaylorMP\~#auspol\~pic.twitter.com/4FWteJDyEh  Political Alert (@political_alert) October 28, 2021 For Australian taxpayers, international investment would represent a welcome reduction to the bill for realising our own ambitions. We are currently on the hook for the new projects that form part of the "technology road map". Mining magnate Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest is currently shopping for government co-investment in his plan to create green hydrogen. This should serve as a reminder that, despite the government's slogan "technology not taxes", the replacement for the politically toxic carbon tax will be a big wodge of money out of the pooled taxes contributed by Australians, allocated by governments "picking winners". It would be nice to have this investment validated by an overseas vote of confidence that our money is going into a technology that others believe will one day pay a return. The large-scale Sun Cable project backed by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest recently received this kind of recognition from the Indonesian government. COP26 will be an opportunity to present to other potential investors. Perhaps you now see where I'm going with this. The Nationally Determined Contribution documents that countries take to COP26 are hardly worth the hemp they're printed on as commitments to reducing emissions. But Australia's is a canny prospectus for wooing investors into taxpayer-supported projects. Scotty from Marketing's pamphlet full of "technologies which don't yet exist", as detractors have derided them, may fudge its way ignobly to 2050, but its value lies in the message it sends to investors that there's a government willing to contribute significant funds to new technology. And there's nothing investors like better than state-sponsorship to turbo-charge the value of their shares. Our national head of marketing will be presenting his prospectus at the biggest green expo in the world. The opportunities created by the sense of urgency that the summit creates around climate are there to be seized and monetised. You might admire the PM for his savvy or savage him for his lack of climatory zeal, but the fact remains that Scott Morrison and COP are a perfect match for each other.

Glasgow | Western leaders at the COP26 summit in Glasgow have tried to salvage support for concerted global action on climate change but the world's biggest emitter, China, offered nothing new, India nominated 2070 as its net zero emissions target, and other big polluters Brazil and Russia did not show up. Amid dire warnings of the consequences of ongoing global inaction, summit host and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to at least think about the children and the world they were being bequeathed. "We are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster - record outputs and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2," he said. "All those promises will be nothing but blah blah blah - to coin a phrase - and the anger and impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change." US President Joe Biden acknowledged he had talked a big game in the lead-up to Glasgow but arrived with little after Congress refused to pass a massive spending bill that contained measures to reduce emissions. This, he said, would "demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table, but hopefully leading by the power of our example". No concrete targets "I know it hasn't been the case and that's why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words." The COP26 Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend Glasgow but issued the conference a written statement devoid of any new commitment. "Ancient Chinese believe that successful governance relies on solid action," it said. "I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all." Mr Johnson and his allies want COP26 to agree on ambitious 2050 and 2030 emissions reductions targets because the consensus is that only this level of commitment can restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - the now-agreed threshold above which climate change becomes catastrophic. French President Emmanuel Macron said, "the largest emitters whose national strategies do not match our strategy of 1.5 ... must scale up". Buy key polluter Russia and Brazil were among the absentees - although Brazil issued a press statement saying it had boosted its 2030 emissions reduction target from 43 per cent to 50 per cent, from an unclear baseline, and would aim for "carbon neutrality" by 2050. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose nation faces significant challenges reducing emissions, outlined a series of pledges that he called "five elixirs". There were net zero emissions by 2070, the generation of 500 gigawatts of power using non-fossil fuels by 2030, reducing carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2030, reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, and having 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Mr Modi put the onus back on the individual consumer, calling for a new mass movement towards more sustainable lifestyles, backed by "an institutional framework". "Today, instead of mindless and destructive consumption we need mindful and deliberate utilisation," he said. He said lifestyle changes should range across areas including diet, fashion, housing, packaging, energy and water management. Madhura Joshi, an analyst at the think tank E3G, said India's commitments were encouraging. "They can deliver net zero by 2070, and India can hopefully achieve this much earlier," she said. "India often does better than its set targets. The stage is now set for a step change in clean investment." HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/pm-makes-his-technology-sales-pitch-to-the-world-20211102-p5953x Prime Minister Scott Morrison used his contribution to formally commit to net zero emission by 2050 and plug his technology-based approach as the solution to the policy gap between developed and developing nations that is stopping universal global action on global warming. Mr Morrison said developing affordable and scalable low-emissions technology was the only realistic mechanism for major emitters such as India and China to come on board. "We can't control the costs of carbon-based fuels in China or in India or in Indonesia. But what we can do is work with those countries to ensure the technologies that they're adopting for their industrial growth and their strength and their jobs is low emissions and low costs," he said. A dominant feature of the summit was a row over money between the rich West and the developing world, as leaders of poor countries excoriated their wealthy peers for failing to open their wallets. About 60 leaders took the podium on Monday, and many laid bare the divisions over rich countries' failure to meet a target of stumping up $US100 billion ($133 billion) a year that would help fund developing countries' climate transition costs. The issue is critical to COP26 's success because many poorer countries are reluctant to take major climate action without rich-country support. They say the already-developed world wants them to sacrifice their development to meet West-imposed targets. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tried to stir global action by telling leaders "we are digging our own graves". "It's time to say \' enough'," he said. "Enough of brutalising biodiversity, enough of killing ourselves with carbon, enough of treating nature like a toilet, enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper." \</doc>

Glasgow | Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 has divided opinion at COP26 in Glasgow, with some welcoming it as a step forward and others saying it did not go far enough. Mr Modi used his intervention during the leaders' summit to propose five "elixirs": a suite of new energy-transition targets for the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. He said India would this decade get 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewables by 2030, up from 40 per cent now, and generate 500 gigawatts of non-fossil-based energy. He also pledged that by 2030 carbon emissions would decrease by 1 billion tonnes, and the carbon intensity of the economy (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) would decline 45 per cent. But the headline was a promise to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 - much later than the West's benchmark of 2050 and even China's target of 2060. Some press reports and climate analysts welcomed the announcement as "a step forward", "encouraging" and "realistic". "The Prime Minister has set India firmly on a clean energy pathway. This can deliver net-zero by 2070, and India could hopefully achieve this much earlier," said Madhura Joshi, a senior associate at the environmental think tank E3G. She said that although some might say India had left wide "wriggle room" to keep using coal, it was an increasingly uneconomical fuel and not one that India would ultimately need. \' The dance of politics' The CEO of the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water, Arunabha Ghosh, told The Guardian that Mr Modi's announcement was "real climate action", and Grantham Research Institute professor Nicholas Stern said it "demonstrated real leadership" and was "a very significant moment for the summit". But one climate analyst told The Australian Financial Review that 2070 was a "ludicrous" target, and that the positive reception Mr Modi had received was "part of the dance of politics". Mr Modi may be getting the benefit of the doubt as some summiteers try to maintain a sense of positivity and forward momentum at COP26 - particularly after India joined the group of countries blocking action on coal at the G20 summit in Rome. The rich nations might also be motivated to welcome Mr Modi's pledge because they need to be seen to understand the greater challenges faced by developing countries - many of which have used the summit to complain of a lack of moral and financial support from wealthier economies. Mr Modi used his speaking slot at COP26 to position himself as a champion of poorer nations, saying "India understands and shares the pain of other developing countries and has continuously been vocal about their expectations". He also made an unconventional foray into the consumer-politics end of the climate challenge, saying "lifestyles play a very important role in climate change". He said India wanted to "take lifestyle forward as a movement", underpinned by "an institutional framework" that would shift people's consumption habits in areas as diverse as diet, packaging, housing, clothing and fashion, energy and water management. "Today, instead of mindless and destructive consumption, we need mindful and deliberate utilisation," he said. \</doc>

As we wake to daily news of Russian attacks on Ukraine's hospitals and homes and on women, children and the elderly while they shelter or flee, last year's COP26 commitment to net zero seems a faint memory. In modern Europe, you'd think the invasion of a sovereign nation wouldn't be tolerated - that European democracies would at least cease trade with the aggressor. The EU and UK have imposed some sanctions on Russia. But they won't do the one thing that would hurt most: ban Russian energy imports. Nearly half Russia's oil, gas and mineral exports go to the EU and UK. In 2020, Russia's revenue from these exports exceeded its total military spending. The UK, reliant on Russia for eight per cent of oil and four per cent of gas, will phase out Russian oil imports this year and \£d"explore options" to reduce gas imports. The EU, dependent on Russia for 40 per cent of gas and 25 per cent of oil, has baulked at this. Instead, it has proposed "an outline of a plan" for independence from Russian fossil fuels before 2030. The EU resisted banning Russian banks from SWIFT, eventually agreeing to exclude just seven banks but not those handling most oil and gas payments. So, for now, the EU and UK continue to pay Russia circa $US400 ($A530) million a day for energy and, as a result, fund Moscow's war crimes in Ukraine. This is what happens when you're beholden to a rogue state for energy. Ending Russian energy imports would cripple European industry, send energy prices soaring and leave millions vulnerable to hypothermia and death next winter. The EU and UK are also increasingly reliant on gas power. In 1990, gas accounted for eight per cent of EU electricity production and under two per cent for UK compared to around 20 per cent and 40 per cent today. Gas provides baseload power as countries increase intermittent, weather-dependent wind and solar. This isn't a theoretical issue. In 2021, wind power production in the EU and UK slumped markedly due to a wind drought. Meanwhile, EU and UK domestic gas and oil production has plunged with bans on new North Sea exploration and on fracking. The EU imports 90 per cent of its gas and 97 per cent of its oil products. Fifty years ago, the EU countries and UK produced nearly as much gas as Russia. Now Russia produces around seven times more. And replacing Russian gas is extremely difficult \£dbecause it's delivered through fixed pipelines that can't just be redirected to ports. Fracking enables extraction of hard-to-reach gas and oil from rocks, providing resources for countries without conventional reserves. In the United States, fracking and gas power delivered energy independence and falling emissions. Scientists say fracking is completely safe if properly regulated. But fracking has been demonised by a campaign of lies; with serious claims this campaign has been supported by Russian disinformation and funding to stifle competing gas production. The EU's move away from nuclear power is crazy. Nuclear provides safe, abundant, reliable electricity with zero emissions. The International Energy Agency estimates 812gw of nuclear power is required to achieve net zero by 2050. On current projections, this will fall 33gw short. Non-OECD countries lead new nuclear power, with China and Russia dominating. But the UK is embracing nuclear power with the first new plant to open in 2026 and a second in advanced approval stage. The UK government and private sector have also provided \£3450 million to fund the design of small modular reactor technology. There's a hard lesson here for Australia. We're moving to greater solar and wind power and rely on China for renewable and battery products and the minerals required to manufacture them. Fracking is subject to protests and bans, and nuclear power is banned nationally. Australian governments should encourage mining of rare earth elements and other minerals for renewables and batteries. We have the third largest global reserves of rare earth elements but mine almost none. We should also manufacture new energy technologies, which means having all options on the table for \£dreliable electricity. We should lift the ban on nuclear power, not least to support high-\£denergy industries and electrified land transport. We should reject the unscientific bans and other hurdles on fracking. And environmental groups should be subject to stringent transparency and accountability rules to confirm they're not funded by foreign states. To Russia and China, net zero means increasing their own fossil fuel and nuclear energy while mining and manufacturing to supply \£dWestern democracies with gas and renewables. Europe's response to Ukraine exposes the fantasy of net zero rhetoric that's less about reducing emissions and more about dependence on Russian gas. Australia must avoid the same relationship with China. Nyunggai Warren Mundine AO is author of Speaking My Mind and Warren Mundine - In Black and White @nyunggai \</doc>

AGL, the largest Australian power company, has pledged to bring forward the closures of its remaining coal-burning power stations in Victoria and New South Wales. As heavy emitters face intensifying pressure to curtail their use of planet-heating fossil fuels, AGL on Thursday said it would remove coal from its electricity generation mix by 2045 at the latest - three years earlier than previously planned. The announcement has disappointed climate advocates, who have been ramping up demands for the company to exit coal much earlier. The United Nations has called for developed countries to remove coal from their power networks by 2030 in order to avert catastrophic levels of climate change. Under AGL's new closure dates, its Bayswater coal plant in NSW, which had been scheduled to retire in 2036, would now shut in 2033. Its newest coal generator, the Loy Yang A generator in Victoria's Latrobe Valley, would have its closure brought forward from 2048 to 2045. AGL said the earlier closures would cut its emissions by between 18-27 per cent a year from 2025-34, and by 55-60 per cent a year from 2025-30. "The readiness of the entire energy system to operate without our critical baseload generation will determine whether the earlier, more ambitious targets in the range can be achieved," the company said. The viability of AGL's coal operations have increasingly been in doubt as the rapid rise of cheaper-to-run renewable energy across the country drives daytime wholesale power prices to levels where fossil fuels struggle to compete. Volatile prices across the east-coast energy grid helped push AGL to a $2 billion net loss in the 12 months to June 30. On Thursday, AGL posted a 41 per cent drop in underlying profit to $194 million for the six months to December 31. However, its bottom-line result returned to profit following heavy writedowns the previous year. The board declared a first-half dividend of 16\£2 per share, down from 41\£2 a year earlier. Chief executive Graeme Hunt still described the result as "solid" against the backdrop of reduced demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, milder weather and growing uptake of rooftop solar panels. AGL is the nation's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, accounting for up to 8 per cent of Australia's carbon footprint. As the shift to renewable energy squeezes fossil fuels further out of Australia's electricity market, AGL last year declared the "winds of change" had swept the sector much faster than anticipated, prompting the company to embark on plans for a historic demerger, creating a new entity called Accel Energy to own its fleet of large coal- and gas-fired generators. The other, to be called AGL Australia, will hold its electricity, gas and telecommunications retailing business along with some cleaner generation assets. The revised power-plant closure dates were announced on Thursday as part of new climate goals unveiled for both demerged businesses. The company said AGL Australia would also bring forward its target to reach "net-zero" emissions - a pledge to remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it releases - to 2040. AGL had already vowed to shut its Liddell power plant in NSW next year, which will strip out about 5 per cent of the electricity sector's emissions. However, with other coal-fired generators across the business licensed to run until the late 2040s, the company has faced mounting pressure from green groups and powerful investors alike to commit to vastly stronger emissions cuts. More than half of AGL's investors including US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p58tos defied the board and voted to support an activist climate resolution at the company's annual general meeting in September requesting consideration of new goals that would compel an earlier coal exit than planned. While coal today makes up more than 60 per cent of Australia's electricity mix, an international push for developed countries to phase out coal-fired electricity by 2030 has been building. An agreement endorsed by nearly 200 nations at last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow included for the first time a pledge to begin curtailing coal from the energy mix. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described coal as a "deadly addiction, while COP26 president Alok Sharma called on world leaders to "consign coal to history". Because electricity production is a dominant source of Australia's emissions, reducing output from coal plants would help sharply reduce the national carbon footprint. However, concerns have been building across the industry that HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56oub unexpectedly early shutdowns of coal-fired generators could threaten the reliability of the nation's power market and cause price volatility in the future. The Morrison government argues gas is vital to ensuring affordable and reliable power as the energy transition accelerates, and is pushing ahead with a controversial plan to build a Commonwealth-owned gas-fired generator at Kurri Kurri in NSW. It is also driving the development of a so-called "capacity mechanism" aimed at spurring private investment in assets including gas, pumped hydro and batteries that are capable of supplying on-demand power when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.

Respected scientific research group Climate Action Tracker has given a withering assessment of Australia's climate policies in a shock report that warned of global temperature rises of 2.4 degrees by the end of this century. Despite a rush of fresh targets to reduce carbon emissions this decade at COP26 in Glasgow - but not from Australia - the CAT said policy implementation on the ground was advancing at a snail's pace. The CAT report criticised Australia on a number of fronts, including that it refused to cut out coal-fired power by 2030 and that it subsidised gas production. The report was compiled ahead of the Australian government's pre- COP26 pledge for net zero by 2050. But Canberra was chastised for ramping up a "gas-fired recovery" over a green economic recovery and its refusal to increase a 2030 domestic emissions target. The CAT's new overall rating for Australia is "highly insufficient". Global temperature rises above 2\'b0C are predicted to create a maelstrom of deadly environmental impacts from record heatwaves, rises in sea levels, destruction of ice sheets and ocean devastation, including of coral reefs. "Under current policies (rather than the pledges), we estimate end-of-century warming to be 2.7\'b0C," the report says. If all 2030 pledges are factored in, the rise is still estimated at 2.4\'b0C. "While this temperature estimate has fallen since our September 2020 assessment, major new policy developments are not the driving factor. We need to see a profound effort in all sectors, in this decade, to decarbonise the world to be in line with 1.5\'b0C," CAT report authors said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's ambassador to the United Nations, warned of island nations being overwhelmed: "Beyond 1.5 we cannot imagine a future. It is not a number for negotiation." The CAT report said: "Even with all new Glasgow pledges for 2030, we will emit roughly twice as much in 2030 as required for 1.5\'b0. Therefore, all governments need to reconsider their targets." Earlier global warming predictions, including one issued last week by the International Energy Agency, were more optimistic: that the world was heading to 1.8\'b0C of warming; but that analysis was based on the longer 2050 pledges, and with a caveat that all of the promises were carried out. "Glasgow was meant to keep the Paris agreement's 1.5\'b0C limit in sight, but the 2030 emissions gap is still so huge that we can't really see that being possible at present," Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said. He said some countries were trying to portray that the 1.5\'b0C limit was achievable on current policies and they were downplaying the need for urgent and immediate changes. COP26 president Alok Sharma said there had been a number of reports and analyses of national country commitments, all demonstrating there has been some progress - but he agreed it was "clearly not enough (action)." "If we look at where we were heading before Paris, the trajectory was heading to six degrees of global warming; post Paris commitments to below four degrees, and now we have bent the curve towards two degrees," Mr Sharma said. "That is not good enough, we want to say with credibility we are keeping 1.5 alive, within reach." Mr Sharma refused to address a question whether countries like Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Australia were standing in the way of negotiations around transparency. Negotiators are spending the next few days debating the wording of the "cover" agreement that may be announced at the end of COP26 this weekend, and whether annual reporting may be required of nations to achieve a 2030 target. Australian Conservation Foundation manager Gavan McFadzean said Australia was one of a small number of countries that didn't update their 2030 carbon emissions target and there was a push from other countries to make them accountable. He told The Australian: "There may be some wording about countries who haven't revised their 2030 target to do it next year. These are the countries that have been frankly recalcitrant until this point and other countries are exasperated and looking for diplomatic ways to continue to turn the screws on Australia's performance." \</doc>

Australian companies and governments switching their fleets to low-emission vehicles will accelerate the rollout of charging stations, increase supply, and drive down prices for electric cars and trucks across the country. Ahead of the March 29 budget, The Weekend Australian can reveal the federal government's expanded $250m future fuels fund will be made available for businesses transitioning to low-emission light and heavy vehicle fleets. The electric vehicle funding drive, a key plank of the government's future fuels strategy, will also speed-up the construction of EV charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor, who will announce the commercial fleet push in Melbourne on Saturday, said he was focused on helping businesses "embrace technologies that help to both save on their operation costs and reduce emissions". "This fleets-first approach will also create a larger market for second-hand vehicles, which will improve affordability and accessibility for other consumers," Mr Taylor said. "Including hydrogen refuelling as a priority area will help accelerate the decarbonisation of heavy and long distance vehicle fleets where battery EVs may not be a viable option." Australian Renewable Energy Agency chief executive Darren Miller, who is overseeing the grants program, said "assisting fleet users to move to zero-emission vehicles means getting more zero-emission cars and trucks on the road sooner and driving the road transport sector towards a net zero future". "By getting these vehicles on the road as soon as possible we'll reduce emissions in the short term and help to create a market for second-hand vehicles, giving more consumers the option of switching to a ZEV with their next vehicle purchase," Mr Miller said. "We're confident the future fuels program will continue that great work and drive down Australia's transport emissions." Mr Taylor, who will launch the $128m funding boost for low-emission fleets at SEA Electric Australia, said the government was backing businesses that want to switch to future fuel technologies "where it makes sense for their fleets". "We will not force Australians out of the vehicle they want to drive or put the costs up for those who can afford it the least," he said. The Future Fuels strategy, released following the COP26 Glasgow summit last year, is a central pillar of the government's $2.1bn investment in low- and zero-emission technologies. Shifting companies and governments to low-emission vehicles has been identified by both the Coalition and Labor as a top priority to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 due to the large -impact of commercial fleets. \</doc>

A group of Liberal backbenchers facing election challenges from independent candidates have renewed calls for a more ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target in the wake of the COP26 summit. The conference's final communique called on all nations to "revisit and strengthen" their 2030 targets at next year's summit in Egypt, with COP26 president Alok Sharma acknowledging the current pledges don't go far enough. Australia signed the agreement but on Sunday the federal government confirmed that its 2030 target wouldn't be changing, despite its own modelling predicting it will be comfortably beaten. "Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it as we did with our\~Kyoto-era targets," Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Energy Minister Angus Taylor said in a joint statement. Jason Falinski, a Liberal backbencher based on Sydney's northern beaches, says the 2030 target should not be changed as it was an election commitment. He's instead raised a new date. "COP27 [in 2022] will move to targets for 2035 and that will become the medium-term target that nations will be asked to look at and that obviously creates scope for countries like Australia to look at their projections," he told the ABC. Mr Falinski did not put a specific target on the 2035 date but said it should be "as high as possible in a manner and form that protects both our environment and the economic opportunities that Australia". "As a matter of democratic faith, any update to our 2035 target needs to be taken to the people at an election so they can compare and contrast," Mr Falinski said. Several other Liberal MPs are agitating for the same outcome. Some think a 45 to 55 per cent emissions reduction target by 2035 is realistic, while others are unwilling to speculate until they see detailed modelling. COP26 outcome as important progress but did not commit to revisiting and strengthening the 2030 targets\~Australia signed up to. "It reminds me of Prince Hal to Hotspur in Henry IV \- 'I never promised to pay thee, but now that I'm here I'll pay thee double,' "he told the ABC. Senator Payne and Mr Taylor also pushed back against critics of Australia's climate change policy and ambition, noting the government was achieving its targets unlike some other nations. "The Morrison Government will always stand up for and make decisions in Australia's national interest, and we will do what's right for rural and regional communities," they said. "Australia's economy is almost unique amongst developed countries, with an economy specialised in the production of energy- and emissions-intensive commodities." Labor: 'They failed miserably' The Federal Opposition called for more clarity on the government's position on 2030 and also criticised the backbencher's push for a 2035 target. Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen said voters should not be convinced by Liberal backbenchers trying to differentiate themselves. "This is just the normal sort of posturing we get from MPs pretending to be different from a government that they are a member of," Mr Bowen told the ABC. "They failed miserably to get the government to increase their 2030 target and to shift the target to 2035 is a pretty big cop-out." On Sunday, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said that if the government had signed up for an increased 2022 target then it needed to detail that before the election. "What we see from Scott Morrison is someone who is not sure whether he is actually going to change his position on climate change, because he is all things to all people, [that's what] he is trying to be," Mr Albanese said. Labor is yet to unveil its own 2030 plans, having ditched the 45 per cent emission reduction target it took to the 2019 election. \</doc>

COP26 pledges could slow warming GLOBAL warming could be halted at 1.9 degrees, arguably just inside the Paris Agreement limit, if all COP26 emissions reductions pledges are fulfilled, according to "highly credible" new modelling. The projections by the group Climate Resource take into account new promises to slash emissions made just before and during the COP26 conference in Glasgow. Eleven nations have announced new targets since October 18, including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and India. The 1.9 degree prediction is a vast improvement on the 2.7 degrees of warming associated with previous pledges to cut emissions. Researchers for the paper, including Associate Professor Malte Meinshausen from the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, said: "For the first time in history, the aggregate effect of the combined pledges by 194 countries might bring the world to below 2C warming with more than a 50 per cent chance." The improved scenario was largely attributable to China's recently reaffirmed target to get to net zero by 2060, and India's announcement it would get there by 2070, researchers said. The two nations are the first and third biggest emitters, collectively responsible for more than a third of total greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere. Dr Simon Bradshaw from the Climate Council said the analysis was "highly credible", but it "hinges on the assumption that pledges will be backed by the necessary policies and actions across energy and land use, and that funding is adequate to ensure their implementation". "While real progress, it is still a long way from what is necessary to 'keep 1.5C alive'. That will require countries coming back with new and stronger commitments for this decade," Dr Bradshaw said. The analysis comes after US Climate Envoy John Kerry cited other experts who said the world still had a 60 per cent chance of limiting global warming at 1.5C. The most recent IPCC report showed the world had already warmed close to 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. Professor Will Steffen said a 1.9C warmer world would certainly be better than one that was 2.5C or 3C hotter, but we shouldn't "underestimate how much more difficult a 1.9 degree warmer world is going to be to live in". "First of all with a huge degree of probability, the Great Barrier Reef would be gone," he said. "We know that at two degrees of warming it's virtually gone, and 1.9 is close to that." A 1.9C warmer world would entail higher sea levels, more damage from coastal erosion, more extreme bushfire weather and regular 50 degree days in cities such as Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, Prof Steffen said.

\~\~Some Liberal MPs want Australia to commit to stronger 2035 emissions cuts as the Morrison government refuses to budge on its target for this decade. \~\~ NSW MP Dave Sharma thinks it's doable to reduce emissions between 40 and 45 per cent by 2035. \~\~ "It's a modest stretch, but it's not a big stretch," he told Sky News on Monday. \~\~ Countries agreed at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to accelerate the phasing down, but not out, of coal after lobbying by countries including India. \~\~ "The direction of travel is is clear; it's away from fossil fuels," Mr Sharma said. \~\~ "If we're serious about reducing our emissions, we need to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels." \~\~ Energy Minister Angus Taylor has ruled out increasing Australia's existing pledge of cutting emissions by 26 to 28 per cent this decade. \~\~ This is despite Australia being a signatory to a COP26 agreement calling on countries to revisit their mid-term targets. \~\~ "We have a process which is proven, which has delivered far more than most countries in the world in terms of emissions reductions," Mr Taylor told ABC radio. \~\~ "And that process is one where we update predictions each year." \~\~ The world's failure at COP26 to agree to phase out coal has been trumpeted by Nationals senator Matt Canavan as a great result for Australia's mining industry. \~\~ "Given the fact that the agreement did not say that coal needs to be phased down or taken out, it is a big green light for us to build more coal mines," he told the Nine Network. \~\~ But one of the architects of the Paris Agreement, Robert Orr, does not think global investors will be rushing to support coalmining in Australia or anywhere. \~\~ "It's safe to say that the so-called Australian way to net zero was pretty heavily criticised in Glasgow by a range of parties," the special adviser on climate change to the UN secretary-general told ABC radio. \~\~ Australia has a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 that relies on voluntary action from the private sector. \~\~ It's plan anticipates getting 85 per cent of the way there by 2050 and relies on "further technological improvements" to make up the gap to zero. \~\~ "The final 15 per cent ... the technologies we expect to play a role, they are primarily technologies we are already investing in," Mr Taylor said. \~\~ Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese plans to release Labor's 2030 emissions target before the year's end. \~\~ He accuses the Morrison government of hypocrisy for signing up to a UN push for higher 2030 targets only to walk away from it. \</doc>

The livestock industry must not become the sacrificial lamb or cow of key global climate change talks in Glasgow this week, the head of Australia's billion-dollar red-meat sector says. Jason Strong, the managing director of Meat and Livestock Australia, which oversees the expenditure of more than $100m in livestock producer levies annually, has backed Australia's decision not to sign up to the US and European-backed Global Methane Pledge ahead of the crucial summit. The pledge, for a 30 per cent reduction in methane emissions on 2020 levels by 2030, has gained the support of about 80 nations but not some of the world's big emitters such as Russia, China and Brazil. Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said Australia would not support the target. Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said a 30 per cent cut in emissions would have a disastrous impact on the beef, feedlot, dairy and coal mining sectors. Methane makes up about 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions - with the livestock industry responsible for roughly half of that. Mr Strong said the sector was already a world leader when it came to reducing emissions. "When you think about the contribution of livestock, so often the poor old cow gets maligned in this whole discussion," Mr Strong said. "(The livestock industry accounts for) half of the methane emissions but the addition to that is that it's only 10 per cent (of total emissions). And ... it's actually been halved since 2005. "So we have all this discussion around livestock, largely from the people who are responsible for the other 90 per cent. We've all got our part to play and livestock, particularly cattle, have already done a massive amount of the heavy lifting." Mr Strong said breakthroughs on genetics, enabling farmers to turn off livestock at a younger age and a heavier weight, and progress with technology, in particular methane-reducing feedstuffs, meant the red-meat industry was more than halfway to meeting its goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. He said the industry recorded "some quick wins upfront when we didn't know much about where the specific areas of progress were going to come from first" and expects the remaining percentage to be somewhat more challenging. "Maybe it was the easy half but we've still got the best part of nine years to go (to reach the target) so it is OK ... it's definitely achievable and something which the sector remains committed to." Mr Strong said expected "bonuses along the way" to carbon neutrality by 2030 included climate neutrality "where we no longer contribute to warming". "This is what so much of the conversation is about," he said. "The Australian sheep industry is already there and the beef industry has got a line of sight to that in the next few years." Debate about the importance of the industry in Glasgow comes as Australia's beef farmers enjoy record prices. The benchmark Eastern Young Cattle Indicator hit a new high of 1075.8c/kg last week - and currently is tracking almost 25 per cent of this time last year and more than double its rate of early November 2019. Mr Strong said the fundamentals of the beef industry were "as about as exciting as it gets". "Is it sustainable? The short answer is yes but that's obviously not at the record prices," he said. "We are in a position where we've seen a sustainable improvement and sophistication of the red-meat supply chain and we are seeing the benefits of the industry's investment and commitment over the last 20 or 30 years in increased market access, in more consistent, high-quality product that is targeted to higher-value committed consumers and we are seeing a connection along the supply chain. "We've absolutely got some drivers around it at the moment around supply and demand, which are certainly peaking those prices, but we are also seeing a benefit of all of the investment and effort the industry has put in." \</doc>

You've probably heard about COP26 - the meeting of global leaders in the Scottish city of Glasgow. If you're aren't sure what it's all about, 'COP' stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It's an initiative of the United Nations, and amazingly, COPs on climate change have been taking place for nearly 30 years. COP21, which took place in Paris in 2015, resulted in the Paris Agreement, which saw participating nations agree to limit global warming to below two degrees. This year marks the 26th annual summit - hence the name COP26 . The Lowy Institute confirms that six in ten Australians say 'global warming is a serious and pressing problem'. But for anyone eager to support climate action, it can be frustrating to watch COP26 unfold as politicians and bureaucrats wrangle over what needs to be done. The good news is that as investors we can take action by supporting sustainable investments. Investing directly in companies delivering clean energy for example. But for low-cost diversification across a wide variety of sustainable businesses it's hard to go past exchange traded funds (ETFs). That said, the issue of 'greenwashing', making an investment sound more eco-friendly than it really is, is a growing problem. So it really pays to look under the hood of a fund to understand what your money is supporting. As a guide to the benefits of an ETF, fund manager - Vanguard, which is one of the goliaths of the ETF market, launched an Ethically Conscious Australian Shares ETF in late 2020. It invests in around 250 listed Aussie companies - far more than most of us could hold directly, but it screens out those engaged in fossil fuels, nuclear energy and the like. So it ticks the box for sustainability. ETFs also tick the box for value. The Vanguard fund for instance has an annual fund fee of just 0.16 per cent. The 2021 Responsible Investment Benchmark Report from the Responsible Investment Association of Australia (RIAA) shows that investing sustainably doesn't have to mean sacrificing strong returns. The RIAA found responsible Australian share funds notched up gains averaging 7.4 per cent and 8.1 per cent annually over the past five and 10 years respectively. International funds with a sustainable focus performed even better with five- and 10-year returns of 11.4 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively. Of course, past returns are no guide for the future. But as the RIAA notes, money is jumping ship to ethical investments. In Australia, the responsible investment market has soared in popularity to be worth $1.2 trillion in 2020. Ethical investing could be the way for you to help the planet while also helping to grow your wealth.

The Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), with the UK and its Italian partners, agreed today new dates for the COP26 UN climate conference, which will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021 in Glasgow. The agreement followed consultation with UNFCCC members, delivery partners and the international climate community. The conference was originally set to take place in November 2020, but had been postponed due to COVID-19. In the run up to November 2021, the UK as hosts will continue to work with all involved to increase climate action, build resilience and lower emissions. The new date will also allow the UK and our Italian partners to harness our incoming G7 and G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition. The decision on the new date comes as the UK Government announces that over 25 experts in multiple global sectors will be advising the COP26 Presidency. The Friends of COP bring expertise from countries across six continents, including France, Barbados, Chad, Australia, India and Peru. They will advise the UK Government and inspire action from their sectors ahead of the conference. The Friends of COP include Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General on Climate Action, Eric Garcetti, Mayor of Los Angeles and Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation. COP26 President and Secretary of State for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Alok Sharma, said: While we rightly focus on fighting the immediate crisis of the Coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change. With the new dates for COP26 now agreed we are working with our international partners on an ambitious roadmap for global climate action between now and November 2021. The steps we take to rebuild our economies will have a profound impact on our societies' future sustainability, resilience and wellbeing and COP26 can be a moment where the world unites behind a clean resilient recovery. Everyone will need to raise their ambitions to tackle climate change and the expertise of the Friends of COP will be important in helping boost climate action across the globe. Italian Minister for the Environment, Land and Sea Protection, Sergio Costa, said: I am glad that consultations with Parties have made it possible to collectively and quickly agree new dates for COP26. The new dates mean the conference will be at a time when the Covid-19 tragedy will be behind us and we will be able to ensure inclusiveness, for us a fundamental prerequisite for an ambitious COP26 based on global commitment to action. Between now and November 2021 we will take advantage of every international opportunity to increase ambition and mobilization, also harnessing the G20 under the Italian Presidency and the G7 under the British Presidency. Carolina Schmidt Zald\'edvar, COP25 President and Minister of Environment of Chile said: It is very important that we continue to push for climate action, and having quickly agreed on new dates for COP26 is a sign of this commitment. While the subsidiary body sessions (SB52) were also postponed 4-12 October 2020, the work of the Parties and stakeholders will continue through virtual meetings such as the upcoming 'June Momentum'. The urgency with which governments and the way in which countries promote recovery from the post-COVID-19 crisis will directly affect the other serious global crisis we are experiencing: global warming and climate change crisis. That is why we will continue to strongly mobilize all actors. We need more ambition to reduce emissions, to build resilience and to cooperate with each other. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said: Our efforts to address climate change and COVID-19 are not mutually exclusive. If done right, the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable climate path. We honour those who we have lost by working with renewed commitment and continuing to demonstrate leadership and determination in addressing climate change, and building a safe, clean, just and resilient world.

MADRID, Spain -- There was standing room only as ministers, diplomats, activists and journalists gathered at the IFEMA conference centre in Madrid to mark Africa Day at the COP 25 climate meeting. Speakers called for a united front to tackle the challenges of climate change in Africa. In the opening statement for Africa Day on Tuesday, Yasmin Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environmental Affairs, on behalf of the African Union, said: "We have, and will continue to engage and to seek landing grounds on the outstanding issues. But we must flag our concern at the apparent reluctance by our interlocutors to engage on issues of priority to developing countries, as evidenced by the large number of such issues which have simply been pushed from session to session without any progress." Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent's cause. "The climate disaster issues confronting the continent demand a predictable and unified response," said UN ASG Mohamed Beavogui, Director General of African Risk Capacity, an agency of theAfrican Union( HYPERLINK http://www.AU.int www.AU.int ) that helps governments respond to natural disasters. "Africa needs to move towards market-based innovative financing models to achieve a strong, united, resilient and globally influential continent. The future of Africa depends on solidarity." Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the ECA would support African countries to revise their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to attract private sector investments in clean energy. "The lack of concerted and meaningful global ambition and action to tackle climate change poses an existential threat to African populations," Songwe said. The Paris Agreement is the guiding force of current climate negotiations. It calls on nations to curb temperature increases at 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain rises within 1.5\'b0C. The next step is to implement NDCs, which set out national targets under the Paris Agreement. While African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate resilient and low-carbon economies in their NDCs, the continent's position is that it should not be treated the same as developed nations as its carbon emissions constitute a fraction of the world's big economies. "The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) remains committed to partnering with other institutions in providing the requisite support to AU member states in reviewing and updating their NDCs," said Estherine Fotabong, Director of Programmes at AUDA-NEPAD. Barbara Creecy, South Africa's Environment Minister and current chair of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, said the Africa Day event should come up with new ideas to enhance the implementation of NDCs in Africa. Africa is already responding positively to the challenge of climate change, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, citing huge investment interest in renewables at the Bank's Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg. "Clearly, we are a continent that has what it takes to create the Africa that we want to see happen. I believe what has been the missing link is the ability to brand right and to act on the market signals," Nyong said. "We continue to present Africa as a vulnerable case and not as a business case with opportunities. In fact, where we have attempted the latter, the results have been spot-on." Chief Fortune Charumbira, Vice President of the Pan-African Parliament, said robust climate legislation was key. "The world's response to the challenge has shown that legislation is imperative to cement efforts employed by various stakeholders; from the Paris Agreement to Nationally Determined Contributions," he said. Amb. Josefa Sacko, Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission, said climate change affected sectors key to Africa's socio-economic development, such as agriculture, livestock and fisheries, energy, biodiversity and tourism. She called on African countries to take stock of the Paris Agreement, and its implementation around finance capacity building and technology.

EIB Group financing will support EUR 1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainable investment in the decade to 2030. EIB Group will align all financing activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement from the end of 2020 The EIB will increase its financing activities dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability to reach 50% of its operations in 2025 The EIB will phase out financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021 At the COP 25 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU bank, will be discussing how its new climate action roadmap and recent decision to phase out support for unabated fossil fuel energy projects can support European Union leadership on international climate action. The EIB delegation will engage with national governments, the private sector and civil society as well as fellow financial and European institutions to debate how more climate finance can be mobilized to tackle the climate emergency. In addition, the EIB will be signing a number of new financing agreements to promote solar energy projects in Spain and climate action investments in Latin America. 'The climate emergency is the top issue on the political agenda of our time. We must change course to a carbon neutral future and limit damage from the impact of climate change. That means every country, every industry and every institution needs to do its share,' said EIB President Werner Hoyer. 'The EU bank has decided to greatly strengthen its ambition. We will stop financing unabated fossil fuels, launch the most ambitious climate investment roadmap of any International Financial Institution and propose an energy transition package to leave no one behind. We will serve as the financial engine of the European Green Deal under the new European Commission,' he added: 'In the context of COP25 , these decisions send an important signal to the world: The European Union and its bank are serious about climate action. See more information about the EIB participation in COP 25 and a selection of videos, blogs, podcasts EIB press conference: The new climate and energy roadmap - setting a global standard? On Monday 9th December at 10.30, the EU bank will host a press conference with its President, Werner Hoyer. The press conference will take place at the official COP 25 venue IFEMA and will be open to accredited journalists. The press conference room is CHILOE, located in Hall 10. EIB Climate Survey: Panic or the dawning of reality? On 2nd December, the EIB will present the results of the EIB Climate Survey conducted in the EU, the US and China. The first wave of the survey highlights how people perceive climate change and its impact on their lives. EIB-Benelux Pavilion, 13.30-14.15. EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro commented the survey findings: 'European citizens are highly concerned about climate change and its impact on their everyday life and future. Interestingly, many of them are optimistic about the possibility to reverse it. Unfortunately, science says otherwise. We have one shot at limiting global warming and mitigating its effects. The EIB's survey is a key tool to understand citizens' perception on climate change, and also the role they expect from their leaders in the public and the private sectors. As one of the largest multilateral providers of climate finance worldwide, the EIB is already the EU Climate Bank and we are committed to doing much more. This is why listening to citizens' attitudes is key for us to make sure we address their concerns, while leaving no one behind.' Financing the Paris Agreement: How to mobilise private investors? At a joint event on Tuesday 10th December, EIB President Hoyer will join Nadia Calvino, Spain's Minister of Economy and Business, and Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission Vice-President, to share EIB's experience in mobilising private finance and discuss how to connect the financial system and sustainability to make a successful transformation to a greener, more sustainable planet.

Photographer Jamey Stillings HYPERLINK http://jameystillings.com jameystillings.com ALTHOUGH protests in Chile have led the nation to withdraw from hosting the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ), its ambitious plans for a renewable energy future continue. This dramatic image of a solar facility, contrasting starkly with the ancient sand of the Atacama desert, shows how those intentions are becoming reality. These panels are in the Solar Jama plant, along the coast from Chile's capital, Santiago. It is located thousands of metres above sea level, and the arid desert air contains very little water vapour, allowing more sunlight to reach the solar cells. The country's green energy credentials were dealt a blow last week when it pulled out as host of COP25 Chile aims to get 20 per cent of its power from renewables by 2025, rising to 70 per cent by 2050, the year by which it has pledged to become carbon neutral. Its late withdrawal from hosting COP25 points to the difficulties and complexities of such ambitions: how can you effect change in the middle of civil unrest? \</doc>

December 4, 2019 On the sidelines of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, the agency on Wednesday released on Wednesday the Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector report, which estimates that by 2030, transport-related emissions from tourism will comprise 5.3 per cent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions. "This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector", UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler said at the launch. UNWTO said transport-related emissions remain a major challenge: "While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done", said Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Against the backdrop of a growing number of sightseers both at home and abroad, the data factors in the predicted growth in global emissions to 2030 and is set against the "current ambition" for the decarbonization of transport. "Industry must do more, but Governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition", Mr. Sarmad added. "The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world." \</doc>

Italy's second-largest drugmaker Chiesi says it is developing an environmentally friendly pMDI inhaler for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The announcement was made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 The firm has committed to a five-year, 350 million-euro ($388 million) investment plan to bring these new formulations to market, which will reduce the carbon footprint of pMDI inhalers by 90%. As part of the project, Chiesi has inked a commercial agreement with leading medical propellant manufacturer Koura, to secure supply of a new propellant which will minimize the carbon footprint of a pMDI. Chiesi has invested approximately 50 million euros in manufacturing facilities for the new formulation and will work jointly with the Mexican firm on clinical development and testing. Chiesi has received "B Corp" certification for its social and environmental transparency and accountability, and has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2035. The firm said it was the first in the industry to "publicly announce a solution" to address the carbon footprint of spray inhalers (pMDIs). Chief executive Ugo Di Francesco said: "We believe protecting patient health and the environment should not be a matter of compromise." \~ \</doc>

Mark Carney is to advise the prime minister on climate change ahead of this year's round of talks in Glasgow to help drive the UK towards its net zero emissions target by 2050. The Bank of England governor will take up the unpaid, part-time role for the COP26 United Nations climate change conference after he steps down from the central bank on March 15. The role will complement his position as UN special envoy for climate action and finance for the Glasgow summit, which pays a nominal $1 a year. It means he will split his time between London and New York after leaving the Bank, delaying his return to his native Canada until the end of the year. Mr Carney, 54, has been a driving force for using the financial system to decarbonise the global economy, leading efforts to incorporate climate change into business models as both an economic and financial risk to change investment incentives. Investors now assess the risk of both environmental disaster and policy reforms when making allocation decisions, companies are providing greater disclosure on their carbon footprint and banks are being stress tested against the economic fallout from environmental disaster. Mr Carney's post as the prime minister's finance adviser for November's COP26 event in Scotland suggests the financial case will play a significant role in discussions. The COP25 summit in Madrid last year was widely considered to have been a failure. Mr Johnson said: "Mark Carney is an invaluable addition to the COP26 team. His expertise will help the UK to lead in mobilising businesses and investors to support our net zero revolution." Rising seas to hit credit ratings, page 46 \</doc>

Chile cancels upcoming APEC trade and COP25 climate summits Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced on 30 October that his government would not be holding two major upcoming summits in the country, the 16-17 November 2019 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, and the 2-13 December 2019 COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference , due to anti-government unrest in his country. On its @latercera Twitter account, Chilean La Tercera newspaper quoted Pinera as saying his government was cancelling the meetings "given the circumstances of the last few weeks". Pinera said the decision was "painful" but was based on "common sense". HYPERLINK https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c20174b7 https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c20174b7 Chile leader cites 'order, dialogue' priorities to cancel summits Pinera, explaining his reasons for cancelling major international trade and climate change summits Chile was due to host in November and December, said on 30 October his administration wanted to concentrate on the priorities of "fully restoring public order" and advancing a "new social agenda" of policies and a "dialogue" with citizens, following nearly two weeks of intense anti-government protests, Chilean newspaper La Tercera reported. Its website reported that Pinera announced "with great sorrow" that his government was cancelling two major upcoming summits that his country was scheduled to host, the 16-17 November 2019 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, and the 2-13 December 2019 COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference , "given the circumstances of the last few weeks". The Chilean leader added that the decision was taken "considering that our first pre-occupation and priority as a government is to absolutely concentrate on, first, fully re-establishing public order, citizens' security and social peace; second, advancing with all the force and urgency that it requires the new social agenda to respond to the main demands of our citizens; and third, pushing forward a wide and deep process of dialogue to listen to our compatriots". La Tercera said Pinera made the comments at a press briefing at the La Moneda presidential palace, accompanied by Foreign Minister Teodoro Ribera and Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt. "This is a very difficult decision, which has caused us a lot of pain, because we perfectly understand the importance that the APEC and COP signify for Chile and for the world," the newspaper added in its report. Pinera said Chile remained committed to both institutions and initiatives. Since 17 October, President Pinera's government has been dealing with a wave of anti-government protests, over social and economic inequalities and costs of living, in which at least 20 people have been killed and hundreds injured.

The newspaper said Durazo did not specify whether the President had been involved in making the decision to release Guzman on the same day, 17 October, in the northwestern city of Culiacan, after federal security forces were "cornered" by armed individuals, suspected drug cartel gunmen, who staged attacks across the city for several hours. In a 22 October daily press briefing, President Lopez Obrador had said he had "not been informed" in advance that an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzman would take place on 17 October. He went on to explain that the decision to release Ovidio Guzman had been made by his security cabinet, which included the Secretaries of Defence, Navy and Security, and that the decision had had his approval. El Universal, in its 30 October report, said Durazo had been accompanied in his meeting with Mexican legislators by the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the National Defence Secretariat, General Homero Mendoza. The daily added that in the meeting, Durazo accepted there was a possibility that there might have been information "leaks" about the 17 October operation prior to its being carried out. This would be investigated. Durazo told the lawmakers that during the 17 October operation in Culiacan, the security forces had been overrun "in all senses, particularly, in the number of troops and weapons, which led them to basically be 'cornered'".

Text of report in English by pro-Ethiopian government Walta Information Centre website on 2 December The new head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will visit Ethiopia this weekend as part of her first trip to Africa after assuming EU presidency. "On Friday [6 December], I am going to do my first trip outside the EU. That will be to Africa," she told journalists in Brussels, in another symbolic move meant to show Europe's increased focus on the continent. During her stay in Addis Ababa, Von der Leyen is expected to meet President Sahlework Zewde and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. She will also meet Moussa Faki Mahmat, chairman of the African Union Commission, to explore further cooperation with the continental body. The EU is a major trading partner with, and donor to, African countries. EU has promised more investment to the continent to better tap its economic potential and stem the flow of African economic migrants who attempt perilous crossings of the Mediterranean to reach Europe. Furthermore, the president is expected to attend the opening of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , known formally as COP25 that will held in Madrid, Spain. She has set high targets in the European Union's policy to combat climate change, pledging to reduce the bloc's carbon emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2030. She disclosed that her objective is to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, meaning carbon emissions should be fully offset by measures that cut CO2, like planting trees.

The world's largest investors with more than $37 trillion of assets under management have asked governments to introduce carbon taxes and to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies to tackle climate change. A group of 631 institutions, from Aviva, Schroders and Legal & General to Californian and Canadian state pension schemes, has said that urgent policy action is needed for the investment in green industries that will keep the world within the Paris agreement targets on global warming. The intervention comes halfway through the COP25 United Nations climate change conference "The global shift to clean energy is under way, but much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low-carbon transition and to improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system to climate risks," the group wrote in a joint statement. "It is vital that policymakers are firmly committed to achieving the goals of the Paris agreement." The Paris agreement aims to keep "the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C". It was struck in December 2015 and 184 countries have made pledges to cut their emissions; however, 136 are of those are judged to be "totally inadequate", according to the Universal Ecological Fund. Britain and the rest of the European Union are among those whose plans are deemed sufficient. The institutions want "governments to phase out thermal coal power, put a meaningful price on carbon pollution [and] end subsidies for fossil fuels". Present national plans "would lead to an unacceptably high temperature increase that would cause substantial negative economic impacts", they said. \</doc>

By BBC Monitoring The Chilean government's decision to cancel the impending APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] and COP25 [ United Nations Climate Change Conference ] summits due to protests and nationwide violence has been assessed by the country's media as understandable but potentially damaging to Chile's image. Local coverage since the unrest began on 18 October had suggested President Sebastian Pinera had hoped to persevere with the conferences. But the Chilean leader addressed the issue in a 30 October press conference, saying, "with profound pain, because this is painful for Chile, our government has decided not to undertake the APEC summit, nor the COP summit." News website Emol reported shortly afterwards that government sources "assure that with the decision taken today they wanted to give a signal of the concern and priority the government has on the crisis in the country and not abroad". But political analyst Cristobal Bellolio wrote of the summits on Twitter: "they were important for Chile. We all lose with this." Short notice In its reporting, Emol highlighted the short notice at which the summits had been cancelled, headlining one of its articles, "17 days before APEC and a month away from COP25 , Pinera announced unprecedented suspension of both events." A further report by the outlet called the president's announcement "surprising", writing that only "days previously La Moneda [presidential palace] insisted that both events would happen". News website El Mostrador wrote in its 30 October coverage: "the decision to cancel the organisation of both summits represents a tough blow for Pinera's international leadership, having bet all his chips on positioning himself as an environmental leader. Likewise, the APEC summit was an important showcase for Chile, considering that during that meeting the presidents of the United States and China were to sign the deal to put an end to the trade war." Former foreign minister and current president of the progressive PPD party Heraldo Munoz told CNN Chile on 30 October, "it's a strong blow for foreign policy, but it's not a surprise." Politicians and businesses react Coverage on Radio Bio Bio's website described "support and harsh criticism: the diverse political reactions following cancellation of APEC and COP25 ." Right-wing UDI deputy Issa Kort backed the president's decision, saying, "Chile is experiencing a severe crisis and we should attend to citizens first. We don't gain anything if we don't have our crisis resolved first." Centrist Christian Democratic Party deputy Matias Walker wrote on Twitter, "it is a realistic, sober decision, about understanding where we are and what our priorities are at this moment: responding to social demands and greater participation." However, the outlet said left-wing Convergencia Social deputy Diego Ibanez would have favoured pushing the COP summit back instead of cancelling. Ibanez was quoted as saying, "if the president thinks by cancelling COP this is going to calm down, he's wrong. This was a global event where issues that affect Chile were going to be discussed and was necessary for the country." Financial newspaper Diario Financiero described disappointment from the nation's business community on its website on 30 October, writing, "commerce says cancelling summits reasonable, but warns of damage to national image." The newspaper quoted the head of the National Chamber of Commerce, Manuel Melero, who called the decision "reasonable, prudent, understandable, but lamentable, very lamentable for the country".

This update follows the filing, on November 29, of its financial statements ("3Q Statements") and Management Discussion and Analysis (the "3Q MD&A") of its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. OPERATING AND CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO 3Q 19 Sigma's Chief Strategy Officer Speaks at World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid about "Leadership in Responsible Mining". Sigma Lithium is pleased to announce today that Ana Cabral-Gardner, Chief Strategy Officer presented at the World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 on the panel covering the theme of "Leadership in responsible mining - mitigating the impacts of resource extraction" on November 8, in Madrid.She discussed the case study of Sigma as an ESG "green lithium" company and the role played by Sigma's investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive implementation of environmental and social best practices. Ms Cabral-Gardner highlighted how these key issues are part of a broader movement spearheaded by ethical and ESG-focused investors driving sweeping changes in practices across the mining industry as a whole.Excerpts from Ms Cabral-Gardner's speech include:"In battery materials, we start with a consumer who is very knowledgeable about carbon emissions and this is why he is buying an electric car to begin with. That consumer is demanding carbon neutrality, carbon consciousness and sustainability, throughout the value chain...when one thinks about the cathodes... it will be counterintuitive to buy a car to decarbonize the environment if upstream you are burning coal to produce lithium, nickel or using child labor to produce cobalt.""In this [EV] industry a paradigm is being broken [from the ICE days], whereby now 'upstream matters' and therefore, upstream practices matter too. So ultimately, in the very last step of the value chain...the OEM hears this [message from the consumer], because they are tuned into what their customer wants. So there is a "push for provenance" in battery materials, and at Sigma we sense that in the contracts [for lithium offtakes]. Sigma is in binding offtake discussions with some of the EV industry leading participants in great part because of the [differentiation] of the "green lithium' Sigma is 100% hydro, it is 100% environmentally conformed to dry stacking and other best practices. So even though the green price differentiation hasn't yet happened in metals and it isn't expected, it has been translated into displacement value: you get the best contracts, you get to sell the big volumes...""Sigma produces environmentally sustainable high-quality high-grade lithium concentrate from its pilot plant on site in Brazil... and the Company has some of the world's largest and richest deposits of spodumene ore... and we set out to develop it since the very beginning six years ago as an ESG green mining case study, pioneering amongst lithium companies ... and we did that by focusing 15% of the capex towards always keeping up with best environmental practices [management and rehabilitation] and obviously focusing on the way [electric] power was sourced to beneficiate the material [lithium].""Four examples of actions include dry-stacking tailings management from inception at the pilot plant to investing in water recirculation equipment that would lead the company to recycle 90% of the water...so there is an enormous focus on water efficiency. And then there is energy efficiency, 100% of the energy is green, power is sourced from hydro.""More importantly there is the "S" in ESG, the Company works in a region with the second-lowest IDH [index of human development] in Brazil and one of the lowest in the world... So [Sigma] is transformational as we become the largest investor by a factor of 20x in the region with massive social impact. This has been our mission and just demonstrates that with the right purpose and the right will we can become a great example even though we are a relatively small mining company on a small budget.But why? Because being in battery materials... the purpose of that value chain is to decarbonize at the "mobility-end" of the value chain. So if we do not behave accordingly by being 100% green and by powering the energy with 100% green energy and enforcing those practices all along, we would not be a sustainable member of that [EV] value chain.Signs a CAD6.6 million Revolving Credit Facility with A10 Investimentos to Meet ESG Goals and Further Advance Second Deposit into Pre-Feasibility. A10 Investimentos and its affiliates ("A10 Group") continues to support Sigma in meeting its development and construction timetable as well as strategic environmental and social ESG goals. On November 29, A10 Group provided Sigma with a CAD6.6 million (USD5 million) senior unsecured revolving credit facility to complete the pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit, to meet the current social-economic obligations under the environmental licensing as well as for general corporate purposes. The facility bears interest at 11% per annum (calculated in US Dollars from the day funds are drawn) and it has a one-year term, which is the maturity day for all funds drawn, if any. Each disbursement under the facility is subject to A10 Group's approval.This credit facility is a related party transaction for Sigma for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101") and Policy 5.9 of the TSX Venture Exchange (which incorporates by reference MI 61-101) because Ana Cabral-Gardner, Marcelo Paiva and Anna Hartley are officers and/or directors of Sigma as well as principals of the A10 Group. In accordance with applicable law, the credit facility agreement was reviewed and unanimously approved by the directors of Sigma other than those related to the A10 Group. The credit facility, which is not convertible into securities of Sigma, is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the fair market value of the transaction is below 25% of Sigma's market capitalization. It is also exempt from the minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the facility is on reasonable commercial terms and is not convertible into securities of SigmaSelection of Global Engineering Contractor for Construction of Plant on a 'Lump Sum Turnkey Basis' Capped by a Gross Maximum Price Sigma invited global engineering firms to conduct due diligence and submit proposals for engineering and procurement services for the construction of the commercial production plant (the "Plant") and the production complex. The Plant will be based on the design prepared by Primero Group Ltd for the FS Technical Report (as defined below) for the Xuxa Deposit, supporting a 1.5 Mtpa lithium concentrate processing operation with an output capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes per year.Sigma requested that the construction costs described in the proposals be fixed price lump sum turnkey not exceeding a gross maximum price to be determined following due diligence. By securing the EPC contacts as gross maximum price, Sigma is seeking to manage the capex budget during construction, and thus, avoid the risk of cost overruns.Due to Primero Group's previous experience in building similar lithium processing plants in Western Australia, as well as the depth of analysis conducted to prepare the Plant design in the FS Technical Report, Sigma believes the gross maximum price proposals will be in line with the capital expenditures outlined in the FS Technical Report.Barreiro Pre-Feasibility Study, Project Financing and Capital Structure Pre-Feasibility Barreiro: Sigma continues its pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit. Subject to completion of all related feasibility studies and assessments, Sigma aims to increase Project production capacity of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium concentrate to 440,000 tonnes per year from an initial 220,000 tonnes.Project Financing and Capital Structure: Sigma expanded the group of financial institutions involved in the discussions of project financing to five commercial banks, one Brazilian development bank and one international development bank. The Company is actively engaged in structuring the debt and equity financing package for the construction of the Plant targeting a cost-effective and optimized capital structure that matches the risk and ESG profile of the Project.Feasibility Study of Xuxa Deposit and Plant: On November 7th, 2019 Sigma filed its National Instrument 43-101 technical report on the feasibility study on the Xuxa deposit (the "FS Technical Report"), which is dated October 18 2019 and has an effective date of September 16 2019, on SEDAR.The FS Technical Report (titled "Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Ara\'e7ua\'ed and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on Feasibility Study Final Report") supports an average annual production for 9.2 years of 220,000 tonnes of coarse green and high-quality battery grade 6% lithium concentrate ("Lithium Concentrate") at the Xuxa deposit and Plant with projected cash operating costs of US$ 238 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate (cash cost CIF China of US$ 342 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate), among the lowest costs globally.\~The FS Technical Report positive results projected for the Xuxa deposit an after tax NPV of US$ 249 million, an IRR of 43%, payback period of 3.1 years and a Capex of US$ 98.4 million. The positive economics of the FS Technical Report provides a strong platform for Sigma to continue to develop its extensive mineral properties, which include nine past-producing lithium mines.THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was a loss of CAD1.99 million, which declined from a loss of CAD3.16 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The improvement was mainly due to a 57% year-on-year fall in general and administrative expenses driven by a reduction in corporate support costs and personnel in Brazil following the FS completion. The Company continues to assess these costs to ensure that cost-effective choices are being made.Exploration and evaluation assets were up by 124% on a year-on-year basis to CAD 17.44 million as of September 30 2019. The increase reflects mostly the completion of a substantial drilling programme undertaken at Sigma's Grota do Cirilo property, which more than tripled the amount of measured and indicated mineral resources to 45.7 million tonnes as discussed in the Company's press release dated January 10th, 2019.The Company does not generate cash from mining operations. During the nine months ended September 30th, 2019, the Company received a Pre-Payment from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. ("Mitsui") in the amount of CAD 4,007,100 (US$3,000,000). In addition, broker warrants were exercised providing cash proceeds of CAD 137,695. The Company's aggregate operating, investing and financing activities during the nine months ended September 30th, 2019 resulted in a net cash and cash equivalents position of CAD 1,503,303 and a negative working capital of CAD 4,214,713.The rise in total liabilities from CAD6.41 million as of September 30th, 2018 to CAD 11.55 million as of September 30th, 2019 was mostly due to the addition of CAD4.01 million (USD 3.00 million) in deferred revenue, which corresponds to an initial tranche of a Pre-Payment made by Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan, which is part of a USD 30 million Pre-Payment facility agreed in exchange for production offtake rights, as outlined in Sigma's press release dated April 5 2019. \</doc>

By BBC Monitoring Chilean President Sebastian Pinera's 24 September speech to the United Nations General Assembly focussing on the environment earned applause from media in Chile, but some pundits questioned his motives and track record on green issues. "Sebastian Pinera showed off his greenest side," news website El Mostrador reported on 24 September, noting that 16 of Pinera's 21 minutes of podium time at the UN were dedicated to the environment. Leading daily El Mercurio was impressed by Pinera's use of the topic to show his leadership in global affairs, while one pundit noted that despite initial concerns over Chile's ability to host the upcoming COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December, the decision now seemed to be a positive one. Pinera's critics, meanwhile, used the opportunity to question the president's reported hesitance to sign up to the Escazu agreement, an environmental deal agreed among several other South American states. While in New York, Pinera was awarded the Atlantic Council's Global Citizen Prize for his efforts to mitigate climate change, raising eyebrows among environmentalists who remain unconvinced of his track record. Pinera at UN: style or substance? El Mercurio dedicated its 25 September editorial to dissecting Pinera's visit to the United Nations, saying, "President Pinera has exhibited his international leadership on one of the greatest global priorities, the fight against climate change and global warming". Others wondered whether he was putting his personal image ahead of the country's needs, however. Journalist Juan Ignacio Brito wrote in a 26 September op-ed on news website El Libero: "The president dedicates time and energy to participating in summits and global meetings on climate change, [which are] filled more with glamour than concrete results". He also asked whether it was "a distraction to breathe life into an unpopular president?" "Is there anything substantial at stake for Chile?" he added. Radio Bio Bio presenter Tomas Mosciatti was positive about the president's recent performance on the world stage. During a broadcast on 23 September, he said of Pinera, "he had a success from an international point of view". The pundit tempered his praise by saying, "we have to see how COP25 goes, what agreements are reached", but he added, "for the moment, a success". Countdown to COP25 While Chile's decision to host the COP25 conference appeared to be winning over large sections of the media, a renewed government focus on climate change brought pending environmental issues to the fore. In a 25 September article published online, newspaper La Tercera noted, "there are 68 days left until that event and there are various environmental experts who see several points that Sebastian Pinera, in their judgement, must solve before the meeting." The article quoted Universidad de Chile academic Valentina Duran, who said it was "incoherent" that the president had not yet signed up to the Escazu agreement. According to the report, the Escazu issue was seen as the "main problem that Chile will face before COP25 ", but other key outstanding topics included finalising pending environmental legislation and details of how Chile plans to clean up areas affected by industrial pollution. El Mostrador, meanwhile, reported on 24 September, "Pinera's ambiguity on Escazu threatens to eclipse his moment of fame on the environment". A deserved accolade? Coverage of Pinera's Global Citizen Award suggested some in Chile remained dubious about the president's green credentials. CNN Chile reported on 25 September that Rodrigo Mundaca, secretary general of the Modatima environmental movement, said it was a "completely undeserved prize". Although Greenpeace's executive director Jennifer Morgan said Pinera did not yet deserve the award, she added that "he has an enormous opportunity". While environmentalists preferred to wait and see whether the president commited to his promises, some analysts suggested he would face opposition from his political partners at home if he did so. In a 26 September report by news website Emol, political scientist Mauricio Morales was quoted as saying, "for the coalition that backs the president, economic growth is much more important than protecting the environment." "That is why the president's great plan of establishing himself as the green emblem of the world and Latin America is going to collide with reality," Morales added.

Photocredit: Adobe Stock The COP25 talks were viewed as a test of governments' collective will to heed the advice of science to cut greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly, in order to prevent rising global temperatures from hitting irreversible tipping points. But after two weeks of negotiations, the conference, in its concluding draft, endorsed only a declaration on the "urgent need" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement - an outcome UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called 'disappointing.' Many developing countries and campaigners had wanted to see much more explicit language spelling out the importance of countries submitting bolder pledges on emissions as the Paris process enters a crucial implementation phase next year. RELATED CONTENT EU policymakers gear up to underscore urgency of climate action at COP25 Climate change 'did not originate' in the Arctic, conference hears MEPs to press Commission to declare "state of climate emergency" in Europe COP25 COP25 'critical' in ensuring 2015 Paris Agreement put in place, says senior MEP Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change The next climate summit will take place in Glasgow in November 2020, where countries are supposed to present their plans for achieving the Paris targets. Reaction from MEPs and campaign groups to the outcome of the much-vaunted meeting in Spain, moved at short notice from Chile, was swift, with most voicing disappointment. The S&D coordinator for the environment committee, Jytte Guteland, described it as a "very disappointing outcome and another missed opportunity." "Once again, world leaders failed to live up to the expectations of citizens and young generations who called for awareness of the need for concrete and immediate action to reduce global warming." "While the world is still heading for more than 3 degrees of warming, the final resolution fails to fully address the climate emergency and only includes a timid call for increasing ambition ahead of next year's Glasgow summit" Bas Eickhout MEP The deputy, part of a four-strong S&D delegation in Madrid, said it was "unfortunate" no agreement was reached on the "most sensitive and crucial issues", such as the so-called rulebook for the Paris Agreement, the guidance on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, transparency of reporting obligations, the leftover credits from the Kyoto system and the financing of the Adaptation Fund to help the least developed countries in the transition. Guteland said, "It is deeply regrettable that the Parties could not manage to come to an agreement, despite the best efforts from the EU. It is a setback but the fight is far from over. Now we need to roll up our sleeves even further and keep pushing so that an agreement can be found in Glasgow in 2020." "The EU has played a constructive role throughout these negotiations and pushed for stronger commitments from the Parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Green Deal is a clear testament of the EU's intention to act swiftly and resolutely to do our part in the global efforts to limit climate change." "We regret that no agreement was found but we are determined to continue our fight for fair and bold solutions to climate change. The EU played an assertive and leading role as a constitutive and progressive negotiator and will strengthen its climate efforts further with the European Green Deal." Further reaction came from Greens MEP Bas Eickhout, head of Parliament's delegation to COP25 , who said, "The big gap between insufficient climate policies around the world and the objectives of the Paris Agreement has not narrowed. This must have consequences for trade talks that the EU is currently having with the biggest obstructors." "Once again, world leaders failed to live up to the expectations of citizens and young generations who called for awareness of the need for concrete and immediate action to reduce global warming" Jytte Guteland MEP "The gap between what science tells us to do and what politicians deliver on climate summits is enormous. Nothing has changed in that regard." From the NGO community, Susann Scherbarth, climate justice campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said, "This COP has been another chance lost to listen to the people on the streets demanding climate justice, and every missed opportunity closes the window for action and means more irreversible climate impacts around the globe." "The climate talks will take place in Europe again next year, for the fourth time running, and from now until then we will keep up the pressure on governments to deliver urgent transformative action to create sustainable societies within the Earth's limits." Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe, said, "During COP25 , the EU has repeatedly said it wants to lead by example. To prove its sincerity and leadership to implement the Paris Agreement, the EU needs to substantially increase its 2030 climate pledge in the first months of 2020." "Every missed opportunity closes the window for action and means more irreversible climate impacts around the globe" Susann Scherbarth, Friends of the Earth Europe "The window of opportunity to achieve the 1.5\'b0C objective of the Paris Agreement is closing rapidly." Elsewhere, Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, commented, "This COP exposed the role of polluters in politics and the youth's deep distrust of government, as climate blockers like Brazil and Saudi Arabia, enabled by an irresponsibly weak Chilean leadership, peddled carbon deals and steamrolled scientists and civil society." Sofie Nordvik, representing Norway's youth delegates, noted, "We lack the ambition needed to avoid this climate emergency. Our leaders need to step up. The world would have looked very different if young people were in charge today." "It seems that EU now needs to be the leader and we want to be, and we are going to be and that is what we are doing," said Krista Mikkonen, Finland's environment minister and the EU's representative at the talks. \</doc>

November 29, 2019 ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $ 25 billion between 2020 and 2025. The African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org http://www.AfDB.org ) will on Monday kick off a campaign to plead the continent's case at the world's leading climate change conference. The 25th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) ( \~ HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/37Sg92z http://bit.ly/37Sg92z African countries know all too well the risks posed by climate change, said Wale Shonibare, the Bank's Acting Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth. He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year. "However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities -- from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative," Shonibare said. Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25 , which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C. Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid. "2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale," said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank. The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change. The Bank will participate in several panel discussions at COP25 , and will support the advocacy efforts of its regional member countries. The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. Some of its achievements are: - 85% of investments are screened for climate risk and for greenhouse gas emissions.

December 10, 2019 "Science is unequivocal on the urgency to act, both at global and national levels", he told the conference to address the climate crisis - officially known as the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The official opening ceremony of the high-level segment of the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 25 . (10 December 2019), by UN Climate Change/James Dowson Mr. Muhammad-Bande recalled the consensus reached through the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in temperature to 2\'baC above pre-industrial levels and efforts to hold it to 1.5\'baC. And yet, if current trends in global emissions continue, they will cause further warming; and humans will face increasingly severe and extreme weather events. "Lands are being degraded. Forests, ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost. Our oceans are facing pollution, acidification and loss of coastal habitats", he spelled out. Recurrent climate disasters are becoming global and borderless; causing unprecedented human and socioeconomic costs; and threatening progress in reducing global poverty and improving people's lives. Let's not 'go down with the ship' Risk reduction measures have the potential to "safeguard up to 280 million people at risk of displacement due to sea level rise". "It is our decision: to go down with this ship or to change course immediately", he underscored. "This is the time to act". "We are defined by our actions, and every day we have a moral obligation to take action in favour of the next generation and beyond", Mr. Muhammad-Bande concluded. "I am confident we will rise to this challenge". Nuclear energy solutions On his first official trip as the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted the role that nuclear power can play in the global transition to clean energy. "Variable renewables, such as solar and wind, are vital to the clean energy transition, but they alone cannot meet countries' growing energy needs", he maintained, adding that nuclear energy can "provide the continuous, low-carbon power to back up increasing use of renewables". Moreover, nuclear power can be "the key that unlocks their full potential by providing flexible support - day or night, rain or shine", upheld the IAEA chief. And many States believe that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustainable development and meet global climate goals without significant use of nuclear energy. He pointed out that "nuclear power provides around one-third of the world's low-carbon electricity and already plays a significant role in mitigating climate change". Out of time "Each year at COP we are told that the window of opportunity could close soon", UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said on the urgency of climate action. "The window of opportunity is closing now," she warned. "My message is this. We need your decisions. We need your leadership. We are out of time." Action for the most vulnerable People around the world are being affected by one extreme weather event after another. But refugees, stateless people, and internally displaced often reside in climate change "hotspots", leaving them exposed to secondary displacements, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. So Tuesday saw the timely launch by 12 international organizations of the Alliance for Hydromet Development, agreeing to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to deliver high-quality weather forecasts, early warning systems and hydrological and climate services. The window of opportunity is closing now - UN Climate Change chief Pointing out that "the science is clear", World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, told COP25 that "ambitious climate action requires countries to be equipped with the most reliable warnings and best available climate information services". "The Alliance is the vehicle to collectively scale-up our support to the most vulnerable", he concluded. For her part, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development Laura Tuck underlined the important role of the Alliance. "It's good to see everyone formally coming together through this Alliance and committing to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries in the provision of hydromet and early warning services," she said. "This will help ensure we are coherent, consistent, and efficient in the way we are supporting countries to prepare for climate risks and protect people." COP25 will lay the groundwork for next year's defining climate change conference, when countries must submit new climate action plans under the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

IDB Invest and Engie Energ&a Chile have signed a letter of intent for a proposed $125 million loan for renewable energy assets in Chile. The loan is intended to finance Engie's future investments in renewable energy projects as it closes down its coal-fired assets in the country. The companies announced the agreement on 9 December (2019), during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. Engie simultaneously announced that it would close two coal-fired plants the 162MW Mejillones CTM1 and 172MW Mejillones CTM2 facilities, both in Antofagasta by late 2024. The company is already in the process of pulling the plug on four units of a 439MW coal-fired plant in Tocopilla, Antofagasta. Units 12 and 13 were retired in June and units 14 and 15 are expected to stop operating by January 2022. To replace the coal-fired assets, Engie intends to build\~a 1GW portfolio of solar and wind assets with a rough investment of $1 billion. The company revealed that it had started building three such projects on 4 October (2019) two solar parks and one wind farm representing a combined investment of $300 million. Engie is one of three major generators present in Chile to have made commitments to shut down coal-fired plants in the country in an agreement with the government on 4 June. Enel will shutter its 150MW Tarapac& plant by the end of the year, while AES Corp will shut down the 120MW Ventanas 1 and 220MW Ventanas 2 plants in Valpara&so by late 2022.

The private sector should expand its reach and not only focus on profits and return on investments but pursue its ethical responsibilities to ensure the communities where they operate address poverty reduction, sustainable food security and societal wellbeing, says Nutreco s corporate sustainability director, Jos\'e9 Villalon. He was presenting at UN Climate Conference ( COP25 ), taking place in Madrid this week. The COP25 brings together governments, businesses, local authorities and civil society to work on the rule book for implementing the Paris Agreement and to build momentum for more ambition in the years ahead. \~ Villalon argued that private companies can and should work across the value chain to significantly reduce their impact on climate change in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\~ Global companies like Nutreco are not only well positioned to make a bold impact but have a clear social responsibility to do so, he added. In a session on Sustainability Aquaculture and Food Security today [December 5], he spoke on behalf of Nutreco s aquaculture division, Skretting, about the essential role that the aquaculture industry must play in feeding the growing global population. The industry needs to earn its social license to operate by enabling farmers to increase their food production by 50%. Novel feed ingredients, such as protein from insects, or from bacteria fed on recycled CO2 as well as fermented algae producing high omega-3 are a few of several viable tools to achieve this ambition, but we cannot do it alone. \~ Tomorrow, Villalon will talk about how companies like Nutreco are looking to create shared value, reduce poverty and address food security in rural communities by doing more with less, and by measurably decreasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) through science-based targets (SBT) methodology. EU Green Deal EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also spoke at COP25 in relation to the EU s climate ambitions. She participated in the opening Leaders Session on Monday. In ten days from now, the European Commission will present the European Green Deal. Our goal is to be the first climate neutral continent by 2050. If we want to achieve that goal, we have to act now, we have to implement our policies now. Because we know that this transition needs a generational change." She said the EU Green Deal will cut emissions while also creating jobs and improving quality of life. "This will include extending emission trading to all relevant sectors [e.g. shipping], clean, affordable and secure energy, the boosting of the circular economy, a farm to fork strategy as well as a biodiversity strategy," said von der Leyen. The first-ever European climate law to achieve a transition to climate-neutrality by 2050 will be officially presented in March 2020, although the package will be unveiled by the commissioner for the Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, on December 11. Weak, half-baked policy Draft plans for the EU Green Deal would have minimal impact on the worsening climate and ecological emergencies, warned Greenpeace last week, after it obtained a leaked overview of the plans compiled by the European Commission. Commenting on the HYPERLINK https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-eu-unit-stateless/2019/11/06a0dcd9-201911_europeangreendeal_summary_for_permreps_leak.pdf \~leak , Greenpeace spokesperson, Franziska Achterberg said: This is a vast policy program that marks a shift away from the Juncker commission s deregulation agenda. But you just have to look beyond the top lines to see that the proposed measures are either too weak, half-baked or missing altogether. Responding to the climate and ecological crises requires a fundamental rethink of the economic system that for decades has rewarded pollution, environmental destruction and human exploitation. This plan barely scratches the surface. \</doc>

Engie Energ&a Chile\~is finally moving forward with its first wind farm in Chile, which was stalled for months because of an arbitration claim. The 150MW Calama wind project, located in the Antofagasta region, was announced on 4 October (2019) as part of Engie's plan to build a 1GW portfolio of wind and solar assets in Chile. Global Energy Service (GES) was awarded the EPC contract to build the Calama facility, which will be fitted with 30 wind turbines. However, construction was halted after Asachi - the indigenous association of Chiu Chiu, a locality in Antofagasta - filed an arbitration claim against the project last September, claiming it was located on a site of vital importance for agriculture. Asachi reached an agreement with Engie and withdrew its claim fourth months later. The Calama wind farm is Engie's second project between Calama and San Pedro de Atacama, Antofagasta. The other is the 97MW Capricornio solar project, which is also being built by GES. Construction on both projects initially began in the fall, and they are expected to come online mid-2021. The two projects, along with the 120MW (DC) Tamaya solar park in Tocopilla, Antofagasta, represent a total investment of $300 million. Construction on Tamaya is slated to start in Q1 2020. IDB Invest signed a letter of intent with Engie for a proposed $125 million loan for renewable energy projects in the Chile, in December (2019) during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. Engie Energ&a Chile owns two other solar parks in Chile, having acquired them from another affiliate of Engie, Solairedirect, last April. The projects are the 54MW Los Loros and 1.3MW Andacollo projects, in the province of Copiap&, in the Atacama desert. Engie's renewable energy investment plan in Chile was given added impetus when the company reached an agreement with the Chilean government to shut down its Tocopilla coal-fired plant. Enel and AES Corp. made similar commitments. (A version of this story first appeared on\~Power, Finance & Risk) \</doc>

October 31, 2019 In response to the Chilean government's announcement that it would withdraw from hosting COP25 in December, Ceres' CEO and President Mindy Lubber said: "The Chilean government's decision to withdraw from hosting COP25 raises concerns for all who are focused on ensuring strong, swift and just global action to tackle the climate crisis. The world needs urgent, coordinated, and collective action across global governments and sectors of the economy in order to put us on a pathway to reach net-zero carbon emissions, limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. That action must incorporate the needs and concerns of those most vulnerable to the climate crisis and to the economic shifts required to address it. We support the people of Chile and thank everyone who has worked tirelessly to advance a productive and successful COP25 . "We look forward to further guidance from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat on an updated COP25 plan that will enable ongoing progress toward implementation of the Paris Agreement, with the support of investors, companies and civil society who are calling for action at the pace and scale the climate crisis requires." \</doc>

Scott Cato, who represents the south west of England, added, "It is also time to stop aviation free riding on the global climate. The sector needs to be taken under the wing of the Paris Agreement. Its emissions must count and we must find ways to curtail the perpetual growth in flights and send them into freefall." "A frequent flier levy would be a fair way to address this as the vast majority of flights are taken by a minority of people." She also told The Parliament Magazine, "The move of the COP25 event from South America to Europe is a poignant reminder that social and environmental justice must go hand in hand in tackling the climate emergency." "The move of the COP25 event from South America to Europe is a poignant reminder that social and environmental justice must go hand in hand in tackling the climate emergency" Molly Scott Cato MEP "COP has moved first from Brazil, where Bolsonaro is trashing the Amazon rainforest, and then from Chile due to civil unrest over inequality. Here again, we believe the Green New Deal holds the answer as it aims to address social inequality and poverty while drastically cutting emissions." Meanwhile, a leading environment group has voiced concern about switching the COP25 climate conference at short notice to Madrid. Speaking to this website, Susann Scherbarth, climate justice campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said, "This last-minute move of the UN climate talks to Spain risks excluding voices from the Global South - what with wasted travel tickets and last-minute EU visas." "With four consecutive COPs now in Europe, attention could shift away from the regions most impacted by the climate crisis. We're also concerned that brutal repression of demonstrations in Chile could now increase." "With four consecutive COPs now in Europe, attention could shift away from the regions most impacted by the climate crisis" Susann Scherbarth, Friends of the Earth Europe Elsewhere, the European Union has been accused of "knowingly missing the opportunity" to boost global climate ambition. Climate Action Network Europe says that by failing to increase the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target the EU has "turned a blind eye to the clear call from science that highlights the dangers of any further delay." Wendel Trio, director of CAN Europe, based in Brussels, told this website, "This failure ignores the increasingly enraged nature that is claiming ever more lives and livelihoods with fires, droughts and hurricanes, also in Europe." Trio added, "And it goes against the calls from the millions of European citizens, notably young people, who have taken to the streets to demand that climate action be treated with real urgency and seriousness." "The time is up for any self-claimed leadership talk that is not backed-up by transformative action. We urge the European Union to announce at COP25 in Madrid its commitment to significantly improve its 2030 target" Wendel Trio, Director of CAN Europe Trio said, "The time is up for any self-claimed leadership talk that is not backed-up by transformative action. We urge the European Union to announce at COP25 in Madrid its commitment to significantly improve its 2030 target." "The earlier the EU will do this the bigger impact it will have on the global climate ambition by incentivising further action from others." The group says that adopting an "ambitious and forward-thinking" position on climate finance is "crucial to the success" of the COP25 negotiations. Its demand comes after a recent Eurobarometer survey said that 93 percent of Europeans are concerned or very concerned about climate change and support action across the EU to tackle it. \</doc>

There is no time to waste, because our planet is at risk." "Scientists are telling us that this is an emergency, because the changing climate is already having a negative impact, not only on biodiversity but it has already become a threat to humanity." "We need to act now if we want to correct the trend and extreme weather events, desertification, rising sea and ocean levels and loss of biodiversity. We know that there are already millions of climate refugees and that it is the poor who are suffering the most in this climate emergency. We will see more people striving for water and food if we don't act." "Fighting climate warming is no longer an option but an obligation.

Maltese MEP Miriam Dalli said, "Global warming is a fact and this is an emergency. Melting glaciers and rising sea levels are a fact and this is an emergency. Frequent wildfires, long periods of drought and more and more intense tropical storms are facts, and this is a climate emergency." "Parliament places itself at the forefront of the fight against climate change. This will represent a powerful sign to the European and world leaders before the upcoming COP25 to push them to urgently take the concrete actions needed in order to fight and contain this threat before it is too late." Separately, the assembly's environment committee will on Tuesday outline its demands for the Biodiversity Convention's COP15, the biodiversity equivalent of the Paris agreement on climate change, taking place in China in 2020. MEPs can propose the agreement to include ambitious legally-binding targets, detailed timelines and clear performance indicators. The same committee will also vote on an EU roadmap to tackle the decline of bees and other pollinators in Europe.

Photocredit: Giancarlo Rocconi With COP25 switching from Santiago to Madrid, what does hosting the climate change conference in Spain mean for your country and people? First of all, we can only regret the situation in Chile and hope for a resolution. It is a pity they haven't been able to hold COP25 after their huge organisational effort. I have to say I had no doubt that, given the circumstances, Spain was going to offer to host it for two reasons: first, because our country and its government have demonstrated a firm commitment in the fight against climate change. This is demonstrated by the fact that the European Commission considers Spain as having presented the most ambitious of the 2030 Horizon energy and climate plans of all Member States; second, because of the desire and political drive to quickly offer a way out to a sister country like Chile. Both our Ecological Transition Minister Teresa Ribera and President Pedro S\'e1nchez are correct to promote holding COP25 in Madrid. It is an organisational challenge to prepare it in barely a month, but I am sure that with cooperation from Chile it will be a success. RELATED CONTENT COP25 2020 can be the start of a new Greens decade, says Monica Frassoni Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off In your view, how important is COP25 in ensuring the completion of the Paris Agreement work programme, especially in relation to measuring emission reductions? It is important because we are faced with a COP prior to the first revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions and it will be necessary for countries to increase the ambition of the Contributions which are currently insufficient as indicated by the Talanoa Dialogues, in order to achieve the Paris goals. At Katowice COP24 there was progress in the technical framework necessary to put the Paris Agreement into operation in an international context. COP24 can be considered a relative success. Now it is important to complement implementation of Article 6 which permits cooperative approaches for mitigation of emissions through market mechanisms. Our European emission allowance market may be considered by other countries as a global mechanism for modulating the price of CO2 and reducing emissions. But the major importance, given the absence of the US, lies in achieving a multilateral consensus and commitments by major emitting countries like China, India and Russia. As a member of the parliament's delegation to COP25 , what do you believe should be the eu's key priorities in the negotiations? I am grateful to the European Parliament and to my group, the S&D, for this opportunity. I was clear, as a new MEP, that I wanted to focus my work on these matters because they are subjects which are important to me. That said, in Madrid we have to demonstrate to the world that Europe provides leadership in the fight against climate change. In Parliament we will table an ambitious resolution which defends, amongst other things, the reduction of CO2 emissions by 55 percent by 2030 and neutrality in 2050. I am from Galicia, a region in which the need for support along the decarbonisation path is a patent reality. The role of energy is decisive and our delegation will emphasise support for energy efficiency and renewables and the abolition of fossil fuels subsidies. We will also work to convince developed countries of the need to increase the contribution to the Adaptation Fund. Poverty makes populations affected by climate change more vulnerable. In addition, we will have to talk about the planet's forests. They not only have to be preserved and even increased, but we must also think about their biodiversity and health. An industrial forestry cultivation is not a forest. With President Trump formally notifying the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, how will this negatively impact the fight against climate change? Can the EU replace the US as a global leader in tackling the climate crisis? With his scepticism, President Trump demonstrates little sensitivity and great ignorance. When he won the election, he announced his intention to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement and now he is carrying out his threat. But the world now is not what it was; the commitment of other nations has not been reduced but rather reinforced, with the EU at the forefront. We must wait to see what happens next year in the US elections but, for now, Democratic Party candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders completely disagree with Trump's Paris decision. From the ethical, social and economic point of view, the fight against climate change is an obligation to which the European Union is committed. In the face of the climate change challenge, this commitment is not temporary but existential. Greta Thunberg and extinction rebellion in the UK are calling for more drastic changes in societal behaviour. How realistic is it for the EU and Member States to make these adjustments? Among the things which most strengthen the fight against climate change is the commitment and demand of the young, particularly in Europe. Greta Thunberg has amplified that voice. Parliament is conscious of those aspirations and has converted the fight against climate change into one of its leitmotifs. We all add up. What we as public representatives must do is face up to the political crisis with ambition and realism and watch out, above all, for those who are most affected or who are going to be affected by the ecological transition. These include people from the regions most dependent on carbon-based industries. There can be no climate fight without social backing and, therefore, as an S&D member, I consider social justice as crucial. 'Do not leave anybody to their fate' is not a slogan but should be the cornerstone of environmental policy if we want to demonstrate true commitment. The EU also has to start promoting more sustainable lifestyles that are easier to adopt for young people. As citizens we must also act individually, addressing issues such as consumption, waste and mobility. Apart from the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which other challenges do you foresee in reaching a deal at COP25 that is more ambitious in terms of implementing Paris and enhancing climate action across all aspects of society? Attitudes like that of Brazil's President Bolsonaro and the stance adopted by Trump complicate progress in the greater climate ambition. This compels us to cooperate more intensely with other countries. We have to combat the scepticism against climate change and explain the measures which are being taken because, socially, they can be misunderstood. The yellow vest movement in France and protests in Ecuador start from social discontent but share, as a common denominator, concern about increases in fuel taxes. Another challenge can be found closer to home and the EU must show its leadership by increasing its contributions in a way compatible with the 1.5\'b0C global warming target. Climate neutrality by the middle of the century is also pending approval by Council. But we must not forget that Europe only represents nine percent of emissions and 7 percent of the world's population. With sufficient commitment we can lead, influence and serve as an example to the rest of the world. We have to demonstrate that a just transition is not only beneficial climatically but also makes sense from the economic and technological point of view as this will increase the potential for society's well-being. Transport has seen a big increase in emissions so, given that trade relies on transport, what more would you like to see the new Commission do to reduce emissions in this sector? The transport sector is responsible for a quarter of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions and little progress has been made in clean energies penetration. We cannot continue this way if we want to achieve climate neutrality in 2050. Transport decarbonisation is a must. Mobility of people and goods is going to undergo a major change in the EU in the coming years and electrification and digitalisation are going to be key. Promoting low-emission zones in cities not only preserves health but changes citizens' perception, strengthening ecological commitment. I would also highlight the need to tackle the EU directive on taxation of energy products. In sectors like aviation, it makes no sense flying less than 500- 600 km when there are alternatives like the train. We must also support electric mobility and develop an extensive recharging infrastructure. But, looking ahead, we should also consider other decarbonised energy vectors like hydrogen, especially in those areas that electromobility cannot reach. Revision of the Fuel Quality Directive will play an important role in this. With so many different pressures on the EU MFF budget, how realistic is it to expect that Europe not only transforms into a climate-neutral economy, but also maintains support for sustainable development in other countries? What's not realistic is expecting otherwise. Over recent years, the European Union has demonstrated that it is possible to grow while greenhouse gas emissions are reduced - that is to say, uncoupling economic growth and energy intensity. In fact, between 1990 and 2018, emissions fell by 23 percent while the economy grew by 61 percent. Committing to the sustainable development of other countries is not only an ethical matter but also of strategic interest. Climate refugees and migrants already exist and the climate crisis is global and interdependent. It knows neither walls nor borders. In another respect, I would like to stress a sentimental matter which is to do with human nature and its relationship with the landscapes and beauty of our planet. We will become poorer as humans without seeing snow in winter on the mountains, witnessing lifeless oceans or observing great forests turn into deserts. Many of the greatest moments of happiness for human being are associated with their experiences in nature. My appeal is this: let us not deprive those born after us of that opportunity. That should be our mandate. \</doc>

Climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, is stranded in Los Angeles Swedish teen was set to make carbon-neutral trip on land to Santiago, Chile   Chilean capital was scheduled to host a key UN conference on climate change But mass protests erupted in Chile, forcing government to cancel event   Spain's offer to host the conference in its capital of Madrid was accepted The Spanish government says it is willing to help teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg cross the Atlantic Ocean in time to attend a United Nations climate conference in Madrid after it was relocated from Chile. But the clock is ticking. Thunberg, who is currently in Los Angeles, needs to find a way to make it in time for the December 2 start of the COP25 conference in the Spanish capital by traveling through carbon-free modes of transportation. It is uncertain how Spain would arrange a 6,000-mile carbon-free trip for Thunberg given her current location. 'Dear Greta, it would be great to have you here in Madrid,' Teresa Ribera, Spain's Ecological Transition Minister, said on Twitter on Saturday. 'You've made a long journey and help all of us to raise concern, open minds and enhance action. 'We would love to help you to cross the Atlantic back.' Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, suggested his capital city host the UN's COP25 conference aimed at reducing global carbon emissions and combating climate change. The event was initially scheduled to be held in Santiago between December 2 and 13. But Chile has been paralyzed for weeks by massive protests that were sparked by a proposed 3 per cent hike in subway fares. At least 18 people have died and more than 7,000 have been arrested as millions have poured into the streets demanding the government address economic inequality. The massive demonstrations, which have been marred by cases of arson and vandalism, forced the Chilean government to withdraw as hosts of the climate conference. Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old who has gained worldwide fame for sparking a youth movement that is urging global action on climate change, traveled to the United States by sailing on a carbon-free yacht across the Atlantic. The voyage on the zero-emissions yacht which began in Plymouth, England, took about two weeks. After attending the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September, she traveled to Los Angeles in an electric car. Thunberg had planned to travel from Los Angeles by land across Central and South America in order to attend the conference in Santiago. But now that the venue of COP25 has changed, the teen, who has vowed to only get around by carbon-free modes of transportation, tweeted that she is essentially stranded in North America. 'As # COP25 'It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)... 'Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.' In another tweet, she wrote: 'I'm so sorry I'll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. 'But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. 'We're in a climate and ecological emergency. I send my support to the people in Chile.' She also tweeted: 'This of course no problem. 'People are suffering all around the world, and I'm fine whatever I do and wherever I am.' The distance between Los Angeles and Madrid is 5,814 miles. Presumably, Thunberg would need to make another cross-country trek back to the East Coast and then take another vessel which would set sail for the Spanish coast. \</doc>

Chile's foreign minister has vowed to work with allies to cut off Venezuela's communications, shut down its air space and implement a naval blockade if Nicol\'e1s Maduro refuses to hold free elections. Amid an escalating humanitarian crisis that is destabilising the region, causing more than 4m Venezuelans to emigrate, "ever stricter" measures must be taken to put pressure on Caracas to comply with demands to restore democratic order, Teodoro Ribera said. "The solution to the crisis has to be soon ... Venezuela is a problem for hemispheric security," Mr Ribera told the Financial Times. He pointed out that some 400,000 Venezuelans lived among Chile's 18m-strong population. "We have to make Maduro understand that it is preferable to call elections than not to call them." Sanctions have failed to persuade Caracas to heed calls for elections from the international community acting through the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, whose members also include the US and Argentina. Mr Ribera said the "logical next steps" include blocking communications and access to the country by air and sea. "All countries in the region have to advocate for forcing the Maduro government to call free, democratic elections, with international observers," he said. Mr Ribera added that the opposition had to be pragmatic and recognise that democratic political transitions "demand reciprocal HYPERLINK http://www.sacrifices.No www.sacrifices.No one leaves power to go to hell voluntarily." Chile's own transition to democracy after the 1973-90 dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet was negotiated and drawn out, but also peaceful and did not harm the economy, said Mr Ribera. Human rights violators should be prosecuted, he said, but a "witch hunt" had to be avoided. He warned that if the number of Venezuelan immigrants rose to 7-8m, as he fears could happen next year if action is not taken, "that will put very, very great pressure on countries in the region and it could have a destabilising effect". The foreign minister emphasised that the solution had to be peaceful, as military intervention could trigger "an explosion in immigration that we cannot cope with". Chile's hardening stance towards Venezuela comes as Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, the centre-right president, takes on a stronger leadership role in the region and beyond. Santiago is preparing to welcome delegates in December for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP25 . Observers expect the balance of power to shift in the region if the leftist Alberto Fern\'e1ndez is elected president in Argentina this month, replacing the centre-right Mauricio Macri. Mr Macri has played a leading role in the region's opposition to Mr Maduro. In interviews, Mr Fern\'e1ndez has resisted calling Mr Maduro a dictator, but did express concerns about the Maduro regime's authoritarian tendencies.

Madrid, Spain -- Small-scale farmers in developing countries are already suffering from a changing climate they did not cause - with lower crop yields, reduced water availability, price spikes and increased food insecurity. Whilst agriculture contributes to the climate crisis, small-scale farmers are guardians of our natural resources and have the potential to revolutionize food production to increase production and limit environmental degradation. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognises that these farmers are a critical part of the solution to climate change. IFAD has shown that small-scale farmers can be effective agents of change - they can use climate finance to deliver multiple benefits in terms of food security, poverty reduction, ecosystem resilience and emission reductions. IFAD's spokespeople will be participating in a wide range of events throughout UNFCCC COP25 in Madrid (2 to 13 December), encouraging investment in farmers. IFAD will be launching a new report focused on its work in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the IFAD Climate Action Report 2019. Key Issues: \'b7 Small-scale farmers are often located on marginal lands where environmental and climate impacts are most strongly felt, reducing crop yields and incomes. \'b7 Small-scale farmers need to urgently adapt to environmental and climate impacts to ensure continued food production and sustainable incomes. \'b7 IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) is the largest global financing source of its kind, and channels more than US$ 300 million of climate finance to farmers in developing countries so they can access the information, tools and technologies that will help build their resilience to climate change. Small farms provide more than 70 per cent of the food calories to people living in south and east Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Where to find us: A member of the IFAD team will be on the UN's Reducing Inequalities Stand throughout COP25 . They will be happy to arrange interviews/meetings with any of our team.

HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu http://www.europarl.europa.eu Ahead of the COP25 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December, the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee approved on Wednesday a resolution calling on the EU to submit its long-term strategy to reach climate neutrality at the latest by 2050 to the UN Convention on Climate Change as soon as possible. This would guarantee the EU maintains its world leadership in the fight against climate change. They also highlighted the need for the EU to raise its ambition level for 2030 in order to reach the 2050 target. MEPs expect the European Green Deal announced by European Commission President-elect Ursula Von Der Leyen to include a target of 55% emissions reductions by 2030. Global ambition for aviation and shipping not enough MEPs say that current ambition for aviation and shipping fall short of the necessary emissions reductions and hence believe that all countries should be encouraged to include emissions from international shipping and aviation in their national contributions plans (NDCs). More financial support to fight climate change EU countries should at least double their contributions to the international Green Climate Fund, the committee says. MEPs stress that EU member states are the largest providers of public climate finance and that the EU's budget should fully comply with its international commitments. They also note that actual pledges by developed countries still fall short of the collective goal of mobilising 100 billion USD per year as of 2020. Finally, they urgently call on all EU countries to phase out all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies by 2020 and on the European Investment Bank to end lending to fossil fuel projects except for gas when used in combination with renewables. The global action made during the next 10 years will impact the future of humanity for the next 10 000 years, they say. Quote "The Environment Committee is showing the way for Europe to be the first carbon-neutral continent in 2050", said the Chair of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee Pascal Canfin (Renew Europe, FR). "While the United States confirmed yesterday its exit from the Paris Agreement, we reaffirmed today in the European Parliament's Environment Committee that we want Europe to be serious about the fight against climate change", he added. Background The European Commission has already proposed the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but the European Council has still not endorsed it as some countries are opposed. COP25 will take place in Madrid from 2-13 December 2019. A delegation from the European Parliament led by Bas Eickhout (Greens, NL) will participate. Next steps The Environment Committee adopted the draft resolution with 62 votes to 11. The text will be voted by the Parliament as a whole during the 25-28 November plenary session in Strasbourg.

Photo credit: Adobe Stock The conference, which has been moved at short notice to Spain following civil unrest in Chile, has sparked accusations about the "adequacy" of EU countries' 2030 climate targets. The European Union is now being urged to announce at the COP 25 its "commitment to significantly improve its 2030 target." This comes from Climate Action Network Europe (CAN Europe), a leading Brussels-based environmental group which has written to all members of Parliament's environment committee with a "wish list" of what it hopes will come out of COP25 . Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off Climate change now an 'emergency' says former European commissioner Miguel Ca\'f1ete: Leaders of EU cities and regions must 'lead by example' on climate Finland kicks off EU presidency on green note Disappointment reigns after EU summit fails to deliver on carbon neutrality goal The letter to MEPs is timed to coincide with a committee vote on the COP25 resolution later on Wednesday and outlines the issues that the group considers as priorities for the COP25 . It states that with the Paris Agreement and the Katowice Rulebook, the "global climate regime has its overall governance and most of its implementation rules in place." But it adds, "The key component still missing is the level of ambition, and in particular the adequacy of countries' 2030 targets." "We are disappointed that the European Union knowingly missed the opportunity to boost global climate ambition by deciding not to announce an increase to the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target" CAN Europe CAN says the focus at the COP 25 should be on the global "political momentum" of updating countries' 2030 targets, the NDCs, by the 2020 deadline next year. Other key topics of this year's COP, it says, are ensuring the "environmental integrity" of the rules that govern the carbon markets and that climate finance that supports countries to transition and to adapt is provided. "Countries should find an effective outcome of the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage that includes the establishment of a finance arm," it says. The letter, seen by this site, goes on, "We are disappointed that the European Union knowingly missed the opportunity to boost global climate ambition by deciding not to announce an increase to the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York." CAN says the global emissions need to, "at minimum," be halved by 2030 to keep temperature increase below 1.5\'b0C. "To stay on the 1.5\'b0C pathway the EU needs to adopt a 2030 target at least -65 percent as its fair share" CAN Europe It says it has noted the commitment of the Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen to present a proposal for a more ambitious EU 2030 climate target of a reduction of 55 percent. "However, to stay on the 1.5\'b0C pathway the EU needs to adopt a 2030 target at least -65 percent as its fair share." The letter concludes, "We urge the European Union to announce at the COP25 its commitment to significantly improve its 2030 target. The earlier the EU will do this, the bigger impact it will have on the global climate ambition by incentivising further action from others." "For this we need the European Parliament to maintain its role in calling for higher ambition in the EU." \</doc>

ACCIONA will be actively participating in the COP25 climate Summit, that will be held in Madrid from the 2nd to the 13th of December. The company will be taking part in many different forums and meetings sponsored by the United Nations, with the aim of accelerating corporations' commitments to fighting the ongoing climate emergency. The company will also roll out various campaigns throughout Madrid to raise awareness on this global issue. Jose Manuel Entrecanales, Chairman and CEO of ACCIONA, will attend the COP25 inauguration ceremony on Monday 2nd of December. In addition, among other events, Entrecanales will participate in the High Level Meeting on Climate Change as part of the Caring4Climate forum (Wednesday, 11th December). This gathering is a UN initiative directed at high-profile business leaders, which aims to mobilize corporations in the acceleration of our economy's decarbonization. Various ACCIONA representatives will speak at COP25 discussions and forums that will address important developments such as clean energy and resilient infrastructure, the progress in sustainable water management and sanitation models, as well as how to reduce the climate footprint of large cities. Along these lines, the company will engage in the presentation of the Flexibility Solutions for High Renewable Energy Systems report, (Wednesday, 4th December), carried out in collaboration with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. This study offers specific solutions for decarbonizing electrical systems in areas such as storage, demand management, flexible charging of electric vehicles and interconnections. The formation of investment models for resilient infrastructure in Latin America will be the key focus point of meetings organized by the Inter-American Development Bank (Monday and Tuesday, 9th and 10th December) in which ACCIONA will also participate. ACCIONA, as an experienced company in electric motorcycle sharing services in Spain, will contribute its knowhow on this business model for the UN Environment Program's annual report on electric mobility on Thursday 12th December. The Spanish Engineering Institute will sponsor a conference on Innovation as a driving force behind sustainability on Wednesday 4th December. For this occasion, ACCIONA will showcase its commitment to the future and to technological development. In an event organized by ACCIONA and the Elcano Royal Institute, a number of global leaders will analyze international regulatory models for decarbonization. The forum, Reaching net zero: Learning from international experiences with climate legislation, will take place on Thursday 12th December, at the COP25 headquarters. The company will also be showcasing its expertise through the acciona.org foundation, an initiative that provides basic energy and clean water services in rural areas in Peru, Mexico and Panama. Acciona.org's efforts will be included as one of the best practices presented at the Spanish Companies and Human Rights discussion, organized by the Spanish Global Compact Network (Wednesday, 4th December). OUTREACH AND RAISING AWARENESS ACCIONA will extend its participation in COP25 This Saturday (30th November), ACCIONA will install a 16-metre wind turbine blade in the heart of Madrid (at Paseo de la Castellana N33). This blade was used in one of the first wind farms developed in Spain 25 years ago, El Cabrito, located in Tarifa (Cadiz). In addition, the company has also installed a 40-metre blade at IFEMA (opposite Pavilion 1). By doing so, the company intends to exhibit the evolution of this renewable technology, which has now been proven to be competitive, economic, and manageable. ACCIONA will roll out a campaign along Madrid's metro line 8, which links the city center to the IFEMA grounds, to raise awareness of the global climate panorama. This campaign is a gesture in favor of public transport's role in reducing pollution and making large cities more livable, while at the same time offering passengers food for thought. The website HYPERLINK https://www.acciona.com/ HYPERLINK cop25 / will provide relevant information during the summit, allowing users to understand the impact and scope of COP25 , a global event that counts on ACCIONA as one of its main sponsors. In addition, ACCIONA's stand at COP25 will encourage visitors to take action towards achieving a sustainable city, through a unique and fun augmented reality (AR) experience. Homeward Bound, the program sponsored by ACCIONA that promotes women's leadership in science and sustainability, will close this year's edition with a special encounter in Madrid.

A vote to register the current situation across the continent a "climate emergency" was passed by a large majority. It comes a day after an internal EU docoment revealed climate protection could cost Europe (EURO)3trillion. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said the European Commission laid out how (EURO)300billion would be spent each year. This is part of Brussels plans for Europe to become the first carbon neutral continent by 2050. Related articles The funds would be coming from the EU budget as well as member states and the private sector, claims the bloc paper. New EU President Ursula von der Leyen has called for at least half the budget of the bloc to be spent on climate protection. However, a spokesman for Ms von der Leyen said: "The cited Commission document is not known to her and it could at most be administrative considerations." Activists praised the move with many seeing it as a rebuke to Donald Trump and his actions against the Paris climate deal. Irish Green Party MEP Grace O'Sullivan added: "Thankfully, unhelpful amendments pushing nuclear energy were not moved." Sven Giegold, of the Green Party, tweeted: "Yes! The European Parliament declares Climate emergency! An important sign at the right time. These are crucial years for future generations! Very sad: large parts of the Christian Democrats have voted against it!" Greenpeace hailed the move but said more now needs to be done. In a statement it said: "We need Europe to set climate targets to cut emissions by 2030 in line with science NOW." However, many will see the declaration as merely a symobolic act, aimed to increased pressure on member states. And others raged the monthly mass trip from Brussels to Strasbourg should be scrapped as starting point to dealing with the crisis. Scottish MEP Alyn Smith said the journeys emit 19,000 tonnes of CO2. There is also rising anger at the Strasbourg facilities carbon footprint for a building which is only open 48 days a year. And German MEP Peter Liese said the message of an emergency creates "panic and images of the Third Reich". He said: "This is not panic mongering. We need to keep a sober head." Leading group EPP had also called for the use of the word "urgency" rather than emergency. The resolution was passed by 429 votes with 225 MEPs voted against the action. Yeseterday, Ms von der Leyen, who takes over from Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday, says: "We do not have a moment to waste on fighting climate change. The faster Europe moves, the greater the advantage will be for our citizens, our competitiveness and our prosperity." Today's vote came ahead of the United Nations climate change conference COP25 , which takes place in Madrid, Spain.

Beating climate change requires "leadership and common sense", presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg has told delegates at an international climate summit where the US has been notable by its absence. The former New York mayor and multimillionaire Democrat appeared at COP25 in Madrid yesterday as the second week of fraught negotiations on the final details of the Paris Agreement began. "Beating climate change won't require a miracle, it won't require limitless resources," Mr Bloomberg told the crowd at the packed event. "It will require leadership and common sense." Mr Bloomberg, who announced his candidacy for president in November, said he was at the COP25 talks "because Donald Trump is not". "I'm here because his administration refused to lead on climate change, so others must do the work." President Trump began the year-long process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement in November - an act which will not take effect until after the 2020 presidential election - and was not present at the summit. Instead, the US was represented at COP25 by a congressional delegation of Democrats led by house speaker Nancy Pelosi who said congress had an "iron-clad" commitment to action on the climate crisis. In a tweet, Mr Bloomberg said that, if elected president, one of the first things he would do is re-enter the Paris Agreement and "increase America's commitment to reducing emissions". Most other Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, have made similar promises. Mr Bloomberg is vice-president of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change and Energy, a group of city representatives around the world aiming to go beyond national commitments to curb their carbon emissions. To highlight this, the US Climate Action Centre has been running events at COP25 showcasing the carbon reduction work of academic, cultural, corporate and agricultural institutions. One event focused on some of the hundreds of legal actions taken by state attorney generals against federal rollbacks to environmental regulation in the three years since Mr Trump became president. A recent report by the New York University School of Law's State Energy and Environmental Impact Centre said the Trump administration had "engaged in a concerted, across-the-board attempt to weaken many of our nation's bedrock health, safety and environmental laws" and states had been a powerful force in challenging it. The COP25 Mr Gore said he wanted to send a message that the vast majority of Americans want the rest of the world to hear: "We are still here." The climate talks are well into their second week now, with discussions officially scheduled to end on Friday. But with agreement on some of the more controversial details looking increasingly unlikely, NGOs, activist groups and developing nation representatives are stepping up the pressure on national ministers to make ambitious choices that respect human rights and give minority voices a chance to be heard. \</doc>

December 2, 2019 BMW Group joins "Getting to Zero Coalition" ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference . The objective: decarbonisation of international maritime shipping. Munich. The BMW Group has expanded its commitment towards making transport logistics more sustainable. Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid and as part of the Group's commitment to further reduce carbon emissions along the entire value chain, the company has joined the "Getting to Zero Coalition". The objective of this initiative is to use zero-emission cargo vessels from 2030. The Getting to Zero Coalition is a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum, the Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Form. "Maritime transport is crucial for supplying the BMW Group's international manufacturing network and for the global distribution of vehicles. We see the Getting to Zero Coalition of various governments, companies and other cross-sector stakeholders as a unique opportunity to continuously minimise carbon emissions in the maritime sector as well", emphasises J\'fcrgen Maidl, Senior Vice President Production Network and Supply Chain Management at the BMW Group. "We are delighted to be the first carmaker to join this coalition and thus lead the way towards more sustainability." Maritime transport currently accounts for 50 per cent of the BMW Group's transport chain CO2 emissions. Globally, around three per cent of the overall greenhouse gas emissions come from maritime transport - and the trend is strongly upwards. As part of the Getting to Zero Coalition, the BMW Group now wants to achieve a total elimination of carbon emissions by using carbon-free fuels and new propulsion systems as well as optimising energy efficiency. With its activities as part of the Getting to Zero Coalition, the BMW Group is continuing to push decarbonisation within the company in the area of logistics: in addition to the sustainability strategy along the entire value chain, the Group's holistic approach also includes resource-friendly production methods in BMW plants worldwide and further development of electric mobility. The BMW Group has succeeded, for example, in reducing the consumption of resources and emissions per vehicle produced by more than 50 per cent since 2006. In addition, all plants operated by the BMW Group and the three BBA joint venture plants in China will be supplied exclusively with energy from renewable sources from next year. The BMW Group plants in Europe are already being supplied with 100 per cent green electricity since 2017. By focusing on electric mobility from a very early stage, BMW has also become one of the global pioneers of this technology. The BMW i3 has been the global leader in its segment since 2013. With a portfolio currently including 12 models, BMW offers the widest range of electric vehicles in the market. By 2021, one million electrified vehicles of the BMW Group will be on the roads. Moreover, by 2023, the company will be offering 25 electrified models. BMW Group reconfirms its clear commitment to the UN Agenda 2030 The announcement that the BMW Group has joined the Getting to Zero Coalition in advance of COP 25 , taking place from 2 to 13 December in Madrid, is no coincidence. The United Nations Climate Change Conferences and the BMW Group's activities are linked by a long history of close collaboration. The BMW Group has actively taken part in the COP climate change conferences on a regular basis since 2008. This year, the company will contribute new ideas and its technical expertise on sustainable development once again. The focus of the activities will be on the renewed involvement of the BMW Group as a headline sponsor of the Sustainable Innovation Forum (SIF) on 10 and 11 December 2019. The SIF has been one of the leading sustainability conferences in the UN COP fringe programme for many years and is regularly attended by global key stakeholders from politics, industry, science and society, who use it as a platform for discussion on the challenges of sustainable development. In this context, the BMW Group will mainly present current developments in electric mobility and demonstrate how smart and digital technologies can contribute to sustainable mobility.

MADRID, Spain -- The African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) has urged the continent's nations to stay the course on climate action, after a marathon session of talks at the twenty-fifth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. The conference was scheduled to run from 2 to 13 December, but only concluded business on Sunday, two days after the official programme ended. Meanwhile, back home, Africans were reminded of the all-too-real consequences if these talks fail to deliver results. Thousands of East Africans have been displaced in the wake of heavy rains that have battered the region since October, and more wet weather is expected due to an Indian Ocean Dipole attributed to the warming of the ocean. Such extreme weather events should galvanise Africans; their governments are spending 2% of GDP on climate related disasters, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. He encouraged the global community to remain steadfast in finding effective solutions to climate change.The annual negotiations are now in their 25th year. "The global community, and in particular Africa has a lot to offer in terms of solutions; what is evidently lacking is the global political will to turn potential into wealth to serve humanity and the planet,"said Nyong, who led the Bank's delegation to the UN conference. At the conference, African delegates pushed for support for climate finance to build resilience against the impact of climate change and for special consideration for Africa around targets contained in the treaties under discussion. The discussions at COP 25 centred around the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to cut carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C.The conference ended with a declaration on the "urgent need" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement. The African Development Bank attended the conference to lend strategic support to its regional member countries in the negotiations. Nyong pointed out that Africa is committed; 51 of the 54 African countries have already ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement signed at the landmark COP21 in Paris. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. Support for the Bank-funded Desert to Power project highlighted Africa's determination to strive for a climate-friendly world, especially for its local populations, said Nyong. Desert to Power is a $ 20 billion initiative to deploy solar energy solutions across the entire Sahel region, generating 10,000 MW to provide 250 million people with clean electricity. "The African Development Bank stands ready as ever to assist its regional member countries to build resilience against climate change, as indicated by the Bank's decision to join theAlliance for Hydromet Development, announced at COP 25 ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/35sye5S https://bit.ly/35sye5S The Bank will also continue to drive initiatives to strengthen the ability of regional member countries to advocate robustly at global forums such as COP 25 , Nyong added. One example was the Bank's participation at the annual African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and support for the Africa Group of Negotiations (AGN). "We look forward to engaging further with regional member countries and other parties to ensure that the continent's development agenda remains on track," Nyong added. Leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, attended the conference in Madrid.

According to new research nearly 40 percent of global land plant species can be categorized as very rare, and these species are most at risk of extinction as climate and land use continues to change. An international team of researchers, including Professor Jon Lovett from the University of Leeds, worked for 10 years to compile 20 million observational records of the world's land plants. The result is the largest dataset on botanical biodiversity ever created. They found that there are about 435,000 unique land plant species on Earth. Of these thirty-six and a half percent are 'exceedingly rare,' meaning they have only ever been observed and recorded fewer than five times. The researchers hope this information can help reduce global biodiversity losses by informing strategic conservation action that includes consideration of the effects of climate change and land use. 'In many of these regions agriculture, forestry and urban development is on the rise. Without robust conservation policies there is a real risk to loss of diversity in rare species and because of their low numbers this puts them a greater risk of extinction.' PROFESSOR JON LOVETT, SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY Their findings are published in a special issue of Science Advances that coincides with the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , in Madrid. The COP25 is convening nations to act on climate change. Professor Lovett, from the School of Geography at Leeds, has researched the flora of Africa for 40 years, and is part of the Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change (SPARC) research project. He said: 'The analysis is the biggest so far for the African continent and really underlines the importance of rarity in the African flora. 'It shows how vulnerable many species in Africa are - especially from changes to their habitat. The good news is that many of the rare plants are in places, such as mountains, where they can be resilient to climate change by moving locally. The real danger to them is changes in land use through deforestation, fire and agriculture.' Lead author Brian Enquist, University of Arizona professor of Ecology and Evolutionary biology said: 'When talking about global biodiversity, we had a good approximation of the total number of land plant species, but we didn't have a real handle on how many there really are.' 'According to ecological and evolutionary theory, we'd expect many species to be rare, but the actual observed number we found was actually pretty startling,' he said. 'There are many more rare species than we expected.' The researchers found that rare species tend to cluster in a handful of hotspots, such as the Northern Andes in South America, Costa Rica, South Africa, eastern Africa, Madagascar and Southeast Asia. Many of these regions, they found, have remained climatologically stable over long periods of time, allowing such rare species to persist. But just because these species enjoyed a relatively stable climate in the past does not mean they will enjoy a stable future. The research also revealed that these very rare species hotspots are projected to experience a disproportionally high rate of future climate change and human disruption. Professor Lovett said: 'In many of these regions agriculture, forestry and urban development are on the rise. Without robust conservation policies there is a real risk to loss of diversity in rare species and because of their low numbers this puts them a greater risk of extinction.' Patrick Roehrdanz a co-author on the paper and managing scientist at Conservation International said: 'This work is better able to highlight the dual threats of climate change and human impact on the regions that harbor much of the world's rare plant species and emphasizes the need for strategic conservation to protect these cradles of biodiversity.'

"Today is the last day of the COP25 in Madrid", said Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. "And I appeal to the delegates of all Member States to convey a message of ambition to the world". He urged all to align "their objectives with science" to make sure that "temperatures will not rise above 1.5C at the end of the century". Mr. Guterres maintained that a "spirit of compromise is necessary for a successful conclusion of the regulations related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement" of 2015, which was signed by 193 countries to limit the damage caused by a warming world. He also underscored the importance of "showing a very strong commitment and a very strong ambition in climate action". The UN chief congratulated the European Union for its announcement on Friday, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and called for this example of climate action "to be followed worldwide". Only coal-reliant Poland out of the 28-member bloc, decided it would not commit. According to his spokesperson, the Secretary-General continues to meet with various parties at the Conference as talks go into the night, with the possibility that proceedings may continue into Saturday. All eyes £re on us' At an on-site press conference, Andres Landerretche, COP25 Presidency Coordinator, spelled out: "The eyes of the people are on us". Recalling that a consensus between 193 States was needed before the conference could be concluded, he acknowledged that "negotiations have always been very difficult". While "our priorities are always a call to ambition, mitigation efforts and adaptation" he flagged that the underlying issue underpinning final negotiations, was the "key element" of finance. "Some groups ask for more financing to move forward with climate action plans", including for technology transference and capacity building. Everyone has a role to play Mr. Landerretche stressed that while governments are responsible for frameworks, a cultural change must take place, with everyone asking themselves three fundamental questions: What am I doing to reduce my carbon footprint, resilience and vulnerabilities? Because, added, "everybody has to be on board". The coordinator told journalists that his mood was one of "general-moderate optimism" and he was "quite pleased" with comments from the floor in terms of a final text, which he hoped would "crystalize into a very good outcome". "Our intention is to finish the programme", he concluded. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK www.m2.com )) \</doc>

I am disappointed with the results of # COP25 . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up.- Ant\'f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 15, 2019 UN chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres expressed his feelings on Twitter, but refused to see the conference as a defeat, and wrote that he is "more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise". However, by Friday, when the conference had been expected to end, agreement on some important issues had been reached by negotiators, for example on capacity building, a gender programme, and technology, but an overall deal was held up over disagreement on the larger, and more contentious issues dealing with loss and damage caused by man-made climate change, as well as financing for adaptation. Weary negotiators worked through Friday night, at the request of the Chilean president of the COP, but a draft version of the outcome text released on Saturday morning was reported to have underwhelmed all parties to the negotiations, with representatives of NGOs and civil society describing it as unacceptable, and a betrayal of the commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. At 3pm local time on Saturday afternoon, a press conference was held by the COP organisers, explaining that the negotiators were still hard at work, aiming to "show the outside world that we can deliver, that multilateralism works." By Saturday evening, there was still no sign of a deal, prompting acclaimed 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg, one of the high-profile speakers at the Climate Action Summit held at UN Headquarters in September, to announce that "it seems like COP25 in Madrid is falling apart right now. The science is clear, but the science is being ignored". Improved commitments announced at all levels Despite the disappointment voiced at the contents of the outcome document, several announcements made during the two-week conference to indicate progress. The European Union, for example, committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, and 73 nations announced that they will submit an enhanced climate action plan (or Nationally Determined Contribution). A groundswell of ambition for a cleaner economy was also evident a regional and local level, with 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors are working towards achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Discussions held during COP25 broadened the understanding of the science behind the climate crisis, and the critical need for urgency: the UN Global Compact, which works with the private sector, announced that 177 companies have now agreed to set science-based climate targets that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. That is double the number of companies that signed up to the pledge at the Climate Action Summit, representing private sector emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France. Scottish bagpipes were heard in Madrid on Friday, marking next year's climate conference, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. COP26, due to be held in December 2020, is being touted as an important milestone in the fight against climate change, because countries will be expected to present upgraded national climate plans, that go beyond commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

1. We just had the Climate Action Summit in New York. How is COP25 different? The Climate Action Summit in September was the initiative of the UN Secretary-General to focus the attention of the international community on the climate emergency and to accelerate actions to reverse climate change. The Climate Conference (held in Madrid after the meeting was moved from Chile due to unrest there), COP25 , is the actual Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which is tasked with making sure that the Convention, (and now the 2015 Paris Agreement, which strengthens the Convention), are being implemented. 2. But why all the UN attention on the climate? There is more evidence of the impacts of climate change, especially in extreme weather events, and these impacts are taking a greater toll. The science shows that emissions are still going up, not down. According to the 2019 WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned, in its 2019 Emissions Gap Report, that greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 are needed to meet the internationally agreed goal of a 1.5\'b0C increase in temperatures over pre-industrial levels. Scientists agree that's a tall order, and that the window of opportunity is growing smaller. 3. So what did the September Climate Action Summit achieve? The summit served as a springboard ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris Agreement, focusing global attention on the climate emergency and the urgent need to significantly scale up action. And leaders, from many countries and sectors, stepped up. More than seventy countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world's largest. Small island states together committed to achieve carbon neutrality and to move to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030. And countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees. More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating the green economy. A group of the world's largest asset-owners, controlling $ 2 trillion, pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050. This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world's invested capital, some $ 34 trillion, for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide. 4. Hang on: UNEP, WMO, IPCC, UNFCCC, COP...why all the acronyms? It's true that the UN is a very acronym-heavy place. These ones all represent international tools and agencies that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. Here's how they fit together. UNEP is the UN Environment Programme, the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment. WMO stands for World Meteorological Office, the UN agency for international cooperation in areas such as weather forecasting, observing changes in the climate, and studying water resources. In 1988 the UN General Assembly asked UNEP and the WMO to establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is made of hundreds of experts, in order to assess data, and providing reliable scientific evidence for climate action negotiations. All three UN bodies publish reports that, in recent years, have frequently made international headlines, as concerns about the climate crisis have grown. As for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), this document was signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the treaty, nations agreed to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere" to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, 197 countries are parties to the treaty. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a "conference of the parties", or COP, has been held to discuss how to move forward. Madrid will hold the 25th COP, therefore COP25 . 5. And what's important about this COP? COP25 is the final COP before we enter the defining year of 2020, when many nations must submit new climate action plans. Among the many elements that need to be ironed out is the financing of climate action worldwide. Currently, not enough is being done to meet the three climate goals: reducing emissions 45 per cent by 2030; achieving climate neutrality by 2050 (which means a net zero carbon footprint), and stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5\'b0C by the end of the century. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, the world cannot afford to waste more time, and a bold, decisive, ambitious way forward needs to be agreed.

16-year-old Greta Thunberg said journalists shouldn't listen to her over others She said: 'It's absurd. I don't like to be the centre of attention all the time'   Reportedly likely to leave UN climate summit meeting early this week to go home Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg announced to 420 reporters that she is tired of the relentless media attention she is getting. The 16-year-old activist arrived in Madrid last Friday, following a three-week sailing trip across the Atlantic, because she has sworn off flying due to the threat it poses for the environment. Greta was joined by other activists at an event at La Casa Encendida where the COP25 United Nations climate change conference is being held. 'There is no need to listen to us anymore,' she said. 'It is people especially from the global south, especially from indigenous communities, who need to tell their stories,' she said before handing the mic to young activists from the United States, the Philippines, Russia, Uganda, Chile and the Marshall Islands. The 420 journalists there mainly directed their questions to Ms Thunberg, prompting her to say: 'They shouldn't listen to me before anyone else. I am a small part of a very big movement.' 'As long as the press writes about me, they are also writing about the climate crisis.' The teenager later took part in a climate march attended by roughly 25,000 people. Two were arrested and six police officers were injured during the march, which also saw Spanish actor Javier Bardem call the Mayor of Madrid 'stupid' for his opinions on climate change. The actor has since apologised. Ms Thunberg was then forced to leave early for security reasons and fellow activists from her Fridays for Future movement said she was upset that she was being followed so much. Yesterday she turned up to a meeting at Madrid's Complutense University wearing a hooded sweatshirt that covered her face as she prepared the agenda for this week. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par She chose the university as the meeting place because hundreds of other environmental groups meet there and it is informally referred to as the HQ of the 'counter-summit'. She reportedly said she wanted a secondary role in two upcoming meetings this week - today at the COP25 The Spanish spokesman for Fridays for Future told El Pais: 'She gets really stressed out with all the media pressure. 'She feels more comfortable in safe spaces.' Ms Thunberg is reportedly unlikely to stay until the last day of the summit on Friday and is anxious to get back to Stockholm to be with her mother. It was Thunberg's first official appearance at the meeting of nearly 200 states tasked with fleshing out the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting global temperature rises. The panel took it in turns to make statements. Greta Thunberg, Sweden: '(Indigenous peoples') rights are being violated across the world and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency.' Angela Valenzuela, Chile: 'While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments the world is literally burning out.' COP25 is focused on finding elaborate ways for rich industrialised countries to be able to carry on polluting while pretending not to.' 'As we know well in Chile, neoliberalism is a death cult. As we know from past attempts, the market will not save us from the climate crisis.' Carlon Zackhras, Marshall Islands: 'We have been told if we want to stay in our islands we have to adapt and elevate with migration as the only plan B.' 'We are having to deal with issues we did not create.' 'My home is only two metres above water. With the threat of climate change we lose two metres of our culture.' Nakabuye Hilda Flavia, Uganda: 'It a bit reminds me of the rampant racism and apartheid my ancestors endured. We are suffering severe effects of climate change, as if coming from the global south is a mortal sin, with no or very little action from developing countries.' 'Which type of storm or flavour of floods must Africa taste for us to get climate justice.' 'Developed countries must be ashamed of themselves given the amount of carbon they emit compared to what Africa is emitting. We almost emit nothing but we are suffering the most.' Rose Whipple, Santee Dakota, Ho-Chunk, Winnebago, USA: 'The climate crisis is a spiritual crisis for our entire world. Our solutions must weave science and spirituality and traditional ecological knowledge with technology.' 'Our movements must be bigger than recycling and braver than holding signs.' 'It is up to each and every one of us to build movements that centre the rights of indigenous peoples, healing and justice for the next seven generations. \</doc>

GLASGOW was the most active city in Scotland last year in terms of hotel investment, and third-top in the UK outside London, analysis has revealed. In its UK Hotel Capital Markets Investment Review 2020, property consultancy Knight Frank highlights around \£3260 million of hotel deals last year in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Inverness. It calculates that, in Glasgow, \£3170m was spent across nine transactions in 2019, covering a total of more than 1,700 rooms. Knight Frank noted Glasgow's desirability as a tourist and events destination. It flagged the COP 26 United Nations climate change conference , which will take place in the city in November, as an example of the scale of event that Glasgow was able to attract. READ MORE:\~Ian McConnell: Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experiment, amid Brexit folly The property consultancy also flagged further significant new hotel openings planned in Glasgow in coming years. John Rae, head of Knight Frank's Glasgow office, said: "It's been a strong year for investment in Glasgow hotels - a reflection of the fact that it is emerging as a highly desirable tourist and events destination. The arrival of the COP26 United Nations climate change conference later this year is indicative of the scale of events that Glasgow can now host, and it is a huge opportunity to highlight all the city has to offer." He added: "There are a substantial number of hotel rooms to be added in Glasgow over the next few years, with a range of well-known and boutique operators confirmed or planning new premises in the city. As they come on stream, we expect hotel investment activity to remain strong in the years ahead as investors increasingly look to alternative property assets."

It flagged the sale of the Fairmont St Andrews as the biggest deal of the year in the Scottish "secondary' market". \</doc>

November 26, 2019 ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- WHO: African Development Bank Group WHAT: 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) WHERE: IFEMA, Madrid, Spain WHEN: 2-13 December 2019 The 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) organized and presided over by Chile will take place in Madrid, Spain, from 2 to 13 December 2019. The 197 Parties that make up the treaty -- 196 nations plus the European Union -- will seek to move towards the implementation of the agreements that have been reached under the Convention that lays down specific obligations for all Parties to fight climate change. Having signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, nearly all African countries have committed to enhancedclimate action through reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and building resilience. For the continent, adaptation to the adverse impact of climate change is urgent.Now is the time to translate the commitments made by African countries under the Paris Agreement into action, by safeguarding development gains andbuilding resilienceagainstextreme weather eventsthat areincreasing in frequency and intensity. This annual conference is the single global platform for all nations to negotiate an internationally agreed way forward to combat climate change. It also represents a key event that brings together all the major stakeholders engaged on climate change issues from across governments, private sector and civil society, including the African Development Bank's main partners in the climate change domain. Highly represented in previous COP summits, the\~African Development Bank,the continent's\~premier\~development finance institution, will be present in Madrid to support regional member countries to engage in an informed and effective manner in the negotiations through support to the African group of negotiators and through advocacy to make Africa's voice heard in the international arena. The Bank has, through its climate change action plan, made important commitments to integrate climate considerations across its operations and to scale up its climate investments in African countries. Last September, the Multilateral Development Banks announced their plan to increase the global climate action investments each year to $ 175 billion by 2025.In Madrid, the African Development Bank will join the other MDBs to showcase our joint commitment to combatting climate change. A delegation of experts from the African Development Bank, led by Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth, will engage with public and private actors to build and strengthen partnerships to promote climate-resilient and low-carbon development in Africa. The Bank's experts will participate in different events and hold sessions at the Multilateral Development Banks' Pavilion about climate finance, building resilience and mainstreaming gender in climate change operations, among other topics. The MDB Pavilion is the fruit of collaboration between Asian Development Bank (ADB) ( HYPERLINK http://www.ADB.org www.ADB.org ), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank(EIB) ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.EIB.org www.EIB.org ), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.IsDB.org www.IsDB.org ) and World Bank. 10 December: Africa Day 10 December marks Africa Day at COP25 .

Ant\'f3nio Guterres issued the charge on Wednesday in a speech to the annual Caring for Climate Meeting, held during the on-going UN COP25 climate conference in Madrid. The magnitude of the climate emergency is jeopardizing our future and life as we know it. I have come back to # COP25 to appeal for a successful conclusion of the conference and increased #ClimateAction and ambition.- Ant\'f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 11, 2019 "I'm meeting more and more business leaders that complain that they cannot do more because governments will not allow them to do so, because of the environment that is still created in the bureaucratic, administrative, tax regulatory and other frameworks that are under government control", he said. Business sector fights climate change Caring for Climate mobilizes business leaders to implement and recommend solutions and policies to beat climate change. It was launched in 2007 and is convened by the UN Global Compact, the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). With the climate crisis increasingly jeopardizing life on the planet, the Secretary-General stressed that more collective action will be needed from governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society. "While we see some incremental steps towards sustainable business models, it is nowhere near the scope or scale required", he said. "What we need is not an incremental approach, but a transformational approach. And we need businesses to unite behind the science by taking rapid and ambitious action across their operations and value chains." The "science" refers to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. This will require reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, by 45 per cent by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Business and finance cannot act alone Business and financial leaders have been doing their part to beat climate change, as the Secretary-General acknowledged. He was encouraged that 170 major companies have committed to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets through the 'Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees' campaign. However, he said the business and financial sectors cannot act alone. Next year, many governments will present plans to reduce their emissions, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Mr. Guterres forecast that these enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will include carbon neutral strategies and green initiatives in sectors such as energy, industry, construction and transport. \~ "In support of these efforts, I am calling on you, leaders from the private sector and civil society, to challenge your Governments to use this opportunity to make clear their economic development policies that will enable your companies to invest decisively in a net-zero future," he said. The UN chief added that millions worldwide, particularly young people, recognize that more must be done to limit the worst impacts of climate disruption. "That's why they are calling on leaders from all sectors to do exponentially more to address the climate emergency," he said. "We are quickly nearing our last opportunity to be on the right side of history." In his speech to the COP's high-level event on Global Climate Action, the Secretary-General urged the world's biggest emitters to do more on climate. "If we do not reach carbon neutrality by 2050, all our current efforts to promote sustainable development will be undermined," he said. Mr, Guterres also laid out 10 priorities to tackle the climate crisis. They including securing commitments from the main emitters of more ambitious national commitments by 2020, ensuring that all governments follow the example of the 75 countries that committed to coming forward by next year with net zero emissions strategies for 2050, and ensuring that national commitments include a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected in the transition to a green economy. Youth climate activisit, Greta Thunberg, addresses the high-level meeting on Caring for Climate at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid. Greta Thunberg's visit The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg was at the UN conference on Wednesday, urging participants to focus on the science behind climate change. She explained it was important to keep to the 1.5-degree threshold "because even at one degree, people are dying from the climate crisis." "Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilizing the climate so that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing arctic permafrost. Every fraction of a degree matters." Ms. Thunberg told world leaders at the UN's Climate Action Summit in September that they were "failing" her generation, by not taking action to ease the climate crisis fast enough, and on Wednesday, the 16-year-old Swede who founded the school strike movement, was named by TIME magazine as their 2019 Person of the Year. The UN Secretary-General has welcomed this acknowledgement of young people's role in climate action, his deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists in New York. "As I understand it, this is a recognition of the effect that youth have been having on this debate, and the Secretary-General has been very clear about the need for the world's leaders to listen to youth. It is their world that we are currently damaging through our inaction and our delayed action. One day, they will be the inheritors of the world that we have left for them, and we need to make sure that we have done right by them. And it's good to see recognition, both of the powerful role they can have when they make their voices heard and of the importance of listening to them," he said.

\~ Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton has represented Chile on a series of "green" bonds as the Andean country blazes a trail for sustainable finance in Latin America. The latest issuances - $1.65 billion in the U.S. and (EURO)1.96 billion in Europe - priced and closed in January. All told, Chile has raised more than $6 billion via the green bond market since June. Chilean firm Morales & Besa, led by partner Guillermo Morales, also counseled Chile. Shearman & Sterling, led by partners Stuart Fleischmann and Grissel Mercado, represented underwriters on both the U.S. dollar-denominated and the euro bonds. Garrigues partner Pedro Garc\'eda served as Chilean counsel for the underwriters. Chile intends to invest the proceeds into projects that qualify as "eligible green expenditures" under the country's Green Bond Framework. Those expenditures could include renewable energy projects, infrastructure for electrified transport, water management, and eco-friendly buildings. "In the face of climate change, markets seem to favor issuers that can present them with investment opportunities that indicate a commitment to the climate change agenda," said Andr\'e9s de la Cruz, a Cleary partner based in Buenos Aires who worked the deals. Investors around the world are clamoring for more "green" options as they seek better outcomes for the planet, as well as lower long-term credit risk. For issuers, green bonds expand the potential pool of investors they can tap, which can also reduce financing costs. To date, most of the green bonds issued out of Latin America have been from corporations. Chile was the first country in the Americas to issue green bonds, inspiring countries such as Peru and Mexico to consider green bonds as well. De la Cruz says a number of clients have reached out to discuss the possibility of issuing green bonds since Chile first took that step over the summer. The HYPERLINK Climate Bonds Initiative Justine Leigh-Bell, deputy CEO for the Climate Bonds Initiative, called Chile's inaugural green bond last summer "a huge step in the development of green finance in Latin America and a benchmark for the region." Chile was slated to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in December, but moved the event to Madrid amid violent civil unrest in Santiago, the Chilean capital. The UN climate conferences aim to secure commitments from countries to reduce their carbon footprints.

Development banks focus on incorporating social justice into climate action. In pursuit of the 2015 Paris Agreement's demand for a 'just transition' to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future - one offering social justice to those who fear losing jobs and communities as high-carbon assets are phased out - representatives of multilateral development banks discussed strategies at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid today with government officials, diplomats and economists. The high-level meeting indicated the growing importance of this theme in climate planning, Pierre Heilbronn, EBRD Vice President, Policy and Partnerships, commented: 'Just Transition has several angles: from supporting regions and communities which may be left with a high share of stranded assets or labour, such as coal-mining regions, to helping vulnerable communities adapt to climate change, such as farmers in regions affected by increasingly severe droughts. It also examines the social impacts of climate change policies and projects - topics such as fuel poverty linked to the rise of energy costs.' The purpose of the event was to discuss and better define the role that multilateral development banks (MDBs) can play to support a just transition as well as identifying areas for collaboration. Opened by the EBRD's Managing Director for Economics, Policy and Governance, Mattia Romani, the discussion featured a keynote speech by climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who highlighted the role that MDBs can play in reducing and managing risks linked to sustainable investments. MDB representatives included the Inter-American Development Bank's Climate Change Division chief Amal-Lee Amin, the World Bank Group's Climate Policy Manager, Stephen Hammer, EBRD's Vice President Heilbronn, International Finance Corporation's Vice-President for Economics and Private Sector Development, Hans Peter Lankes, and European Investment Bank's Director for Environment and Sustainable Territorial Development, Werner Schmidt. Closing remarks came from Poland's Ambassador and Special Envoy on Climate, Artur Lorkowski. Spain was represented by Laura Marin, advisor to minister for ecological transition Teresa Ribera. Just Transition initiatives by the EBRD, which works in high-emissions regions where many carbon-intensive assets will need to be retired in the next decade, include finding alternative energy supplies to replace the most ecologically damaging fossil fuels while preserving local communities. Projects like the big solar power plant being built over an exhausted lignite coal mine in North Macedonia, which the EBRD is financing, will potentially allow local communities to transfer to new forms of locally available work. At last year's COP24 climate summit in Katowice, 53 countries signed the 'Just Transition Declaration' which recognises that understanding the social aspect of action on climate change is crucial for gaining social approval for the changes taking place. Furthermore, around 50 countries support the UN 'Climate Action for Jobs' initiative launched in September 2019, committing them to formulate national just transition plans as part of long term strategies to tackle climate change. As implementation of the Paris Agreement increasingly requires accelerated action, this will present challenges for economic activities linked to carbon-intensive industries, which may face significant short and medium term adverse impacts. This is why the EU has pledged support to its coal regions to ensure a just transition as it looks to become a climate-neutral continent. This support involves thinking about how to transfer skills and resources to new economic sectors as more diversified economic approaches make regions and countries more resilient.

The European Committee of the Regions is looking forward to the COP25 climate summit in Madrid as an opportunity to formally acknowledge the key role of the EU's cities and regions in strategic climate governance and ensure their adequate engagement in reducing greenhouse emissions. First Vice-President Markku Markkula will lead the CoR delegation in Madrid along with the ENVE Commission chairs Cor Lamers (EPP/NL) and Jean-Noel Verfaillie (RE/FR). Members of the CoR's Commission for Environment, Climate Change and Energy (ENVE) also outlined that the local and regional level is key to the success of the European Green Deal. In a high-level debate with MEP Marie Toussaint (FR, Greens/EFA), Janez Potocnik, co-chair of United Nations' International Resource Panel, and Diederik Samsom, new Head of Cabinet of Commissioner Frans Timmermans, ENVE members exchanged views on how the European Green Deal proposed by the European Commission's president-elect Ursula von der Leyen should be implemented in partnership with local and regional authorities. The CoR will adopt a resolution on the European Green Deal in its next plenary session on 4-5 December. It has also invited a delegation of young elected politicians from across EU to Brussels to learn and exchange views on how to accelerate climate action locally. 'We very much welcome the European Green Deal, which for the first time puts sustainability at the heart of all EU policies. The Deal must follow a place-based approach to ensure that the challenges faced by our cities and regions are addressed with the right tools, resources and funding. Given our competences and our closeness to the citizens, we are committed to shaping the policies under the Green Deal and to delivering these on the ground for the benefit of our planet and our people', ENVE chair Cor Lamers stated. The COP25 summit, which has been moved from Santiago de Chile to Madrid, will take place between 2 and 13 December 2019. The CoR will be represented in Madrid by First Vice-PresidentMarkku Markkula (EPP/FI), ENVE chair Cor Lamers (EPP/NL; Mayor of Schiedam), ENVE vice-chair Jean-Noel Verfaillie (RE/FR; Member of the Nord Departmental Council), Benedetta Brighenti (PES/IT; Member of Castelnuovo Rangone Municipal Council), Andries Gryffroy (EA/BE; Member of the Flemish Parliament) and Tjisse Stelpstra (ECR/NL; Member of the Executive Council of the Province of Drenthe). The delegation was announced at the ENVE Commission meeting on 21 November where Jacob Werksman, the EU Chief negotiator for the UNFCCC COP25 in Madrid, presented the state of the negotiations between the Parties of the Paris Agreement. During a separate ceremony held around Thursday's ENVE meeting, the Portuguese town of Lousada was announced as the winner of the 2019 Transformative Action Award . Its initiative 'Integrated education for sustainability' was selected by a jury of experts for its potential to bring about the socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation of its community. The European sustainability award is organised by ICLEI, the Basque Country and the City of Aalborg (Denmark) and supported by the CoR and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The ENVE commission also discussed the draft opinion on 'Towards sustainable neighbourhoods and small communities - Environment policy below municipal level' (rapporteur Gaetano Armao, IT/EPP, Vice-President and Regional Minister for Economy of the Region of Sicily) that was unanimously approved and will be voted in the plenary of February 2020. More information: The CoR political statements for the COP25 are based on the following 2019 opinions: A Clean Planet for all - A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy , rapporteur Michele Emiliano (IT/PES); Implementing the Paris Agreement through innovative and sustainable energy transition at regional and local level , rapporteur Witold Stepien (PL/EPP); Implementing the Clean Energy Package: the NECPs as a tool for local and territorial governance approach to climate, active and passive energy , rapporteur Jozsef Ribanyi (HU/EPP); Multilevel governance and cross-sectoral cooperation to fight energy poverty , rapporteur Kata Tutto (HU/PES); Smart cities: new challenges for a just transition toward climate neutrality - how to implement the SDGs in real life? , rapporteur Andries Gryffroy (BE/EA); Covenant of Mayors post 2020 , rapporteur Benedetta Brighenti (IT/PES) - to be adopted at the December plenary session; The political statements of Andrew Cooper's (UK/EA) opinion for the COP24 in Katowice are also still valid, especially after the Katowice conclusions, inviting the Parties to consider the outcome, inputs and outputs of the Talanoa Dialogue.

The facility, which will have an initial lithium concentrate capacity of 220,000 tonnes per year, will start producing battery-grade, 6%-lithium spodumene concentrate from June 2021. Capacity will then be ramped up to\~440,000 tpy in 2022,\~Sigma Lithium's chief strategy officer Ana Cabral-Gardner told Fastmarkets on January 27. The Brazilian company\~operates in Minas Gerais, but the company\~has its\~headquarters in Canada and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Despite lower lithium prices and cost overruns at many new projects, Sigma Lithium is expected to reveal the results of a global selection process for engineering and procurement services this week, following almost a year of proposal submissions and due diligence. The project's cash cost of lithium delivered to China on a cif basis is estimated at $342 per tonne. For its base-case scenario, the miner has\~calculated an average spodumene price of\~$650 per tonne\~for 2021. Initially, the plant will produce 33,000 tpy of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), which will increase to 66,000 tpy in 2021. LCE widely is used to manufacture rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). Fastmarkets most recently assessed the lithium hydroxide monohydrate 56.5% LiOH.H2O min, battery grade, spot price cif China, Japan & Korea at $9.50-11 per kg on January 30, unchanged since January 9, and\~at its lowest level since the assessment was launched in August 2017. "Taking into account current output and commissioned projects, supply will not meet expected demand by 2025," Cabral-Gardner said. "That way, we will either see higher prices for lithium products, or simply watch supply bottlenecks emerge." Sigma's concentrate will have the\~advantage\~of being a "green" product, she said,\~because\~the plant\~will use\~renewable energy sources,\~dry-stack tailings\~and recycled water. "That gives us a commercial head start," she added.\~"Clients may not pay a premium for those products, but they most certainly will prefer that kind of material." Automakers at the end of the value chain, pay special attention to that, according to Cabral-Gardner, because the consumers\~actively\~seeking out EVs are, in most cases, doing so out of concern for the environment, and car manufacturers know that. For a Brazilian mining company, ensuring operations are environmentally state-of-the-art became even more important after the Brumadinho disaster in January 2019, when a tailings dam at the Vale-operated C\'c3\'b3rrego do Feij\'c3\£3o iron ore mine in Minas Gerais collapsed, killing\~259 people, with 11 more still\~missing. "Wet tailings\~are not going to disappear because of the Brumadinho disaster, but it brought the safety bar higher all around the world," Cabral-Gardner said. "This means some ore deposits may not be able to\~[cover the] higher costs of safety, halting their development." Cabral-Gardner\~spoke at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) about Sigma Lithium's environmental standards. "Not only the authorities, but investors are seeing the picture case by case, acknowledging higher environmental standards regardless of other events," Cabral-Gardner said. "Investment funds are uniting globally to push for standardization and better disclosure\~[about] tailings dams, and their action has a direct financial impact on miners." \</doc>

Greta Thunberg, 16, accused world leaders of running a "creative PR" campaign but failing to effectively take climate change. The teenage activist from Sweden spoke on Wednesday, December 11, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, Spain. In a powerful speech before the UN assembly, Miss Thunberg warned "we no longer have time to leave out the science". Related articles The speech was met with thunderous applause from COP25 but Miss Thunberg has also sparked the ire of US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. On Wednesday, President Bolsonaro branded the climate activist a "brat" after she tweeted about the deaths of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. President Trump also took a swipe at the activist after she was named Times Magazine's person of the year. The US President labelled the decision "ridiculous", urging the teenager to "work on her Anger Management problem". In response, Miss Thunberg updated her Twitter profile, stating: "Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend." READ MORE: Greta Thunberg causes Twitter Meltdown for winning Person of the Year Miss Thunberg's urgent call for more climate action was backed by Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres. On Wednesday Mr Guterres criticised the "bureaucratic" and "administrative" frameworks that prevent companies from limiting their environmental impact. He said: "While we see some incremental steps towards sustainable business models, it is nowhere near the scope or scale required. "What we need is not an incremental approach, but a transformational approach. "And we need businesses to unite behind the science by taking rapid and ambitious action across their operations and value chains." Related articles READ MORE Greta Thunberg UN speech at COP25 in fullHere is a transcript of the climate activists message to the UN's climate conference on Wednesday, December 11. Greta Thunberg: "Hi. A year and a half ago, I didn't speak to anyone unless I really had to but then I found a reason to speak. Since then, I've given many speeches and learned that when you talk in public, you start with something personal or emotional to get everyone's attention. Say things like, 'our house is on fire, I wanted to panic or how dare you'. "But today I will not do that because then those phrases are all that people focus on. They don't remember the facts, the very reason why I say those things in the first place, we no longer have time to leave out the science. "For about a year I have been constantly talking about our rapidly declining carbon budgets over and over again. But since that is still being ignored, I will just keep repeating it "In chapter two, on page 108 in the SR 1.5 IPCC report that came out last year, it says that if we ought to have a 6 percent to 7 percent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5C degrees, we had on January 1, 2018, 420 gigatons of CO2 left two emit in that budget. And of course, that number is much lower today as we emit about 42 gigatons of CO2 every year including land use. "With today's emissions levels, that remaining budget will be gone within about eight years. These numbers aren't anyone's opinions or political views. This is the current best available science. "Though many scientists suggest these figures or too moderate. These are the ones that have been accepted through the IPCC, and please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, which is absolutely essential to make the Paris Agreement to work on a global scale. "That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to real zero emissions much faster and then help poorer countries do the same, so people in less fortunate parts of the world can raise their living standards. These numbers also don't include most feedback loops, nonlinear tipping points, or additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution. "Most models assume, however, that future generations will somehow be able to suck hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 out of the air with technologies that do not exist in the scale required and maybe never will. The approximate 6 percent to 7 percent chance budget is the one with the highest odds given by the IPCC. And now we have less than 340 gigatons of CO2 left to emit in that budget to share fairly. "Why is it so important to stay below 1.5 degrees? Because even at one degree people are dying from the climate crisis. Because that is what the United Science calls for to avoid destabilising the climates. DON'T MISSAstronomy news: December events timeline [INSIGHT]Eclipse 2019: Sun to form 'ring of fire' in annular solar eclipse [UPCOMING]What is the meaning of the December Cold Moon? [ANALYSIS] "So that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing Arctic permafrost. Every fraction of a degree matters. So there it is, again. This is my message. This is what I want you to focus on. "So please tell me, how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic? How do you respond to the fact that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bit of anger? And how do you communicate this without sounding alarmist? I would really like to know. "Since the Paris Agreement, global banks have invested 1.9 trillion US dollars in fossil fuels. One hundred companies are responsible for 71 percent of global emissions. "The G20 countries account for almost 80 percent of total emissions. The richest 10 percent of the world's population produce half of our CO2 emissions, while the poorest 50 percent account for just one-tenth. We indeed have some work to do but some more than others. "Recently, a handful of rich countries pledged to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by so-and-so many percent by this or that date or to become climate neutral or net zero in so-and-so many years. This may sound impressive at first glance but even though the intentions may be good, this is not leadership. "This is not leading. This is misleading because most of these pledges do not include aviation, shipping, and imported and exported goods and consumption. They do, however, include the possibility of countries to offset their emissions elsewhere. "These pledges don't include the immediate yearly reduction rates needed for wealthy countries, which is necessary to stay within the remaining tiny budget. Zero in 2050 means nothing, if high emission continues even for a few years, then the remaining budget will be gone. "Without seeing the full picture, we will not solve this crisis. Finding holistic solutions is what the cup should be all about, but instead, it seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition. "Countries are finding clever ways around having to take real action. Like double-counting emissions reductions and moving their emissions overseas and walking back on their promises to increase ambition or refusing to pay for solutions or loss of damage. This has to stop. "What we need is real drastic emission cuts at the source but of course, just reducing emissions is not enough. Our greenhouse gas emissions has to stop. To stay below 1.5 degrees. We need to keep the carbon in the ground. Only setting up distant dates and saying things which give the impression of the action is underway will most likely do more harm than good because the changes required are still nowhere in sight. "The politics needed does not exist today despite what you might hear from world leaders. And I still believe that the biggest danger is not inaction. The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR. "I have been fortunate enough to be able to travel around the world. And my experience is that the lack of awareness is the same everywhere, not the least amongst those elected to lead us. There is no sense of urgency whatsoever. Our leaders are not behaving as if we were in an emergency. "In an emergency, you change your behaviour. If there is a child standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed, you don't look away because it's too uncomfortable. You immediately run out and rescue that child. "And without that sense of urgency, how can we, the people understand that we are facing a real crisis. And if the people are not fully aware of what is going on, then they will not put pressure on the people in power to act. And without pressure from the people, our leaders can get away with basically not doing anything, which is where we are now. And around and around it goes. "In just three weeks. We will enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future. Right now we are desperate for any sign of hope. "Well, I'm telling you, there is hope. I have seen it but it does not come from the governments or corporations. It comes from the people. "The people who have been unaware but are now starting to wake up. And once we become aware, we change. People can change. People are ready for change. And that is the hope because we have democracy and democracy is happening all the time. "Not just on election day but every second and every hour. It is public opinion that runs the free world. In fact, every great change throughout history has come from the people. We do not have to wait. We can start the change right now. "We the people. Thank you."

EU countries have agreed the EU position for the UN climate conference in Santiago de Chile ( COP25 ). The Council today adopted conclusions on EU preparations for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meetings in Santiago de Chile (2-13 December 2019). The UN Climate Action Summit last week helped bring the issue of climate change to political attention and public scrutiny. The Council stresses that it is now even more important both to work hard to make COP25 a success and deliver concrete results. Infographic - Climate change: The EU is delivering on the Paris Agreement Climate change: The EU is delivering on the Paris AgreementSee full infographic The EU's priorities for the upcoming negotiations in Santiago include: completing the implementation guidelines for the voluntary cooperation mechanism of the Paris Agreement (article 6), completing the second review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage, completing the review of the Lima work programme on gender, and advancing technical work on the arrangements under the Enhanced Transparency Framework. The conclusions outline the EU's position on these objectives, and deliver a strong political message on the urgent need for enhanced global action, the EU's firm commitment to the multilateral process and its level of ambition. The Council expresses its deep concern at the increasing impact of climate change on the deterioration of global biodiversity and the world's water resources and ecosystems, and at UN reports confirming that Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by parties and current greenhouse gas emission (GHG) trajectories fall far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. It recognises the strong calls by civil society and citizens, especially youth, for enhanced action and ambition. The Council reiterates the importance of stepping up global climate action. It highlights that the EU continues to successfully decouple its economic growth from its emissions - from 1990 to 2017 the EU's economy grew by 58%, while total GHG emissions decreased by 22%. The EU and its member states are therefore set to overachieve the goal of a 20% GHG reduction domestically by 2020 with existing policies under the EU 2020 climate and energy package. In 2014 the EU committed itself to reducing domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, as its contribution to the Paris Agreement. The EU is the first major economy in the world to take the lead in the green transition and to show the way on implementation of the Paris Agreement by already having in place an ambitious, binding, legislative framework to deliver on its commitment. The EU 2030 renewable energy target has been set at at least 32% and energy efficiency target at at least 32.5%, supported by a reliable governance system. These targets lead to greater greenhouse gas emission reductions than previously foreseen. The EU is currently discussing how to achieve climate neutrality. The Council highlights the importance of the broad, inclusive and extensive societal debate across the EU and its member states. In its conclusions, the Council looks forward to the European Council finalising its guidance on the EU's climate neutral vision before the end of 2019 with a view to the adoption and submission of the EU's long-term strategy to the UNFCCC in early 2020. It calls also on other parties to the Paris Agreement to submit their long-term strategies in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement by 2020.

Madrid, Spain, - The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has welcomed its fellow United Nations agencies to Madrid for the start of the COP25 Climate Change Summit. With tourism now high on the United Nations agenda, and with UNWTO the global leader in tourism for development and advocacy, this summit will see the near-limitless potential of the sector discussed at the very highest level and placed at the center of the climate emergency conversation. Leaders from around the world are set to attend the summit, which will take place from 2-13 December under the Presidency of the Government of Chile. A key objective this year is to advance critical issues relating to the full operationalization of the Paris Agreement. Since the landmark climate change agreement was signed by 197 nations in 2015, tourism has established itself as one of the most important global sectors for realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN Sustainability Agenda. As the United Nations specialized agency for the promotion of tourism as a driver of the sustainable development agenda, UNWTO participates with a high-level delegation, led by UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili in the summit. UNWTO will also be holding a high-level side event on 3 December. This official side event in the Blue Zone brings back the tourism discussion into the heart of the COP, engaging policy makers whom are committed to the low carbon transformation of the tourism sector. The official side event will mark the launch of the new UNWTO-ITF report Transport-Related CO2 Emissions in the Tourism Sector, a groundbreaking study that presents the climate implications of the different modes of transport used by the tourism sector and provides the evidence necessary for the global tourism sector to define a high ambition scenario for the years to come. 'UNWTO is proud to lead the efforts of the global tourism sector to deliver on climate response,' said UNWTO Secretary-General, Zurab Pololikashvili. 'Spain is a global tourism leader and Madrid the ideal setting for this. I thank the Government of Chile for organizing this high-level summit and Spain for hosting it. COP25 represents a great opportunity to stress the important role tourism can play in building a better, more sustainable world for all', he added. The event will feature high-level speakers, led by the UNWTO Secretary-General and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa. Also contributing at the event will be the Spanish Secretary of State for Tourism, Ms. Isabel Oliver, Ms. Brigitte Collet, French Ambassador for Climate, Mr. Carlos Gentile, Secretary of State for Climate Change and Sustainable Development of Argentina and Chair of the Board of Directors of the One Planet network and Mr. Wills Agricole, Principal Secretary for Energy and Climate Change of Seychelles.

Africa's small island states are bearing the brunt of climate change, even though technology exists to prevent the worst impacts of extreme weather. Climate expert John Harding said fewer lives were being lost as a result of natural disasters, because of advanced early warning systems. However, many cash-strapped African countries are not benefiting from new technologies to develop early warning systems. Harding was speaking on Tuesday at the COP25 climate conference in Madrid during a panel discussion on building the resilience of small island developing states (SIDS) against extreme climate events 'There are many reports that say in Africa...the coverage of climate and weather observing stations is eight times lower than recommended by WMO for optimal weather observation systems...Less than 50 percent of them provide the type of information required,' said Harding, who heads the secretariat of the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS). The session was hosted by the African Development Bank, a significant investor in efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Andre Kamga, director general of the ACMAD Center in Niger, said the Bank-funded severe weather observation project, SAWIDRA, had enabled the use of data to generate forecasts and early warning systems in Africa. 'What matters on the ground is the warning, which emergency services must use during disaster events to save lives,' Kamga said. Linus Mofor, senior environmental affairs officer at the UN Economic Commission for Africa, said governments should invest in their climate response as they do in other economic sectors. 'Having said that, in the absence of the investment in early warning systems,, should we just fold our arms?' The session was moderated by Antonio Palazuelos, from SYAH Cabo Verde, whose small island nation has been battered by extreme weather. The African Development Bank's 2019 African Economic Outlook cites climate shocks as one of the headwinds facing Cabo Verde in the Atlantic; likewise the Indian Ocean islands of the Comoros, Madagascar and the Seychelles. 'Small islands have been for a long time not very much in the focus, so we are very glad to be here to say we need support from partners. We need to get more into robust early warning systems,' Palazuelos said. James Kinyangi, head of the African Development Bank's Climate and Development Special Fund, said small island states were a key constituency. 'The bank supports investments to modernize hydro-meteorological systems in Africa and manages partner efforts to address the weak observational capacity and lack of severe weather early warning systems for small island developing states in Africa,' he said. Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, followed up the session with another panel discussion on Wednesday on SIDS leadership on the ocean, climate and sustainable development goals. He said the Bank had made investments to support island states, such as deep sea mining, and had identified the blue economy as a key part of its Feed Africa strategy to strengthen fisheries and other marine resources, creating wealth to 'empower the African continent, not go to other countries'. Nyong said the Bank had released about $ 17 million to invest in data systems to arm states with the information to better prepare for climate related disasters. 'The Island States are our shareholders and our clients. We pay very close attention to them. If they disappear with the rising sea levels, then it means we really need to assist them build resilience,' Nyong said. He said island states offered opportunities for private sector investment, despite their challenges. 'We are creating an enabling environment, working with countries...providing guarantees to improve the business environment and support climate resilient development.'

It's a grey winter day as I walk through the UN climate conference (known as COP25 ) in HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation Madrid . The pavilions and rooms all have the names of cities, regions and rivers in Chile. They're especially familiar to me: as well as being scientific coordinator for COP25 , I'm director of Chile's Centre for Climate and Resilience Research. It's all a stark reminder that we should be in Santiago. But on 18 October 2019, the president of Chile declared a HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation state of emergency and instituted a curfew to quell three days of public unrest that started because of an increase in metro fares. The outbreak of anger was summed up by the message, "This is not about 30 pesos, it is about 30 years", referring to discontent lasting three decades, which appeared on walls across the city and on social media. The protests ultimately led to COP25 's move to Madrid. The good news is that addressing social issues alongside the climate crisis can generate powerful, long-lasting solutions The movement they spawned continues to this day. Its demands are wide-ranging: better pensions, education, health, a minimum wage; but also water rights and action on environmental degradation. What they have in common is their roots in a profoundly unequal society that can be traced back to Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The economic framework he instituted has hardly changed since the return of democracy in the 90s. But why did this violence and rage explode so suddenly? Chile ranks as one of the most unequal countries among the OECD nations according to the Gini index (the most widely used measure of inequality). The https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation latest survey by the Chilean government shows that the richest 10% of the Chilean population has 39 times more income than the poorest 10% - worse than it was in 2015. The same survey shows that more than a million people live in poverty, almost 400,000 in extreme poverty. Not only that, more than half of workers earn less than 400,000 pesos (\£3390) a month. To put that in context, the average monthly rent in Santiago is 300,000 pesos. At first glance, other than disrupting a climate summit, this kind of social unrest doesn't seem to have much to do with the climate crisis. But look again. We know that climate change acts as an amplifier of social inequality, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable. Think for example about heatwaves, of which we saw several this year. The impacts of such extreme events are experienced very differently depending on whether you have access to air conditioning or whether you have a park or green space close by. The ability to recover from the impact of a tropical storm also depends on your access to insurance or finance, and to natural resources such as water. In Chile, just a month before the social crisis exploded, we saw the first internal displacement as a result of the climate crisis. A 10-year-long drought has resulted in many small-scale and subsistence animal farmers losing their livelihoods. In the same areas, competition for water is fierce between local people and agriculture, particularly HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation avocado producers . So as the impacts of the climate crisis become more intense, we can expect more displacement and more unrest. Not just in Chile but around the world. But it's not just the direct effects of climate change that have the potential to cause social instability. The way we respond to those effects - if done without care and consent - can threaten even more social turbulence. In order to achieve the Paris Agreement goal - limiting warming to 1.5C - the global community needs transformations that are unprecedented in scale and scope. Only recently we heard from the UN that, to reach this target, the world needs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases every year HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation by about 7% . Part of the work that needs to be accomplished by this climate meeting and the next one, which will be held in Glasgow in 2020, is that countries must become much more ambitious about their commitments. Can we implement these transformations without addressing all the other social challenges that our countries face? Clearly not. The Chilean crisis illustrates this very vividly, highlighting the great social, economic and environmental obstacles ahead of us. Climate emergency plus growing inequality is a recipe for chaos. We can see what happens when those whose social demands have been ignored are asked to contribute to the climate effort: the HYPERLINK gilets jaunes (yellow vests)movement in France grew up in response to rising fuel prices. \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation Protests in Ecuador The good news is that addressing social issues alongside the climate crisis has the potential to generate powerful, long-lasting solutions. In Chile, one of the measures to achieve carbon neutrality is HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation phasing out coal power plants. The closures come with a host of benefits, from better air quality to - eventually - cheaper energy. Those who work in the industry, however, are naturally concerned about their employment rights. If the government can support the community through the transition, they will emerge into a better, cleaner and safer future. In other words, making sure "no one is left behind" is key. It is crucial that the connection between social and climate upheaval is made clear in Madrid - otherwise we will have lost the opportunity to learn that every crisis should bring. As the delegates walk to their negotiations, I hope the names they pass - of rivers, regions and cities of Chile - serve as a reminder.

December 11, 2019 Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), expressed hope that more nations will follow their initiative, announced this week at the UN COP25 climate change conference in Madrid. Ms. Espinosa described the countries' commitment to equipping a new generation with the knowledge, awareness and skills to tackle climate change as a key contribution to realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. "Climate change should be included in all school curricula and should play a central role in updated Nationally Determined Contributions", she said, referring to countries' efforts to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. "I look forward towards more countries factoring in climate education into their national climate action plans." Compulsory climate education needed The UNFCCC hopes there will be a critical mass of countries by the time COP 26 rolls around next year in the Scottish city of Glasgow. Italy and Mexico are encouraging other nations to prioritize climate education. "Young people are demanding that governments take climate change far more seriously. There are many areas of society where we must act, and act with increased ambition: compulsory education on these topics needs to be a key part of this national and international response to the big issues of our time", said Lorenzo Fioramonti, Italy's Minister of Education, Innovation and Research. Martha Delgado, Vice Minister of Global Affairs in Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said her country has incorporated mandatory environmental education into the constitution as the first step in a new comprehensive plan. "Great transformations can only be achieved through knowledge, awareness and the sense of collaboration", she said. "We are convinced that environmental education is the route to meeting Sustainable Development Goals, an essential tool to fight the climate crisis and can prompt a profound cultural change to contribute to our planet's sustainability." Earth Day milestone a catalyst The two countries propose that other nations can use the celebration of Earth Day in April as the occasion to announce their plans for climate and environmental education. The 2020 commemoration also marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day and the birth of the environmental movement. Kathleen Rogers, President of the Earth Day Network, pointed out that environmental literacy had been at the core of Earth Day since its inception, but that governments had not gone far enough. "Young people, through movements such as Fridays for Future, have been asking governments to tell the truth about the climate and environmental emergencies that we are now facing - 'telling the truth' needs to happen in the schools and universities, and needs to happen now", she said. The Congregation for Catholic Institutes of the Holy See also has chosen Earth Day 2020 as a preparatory meeting for the Global Compact on Education to be launched by Pope Francis next May. The Compact will promote a global commitment that also teaches new generations respect for humankind and nature. \</doc>

The Sustainable Shipping Initiative (SSI) has launched a new report on the role of biofuels in the decarbonisation of the shipping sector at the United National Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ). COP25 participants, alongside two of the association's members: WWF and the China Navigation Company. Biofuels derived from biomass may be an attractive option for the shipping sector; biomass can be used as a feedstock to produce alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol, liquefied biogas (LBG) and biodiesel.- However, in the medium to longer-term, this supply may be limited, particularly given the scaling up of climate ambition and the resulting potential demand pressure across all sectors. Responses to report findings Andrew Stephens, executive director at SSI, said: "In 2018, SSI commissioned research, which revealed that zero-emission vessels need to be entering the world's fleet by 2030, citing advanced biofuels as one of the more economically feasible options, amongst a possible range of low/zero carbon fuels for the shipping industry. "SSI supports a zero-emission shipping sector by 2050 whilst being both fuel- and technology-agnostic. We're also about collaboration across the entire shipping value chain. Through this inquiry we have canvassed a diverse range of perspectives, from a wide range of stakeholders, surrounding the issues of sustainability and availability of biofuels for shipping. We're very pleased to be sharing our findings with (and beyond) the maritime industry to contribute to its decarbonisation efforts." Fernanda de Carvalho, global policy manager for WWF's Climate and Energy Practice, said: "To keep open the window to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, all sectors must transition to zero-carbon technologies by 2050. For long-distance international shipping, this is a tough but feasible challenge. New supply of low and zero-carbon fuels at scale will be key, and the sustainability, risks and life cycle impacts of these fuels must be taken into account. This report provides important insights to inform consideration of the role of biofuels in the short, medium and long-term decarbonisation of the sector." Katharine Palmer, Lloyd's Register's global sustainability manager, said: "If shipping is to successfully decarbonise by 2050 and get zero-emission vessels into the market by 2030, urgent action is needed now. SSI's report 'The Role of Sustainable Biofuels in the Decarbonisation of Shipping' is a proactive step in the right direction and, as a founding member of the Initiative, we are proud to support SSI's leading role in providing insight into the sustainability of biofuels. "Last year, we identified biofuels may have a role to play in the short-term in our Zero-Emission Vessels 2030 study, outlining its key issues - availability and sustainability. SSI's latest report is the next chapter, investigating biofuels' role in shipping's decarbonisation journey, answering key questions about its durability as a long-term fuel and its associated risk landscape. This report will help maritime decision-makers evaluate biofuels to see if it is a suitable pathway for them and rightfully continue the discussion about zero carbon alternatives in maritime." Simon Bennett, general manager - sustainable development at China Navigation Company, said: "The shipping sector must act now, without waiting to be bound by legislation as by then it will be too late to meet necessary targets, but we cannot act alone. We need to coalesce and align on sustainable solutions for radical decarbonisation, taking action to mitigate the Climate Crisis we find ourselves in, in the short-, medium- and longer-term - and the energy transition in between. "Finding solutions needs businesses both within and upstream of the sector, together with policy makers to work together in transition planning, recognising the potential opportunities as well as the risks posed by the various potential substitute fuels and technologies. While biofuels represents one of the solutions today, we need to continue innovating, investing in and scaling up other potential options to carry us through and beyond 2050."

Mr Johnson needs a "big-hitter" to get the COP26 event back on track after he sacked the former energy minister Claire O'Neill as its president. But the former prime minister said no to the high-profile role, which would involve extensive visits to national governments and institutions such as the EU to get them on board. The COP26 president would then assume the role of chairman during the summit itself in November. Related articles Mr Cameron said: "It was an honour to be asked to do that job and I'm very grateful to have been asked. "But I think it's best in these situations if you have a Government minister doing the job; you then have one line of command rather than, perhaps, two people doing the same thing. "There are a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer's Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work." He continued: "But I wish the Government well, I wish this climate change conference well, because it's absolutely vital. "I'm sure that there will be a Government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The Government has my backing as they go forward." Another former Tory leader, Lord Hague, is also understood to have been sounded out by Downing Street but has also turned down the offer. READ MORE:Boris 'doesn't get' climate crisis, says sacked environmental aide Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has nominated his predecessor Ed Miliband for the climate summit job. Mr Corbyn's officials spokesman said: "Ed Miliband is certainly someone who has a strong record and would be an entirely suitable person. "The issue is not exactly who should take on the role, but that it's somebody with credibility. "The performance we have seen in the last day or two over this subject is just a reflection of the fact that Boris Johnson is not serious about the climate crisis." Ms O'Neill's dismissal was justified by Number 10, which said it had been decided the job was a "ministerial role". She hit back at Mr Johnson earlier this week by questioning his green credentials and claiming he had privately admitted he "doesn't really understand" climate change. In a personal attack on the Prime Minister, Ms O'Neill said: "My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises - whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed to family members - is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it and make sure the money is in the bank."

Mr Corbyn quoted Ms O'Neill, saying "there has been a huge lack of leadership and engagement from this Government". Mr Johnson replied: "If you look at what this Government is achieving and already has achieved on climate change, it is quite phenomenal." The UN climate talks are the most important since the Paris Agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science now clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries - at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations. \</doc>

The Green School Project, an initiative by Tata Steel in association with TERI to spread awareness about environment issues in school campuses, made its presence at the United Nations Climate Change Conference for the second year in a row. The 25th meeting of Conference of Parties ( COP25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is ongoing in Madrid, Spain. A session on 'Green Education: joining hands to address Climate Change' was hosted by Tata Steel in association with TERI on 3rd December at the India Pavilion at COP25 , Madrid. The keynote address was delivered by Mr C K Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India. This was followed by a talk by Mr Saurabh Bharadwaj, Fellow Area Convener, Earth Science and Climate Change, TERI. He apprised the audience on India's climate change vulnerability and shared his analysis on climate risk modelling. He emphasized on leveraging the power of youth in India to take impactful action in the sphere of environmental protection. A plenary session on 'Sustainability Insights: Corporate Learnings' was also held where Ms Aparajita Agarwal, Sr. Manager, Regulatory Affairs, Tata Steel, also participated. Ms Agarwal spoke about the sustainable practices adopted by Tata Steel to abate emissions. She highlighted that sustainability is integral to Tata Steel's ethos and value systems. Ms Agarwal also spoke about Tata Steel's SDG initiatives, and the Company's efforts to test new groundbreaking technologies to reduce emissions. The platform showcased 'The Green School' project, a joint initiative of Tata Steel and TERI which promotes environmental stewardship to enhance critical and interdisciplinary thinking through formal and informal modes of teaching. This project is being implemented in 34 schools across operational areas of Tata Steel in Jharkhand and Odisha. ''The role of responsible corporate citizens in spearheading the transition to a sustainable economy is very vital. Addressing climate change is everyone's responsibility and we all need to join hands to make our earth greener and better. Our Green School Project is a unique initiative in that direction,' said Mr. Pankaj Satija, Chief, Regulatory Affairs, Tata Steel. Ms Neha, Fellow TERI, spoke on 'Beyond Textbooks, Creating Awareness about Climate Change' wherein she focused on the importance of using informal methods of teaching to spread the message of a green future. She shared the project learnings, achievements and way forward on creating a template to replicate the project at the national and international level using green curriculum and distinct pedagogy. The attitudinal and behavioral changes brought about by the project were also presented. A handbook developed as a part of the Green School project, enlisting the gaps in the school green curricula was shared with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to consider for implementation at the national level. A short movie on the 'Green School' project was also screened at the end of the event. The project was well received by government officials, academia and event participants - all of whom recognized the immediate necessity of focusing on green education and joining hands to address the climate change challenge.

Development finance institution\~IDB Invest\~is in the process of structuring a debt package to finance\~Engie's first wind project in Chile. The $125 million loan is being provided by IDB's Clean Technology Fund split: $110 million - 12-year tranche $15 million\~ It will finance the 151.2MW Calama wind farm, located near the city of Calama in Antofagasta, which has an estimated total cost of $152.9 million. Engie is developing the asset through its local subsidiary,\~Engie Energ&a Chile. Construction started last fall after Global Energy Services (GES) was awarded the EPC contract. Siemens Gamesa is supplying 36 wind turbines with a capacity of 4.2MW each. The project's output will be fed into the grid through the existing 220kV Calama-Jama Solar transmission line. Construction was briefly halted in September 2019 after Asachi, the indigenous association of Chiu Chiu (a locality of Antofagasta) filed an arbitration claim against the project. According to the group, the project was located in an area critical for agriculture. Engie reached an agreement with Asachi, which withdrew the claim four months later. The Calama project is expected to be brought online by mid-2021. The offtaker for the project has not yet been disclosed, but Engie has signed power purchase agreements with several companies in Chile as it has developed a pipeline of mostly solar projects in the country. In early March, the developer signed a five-year PPA with Chilean fishing company Corpesca to supply its operations in the Arica y Parinacota and Tarapaca regions. Then, Engie inked an 11-year PPA with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta Minerals. Simultaneously, the developer agreed to buy a stake in a coal-fired power plant owned by the copper company. In each case, Engie did not disclose whether the generation would come from specific projects or the developer's whole portfolio. Decarbonization Engie announced the Calama project in October last year as part of its plan to build a 1GW portfolio of wind and solar assets in Chile. The developer signed a letter of intent for the Calaman loan with IDB on 9 December last year, during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. At the time, the institutions said that the debt package would finance Engie's future investments in renewable energy projects, without naming specific assets, as it closed down its coal-fired assets in the country. The switch from coal to renewable energy was reinforced on 4 June 2019, when Engie reached an agreement with the Chilean government to shut down its coal-fired assets, in line with the administration's decarbonization strategy. Engie retired units 12 and 13 of its 439MW coal-fired plant in Tocopilla, Antofagasta, in June, and units 14 and 15 are expected to cease operations by January 2022. The Calama wind farm will replace the output of Tocopilla units 14 and 15. Engie announced on 9 December that it would shutter another two coal-fired plants - the 162MW Mejillones CTM1 and 172MW Mejillones CTM2 facilities, both in Antofagasta - by late 2024. The other renewable energy assets Engie is developing in the country are:\~ 97MW Capricornio solar park in Antofagasta 120MW Tamaya solar project, also in Antofagasta 54MW Los Loros solar park in the province of Copiap 1.3MW Andacollo solar facility in Copiap& Engie Energ&a Chile in April 2019 acquired the Los Loros and Andacollo solar units from another affiliate of Engie, Solairedirect.

Madrid, Spain - Transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to account for 5.3% of all man-made CO2 emissions by 2030, up from 5% in 2016, a landmark new report from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the International Transport Forum (ITF) shows. At the same time, as tourist numbers rise and the sector makes progress in achieving low-carbon travel, emissions per passenger kilometer are expected to decline over the coming decade. Against this backdrop, UNWTO calls for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to effectively transform tourism for climate action. Launched at an official side-event of the One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme during the UN Climate Summit, COP25 in Madrid, the 'Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector' presents the emissions produced by the different modes of tourism transport. As the number of both international and domestic tourists continues to rise, this data is presented alongside the predicted growth in emissions to 2030 and is set against the so called 'current ambition' for the decarbonization of transport. Presenting the report, UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler said: 'This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector. It is now for the tourism sector, especially tourism policy makers to use data effectively and ensure the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate emergency.' Ovais Sarmad, the Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addressed the need to scale efforts towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement: 'While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done. Industry must do more, but governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition. The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world.' Some of the main conclusions of the research include: Against the current ambition scenario, transport-related CO2 emissions from tourism are predicted to increase from 1,597 million tonnes to 1,998 million tonnes between 2016 and 2030, representing a 25% rise. During the same period, international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion to 37 billion, mainly driven by domestic tourism (from 18.8 billion to 35.6 billion), followed by international arrivals (1.2 billion to 1.8 billion). Transport-related emissions from tourism represented 5% of all man-made emissions in 2016 and will increase to 5.3% by 2030. Tourism related transport emissions represented 22% of all transport emissions in 2016 and will continue doing so in 2030 (21%). Moving to a 'high ambition scenario' In addition, the tourism sector must determine its own high ambition scenario, complementing the efforts of the transport sector. Here, tourism would advance towards significantly decoupling growth from emissions in order to grow within the international climate targets.

Sea levels are at the highest in human history", he said, listing the benchmarks which indicate that "the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and is hurtling towards us". But scientists have provided a roadmap away from that point, which will allow us to limit global temperature rise to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels, by 2030. 1.5 degrees 'still within reach' Efforts so far have been "utterly inadequate" and the Paris Agreement commitments still mean a rise of 3.2 degrees unless more drastic action is taken, said the UN chief, but 1.5 degrees "is still within reach." "The technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available", he added, "the signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilization." The key missing ingredient is a lack of political will he said: "Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels", or to shift taxation from income to carbon, "taxing pollution instead of people."

"In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050." Mr. Guterres said at least $ 100 billion dollars must be made available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their "legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery." The "social dimension" of climate change must also be paramount, so that national commitments include "a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected as we move from the grey to the green economy." In conclusion he noted: "We are in a deep hole and we are are still digging. Soon it will be too deep to escape." Mark Carney to be new Special Envoy for Climate Action The Secretary-General announced on Sunday that the current head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is to become the UN's new Special Envoy for Climate Action.

During the UN summit in Madrid, COP25 , there was a panel debate on Sustainable Underground Mining, SUM. The aim of the seminar was to provide real examples and inspire others to cooperation projects like the one between LKAB, ABB, Epiroc, Combitech and the Volvo Group - a project to create the mine of the future together, which is carbon-free, digitalised and autonomous. 'More and more people are recognising that cooperation will be necessary to achieve the climate and sustainability goals,' says Jan Mostrom, President and CEO of LKAB. The demand for iron ore will increase in the next few decades. There is not enough reusable scrap metal, and more ore will therefore need to be mined, for example in LKAB's mines in Malmfalten. But a change is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of the iron and steel industry, and efforts to make that change are currently underway in SUM. Five Swedish industrial companies have entered a partnership, which allows them to utilise the necessary expertise needed to achieve the goal of a carbon-free mine with smart, autonomous vehicles and innovative management systems, which together generate a safer working environment and increased productivity. Increased interest in industrial partnerships Despite tough competition from other items on the agenda of the Madrid summit, the seminar on sustainable mining drew a full house. The global interest in industrial partnerships like the one in SUM is increasing. 'Industry partnerships are key to deliver systems solutions that create prosperity for society and industry', says Niklas Wahlberg, Vice-President, Societal Changes and Solutions, Volvo Group. 'We are proud to be part of the SUM project that will boost productivity for the mining company LKAB, improve work conditions, including safety, and benefit the environment with the objective to drive the transformation to a sustainable mining operation globally' says Anders Hedqvist, VP RD at Epiroc. 'This is a unique project. Together, we will make mining carbon-free. The trick is to find interactive solutions where people are the focus,' says Lars Ydreskog, CEO of Combitech and digitalisation advisor. 'We are working together to find new methods and smarter solutions for the sustainable mining of the future. With our knowledge of automation and electrification of underground mines, we are contributing to immediate measures to fight climate change,' says Bjorn Jonsson, Business Area Manager at ABB Industrial Automation, Sweden. Cooperation is a must After 2030, LKAB will be prepared to break iron ore deeper in the mines of Kiruna and Malmberget, in order to secure long-term competitiveness. This requires decisions to be made already in the mid-2020s to effectuate one of Sweden's greatest industrial investments in history. 'Our goal is to create a completely fossil-free value chain, from mine to finished steel. We are taking on these challenges together, by having each of the SUM companies contribute their expertise. We cannot do it alone; cooperation is a must,' says Jan Mostrom.

International talks that aimed to progress action to tackle climate change have left vulnerable nations, environmental groups and young people across the world deeply disappointed. COP25 , which was held in Madrid after a last-minute move from Chile, was intended to iron out the final details of the 2015 Paris Agreement and encourage countries to submit more ambitious national carbon-cutting plans next year. But a fraught negotiation process, which highlighted the disparities between poor and wealthy nations and between those willing and reticent to act, elicited growing anger as it went deep into extra time over the weekend. Diplomats managed to agree on some issues in the final sleep-deprived 48 hours, including an updated gender action plan that recognises the impact of climate change on human rights, historic and current gender inequalities and the importance of intersectionality. And, despite numerous attempts to weaken it, the final agreement re-emphasised the "significant gap" between national promises to cut carbon and the amount that is actually needed to stave off dangerous warming, stressing "the urgency of enhanced ambition in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation and adaptation efforts by all parties". But several key issues were deferred to next year's summit in Glasgow. A decision on international carbon market rules proved intractable as countries argued over the issue of double counting and whether to allow overperformance in previous emission trading schemes to count towards future targets. While business organisations were disappointed not to have a clearer idea of how carbon markets would work, some observers welcomed the postponement on the basis that no rules were better than bad ones. S\'e9bastien Duyck, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law, said the final proposals had threatened to undermine human rights and would have been too weak to be truly effective in cutting emissions. Countries agreed to do more work on the thorny issue of loss and damage but did not approve any new source of finance to compensate vulnerable countries for climate change. Instead, part of the existing Green Climate Fund was siphoned off to deal with loss and damage, while organisations and nations were "urged" to do more. The US, which is due to leave the Paris Agreement next year, was singled out for obstructing progress on this issue. Ian Fry, negotiator for the vulnerable island nation of Tuvalu, denounced the US's attitude during the summit's final meeting and said that "refusing to support those most impacted could constitute a crime against humanity". According to Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, which organised a string of NGO-led events during the two-week summit, the final outcome showed a "profound disconnect between people and politicians on the climate emergency". As the talks wore on, thousands of protesters marched in the streets of Madrid and scientists warned that much more had to be done to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Some directed their criticism squarely at the summit's Chilean presidency. Greenpeace Chile's national director Matias Asun said: "Chile lost a perfect opportunity to show climate leadership. The real progress was made by people moving forward for real changes while pushing those who passively watching our environment been destroyed." But Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris Agreement, said that while the results were "a far cry from what science tells us is needed", it still achieved the "best possible outcome" thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries. The UK will host the next international summit in Glasgow in November 2020 and expectations will be high. Mary Church, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the UN "must put pressure" on the new UK government to ensure the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are not excluded. "The COP in Glasgow will serve as a rallying cry for all who care about our planet and the fate of peoples all over the world," said Church. "The eyes of the world will be on us." \</doc>

Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, contrasted the "leadership" and "mobilisation" shown by the world's youth on the climate emergency with the lack of action by governments, which were failing to keep up with the urgency of the problem despite increasing signs that the climate was reaching breakdown. Before the start of a critical conference on the climate crisis on Monday, he said the world had the technical and economic means to halt climate chaos, but what was missing was political will. "The technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available. Signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation. [But we need] political will to put a price on carbon, political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels [and start] taxing pollution instead of people." Guterres called for further investment from rich countries and support for poor nations to make the changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of global heating. Amid rising temperatures, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts and floods, the danger signals were clear and must be acted on without further delay, he said. "In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050." He was joined in his call by the leaders and representatives of some of the world's poorest countries, which are suffering most from climate change. The countries most at risk of deluge from climate chaos have issued an impassioned plea to the industrialised world ahead of crucial negotiations on the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations Paris agreement that start on Monday in Madrid. "We see [these talks] as the last opportunity to take decisive action," Janine Felson, deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) told the Guardian. "Anything short of vastly greater commitment to emission reduction, a new climate finance goal and tangible support for disaster risk reduction will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe." Pacific atolls and other low-lying islands are likely to be inundated if temperatures rise to more than https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations 1.5C above pre \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations industrial levels , while current Paris commitments put the world on track for a "disastrous" 3C. "We are mired in a HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations planetary emergency of existential proportion ," said the leaders of the 44 states of AOSIS, in a joint statement. "The impacts are real and current for people living on small islands. This does not have to be our destiny or legacy." While small islands are at greatest risk, rich countries were also suffering, said Clarence Samuel, lead negotiator for the Marshall Islands. "None of us are immune," he said. "All month we have watched in horror as our Pacific cousins Australia have literally https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations watched their country burn To fulfil the Paris goals, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations far tougher targets on emissions are needed , while this year's negotiations - known as COP25 , running from 2 December to 13 December - will focus on technical issues such as a mechanism for trading carbon within the Paris agreement. Resolving these technicalities will allow the UN to wrap up the Paris "rulebook", setting out how to measure and achieve emissions cuts, but experts are concerned that it leaves too little time for the substantive question of targets, which under the rules must be resolved by the end of 2020. Lord Stern of Brentford, one of the world's leading climate economists, said: "It's very important that this COP is not just tidying up, but starting [the process] of the next one. It's positive that finance ministers and central bank governors will come this year, and countries like the EU and China need to show leadership." Under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to set out more ambitious climate action in 2020, when current targets expire. Governments were given the five-year grace period to ratchet up their national goals. Talks on the crucial matter of 2030 commitments will largely be relegated to informal meetings on the sidelines of COP25 , though these are what will determine the success of the Paris agreement - and the future of the climate. There are also continuing tensions at the talks over HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations funding to help developing economies curb emissions and cope with the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations consequences of climate disaster Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: "The world's small window of opportunity is closing rapidly. We must urgently deploy all the tools of multilateral cooperation to make COP25 the launchpad for more climate ambition to put the world on a transformational path towards low carbon and resilience." The talks, taking place in Madrid after the original host nation, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations Chile, pulled out owing to its political crisis , will also be overshadowed by US president Donald Trump's decision to \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations withdraw from the Paris agreement The US last month formally submitted the one year's notice legally required for withdrawal under the accord.

Dozens of countries, including the UK, have this year adopted targets for net zero emissions by 2050, but almost none have yet enacted specific policies to reach that goal. Some high-profile visitors are also expected to attend, notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate campaigner. Two big reports coincide with the COP25 gathering. The World health Organization publishes its findings tracking global progress on health and climate change, with data from more than 100 countries. This will be followed on Wednesday by an EU environment agency release, which will show how the bloc is faring on targets for biodiversity protection, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Background reading Splits widen over global climate goals as UN summit gathers Cyber Monday Nato The UK hosts leaders from 29 Nato member countries, but the gathering could be overshadowed by disagreements over Nato\' s core mission and its future strategy. French president Emmanuel Macron declared last month that Nato was  brain-dead . Turkey\' s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, not to be outdone, called Mr Macron  brain-dead as he hit back against the French leader\' s criticism of Turkey\' s treatment of its Nato allies. However, Turkey\' s president is expected to hold meetings with other leaders about the country\' s military operation in north-east Syria and plans to settle Syrian refugees. Background reading  HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/wolfgang-munchau Wolfgang M\'fcnchau: A grand bargain for Europe might yet be possible  Nato needs to reassert its common purpose Opec meeting Oil producers from the Opec cartel will meet in Vienna on Thursday and will be joined by ministers from Russia and other exporters on Friday.\~Their task: to hammer out an agreement on how they will manage their oil production next year. The current deal to reduce Opec and its ally producers\' output by 1.2m barrels of oil per day is set to expire at the end of March and many analysts expect the arrangement to be extended into the middle of 2020. Opec may be worried by recent US Energy Information Administration data showing that US oil production might not be slowing down as quickly as expected, reaching a record high of 12.9m barrels per day last week. Saudi Arabia, the group\' s kingpin, will also be keen to avoid any fall in oil prices since that would hit the valuation in the initial public offering of its giant state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco.  Five things to watch from this week\' s Opec meeting Business Book of the Year The winner of 15th annual Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award is announced at a ceremony in New York on Tuesday. Heavyweight books on data privacy, bias against women and the rise of the politically powerful conglomerate Koch Industries are among the six titles on the shortlist for the \£330,000 prize. Investors will be hoping to garner some insight into thinking at the ECB when Christine Lagarde appears before the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday. The new ECB president has so far brought a greater focus on green issues since replacing Mario Draghi at the start of November, but not much else is known. Nominees to the central bank\' s executive board Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel also appear on Tuesday. Both have said ahead of the hearing that they support the central bank\' s controversial decision to cut interest rates and resume bond purchases, with the caveat that the situation must be carefully watched. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, when it is expected to keep rates on hold to assess the impact of the 0.75 percentage points already delivered. But most economists have pencilled in a further cut in the first quarter of 2020. Market Questions has more on this. Policymakers at the Bank of Canada meet on Wednesday, when they are expected to leave rates unchanged. Chile\' s central bank is expected to cut rates on Wednesday after a meeting that is being brought forward by two days because of some of the worst social unrest in a decade. Last week the Chilean central bank intervened to prop up its currency against the dollar. India\' s central bank is poised to cut its benchmark repurchase rate on Thursday amid a slowdown in economic growth. Companies news and earnings Saudi Aramco Saudi Aramco is set to price its HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/saudi-aramco-ipo IPO on Thursday. Banks on the deal last Friday said that about 4.9m retail investors in the kingdom had bid for shares before this Thursday\' s deadline, with a total valuation of 47.4bn Saudi riyals ($12.6bn). Institutional investor subscriptions were at SR118.9bn, with the subscription period for the class due to end this Wednesday, Samba Capital, NCB Capital and HSBC Saudi Arabia said. Glencore Glencore\' s African copper business will be in the spotlight when the miner and commodity trader holds is annual investor briefing on Tuesday. Analysts and investors will be seeking an update on Katanga, where Glencore is targeting a large increase in copper and cobalt production by 2021, and also Zambia, where it is sinking three new shafts at its Mopani mine. Earnings It\' s a quiet week for earnings, but Tiffany reports third-quarter results on Thursday, a little more than a week after agreeing to be bought by French luxury group LVMH for $16.6bn. The US jeweller is expected to post a rise in third-quarter same-store sales, helped by new marketing and product lines.  LVMH: on a luxury shopping spree Dollar General reports on Tuesday, when investors are likely to focus on comments about the impact of US tariffs on imports from China. Food group Campbell Soup reports on Wednesday and grocery retailer Kroger on Thursday. In the UK Berkeley On the same day Associated British Foods will provide an update ahead of its annual general meeting. The Primark-owner published its annual results in early November, when it said it expected earnings to grow in the coming year. Daily Mail and General Trust \' s final results are expected to be upbeat this Thursday. The publisher was in the news itself at the end of last week when it bought the daily i newspaper for \£350m from JPI Media. Over the weekend newspaper veteran David Montgomery emerged as the unexpected frontrunner in the race to buy other JPI titles, including The Scotsman and The Yorkshire Post. Economic data US jobs numbers for November, due on Friday, should receive a boost from 45,000 GM workers returning to work after ending the longest auto industry strike in 50 years. Economists in a Bloomberg survey are expecting the report to show 188,000 jobs were added in the month, which would be the highest reading since August. This week\' s line-up of economic reports includes the first reading on consumer sentiment, as well as the Institute for Supply Management\' s manufacturing index on Monday and its index measuring the vast services sector on Wednesday. Investors will be hoping for signs of improvement thanks to the prospect of a trade deal between the US and China. Germany\' s industrial woes have been going on for five quarters now. October\' s numbers for industrial orders are out on Thursday, when Eurozone gross domestic product is also released. Germany\' s industrial production figures are due the next day. Turkey releases its GDP on Monday and inflation data the following day, which are likely to weigh on the central bank\' s next policy decision amid calls by Mr Erdogan for rates to be cut. Brazil\' s GDP reading is expected to show an increase of 0.5 per cent from the second quarter. \</doc>

A pair of UEA graduates who have started their own eco-business, have shared their top tips for having a sustainable Christmas in a creative video. Ismat and Jana, began Kipple with the help of UEA's Student Enterprise. They provide returnable, sustainably-sourced home and kitchen starter kits for students. Students can return their kits, receive their deposit, and Kipple repurposes the items into new kits. Ismat Imaan is from India and studied a masters in environmental assessment and management, while Jana Belovicova who is from Slovakia studied international social development, and they both graduated earlier this year. The duo are passionate about sustainability and are aware of how the excesses of the festivities can take a toll on the planet. With UEA scientists contributing to this month's United Nations ' Climate Change Conference COP25 , the focus is not only on people in power, but how each of us can make small changes towards a better future. 1. Show local (and seasonal) some love Attend a local Christmas market with friends and family to marvel at the talent of local people making everything from homemade gin to mince pie fudge and crochet robin decorations. Not only is this a great day out, but the things you buy haven't travelled far and some people upcycle pre-owned products. Don't forget your local charity shops too, re-home gifts while contributing to a good cause- don't forget, one person's trash is another person's treasure! For your food shop, try to use local and seasonal fruit and vegetables (they're often more affordable and have fewer air miles) and buy from farmers markets where possible. 2. Read all about it One by-product of Christmas is mountains of scrunched-up wrapping paper, which is tossed aside in the excitement of the big day. Although it's nice to beautifully-wrap gifts, lots of papers contain plastic or foil overlays and glitter, making them difficult to recycle. Get creative using newspaper or last years' bags and ribbons. 3. Just roll with it A festive table isn't complete without a couple of Christmas crackers to provide some equally terrible jokes. But the naff gifts are usually made of plastic (think a mini comb, yoyo, spinning top and pencil sharpener) and let's be honest they mostly end up in the bin. Why not make your own? Craft shops sell everything you need, or you could attempt a homemade version with toilet roll tubes? Include items that people will actually use like a packet of seeds, face mask, or a small item of jewellery. 4. The cauli and the ivy We all know veganism is better for the environment, so why not show your commitment by tying to go plant-based for Christmas dinner? Give peas a chance? There's an enormous array of products including vegan nut roast, sweat potato parcels or opt for a trendy roasted cauliflower centrepiece. 5. Choo choo choose the train One of the best things about the festive period is getting to spend time with love ones. Playing the board games, which only come out once a year, watching Christmas films and long walks. If you have to travel to see your relatives, take advantage of public transport where possible by taking the train, Megabus or a National Express coach. 6. Be at one with nature Swap tinsel and baubles for natural decorations as much as possible, like pine cones, branches and berries. Collecting them from local areas (make sure you have the land owners permission) is also a nice thing to do with family. 7. Lights out, all out Temperatures have already started to drop and it's easy to switch on the heating as soon as it feel a bit chilly. Before doing so, wrap up and put on a jumper on- make it a Christmas one if you have one. Also, don't forget to disconnect your sparkling lights at night and when you're out to save energy. Over to you Share with us the little (or big!) eco-friendly things you do over the festive period on Twitter (@uniofeastanglia), Facebook (@ueaofficial) or Instagram (uniofeastanglia). If you're a student or recent graduate and you'd like help with a sustainable business idea, including funding and mentoring, visit the website.

First, I would like to thank you personally, Pedro, for taking this initiative to host the COP25 . You and Spain have done a great job at very short notice. In 3 minutes, I would like to focus on 3 essential climate questions: Why do we have to do more ? How can we do more? and What do we need to do? Let's start with the why. Why do we have to do more? We are in a climate emergency. Right now. Today's headlines are dramatic. Just two examples: Sea levels are rising at their fastest rate in 3 000 years. Biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history: one million species are threatened with extinction. In the face of these alarming trends, how can we do more? For centuries, we have been unconsciously £t war' with nature. We have over-exploited our natural resources with no regard for the consequences. We have brought our planet to its knees. Now we need to dramatically change how we do things and revolutionise our approach. We have had the industrial revolution, the technological revolution, now it is time for the 'Green Revolution'. Across the globe, young people have shaken things up. And they are right. Today we have a unique opportunity. Let's be the caretakers of our planet while at the same time thriving economically creating jobs, innovation and a high quality of life. We refuse to oppose a healthy climate and a healthy development. We can do both. In fact, one is good for the other. Europe has shown it is possible to have a growing economy, while decreasing emissions. 'Going green' doesn't have to mean 'going broke'. As President of the European Council, I have a clear goal: to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent on the planet by 2050. So, we will be the champion of the green transition. Many European leaders have called on the Commission to propose a New European Green Deal with concrete measures and this will be a 'cease fire' with nature, and even more, a 'peace treaty' with nature. We need also an ambitious Just Transition Fund and a significant part of the next European budget to be climate-related. I will prioritise these topics on the agenda of the European Council, because Europe has to invest massively in new technologies, research, and innovation. One trillion euros, that is the ambitious amount proposed by the European Investment Bank to support with the private sector strategic, sustainable investments. By 2025, half of the EIB's financing will be dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability. And by the end of next year, the EIB commits to align all its financing activities with the principles and goals of the Paris agreement. But we must support our partners around the world. In 2018 alone, the EU and its member states contributed 74.4 billion euros to development assistance with 21 billion for climate objectives. So my last question is: 'What do we need to do?' We are one planet, we need one approach. It will involve providing sustainable, affordable energy increasing energy efficiency and building a circular economy. This starts by implementing the Paris agreement. Across human history, obstacles have often generated enormous opportunities to create, to innovate and to build a better life. I believe climate change offers this same opportunity: to use science and technology to protect and develop our societies. We need to change how we see this green transition, not as a burden but as an opening and kickstart our economies with green technologies. But we must never forget the people behind our policies. We must be just and socially balanced. This means taking into consideration that not all countries have the same starting point. Protecting our planet is the right choice, the only choice. And the only way to protect our families, our communities, our humanity. Thank you.

The climate emergency is a "challenge of civilisation" requiring sweeping changes to economic systems, but political leaders have not done enough, the pope has said in a message to governments meeting at the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world annual climate summit "We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources [to the climate crisis]," he said, in https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world the pontifical message "Numerous studies tell us it is still possible to limit global warming. To do this we need a clear, far-sighted and strong political will, set on pursuing a new course that aims at refocusing financial and economic investments toward those areas that truly safeguard the conditions of a life worthy of humanity on a healthy planet for today and tomorrow." He put particular emphasis on the role of young people, who "show a heightened sensitivity to the complex problems that arise from this emergency. We must not place the burden on the next generations to take on the problems caused by the previous ones." As a small state, the Vatican has observer status at the talks, so the pope is able to send a representative but has no voting rights on key decisions. As an Argentinian, Pope Francis's words carried particular resonance as this is still regarded as a Latin American COP, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world despite the last-minute change of venue from Chile to Madrid following political unrest in Santiago. The Chilean government is still the official host, and its environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, is the official Chilean president, in charge of the conference, appearing frequently flanked by Lorena Aguilar of the co-hosts Costa Rica, and the UN's top climate official, Patricia Espinosa, of Mexico. Kat Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, welcomed the message from the Holy See: "The pope's intervention in 2015, Laudato si' , helped to secure the Paris agreement, and pushed the cause of global cooperation. It's a sad reflection on the lack of progress since then that he feels the need to once again make the moral case for action.

"His message to COP25 highlights the need to reform our model of development alongside refocusing our economic systems, emphasising the 'challenge of civilisation' is for us to act for the common good and with the most vulnerable people at the heart of decisions." Various faith groups prayed for action on the climate on Tuesday at the COP, and on Friday morning will bring a giant clock to the venue to "sound the alarm" on the climate crisis. Thursday was designated as youth day, with a series of events held to highlight generational differences. Climate strike activists were planning a march through the centre of Madrid on Friday evening, coordinated with marches in other cities around the world. Progress has been slow on the official agenda at the two weeks of UN talks, which began on Monday. Efforts are focusing on a provision of the Paris agreement that would allow for an international trade in carbon, which is controversial among some activists but supported by others. Behind the scenes, countries are wrangling over how to update their plans to cut or curb greenhouse gas emissions, set out under the 2015 Paris agreement. A growing number of countries, including the UK, which will host next year's meeting, are signing up to a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but governments are under pressure to set stronger targets for 2030. \</doc>

As delegates to the COP25 climate summit scramble to adjust to a last-minute change of venue from Santiago to Madrid, one of the highest-profile attendees has stuck out a metaphorical thumb on social media to ask for a lift across the Atlantic. Teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/01/great-thunberg-los-angeles-rally-paradise-wildfires speaking in California Thunberg, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved, had been travelling by boat, train and electric car when the new venue was announced.

The UN announced on Friday that HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/01/great-thunberg-los-angeles-rally-paradise-wildfires Spain would host next month's HYPERLINK COP25 , after Chile abandoned plans to hold it due to deadly anti-government protests. Some 25,000 delegates were expected to travel to Santiago for the event. Harjeet Singh, of environmental group ActionAid International, said moving the summit from Chile to Spain with only four weeks' notice "presents real barriers to participation" for HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/01/great-thunberg-los-angeles-rally-paradise-wildfires delegates from the southern hemisphere . "Hotels in Madrid are already full. Last-minute flights are expensive. Visas can be difficult to obtain at short notice. This sudden decision is likely to shift the balance of power towards the wealthier countries of the global north," he added in a statement. It is the second time that UN authorities have had to scramble to find a new meeting place. Brazil originally welcomed the gathering then backed out after rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. Teresa Ribera, Spain's ecological transition minister, said on Twitter on Saturday: "Dear Greta, it would be great to have you here in Madrid. You've made a long journey and help all of us to raise concern, open minds and enhance action. We would love to help you to cross the Atlantic back." \</doc>

Brazil cannot stop deforestation in the Amazon without the help of rich countries, the country's environment minister told the United Nations ' climate change conference . Ricardo Salles, who declined to set a target for limiting deforestation in the coming year, said his country was committed to reducing illegal activity but needed the support of developed nations. "We are willing to do whatever is necessary to do so, but we need that back-up," Mr Salles said. "That back-up was promised many years ago and we're still expecting the rich countries to participate in a proper way. Proportional funds are what are going to be needed." Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro (inset), has squabbled with European leaders over his commitment to protecting the Amazon. He has worried environmental activists by criticising Brazil's environment regulator and by calling for more development in the Amazon. He also accused activist groups, without evidence, of having set fires in that region to undermine his administration. Deforestation in the 12 months through July reached the highest annual rate in 11 years. Brazil's annual deforestation report released last month showed a nearly 30 per cent jump from the prior year in the Amazon, which lost 3,769 square miles of forest. AP \</doc>

Abengoa (MCE: ABG/P: SM), the international company that applies innovative technology solutions for sustainability in the infrastructures, energy and water sectors, participated today in the panel 'Solar thermal electricity: an essential building block for the energy transition', organized by the European Solar Thermal Electricity Association (Estela) and that took place today in the European Union pavilion during the celebration of its Day of Energy at COP25 in Madrid. The director of Solar Technology of Abengoa, Miguel Mendez Trigo, participated as one of the keynote speakers in this panel dedicated to Solar thermal electricity: an essential building block for the energy transition' and in which the hybridization of renewable technologies was presented as a key element for decarbonization, as well as the role of solar thermal energy in order to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement through the smart decarbonization of the power system. Mendez Trigo highlighted that hybridization solutions can play a fundamental role in the energy transition and, in particular, to solve the challenges related to energy storage thanks to the combination of different renewable technologies, which makes possible a high capacity of design and allows to offer an optimal solution to any kind of need. 'The key is in the hybridization of renewable technologies, see how they fit in the market to reduce emissions and give flexibility to the network,' he said. One of the most important reference of hybridization is the Cerro Dominador solar platform (Chile), property of EIG Global Energy Partners, where Abengoa is currently constructing a 110 MW solar thermal plant and has already completed a solar photovoltaic plant of 100 MW. This platform has thermal energy storage system and batteries that will allow to produce 210 MW with 17 hours of storage the world's first truly dispatchable utility-scale renewable energy complex. Here, the dispatchability of solar thermal energy (Concentrated Solar Power) with thermal energy storage, solar photovoltaic power and the fast response of battery energy storage systems converge into a single installation to provide an affordable, 24/7 clean energy solution. The panel discussion, which was moderated by the secretary general of Estela, Marcel Bial, counted also with the participation of the president of Estela, Jose Luis Martinez, the president of Protermosolar, Luis Crespo, the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of Rioglasss, Jeroen van Schijndel, and a representative from the Spanish Ministry for Energy Transition, Miriam Bueno. Abengoa has been the first company to hybridize solar with gas on a utility-scale project which is the world's largest reference plant completed (470 MW) in Morocco (Ain Beni Mathar). The company was also responsible of developing the first hybrid solar-gas plant in Algeria, Hassi R'Mel, with a 150 MW capacity. With its own solar thermal technology, Abengoa is a world leader in the construction of these type of plants, with 1.7 GW of installed capacity representing 34 % of the worldwide production.

Reading West MP Alok Sharma has been handed a big promotion in a Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Sharma has been named as the new Business Secretary. And he faces a tough start, after he was put in charge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference also known as the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow later in the year. Mr Sharma had been International Development Secretary but now makes a big step up. He replaces both Andrea Leadsom as Business Secretary, and Claire O'Neill, who had been in charge of the summit, in a newly merged role. She famously accused the Prime Minister of "not getting" climate change. The reshuffle so far has seen a number of Tory big names getting removed from their posts. Chancellor Sajid Javid has resigned, and the likes of Mrs Leadsom and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox have been removed. Esther McVey has also been removed from her role as Housing Minister. Mr Sharma replaced Labour's Martin Salter in Reading, Berkshire in 2010. He has held a variety of roles including Housing Minister and Minister of State for employment. He was re-elected in December 2019 with an increased majority of 4,117. Recently, he has been pressing for tougher laws on illegal Traveller camps. \</doc>

The completed mural was unveiled Tuesday in San Francisco depicting Greta Thunberg The 60-foot tall by 30-foot wide mural was done by Argentine street artist Andres Petreselli   Thunberg, 16, tweeted she is leaving on a boat Wednesday for Madrid to attend a United Nations climate change conference   Murals of Thunberg are also in Canada and the United Kingdom Critics of Thunberg's message twice defaced her mural in Canada Thunberg shot to fame after she was seen glaring at President Trump at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit, after he chose to skip the summit A mural of Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg has been completed in San Francisco. The larger-than-life depiction was unveiled Tuesday night showing Thunberg from the chest up and spreading across at least four stories of a building. The 60-foot by 30-foot art work went on display hours after Thunberg announced on Twitter that she would be leaving the United States by boat on Wednesday, headed for a United Nations climate change conference He says the portrait of Thunberg, 16, was unusual because he typically does not address politics, religion or sports. 'But, this one is ... I feel connected with the politics behind (it) because I think it is real and if I have to compare it with the rest of my murals, this is the most political one that I ever made,' the 32-year-old said as he sat on a roof with the mural behind him. The project was funded by the non-profit group OneAtmosphere.org, and executive director Paul Scott told CNN that they wanted to focus on art that applauds the climate activists and Thunberg was the first choice. He said feedback has been positive, but pointed out that those critical of the painting didn't recognize the 16-year-old. 'They're struck by the image and want to learn more,' he said.'If they take the time to learn more about what she's trying to share, that I think has an impact on most people. Makes them want to help.' Petreselli also did the portrait of Robin Williams for the city. Thunberg shot to fame after she was seen glaring at President Trump at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit, after he chose to skip the summit. Petreselli thinks Thunberg has already accomplished making the world more aware about the environmental crisis. 'We're pretty much at the beginning of our extinction, so if we don't do anything right now, it's going to be too late,' he told CNN. Her message has inspired other mural across the globe, including one in Bristol, England, showing Thunberg partly underwater. There's another in Canada and in Turkey. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par However, she has 'drawn' her detractors. The mural in Canada painted a 'free wall' along a bike path was defaced twice shortly after it was created, CNN said. It hasn't deterred Thunberg, who has led climate strikes starting in 2018 at the Swedish Parliament. That caused thousands of students worldwide to skip school and demand action is taken for climate change. She has met with everyone from actor Leonardo DiCaprio to former President Barack Obama, and spoken to the U.S. Congress and the United Nations. In her tweet Tuesday, Thunberg said she plans to set sail from Virginia on a 48-foot catamaran, whose Australian owners Riley Whitlum and Elayna Carausu have offered her a ride across the Atlantic. They'll be joined by Nikki Henderson from the United Kingdom, who's a professional yachtswoman. \</doc>

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended on Sunday morning without a decisive plan to tackle the climate crisis. Instead, member states have agreed to ask other countries for more ambitious greenhouse cuts to ensure climate agreements are met. Related articles UN Chief Antonio Guterres expressed his "disappointment" at the lack of progress on Twitter, saying now is not the time to "give up". The UN chief's sentiment was mirrored by environmental groups who accused the world's leading superpowers of shirking responsibility for the climate crisis. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 194 states have agreed to limit global warming to 1.5C degrees of preindustrial levels. Most recent estimates, however, suggest the planet is headed for a catastrophic 3C to 4C degrees of warming by the end of the century. Scientists have warned unchecked global warming could deprive 1.9 billion people of access to drinking water by 2100.

In a joint project by the HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/spain Prado Museum in Madrid and WWF to coincide with the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, four of the museum's best-known paintings have been altered to reflect the world if temperatures increase by more than 1.5C.

Philip IV, originally depicted enjoying the tranquillity of his power, rides up to his chest in water. The naked innocence of Sorolla's boys is tainted by poisoned fish and the sunny luxuriance of Goya's rustic scene is transformed to one of desperation with climate refugees. Patinir's pessimistic vision of death is drained of all hope, with the Styx running dry in a drought.

Interview:\~Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, CEO, Qatargas How is Qatargas planning to mitigate the effects of what are expected to be major shifts between excess supply and demand in the next five years? KHALID BIN KHALIFA AL THANI: Our strategy is to continue working on cost-effective, reliable production and to be competitive in a wide range of market conditions, building on our substantial asset and resource base. Moving towards 2030 global demand for LNG is expected to reach 561m tonnes per annum (tpa), representing an increase of almost 200m tpa from current production levels. With such an outlook, we are confident that there will be a global sustained LNG demand to offset the volume we produce, as we expand our production by 64% to 126m tpa by 2027. The main drivers of this demand increase are China, India and emerging markets such as Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Long-term economic growth in these countries will require more use of gas in their power, industry, transportation and residential sectors. Additionally, considering that domestic gas production in most of these countries is in decline, and with the existing gas infrastructure and capacity available, LNG will be the best fuel to replace the demand gap. The cost of production is fundamental to ensuring the competitiveness of our product in the market. We have yet to maximise the benefits of considerable brownfield synergies with our production facilities and shipping fleet, and the scale of our expansion project will allow us to realise many project efficiencies. Following the merger of Qatargas and RasGas in January 2018, the new Qatargas has reached higher levels of operational efficiency and cost effectiveness through a combined pool of talented resources and capabilities. As of January 1, 2020 we have completed the integration of our operational assets in Ras Laffan into a single, synergised organisation with one support service infrastructure. This new organisation is designed to manage and operate our existing assets as efficiently and responsively as possible, and is ideally adapted to seamlessly integrate the operation of future expansion projects. What role will natural gas play in the future of emerging economies around the world? AL THANI: The global population today has become more aware of the issues of climate change and air quality. Global warming and the need for cleaner fuels are topics that have been discussed intensely at both national and global levels, most recently at the COP25 UN Conference on Climate Change , which was held in Madrid in December 2019. Government policies and regulations will be the drivers for a transition to cleaner energy. New governmental policies are being implemented in emerging markets to move away from the use of carbon-emitting fuels. For example, China's 13th Five-Year Plan and Clean Winter Heating Policy support a coal-to-gas transition. China is also in the process of liberalising its gas market, creating a single, midstream company as well as allowing third-party access at LNG terminals and investing in new gas pipeline infrastructure, which together will make gas more competitive. These policies will increase gas demand throughout China. Similarly, in India the government is moving towards a gas-based economy and aiming to achieve a GDP of $5trn by 2025. Some $68bn has already been invested in gas pipelines and city distribution networks, bringing affordable gas to 70% of the population. India is also working to increase the share of gas in its energy matrix to 15% by 2030, up from the current level of 6%. Renewables are also an option for cleaner energy in India and in other parts of the world. Large solar systems and wind farms are great investment opportunities for emerging economies, but they will require a significant amount of capital. Additionally, renewables will need gas as a partner to mitigate the volatility that is inherent with the production of renewables. \</doc>

December 2, 2019 Global perspective, human stories The tasks are many, timelines are tight, every item is important Mr. Guterres outlined the work programme for what will be a busy two-week event covering multiple aspects of the climate crisis, including capacity-building, deforestation, indigenous peoples, cities, finance, technology, and gender. "The tasks are many", he said, "our timelines are tight, and every item is important". The conference must convey a firm determination to change course, demonstrate that the world is seriously committed to stopping the "war against nature", and has the political will to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, he continued. COP25 marks the beginning of a 12 month process to review countries' "Nationally Determined Contributions" or NDCs (the commitments made under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement), and ensure that they are ambitious enough to defeat the climate emergency. Overcome divisions, put a price on carbon Encouraging signs of progress, noted Mr. Guterres, came out of the UN's Climate Action Summit, held in September, which saw initiatives proposed by small island nations and least-developed countries, major cities and regional economies, as well as the private and financial sectors. The stated intention of some 70 countries to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020 - with 65 countries and major economies committing to work for net zero emissions by 2050 - while governments and investors are backing away from fossil fuels, were also cited as positive signs. The UN chief called for leaders to end division over climate change, and reach consensus on carbon pricing, a crucial tool for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so, he said, will "get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone." Is this the generation that 'fiddled while the planet burned?' However, failing to decide on a price for carbon will, warned Mr. Guterres, risk fragmenting the carbon markets, sending a negative message that can undermine efforts to solve the climate crisis. Throughout his speech, the Secretary-General was crystal clear about the urgent, existential level of the climate crisis. Failure to act, he said, will be the path of surrender: "Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?" The signs of potential disaster are unmissable, he declared. For example, the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is comparable to that seen between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today. Other indicators include the fact that the last five years have been the hottest on record, and have seen extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. Ice caps are melting at a rapid rate, sea levels are rising, and oceans are acidifying, threatening all marine life. Meanwhile, coal plants continue to be planned and built, and large, important parts of the global economy - from agriculture to transportation, from urban planning and construction to cement, steel and other carbon-intensive industries - are still run in ways that are unsustainable. "There is no time and no reason to delay", concluded Mr. Guterres. "We have the tools, we have the science, we have the resources. Let us show we also have the political will that people demand from us. To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family and all the generations to come". Speaking at a roundtable with Heads of State and government attending COP25 , Mr. Guterres urged them to lead, and not follow, at a time when public opinion over the environment is evolving very quickly, and cities, regions and the business community are taking action to tackle the climate crisis. The Secretary-General reminded them that at the recent G20 meeting of the world's leading economies in Osaka, a group of asset management companies, representing some $ 34 trillion dollars had asked political leaders to enhance climate action, end subsidies to fossil fuels, and put a price on carbon. The private sector, he added, is increasingly demonstrating a strong commitment to move forward, and complaining that it's governments who are lagging behind: regulation is inadequate, fiscal systems are not favourable, subsidies are still going to fossil fuels, and companies face obstacles to climate action. With a head of steam building for action, it is for political leaders to "to be able to take profit of this movement and to lead, for us to be able to defeat climate change". The Secretary-General also addressed a forum of "climate vulnerable" countries, where he pointed out the "great injustice" of climate change: its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. He cited examples, including Mozambique and the Caribbean, ravaged by storms that cause devastation, in terms of lives lost, communities uprooted, and economies crippled; and drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Nevertheless, some of the most vulnerable nations are in the forefront of climate action, showing leadership at September's Climate Action Summit: Mr. Guterres expressed his hope that their example will be followed by the world's big emitters. \</doc>

Children and young people must be at the heart of dealing with the climate crisis, the UN and campaigners have said as HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world climate talks in Madrid HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world little concrete progress Young people, including HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Greta Thunberg , played a leading role in protests at COP25 over the weekend, and on Monday appeared at the conference to put pressure on negotiators to come up with a plan for reducing greenhouse gases and tackling the impacts of climate breakdown. Penelope Lea, a 15-year old from Norway, was the first climate activist chosen to be a Unicef ambassador. She said: "We need to keep giving the decisionmakers the power to make the changes we need to see. People have a right to knowledge, and an obligation to get knowledge. Some say we have to wait for people to get ready for change. But we need to make people ready. These are some of the things the youth movement is trying to do, and have to do to ensure progress at COP25 ." Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, applauded the young activists. "I understand the despair and rage that so many young people and older ones too are feeling. All of us know the facts and so far there has been far too little real action. Children and young people have a right to participate. We need to implement the principle of intergenerational equity that the Paris agreement sets out." Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland, said: "The children have called out the adult world, called us out very effectively, as this is a grave injustice. When I was growing up I did not have that shadow [of climate breakdown]. It's not fair that we have made children have that fear." Unicef warned that climate breakdown would reverse the gains made in recent years in protecting children and enshrining their rights in law. More than 500 million children live in areas judged to be at extremely high risk of floods, due to cyclones, hurricanes, storms and rising sea levels. In the Caribbean alone, the number of children displaced by extreme weather events has risen sixfold in five years, with more than 760,000 children displaced between 2014 and 2018. More than 160 million children are living in areas with high levels of drought, with severe impacts on their development and exposure to disease. That number is expected to rise dramatically, so that on current trends as many as one in four children around the world will live in areas of extreme water stress, according to the UN. Diseases, including mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever, are forecast to spread to new areas as a result of global heating. Children under five are likely to be most at risk. Air pollution, which is made worse by coal-burning power stations, fossil fuels burned for transport and biomass burning in homes without clean energy sources, also HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world hurts children disproportionately. Breathing toxic air can stunt children's lungs permanently, and has a long-term impact on their health, brain function and development. Toxic air contributes to the deaths of about 600,000 deaths of children under five every year, from pneumonia and other respiratory problems. But the measures needed to tackle the climate crisis - replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, creating green spaces and planting trees - would also help to clean up dirty air. Gautam Narasimhan, a senior adviser on climate change, energy and environment at Unicef, said: "From hurricanes to droughts to floods to wildfires, the consequences of the climate crisis are all around us, affecting children the most and threatening their health, education, protection and very survival. Children are essential actors in responding to the climate crisis. We owe it to them to put all our efforts behind solutions we know can make a difference." \</doc>

The UN climate talks that stuttered to a belated and inconclusive close yesterday in Madrid were undone by a technical issue that turned into a fatal obstacle. The central task of this year's talks, known as COP25 , was to iron out rules for a new global carbon market - referred to as "Article Six" because it is the sixth article of the Paris climate accord - and create a system that would allow countries to pay each other for projects that reduce emissions. But the talks - impeded even before they started by the impending withdrawal of the US from the Paris accord - were haunted by the legacy of old carbon credits created under the 1997 Kyoto protocol. Most of those credits, which were conceived as a way for rich countries to pay poorer nations for emissions reduction projects, are nearly worthless and their use been widely discredited. But the countries that hold the old credits - mainly China, India and Brazil - have been fighting to have the right to carry them over into the new system that was meant to have been agreed in Madrid. This battle was central to why the negotiations failed to produce any deal on the carbon markets issue despite running 44 hours over their allotted time. " COP25 showed that the yawning gap between what citizens are demanding on climate action, and what UN negotiations are delivering, is wider than ever," said Nat Keohane, senior vice-president at Environmental Defense Fund and an observer to the talks. "After negotiators failed a second year in a row to agree on guidance for markets, it is time to move on," he said, calling for countries to set up their own rules given the lack of any UN guidance. Environmental groups and countries including the EU have argued against carrying over the old credits, because it would leave a new global carbon market awash with cheap credits generated under dubious circumstances. Meanwhile, Australia lobbied hard to carry over a second type of credit, which would have allowed it to apply the credits it received for overachieving on prior climate goals towards its future targets in 2030. "It is a ghost from the past in some way," said David Waskow, director of the World Resources Institute's climate initiative, and an observer at the talks. "When you look at the final text, you can see that the Kyoto carry-over question was where the nub of the final issue lay - that was where things really did not get resolved." Around 4.3bn credits are available under the Kyoto Protocols' clean development mechanism, according to research by the NewClimate Institute, a think-tank in Berlin - more than the annual emissions of the EU. China holds about 60 per cent of these, India holds 10 per cent and Brazil 5 per cent. The failure of the Madrid talks to reach an agreement will create uncertainty for the private carbon offset markets, which are used by companies and individuals seeking to compensate for their emissions. A surge of purchases from airlines has led to a boom in the private markets for carbon offsets, even though there is no single unified standard for these offsets. "It creates a lot of uncertainty," said Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at Carbon Market Watch. He points out that the lack of any global accounting rules for carbon offsets can result in double counting, because the offsets purchased by companies are also counted as emissions reductions in the country where they originate. The thorny issue of carbon markets under Article Six will now be shunted to UK-hosted talks in Glasgow next year. "This outcome will make the UK's job harder next year in terms of the negotiation items," said Jennifer Tollman, policy adviser at E3G. "The UK has a pretty big lift next year in terms of doing that diplomatic outreach." 'This outcome will make the UK's job harder next year in terms of the negotiation items' \</doc>

Scientists from the University of Reading's Walker Institute are attending the latest UN conference on climate change , which seeks to encourage countries to commit to cutting emissions. The UN's 25th annual Conference of the Parties (COP) takes place from 2-13 December in Madrid. Representatives from the Walker Institute, which supports communities around the world in becoming more resilient to the effects of climate change, are running a series of activities there. Climate change is one of the most pressing concerns of our time, and a key issue ahead of December's General Election. Reading is at the forefront of scientific efforts to understand the threats to the environment and society posed by a changing climate. As well as policy influence, research carried out at Reading has also had a significant impact on the general public. A climate stripes data visualisation created by Reading climate scientist Professor Ed Hawkins has become widely recognised as a powerful illustration of global warming. Professor Hawkins said: 'The power of the stripes graphic is not only that it shows the undeniable effect of global warming over time, but that it represents, in a single image, the entirety of more than a century of carefully assembled scientific evidence. 'What the story will be in the future is up to us. Young people today have taken the initiative by protesting and demanding action. Our fate is in our own hands.' Seven Reading experts are authors in the IPCC's fifth assessment report - the most contributed by any UK university worldwide. Reading experts regularly warn that action is needed quickly to curb rising temperatures and reduce the impacts of climate change on the whole planet. Students and academics from the Walker Institute are contributing to COP25 , organising another COP Climate Action Studio, which is enabling 24 doctoral students to remotely participate in real time. They are hosting an exhibition showcasing the Institute's work around climate change. They will also hold a side event on 3 December in partnership with the Met Office and the University of Exeter, presenting the latest research findings on the impacts of a 1.5-degreeC, 2.5-degreeC or 4-degreeC global temperature rise in different regions of the world. The event will be streamed live here. Different approaches to reporting the latest climate science have also been put forward by Reading scientists. Professor Rowan Sutton, who has contributed to previous IPCC assessment reports, argued information on less likely climate events that could have a big impact should be prioritised in reports to aid decision-makers, in a paper published earlier this year. Professor Hawkins' stripes graphic was used as a backdrop on stage by rock band Enter Shikari at Reading Festival in August 2019, before being printed on the front page of the Economist and the Guardian weeks later. The Institute of Environmental Analytics has launched partnerships with governments around the world to implement renewable energy initiatives, using satellite technology and weather data. #VOTEPLANET The University of Reading's #VotePlanet campaign is highlighting the biggest threats facing the UK and global environment, as well as how research and action can combat them, in the lead up to the General Election on December 12. Public concern for the environment has increased significantly in recent years, with political parties unveiling various eco-friendly pledges in their election manifestos. The #VotePlanet campaign therefore aims to inform voters on the science behind these issues, and what sustainability action it is taking as an institution. Follow the campaign on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and on the University news page. Get involved and share your examples of sustainable action using the hashtag #VotePlanet.

ALLIES of Theresa May are lobbying for her to head this year's United Nations climate change conference , arguing she "has the stature" for the role. The former prime minister's name has been put forward in Westminster after it emerged David Cameron and Lord Hague had both turned down the job. A former minister yesterday told Tory MPs that Mrs May would be a fitting successor to Claire Perry O'Neill, who was last week fired as COP26 president. While prime minister, Mrs May put the 2050 net-zero target into law and spoke of the "moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited". One MP yesterday told The Daily Telegraph: "She has the stature", and suggested the role could give Mrs May a route into the House of Lords when she wants to step down from the Commons. Mrs May has remained MP for Maidenhead since leaving Downing Street last summer. Michael Gove has been suggested as a replacement to lead the November summit, with Lord Goldsmith as his deputy. However one Tory MP said it would be "problematic" for him to do the role as well as his expected promotion to head trade talks. Meanwhile Labour suggested Ed Miliband could head the summit, which will be the biggest event hosted by the Government since the 2012 Olympics. Climate campaigners have been urging the Government to appoint a "bighitter" for the summit, which will be attended by world leaders. \</doc>

Boris Johnson sounded out the former Conservative leaders David Cameron and William Hague to take on the top role at this year's United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, The Times can reveal. The former prime minister and Lord Hague of Richmond turned down the offer to serve as the figurehead of the COP26 event in November. Mr Johnson has identified the conference as a key part of his drive to present Britain as a world leader after Brexit. Some 90,000 people, including world leaders, are expected at the summit, the biggest event hosted by the British government since the 2012 Olympics. It is regarded as critical to keeping the Paris Agreement on climate change on track. Success is far from assured after the US withdrawal from the agreement in 2017. Concerns over the conference's leadership came to light last week when Mr Johnson dismissed Claire O'Neill, the former energy minister, as its president. Yesterday she responded by saying he had privately admitted that he "doesn't really understand" climate change. Downing Street said it had been decided that the leadership was a ministerial role. Preparations for the conference have also been dogged by rows with the Scottish government over the cost and on its policing. 'Johnson doesn't get it', pages 18-19 Leading article, page 31 \</doc>

CONFIDENCE AMONG SCOTTISH BUSINESSES DROPS 15 POINTS By Douglas Barrie, PA Scotland Confidence among businesses in Scotland has dropped 15 points in the last month, according to the latest figures. The Business Barometer from Bank of Scotland Commercial Banking - which questions 1,200 companies across the UK each month - found confidence north of the border was down to minus 4% during January. Firms' confidence in their own business prospects was minus 2%, compared to 12% in December. Overall confidence across Britain rose 13 points to 23%, while business prospect confidence increased four points to 22%. Meanwhile a net balance of 3% of Scottish companies expect to reduce staffing levels during the next year, which was the same figure as last month. Experts are now looking ahead to the rest of 2020, with the United Nations climate change conference COP26 in November being billed as a potential opportunity. Fraser Sime, regional director at Bank of Scotland, said: ``It's evident that levels of uncertainty among Scottish businesses remain elevated. ``Despite this month's dip in confidence, it's encouraging to see opportunity on the horizon, including the COP26 United Nations climate change summit, which is being hosted in Glasgow later this year. ``That will shine a spotlight on sustainability in Scotland and the great businesses that are working to become greener. ``We've also announced our own ambition to reduce the carbon emissions we finance by more than 50% by 2030. ``This will promote the kind of sustainable practices that will help Scottish firms prosper for years to come.'' end \</doc>

This is an astonishing first hand account of one young man's involvement in Extinction Rebellion. Sam Haygarth: Climate Crisis, Just The Tonic @ The Mash House, Edinburgh    Sam Haygarth was working in a call centre when he suddenly became terrified about climate change. He plunged into political activism - becoming one of the leaders of a group which spread around the world holding governments to account about the emergency of rising temperatures. When he's talking about climate change, about activism and about the need for every single one of us to take action, Haygarth is one of the best speakers you'll ever hear. You'll meet Greta Thurnberg and Emma Thompson. You'll travel with Haygarth on the megabus to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland. And you'll wind up in a police cell after Haygarth glues himself to the headquarters of a petrochemical company.

Spain's Old Masters are being subjected to the effects of a modern phenomenon. Works by Diego Vel\'e1zquez and Francisco Goya have been digitally manipulated to show the impact of climate change (Isambard Wilkinson writes). In a joint project by the Prado Museum in Madrid and WWF to coincide with the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, four of the museum's best-known paintings have been altered to reflect the world if temperatures increase by more than 1.5C. They are Philip IV on Horseback by Vel\'e1zquez, Boys on the Beach by Joaqu\'edn Sorolla, The Parasol by Goya, and Charon crossing the Styx by Joachim Patinir. Philip IV, originally depicted enjoying the tranquillity of his power, rides up to his chest in water. The naked innocence of Sorolla's boys is tainted by poisoned fish and the sunny luxuriance of Goya's rustic scene is transformed to one of desperation with climate refugees. Patinir's pessimistic vision of death is drained of all hope, with the Styx running dry in a drought. The photomontages feature on billboards in Madrid as part of a WWF publicity campaign during the UN conference, which runs until tomorrow. Juan Carlos del Olmo, head of the WWF, said that he wanted "to send a strong message through the universal language of art". \</doc>

AS countries convene in Madrid for the of UN-led climate talks, the stark reality of life for people on the frontlines of climate change has been laid bare. A new report from Oxfam, Forced from Home, reveals that climate-fuelled disasters were the number one driver of internal displacement over the last decade - forcing an estimated 20 million people a year from their homes. That's one person every two seconds. In Cuba, Dominica and Tuvalu, nearly 5% of the population has been displaced annually by extreme weather between 2008 and 2018. This is equivalent to almost half the population of Glasgow - where the climate talks will be held this time next year - being displaced elsewhere within Scotland every year. READ MORE:\~Young people are quite right to be prioritising the planet Just imagine the upheaval, and suffering, being forced to leave your home would create - even in Scotland. However, today's report shows it is people in the poorest countries around the world who are most vulnerable to this climate-fuelled displacement. More people in those countries are likely to live in poorly built houses or on land that is more at risk from extreme weather. They are unlikely to have insurance or savings to help them rebuild their lives after a disaster. People like Silveria Perez, a mother of four from Guatemala. Silveria and her family used to have fields full of crops, but El Nino has brought six years of drought across Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Silveria's husband has been forced to move to Mexico to find work, but the money he sends back is only enough to buy one pound of corn - leaving the family to go hungry. With the frequency and intensity of extreme weather increasing, the ability of people living in poverty to withstand shocks is gradually being eroded. Each climate disaster is leading them further into a downward spiral of deeper poverty and hunger, and eventually, displacement. Not only are the countries most affected by climate disasters the poorest countries, they are also the countries that do the least to cause climate change. It's a sobering reality that developed countries, like Scotland, have historic climate debt. Despite the Scottish Parliament agreeing stronger emission targets in September, under our current ambitions we'll be making this crisis worse for the next three decades. Encouragingly, climate finance - the money countries affected by climate change need to adapt and recover - is one of the key issues at this year's UN climate talks, known this year as COP25 . The UN is due to conclude a review of the progress made under the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage, and developing countries will be pushing for the establishment of a new fund to help communities recover and rebuild after climate shocks. Up to now, poor countries have mainly been left to cover the rising costs of extreme weather disasters themselves. And new Oxfam analysis shows that these costs are crippling. Economic losses from extreme weather disasters over the last decade were equivalent to 2% of countries' national income. For small island developing states like Dominica or Tuvalu, this was up to an astonishing 20%. Rich polluting countries, like the UK, must deliver on their promise to mobilise $100 billion a year globally by 2020 to support emissions reductions and adaptation in poor countries. They must also deliver deeper and more urgent emissions reductions to limit global heating to 1.5\'b0C. Next year's COP in Glasgow will mark five years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, and in the run-up to it countries will update their national emission plans for the first time. These plans will set the trajectory for climate action in the crucial period between now and 2030. However, people like Silveria cannot afford for another 12 months to pass with insufficient action. Governments can and must make Madrid matter. Ambitions must be strengthened, and strategies put in place for a swift and just phase-out of fossil fuels. A new finance facility that provides an assessment of global climate financing needs is essential with clear criteria for disbursing funds and agreement on new and innovative ways of mobilising additional funds. In 2019, millions of people across the globe - including thousands of young people here in Scotland - mobilised to demand climate justice. Nowhere is the injustice more clearly visible than in the shattered lives of women, men and children who have been forced to leave their homes and communities by a crisis they did little to create. Much of the focus is on 2030 and the world's leading climate scientists' warning about the catastrophic consequences of going above 1.5C. But for people like Silveria, the crisis is already here. COP26 in Glasgow must be a landmark year in the climate movement but, before then, countries must make the next two weeks in Madrid really matter. Jamie Livingstone Head of Oxfam Scotland \</doc>

December 6, 2019 Madrid/Washington DC: --A delegation from Earth Day Network, the team that organizes the annual Earth Day events, will take part in the UN Climate Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain in order to promote stepped-up climate action in 2020. A key focus of the Earth Day 2020 team's engagement at COP25 will be on climate and environmental education as a central policy for raising ambition in support of urgent national and international efforts. A global survey of citizens carried out by Worldwide Views with support from partners including the Government of France and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, found education topped citizens' views in just under 100 countries as the key to change. The survey was released just prior to the UN Climate Conference in Paris in 2015 where the landmark, universal, climate change agreement was forged. Earth Day Network, which has promoted environmental education since its inception in 1970, believes the momentum is now underway to realize this key goal. The Government of Italy, for example, has just announced it will make climate education compulsory in secondary schools in 2020. Governments like Mexico are also powering ahead with new plans to make environmental education central to its sustainability plans. Pakistan is another nation embracing environmental and climate education focusing first on Islamabad with plans to roll it out across the country over the coming years. Kathleen Roger, Earth Day Network President, said: "The latest science, released prior to COP25 , is clear--without urgent action the world is heading for global average temperature rises well beyond what the planet and its people can take". "If we are to seriously get on track we need dramatic, scaled-up, ambition in everything from investments in clean, renewable energy to restoring the Earth's natural systems like forests. Climate and environmental education also need to be a central pillar of national climate plans to equip a new generation with the truth, the reality and the solutions needed to make the dramatic changes in societies that will be crucial for success," she added. Among the many events linked with this new momentum will be a debate organized by World Environmental Education (WEE) and sponsored by the Earth Day Network Mexico and the Foundation for Environmental Education. It will take place on Friday 6 December at 11 00 am as part of events by the Green Climate Fund at The GEF Pavilion. Speakers will include:- I\'f1igo Orva\'f1anos - WEE President of EDUCA Foundation; Kathleen Rogers, President of Earth Day Network; and Martha Delgado, Mexico's Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights. Earth Day Network is co-sponsoring a side event with the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), Action for Climate Empowerment: Connecting the Global Climate Crisis, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, which will take place Friday, 6 December at 11:30 - 13:00 in Room 4. On Tuesday, December 10, Earth Day Network has scheduled a press conference at COP25 for 11:30 am (tentative time) to present the latest, inspiring, government announcements with a call for new, national climate and environmental education plans to be put down by Earth Day 2020, 22 April, next year. This also supports the call by Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine for nations to put forward their full, enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions by Earth Day next year. Notes to Editors April 2020, nature and the environment face enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change. For many reasons, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day will mark a pivotal year for our planet. Our campaigns are intended to activate at least a billion people worldwide to meet Earth Day's 2020 theme, climate action: - EARTHRISE, an intergenerational global movement for climate action that will mobilize around the world on April 22, 2020 - The Great Global Cleanup, a worldwide campaign to remove billions of pieces of trash from neighborhoods, beaches, rivers, lakes, trails, and parks -- reducing waste and plastic pollution, improving habitats, and preventing harm to wildlife and humans. - Earth Challenge, the largest-ever global citizen science initiative, which will arm everyday individuals with the tools they need to report on the health and wellbeing of the environment, from their drinking water, to their air quality, to the species around them. - Foodprints for the Future, a collaboration with individuals, communities, and partners across all sectors to address one of the largest contributors to climate change facing us today: our food system - Artists for the Earth, a global campaign bringing artists from around the world in every discipline, using the power of their art to express our common humanity.

By BBC Monitoring Chilean President Sebastian Pinera's cancellation of major international trade and climate summits due to a wave of anti-government protests has dashed the Chilean leader's hopes of acting as a high-level peacemaker in the US-China trade war and of being a world champion in protecting the environment, Latin American media reported on 31 October. Commentators saw the two weeks of intense and frequently violent protests that have rocked the South American nation as not only dragging down its economy, but also battering Chile's previously praised reputation as a bastion of economic solidity and social stability in an often volatile region. In a headline, leading Argentine daily La Nacion on 31 October called "A Blow for Chile" Pinera's announcement on 30 October that his government was giving up hosting the 16-17 November 2019 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, and the 2-13 December 2019 COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference . La Nacion described Pinera's decision as a "a major setback to his desire to become a regional reference at a strategic level and a leader on the environment". Pinera's 'nightmares have come true' In particular, the Argentine daily added, "The measure was a bucket of cold water for the aspirations of the [Chilean] government to transform itself into a world window for a partial pact between United States and China to solve the trade war between both powers". Pinera had been hoping to achieve this during the APEC summit. Mexico's left-wing newspaper La Jornada, in a 30 October online story, also saw a major loss of international prestige for the centre-right Chilean leader, saying his "nightmares" had come true by having to cancel the summits. "It is a very hard personal and political blow for Pinera, who in recent months sought greater international protagonism - not exempt from resounding failures, for example, his role in the events of Cucuta [in Colombia] last February, aimed at toppling the regime of [sitting Venezuelan President] Nicolas Maduro; or when he sought to intercede in the bitter dispute between the presidents of France and Brazil, over the fires in the Amazon-: but also for Chile, whose image as a safe destination has been falling as different governments warn their citizens of the risks they run travelling there" 'Panic in Chile' Some regional media outlets portrayed the summit cancellations by the Pinera government as an acknowledgement that it could not guarantee order and security for such events. Brazil's Terca Livre news website headlined its 31 October story: "Panic in Chile: Pinera cancels two international summits". Brazilian business daily Valor said in a 30 October story: "With the cancellation [of the summits], the [Chilean] government implicitly admits that it expects the protests to continue and shows itself lost, experts say" It added: "The cancellation of the summits announced yesterday [30 October] by the leader added clouds to the tourist sector, with the cancellation of many flights and tourism packages to Santiago. Football cup final still on in Santiago Nevertheless, Latin American media noted with apparent relief that Chile was not giving up on hosting one of the region's most watched football events, the Libertadores Cup final. Brazilian news magazine Istoe quoted Chile's Sports Minister Cecilia Perez as affirming that the cup final between Brazil's Flamengo and Argentina's River Plate teams would be "maintained" as scheduled on 23 November in the National Stadium of the Chilean capital Santiago. Ideological fault lines The days of protests by Chilean citizens angry over public transport fare hikes and living costs has revived an ideological confrontation in the region between supporters of Chile's centre-right leader and the pro-US and pro-market policies he had espoused, and left-wing leaders and activists who hailed the Chilean upheaval as a "defeat" of the Western-style neo-liberal capitalist model promoted by the United States. Among the latter was left-wing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a target of US sanctions, who on 30 October tweeted words of praise for what he called the "impressive popular rebellion in Chile" against "sectors of the oligarchy". "This process excites us a lot," he said in a video posted on his @NicolasMaduro Twitter account, adding he believed the Chilean people were engaged in fighting for a "new constitution" in the country, similar to the one produced by his leftist "Bolivarian Revolution". From the other end of the political spectrum, right-wing commentators were portraying the Chilean unrest as a left wing-inspired attempt to topple Pinera's government. Brazilian lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, tweeted on his @BolsonaroSP account on 30 October: "In Chile the Forum of SP [Sao Paulo, regional alliance of left-wing parties] is burning metros, buses, banks. Pres[ident] Pinera made concessions. Do you think these black [sic] blocs are going to stop there? The objective is not the social agenda, it is the taking of power".

A TEAM of 25 north-east officers have helped to make sure their colleagues get rest days, a new report said. Police Scotland created a Brexit contingency team - also called the force reserve - in March last year. It was made up of 275 officers across the country, including 25 who were drafted in from the north-east during at least two periods, each lasting several weeks. They were deployed to major events such as Old Firm football derbies and environmental street protests so they are trained for problems that may arise from leaving the European Union. In a new Scottish Police Authority report, Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr highlighted the team\'e2(EURO)(TM)s availability to be drafted into police major events has led to fewer of their colleagues being called up on rest days. He said: "The positive impact on service delivery and staff wellbeing - through reduced cancelled rest days - the force reserve has been recognised.\'e2(EURO) The report said Police Scotland spent \'c2\£315.1m preparing for Brexit as of January 3 - funded by the UK Government. Deputy Chief Constable Kerr added: "A review is being undertaken and will consider a range of options going forward. Upon completion of the review an options paper will be presented, for consideration of the Chief Constable Iain Thomas Livingstone, by the end of January. "Options will include full or part retention or full stand down of force reserve and officers returned to division. "This decision will be taken against the operational backdrop of a number of significant operational challenges during 2020, including Euro 2020 football matches and the United Nations Climate Change Conference (both in Glasgow).\'e2(EURO) \</doc>

TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar last night revealed what he had talked about in his one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump. The issues included Brexit, the tax dodging of multinationals and climate change, even though it wasn't on the agenda until the Mirror raised it before their meeting. Mr Varadkar admitted: "It came up at the press event. "You had the opportunity to raise it there and hear what the President had to say. And in our private meeting I mentioned the fact I will be attending the [ United Nations ] climate change conference in New York in September and that Ireland was determined to meet our obligations under the Paris Agreement, even if the US has withdrawn. I disagreed with the decision of the US to pull out of the Paris accords. "Climate action is something that every country in the world has to act together on or we won't be able to stop climate change and that's why big countries like the US and China have to be as much a part of this as Ireland." Mr Varadkar also explained the country's position on Brexit. He revealed: "He [Mr Trump] said he was aware of sticking points in the negotiations and one of the most difficult points is the issue of the border. He wants to keep that open and believes that can be done. "We didn't go into any details, but he understands that has to be a shared objective." \</doc>

The vital importance of nuclear technologies was a focus of attention at a UN-organized side event held today as part of the COP 25 climate change conference in Madrid. King Lee, Director Harmony Programme, World Nuclear Association, joined representatives from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the International Maritime Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization in a panel facing questions from other UN organizations. The panel discussed driving innovation for low-carbon industrialization to support achieving the ninth Sustainable Development Goal. Lee emphasized that 'nuclear energy is a mature and proven low-carbon source of electricity, with a 60-year track record of providing reliable and safe operation. On-going innovation and technological development will enable even wider applications aimed at deep decarbonisation of economies around the world and supporting sustainable development.' Nuclear generation is already the largest source of low-carbon electricity in advanced economies today. Worldwide, nuclear generation avoids the emission of more than 2,500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. Innovative nuclear technologies will help lead the way to further deep decarbonization. Small modular reactors will help bring nuclear electricity to remote communities. High-temperature reactors will replace the use of fossil fuels for industrial heat. The use of fast reactors operated in a closed fuel cycle will increase uranium resource efficiency. Nuclear technologies already have a broad range of applications in medicine, agriculture and water resources, and those roles will expand in the future. As countries move towards declaring their long term strategies for climate mitigation under the Paris Agreement the vital importance of nuclear energy is becoming clear. Lee said, 'Nuclear technologies do not merely provide energy - they are improving peoples' lives.' Notes to Editors World Nuclear Association is the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry. Its mission is to promote a wider understanding of nuclear energy among key international influencers by producing authoritative information, developing common industry positions, and contributing to the energy debate, as well as to pave the way for expanding nuclear business.

Ayrshire has a new top cop after it was announced that Chief Superintendent Faroque Hussain would take over as Divisional Commander for the area. He replaces Ch Supt Mark Hargreaves who was transferred to the Glasgow Division to head up policing of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) which will take place in the city in November. Ch Supt Hussain said: "I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next Local Police Commander for Ayrshire. I am looking forward to continuing the excellent work and relationships built with local partners and communities across North, East and South Ayrshire by my predecessor Chief Superintendent Mark Hargreaves." Ch Supt Hussain has 20 years police experience and from 2016 to 2018 he served in the Ayrshire Division as a Superintendent. Following his time in Ayrshire he was seconded to the National Crime Agency in London and formed part of a national unit designed to support UK law enforcement. In May 2019 he was promoted to Ch Supt, head of analysis, performance, demand and productivity. He is currently a Strategic Firearms Commander, having previously been an Authorised Firearms Officer and a Tactical Firearms Commander. Ch Supt Hussain said: "My priority will be to support our officers and staff ensuring we continue to work hard with our local communities and partners to reduce criminality and help the most vulnerable people across Ayrshire. I want to engage in a discussion about crime, the challenges facing police and how we will prioritise our activities." He added: "As Sir Robert Peel recognised at the beginning of modern policing in the late 1820s, the rule of law, the tackling of crime and effectiveness of policing depend on the quality of the relationship between the police and public. As the world changes dramatically I need to ensure this fundamental principle remains central. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all of our officers and staff for their continued hard work." \</doc>

Ayrshire is getting a new police supremo - as the last one was shifted after just a year in post. Chief Superintendent Mark Hargreaves has been tapped for a climate summit role in Glasgow. His predecesser Paul Main managed two years before retiring. The new Ayrshire commander is Chief Superintendent Faroque Hussain, a Strategic Firearms Commander. The dad-of-four slipped behind his desk at Kilmarnock HQ on Monday. Aged 42, he is regarded as a high flier and is the highest ranking officer of ethnic background in Scotland. He said: "I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next Local Police Commander for Ayrshire. "My priority will be to support our officers and staff ensuring we continue to work hard with our communities and partners to reduce criminality and help the most vulnerable people across Ayrshire. "I want to engage in a discussion about crime, the challenges facing police and how we will prioritise our activities. "I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all of our officers and staff for their continued hard work." Chief Hussain had been a Superintendent in the County from 2016-18 and lives on the patch. Mark Hargreaves is now leading planning with Glasgow Division on policing of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in November. Chief Hussain has 20 years experience spanning all sorts of police operations. He was seconded to the National Crime Agency in London. In May last year he was promoted to Chief Superintendent. He began his police career in Glasgow in uniform before switching to plain clothes roles, including the Counter Terrorism Unit. \</doc>

The Better Cotton Initiative (BCI)\~has joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Fashion for Global Climate Action initiative as a signatory to the\~Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. The Fashion for Global Climate Action initiative calls on the fashion industry and organisations in the textile supply chain to acknowledge the contribution of the sector to climate change and its responsibility to strive towards climate neutrality for a safer planet. Launched in December of last\~year\~at the\~ United Nations climate change conference , COP24, in Katowice, Poland, the Charter is seen as an industry milestone in collectively addressing the climate impact of the fashion sector across its entire value chain. "Through collective action and bold leadership, we have the power to make this fast and drastic transformation.\~ By signing the Charter, we have demonstrated our commitment to playing our part to ensure that cotton production is on the path to a low-carbon future," BCI said in a statement.

THE United Nations Climate Change conference could be moved from Scotland to England because of a row with the Scottish Government over the cost of policing it. Boris Johnson is considering moving COP26 to the Excel centre in London or the NEC in Birmingham, after officials were asked to pay an extra \£3120 million to cover the cost of policing the event in Glasgow. No10 tried to play down the row, saying "it is standard practice to carry out contingency planning at major international events at this scale". The Prime Minister's press secretary said: "We are committed to holding COP26 in Glasgow but the Scottish Government needs to work with us to make sure that this is a successful summit that showcases the UK as a world leader in tackling climate change and represents value for the UK taxpayer." The NEC and Excel centre were now being considered. A source said: "They may use it to negotiate with Glasgow." One source said that the Scottish Government has "behaved terribly" over the costs of the event. The organisation of COP26 was thrown into doubt after its president Claire Perry O'Neill was controversially fired despite her highly regarded track record as a Government energy minister. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government denied suggestions of conflict with Westminster over the conference, saying: "The Scottish government, Police Scotland, Glasgow city council and all Scotland's public services are focused on delivering a successful COP, not engaging in ridiculous petty politics." \</doc>

The Guam rail fell prey to the brown tree snake, an invasive species accidentally introduced to the US island territory at the end of the second world war. It is only the second bird in history to recover from being extinct in the wild, after the California condor. Other species to have their status updated include the echo parakeet, of which there are now more than 750 in the wild, leading to a reclassification as a "vulnerable" species, having been critically endangered more than a decade ago. The Australian trout cod and pedder galaxias, both freshwater fish, have also showed improvement, the former moving from endangered to vulnerable and the latter from critically endangered to endangered, after many years of conservation efforts. The 10 species showing recovered numbers were "a spark of hope in the midst of the biodiversity crisis", said Grethel Aguilar, the acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, whose red list is the global gold standard data covering species on the brink. "[They] prove that nature will recover if given half a chance." However, the red list data released on Tuesday also showed 73 species declines despite conservation efforts, and the list now numbers 112,432 species around the world, of which more than 30,000 are on the brink of extinction. The IUCN update came as governments from more than 190 nations HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/18/iucn-red-list-reveals-wildlife-destruction-from-treetop-to-ocean-floor met in Madrid for two weeks of talks "The tightly woven links between climate and biodiversity must be recognised at COP25 and there is good reason for this: the impact that a changing climate will have on the ability of ecosystems to support plant and animal life, and the challenges that biodiversity already face in a warming world are both vast," said Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK. Ecosystems are already under unprecedented pressure from human impacts, including habitat loss from encroachment by urbanisation and farming, pollution, hunting, overfishing and invasive species. But the accelerating climate crisis is pushing nature to breaking point around the world, wiping out vital ecosystems, putting unbearable pressure on species and leading some experts to declare a sixth mass extinction. "To avert the worst of these impacts, we have to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C," said Redmond-King. "There is no time for debate. Only a dramatic increase in the ambition of our collective response can avert the climate crisis we are in." One of the ironies of the UN climate talks is that protecting natural systems could provide a lifeline for humanity out of the climate crisis - yet it is one that is often neglected at these annual talks. A focus on "nature-based solutions" could make a marked difference to action on the climate, said Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme. "We need to take the lessons we have learned on the climate change journey." She pointed to deforestation, which threatens species and is accelerating the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Preserving forests is relatively cheap, but is the subject of tense debate at the COP25 talks because some nations want to sell carbon credits from their standing forests, as well as counting them towards their national emissions reduction targets. That argument has yet to be resolved, and may not be before the UN talks end on Friday. Marine biodiversity - which is HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/18/iucn-red-list-reveals-wildlife-destruction-from-treetop-to-ocean-floor under threat from climate breakdown HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/18/iucn-red-list-reveals-wildlife-destruction-from-treetop-to-ocean-floor is vital to their capacity to store carbon and help combat the climate emergency. Oceana, a marine NGO, called attention to the "blue forests" composed of marine algae which are widespread across the planet and which store carbon dioxide and provide a lifeline for the thousands of species that depend on them "Blue forests are one of the main lungs of our oceans, and we should protect them as they deserve," said Ricardo Aguilar, the senior research director at Oceana in Europe. "Scientific reports tend to focus on terrestrial forests, but marine algae can account for as much as a fifth of the CO 2 stored by oceans. It is vital that decision-makers include their protection within international policies against the climate crisis." Another study released at COP25 , published in the journal Global Change Biology, illustrated how preserving mangrove groves can provide a key buffer against the impacts of global heating. Researchers studied the Segara Anakan lagoon in Java, Indonesia, and found it had huge potential for storing carbon, fostering biodiversity and protecting against storms. Kartika Anggi Hapsari, from G\'f6ttingen University and the study's lead author, said: "Our research shows that people need to prioritise mangrove ecosystems for conservation and restoration because mangroves absorb carbon efficiently. It is not enough just to focus on cutting carbon emissions. Society needs to also identify efficient and natural ecosystems, like those dominated by mangrove vegetation, to remove carbon [from the atmosphere]." Next year will be a crucial one for action on both the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, where nations will have to come up with vastly improved targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decade to fulfil the pledges of the 2015 Paris agreement. Before those talks take place, in Glasgow next November, the IUCN will hold its four-yearly World Conservation Congress in June and the UN Biodiversity Convention will decide on new measures for preserving species at a meeting in Kunming, China, in October. Campaigners hope the sequence of key meetings will lead to a greater focus on nature in the coming year, but stressed that more needed to be done to draw out the interdependency of these issues, rather than allowing them to be seen in isolation. This article was amended on 11 December 2019 because an earlier version referred to some experts declaring a fifth mass extinction. This has been corrected to say sixth. \</doc>

There is nothing like a looming Cabinet reshuffle to trigger an unseemly turf war among ministers. But this time, there is an extra dimension to the jockeying for position. The UK is hosting the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow in November, putting the Government's commitment to stop global warming under international scrutiny. It seems to be dawning on No 10 that it needs a high-profile big-hitter to take charge of preparations for the summit, known as COP 26. Last summer, Boris Johnson appointed Claire Perry O'Neill to lead the summit as well as coordinate with Whitehall and the UN. She was sacked by Dominic Cummings in a phone call on Friday - and is now reportedly considering legal action (page 7). Ms Perry O'Neill, who is known for her pithy choice of language and blunt approach, may have found her style incompatible with some in Whitehall. But there is likely to be a bigger reason why she has gone: the PM views COP 26 as a major part of his post-Brexit renewal of Britain and he wants the UK to be seen as punching above its weight. There have been reports that the COP 26 preparations have been beset by disorganisation and lack of communication, which is not necessarily the fault of Ms Perry O'Neill but classic Whitehall stasis. Estimated costs for the summit have reportedly nearly doubled from \£3250m to \£3450m. Announcing her sacking, Ms Perry O'Neill said the Cabinet's COP 26 sub-committee that the PM was supposed to chair had not met once. For now, pending that reshuffle, Andrea Leadsom has taken charge. But this may be a job for Michael Gove, a former environment secretary, looking for a new challenge. \</doc>

(Alliance News) - Barclays PLC is to face calls from shareholders at its annual general meeting to phase out its financing of fossil fuel firms that are not aligned with the Paris climate agreement, a London-based environmental charity said on Wednesday. A group of 11 institutional investors in the bank, managing over GBP130 billion, alongside 100 individual shareholders, backed by charity ShareAction, have filed a resolution which will be voted on at Barclays's annual general meeting in May. The charity said: "Today a group of shareholders, coordinated by ShareAction, have taken formal action at Barclays, asking the bank to phase out its financing of fossil fuel companies that are active agents in driving the climate crisis." The 11 institutional investors include Brunel Pension Partnership, a UK pension fund, and Sarasin & Partners LLP an asset manager with more than GBP132 billion of assets under management. Since the 2015 Paris Agreement was signed, Barclays has provided in excess of USD85 billion of funds to fossil fuel companies, making it sixth-largest backer in sector globally, ShareAction said. "This landmark resolution \- the first climate change resolution filed at a European bank \- requests that Barclays publishes a plan to gradually stop the provision of financial services (including project finance, corporate finance, and underwriting) to companies in the energy sector, and to gas and electric utilities that are not aligned with the goals of the Paris climate agreement," the pressure group said. "The resolution is the first in a series of actions in 2020, which will put financial services to the test on climate change in the run up to the UK-hosted COP26 climate talks." COP26, the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference , takes place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.

The UN secretary general has warned that the planet is close to "the point of no return" and branded global efforts to combat climate change "utterly inadequate", as world leaders gathered for a vital conference on the Paris Agreement. Antonio Guterres issued the stark warning ahead of the fortnight-longUN climate change conference ( COP25 The Alliance of Small Island States, representing nations most at risk from rising seas, views the talks as the last chance to avert potential catastrophe, while Save the Children warns that 33 million African children are facing hunger as a result of cyclones and droughtsmade more likely by climate change. "The point of no return is no longer over the horizon," Mr Guterres told reporters in Madrid. "It is in sight and hurtling towards us." Noting that the world hasthe scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, theUN chief denounced policymakers'lacklustre response in the face of a "global climate emergency". Mr Guterres said: "The signals of hope are multiplying.Public opinion is waking up everywhere, young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation. "More and more cities, financial institutions and businesses are committing to a 1.5C pathway ??? what is still lacking is political will. "Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people." He said that for the leaders of all countries to show "anything less" than accountability and responsibility, and a willingness to commit to ambitious targets "would be a betrayal of our entire human family and all generations to come".But he insisted his message was "one of hope, not of despair. Our war against nature must stop and we know that that is possible." Some 70 countries - many of them among the most vulnerable to climate change - have pledged to stop emitting more greenhouse gases by 2050. But some of the world's largest emitters are yet to do so. Mr Guterres said he hoped the Madrid meeting would prompt governments to aim for net-zero emissions by 2050,ahead of a deadline to do so atCOP26 in Glasgow next year. Last week, the UN's World Meteorological Organisation warned that the level of greenhouse gases had reached another all-time high, "with no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline". Four years after the Paris Agreement, negotiators are still to tackle the contentious issue of creating a worldwide market for emissions- a key element of the sixth article of the 2015 accord. "We are here to find answers for article six, not to find excuses," Mr Guterres said. While these talks represent the last chance for countries to keep the Paris Agreement aliveby firming up their targets for 2050 after a five-year grace period, the conference also marks the first since Mike Pompeo's announcement that the US would turn its back on the accord, as the US president, Donald Trump, had long threatened. The US will be represented by Marcia Bernicat, the assistant state secretary for international environmental affairs, while the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will also lead a delegation of Democratic lawmakers. The talks were initially to be hosted in Chile, butdeadly anti-government protests in itscapital, Santiago, saw the conference relocated to Spain.

African parliamentarians should speak as one to make their voice heard in climate negotiations, Arona Soumare, the African Development Bank's principal expert in climate change and green growth, said on Thursday during the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties on climate change ( COP 25 ). 'For effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, parliaments need to take strong decisions in a more concerted manner to address climate change. The commitments made must be translated into national legislative initiatives. These actions must be provided with the appropriate financial resources,' Soumare said. 'Parliaments are at the heart of the response to climate change. They must be empowered and capacitated so that their priorities in respect of financing climate mitigation and resilience can be taken into account,' he said at a parallel session of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) on the role of African parliamentarians in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The panel, organized by the African Development Bank, the PAP and the Parliamentary Assembly of Francophone Countries (APF), is taking steps to establish a framework to equip African MPs with the tools they need to implement the Paris Agreement and achieve the objectives of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The NDCs were made by signatories to the Paris Agreement reached at COP21 in 2015, in which African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate resilient and low-carbon economies. 'African parliamentarians are equal to the task and are taking their place at the forefront of this fight against climate change,' said Soumare. Currently, about 38% of financing provided by the Bank is allocated to climate-related projects and the Bank has committed to increase climate funding to $ 25 billion between 2020 and 2025. 'We will continue to mobilize more resources to address climate change,' said Soumare. Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change impacts. The President of the Pan African Parliament, Nkodo Roger Dang, said African nations had particular needs when it came to measures to combat climate change. 'There is no way that the countries of Africa can be treated in the same way as Western countries in these negotiations. They do not have the same development capacity,' he said. According to Mithika Mwenda, Executive Director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), every study comes to the same conclusion on the 'particular status' of Africa. 'We are determined to work for this status to be recognized in these negotiations,' he said. The United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 25 ) is being held in Madrid, Spain from 2 to 13 December 2019. Countries will use these sessions to negotiate more ambitious programmes to limit global warming to 1.5-degreeC, in line with the Paris Agreement.

The wave of protest that has engulfed Chile since 18 October came as a surprise to many. After all, this was supposed to be Latin America's most economically successful and politically stable country, whose democratic transition 30 years ago was a model to be followed. Chile's former president, Michelle Bachelet, a symbol of steely determination and forgiveness, today serves as the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights. Current president Sebastian Pi\'f1era tried to leverage the country's prestige to lead international efforts to reach a settlement in the Venezuelan crisis, and was preparing to host most of the world at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit and United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ). The protesters' demands are many, but can be summed up in one word - "dignity". And while it is true that the eightfold increase in GDP per capita to US$20,000 since the return to democratic rule has improved the lives of millions, it has not brought many other indicators along with it. One of the thousands of slogans seen on the streets of Santiago in recent days has been "La alegr\'eda no lleg\'f3" (happiness didn't arrive), alluding to the theme of the pro-democracy movement of the late 1980s. Social mobility, sexual and racial equality, environmental protection, secure pensions and many other conditions associated with a middle-income country do not seem to have progressed. On the other hand, one area that has seen tremendous progress is higher education, with the number of students doubling since 2005. But although the Chilean state spends about as much as France or Canada on tertiary education as a percentage of GDP, Chile's average tuition cost is one of the highest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Frustration with the high cost of education led to the student protests of 2011-13. These were nowhere nearly as sustained or violent as the current wave, but they were certainly a warning sign. And so was Pi\'f1era's reaction. Although there were some policy adjustments, Pi\'f1era's first administration sought to portray itself as a law-and-order government fighting a group of radical hotheads. Only when Bachelet ousted Pi\'f1era in the 2014 presidential election was free tuition introduced for families in the lower 50 per cent of the income distribution, rising to 60 per cent from 2018 - although the effectiveness of that policy has been questioned and it evidently has not quelled popular anger. This time round, Pi\'f1era, who was re-elected in 2018, has reacted in much the same way. The strategy failed to quell the protests last time, and seems to be failing again, even though the police response has been much more severe.

Click for more information This relationship between increased access accompanied by high costs and the resulting high levels of debt is mirrored in many aspects of life for a good portion of the Chilean population. While a not unsubstantial level of social spending has been devoted to lifting millions out of poverty, a new and expanded middle class has been left behind, saddled by debt. And although Chilean corruption is low by regional standards, a number of high-profile collusion scandals have left an impression of an out-of-control private sector, fixing prices and exploiting customers. The close ties between business and politicians, made evident in campaign financing scandals, have served only to deepen public mistrust in institutions. One of the slogans of the 2011-13 student protests called for an end to "profit". This referred specifically to the profits that many suspected were being made by private universities, despite this being illegal. Yet the slogan caught on, precisely because so many people felt that others were profiting from them. It became a code word for overall abuse. No surprise then, that a few years on, these widespread feelings of exploitation have led to the largest demonstrations in decades, and that demands for more accessible and regulated education are accompanied by calls for a higher minimum wage, better healthcare, a more balanced pensions system, the renationalisation of the water industry and, most fundamentally, a new constitution. If the academic world was one of the starting points of the current crisis, it may also offer a way out. Many Chilean academics are caught up in the fervour on the streets, yet the more cool-headed analysis and debate offered by academia offers a window of opportunity. In recent days, the government, desperate to bring an end to the protests, has announced that it will work towards the implementation of a constitutional congress. What precisely this means is still unclear, although one presumes that Pi\'f1era's goal is to channel constitutional efforts through Chile's Congress, rather than establish a special constituent assembly that many believe would result in a Venezuelan-type constitution. This is an opportunity for academics to contribute through expertise, presenting comparative international experiences and introducing authoritative and responsible creativity. For the first time since the 1970s, Chile is in a constitutional moment. It is also an academic one. Robert Funk is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Chile. \</doc>

Minister Ricardo Salles tweeted a picture of the massive meat platter on Sunday He captioned it: 'To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!'   Brazil is world's largest beef exporter and deforestation often caused by herds Came after Madrid talks failed as polluters resisted calls to stunt global warming   President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed result of COP25 talks as a 'commercial game' Brazil's environment minister has mocked climate talks with a meat platter photo after President Bolsonaro dismissed COP25 as a waste of time. Ricardo Salles, who took part in the Madrid convention, tweeted 'rich countries did not want to pay up,' before posting the shot of the rare steak last night. He captioned the image: 'To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!' Brazil is the world's number one beef exporter and deforestation is often caused by breeders who want to transform the Amazonian jungle to feed their herds. The post came after the marathon talks in the Spanish capital ended in disappointment as polluters resisted calls to help stunt global warming. Salles particularly regretted a lack of progress on carbon markets and singled out rich European nations as the players. The South American nation and Australia are among the countries that want to count carbon credits accumulated under a previous climate deal as part of their commitments under the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Salles added: 'Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of Brazil, a protectionist vision took hold, and Brazil and other countries that could provide carbon credits because of their forests and good environmental practices came out losers.' President Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change sceptic, dismissed the result of the COP25 talks as a 'commercial game'. Brazil was meant to host this year's global climate meeting but withdrew its offer more than a year ago, citing financial restrictions shortly after Bolsonaro's election. Bolsonaro said: 'I don't know why people don't understand that it's just a commercial game.' Blaming wealthy countries, he said, 'I'd like to know: has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?' Bolsonaro has been widely criticised for easing restrictions on exploiting the Amazon's vast riches, leading to accelerated deforestation. The Marathon UN climate talks ended with a slim compromise that sparked widespread disappointment. Major polluters resisted calls for ramping up efforts to keep global warming at bay and negotiators postponed debate about rules for international carbon markets until COP26 in Glasgow next year. Organisers kept delegates from almost 200 nations in Madrid far beyond Friday's scheduled close of the two-week talks. In the end, negotiators endorsed a general call for greater efforts to tackle climate change and several measures to help poor countries respond and adapt to its impacts. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was 'disappointed' by the meeting's outcome. 'The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,' he said. 'We must not give up and I will not give up.' The final declaration cited an 'urgent need' to cut planet-heating greenhouse gases in line with the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord. But it fell far short of explicitly demanding that countries submit bolder emissions proposals next year, which developing countries and environmentalists had demanded. The Paris accord established a common goal of keeping temperature increases below 2C, ideally 1.5C by the end of the century. So far, the world is on course for a 3- to 4-C rise, with potentially dramatic consequences for many countries, including rising sea levels and fiercer storms. After two nights of fractious negotiations, delegates in Madrid decided to defer some of the thorniest issues to the next UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Chile's Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who chaired the meeting, said she was 'sad' no deal had been reached on the rules for international trading in carbon emissions permits. 'We were on the verge,' she said, adding that the goal was to establish markets that are 'robust and environmentally sustainable.' Economists say putting a price on carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, and allowing countries or companies to trade emissions permits, will encourage the shift to away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Some observers welcomed the failure of a deal on carbon markets, though, and the European Union and developing countries had said beforehand that no deal was better than a bad one. Helen Mountford, from the environmental think-tank World Resources Institute, said that 'given the high risks of loopholes discussed in Madrid, it was better to delay than accept rules that would have compromised the integrity of the Paris Agreement.' The talks in Spain took place against a backdrop of growing worldwide concern about climate change. The past year saw large protests in hundreds of cities around the globe and climate activists staged several rallies inside and outside the conference venue to express their frustration at the slow pace of the talks. The meeting was moved from Chile's capital Santiago to Madrid at a month's due to violent protests against the Chilean government, which was under pressure to deliver a positive result. Countries agreed four years ago to funnel $100billion per year by 2020 to assist developing nations, but so far nowhere near that amount has been raised. Under the Paris accord, countries are supposed to regularly review their national emissions reduction targets and increase them if necessary. Last week, the European Union agreed a goal of becoming carbon neutral by mid-century, but the move did little to sway discussions in Madrid about setting more ambitious targets in the medium term, an issue that will be on the agenda again in Glasgow. The US will be excluded from much of those talks after President Donald Trump announced the country's withdrawal from the Paris accord, a process than comes into force November 4, 2020. 'The global emissions' curve needs to bend in 2020,' said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research near Berlin. 'Emissions need to be cut half by 2030, and net zero emissions need to be a reality by 2050,' he said. 'Achieving this is possible - with existing technologies and within our current economy. The window of opportunity is open, but barely.' \</doc>

NICOLA Sturgeon is a skilled practitioner of the art of HYPERLINK www.grievance.No matter the issue, the First Minister can be relied upon to explain that Scotland has been ignored or disrespected. Her exhausting instinct to take offence on behalf of Scotland means that successive UK Prime Ministers have worn kid gloves whenever dealing with her. And so it is certainly refreshing that Boris Johnson has refused to play that game. The Prime Minister has been combative, ramping up attacks on the SNP and being confrontational in his approach to dealing with the Scottish Government. There will be many who believe such a change in tone is long overdue. The SNP's feverish desire for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom is, after all, supported only by a minority. And so the Prime Minister can be confident that, when he challenges the SNP, he will be speaking for the majority who would very much like to move on from the constitutional battle that the Nationalists continue to wage. But some Scottish Conservative politicians are concerned that the Prime Minister risks playing into the SNP's hands. If he is wise, Mr Johnson will heed their warnings. Picking a fight, for example, over Miss Sturgeon's right to attend a United Nations climate change conference Former Prime Minister David Cameron was no admirer of the SNP leader or her predecessor, Alex Salmond. But he understood their tactics and sought to charm rather than attack during his dealings with them. Many Scots will cheer on the Prime Minister as he takes off the gloves and takes the fight for the Union to the SNP. But Boris Johnson must pick his battles carefully, lest he feeds the Nationalists' hunger for grievance. \</doc>

Three decades ago, renewable energy was considered too futuristic. The idea of plugging a car into a wall socket was unthinkable. Today, both these things are a reality. And renewable energy is expected to attract $ 2.3 trillion in investment this year. The same will be true in the next phase of the world's response to climate change for adaptation, said Luc Gnacadja, chair of the recently formed interim Executive Committee of the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism (ABM). 'ABM is groundbreaking. The continent where ABM should start is rightfully Africa, because it has the highest vulnerability, the poorest communities and the most development challenges, while having benefitted least from climate finance. I hope that COP 25 recognizes its importance and gives it a place in the implementation of the Paris Agreement as the only cooperative approach for adaptation proposed so far,' Gnacadja told delegates at the COP 25 climate conference in Madrid. The ABM aims to mobilize public and private sector finance to assist developing countries with meeting climate change needs for adaptation set out in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, in particular those requiring international cooperation. 'The design of the ABM methodologies and theory of change must be welcoming for SMEs and micro enterprises. Despite the focus on Africa, the ABM EC will seriously consider opening its services to the rest of the world during the pilot phase, as there is already interest from other regions and ABM is potentially applicable in all countries,' Gnacadja said. The African Development Bank established the interim Executive Committee of the ABM on 4 October. The ABM Executive Committee had adopted an ambitious work plan for 2020, prioritizing guidance on methodologies to determine adaptation benefits and incremental costs of ABM projects. 'Giving monetary value to adaptation will go a long way to crowding in investments that will increasingly build resilience in least developed countries and small island developing states in Africa,' said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth after the session. The African Development Bank's financing for climate mitigation and adaptation action reached parity in 2018, a first among development finance institutions. This demonstrates client responsiveness to adaptation investments when incentives are right, he added.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called on Iran on Monday to cooperate immediately and fully with the IAEA and provide prompt access to locations which it has refused to let Agency inspectors visit. 'The Agency has identified a number of questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three locations that have not been declared by Iran,' Mr Grossi said in his first address to the Agency's Board of Governors as Director General. 'The Agency sought access to two of the locations. Iran has not provided access to these locations and has not engaged in substantive discussions to clarify the Agency's questions. This is adversely affecting the Agency's ability to clarify and resolve these questions and to provide credible assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. I call on Iran to cooperate immediately and fully with the Agency, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified by the Agency.' Mr Grossi, who took up office in December, presented two Iran-related reports to the Board. One concerned Iran's implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed between world powers and Iran in 2015. The other describes the Agency's efforts to clarify information relating to the correctness and completeness of Iran's declarations under its Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol with the IAEA. Referring to JCPOA implementation, Mr Grossi noted Iran's announcement on January 5th that its nuclear programme would no longer be 'subject to any restrictions in the operational sphere.' 'To date, the Agency has not observed any changes to Iran's implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA in connection with this announcement, or in the level of cooperation by Iran in relation to Agency verification and monitoring activities under the JCPOA,' he said. 'The Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement. Evaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran continue,' Mr Grossi added. The IAEA continues to monitor the nuclear programme of North Korea, also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, using open source information and satellite imagery. IAEA inspectors were required to leave the country in 2009. 'We are investing considerable effort in ensuring that we are ready to resume verification of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear programme if a political agreement is reached among countries concerned,' Mr Grossi said. 'If and when such an agreement is achieved, we will be ready to deploy our inspectors from day one. The Agency will have an indispensable role to play.' Coronavirus The Director General began his statement by outlining measures the Agency was taking to help countries address the coronavirus COVID-19. 'The IAEA is not a specialized health Agency and has no role in controlling the disease,' he said. 'But we do have expertise and experience that help in detecting outbreaks of certain viral diseases and in diagnosing them.' Scientists from countries concerned will be offered training in a nuclear-derived technique known as RT-PCR, which makes it possible to identify the virus accurately within hours, as well as RT-PCR machines and biosafety equipment to ensure safe handling of samples. Support for international efforts to control the disease will remain a priority as long as the outbreak persists, Mr Grossi added. Mr Grossi updated the Board on progress in the modernization of the IAEA nuclear applications in Seibersdorf, near Vienna. He announced plans to construct a new building to house four laboratories that have still to be renovated. The modernization project will improve the IAEA's capacity to support Member States in the use of nuclear techniques in food and agriculture, human health and the environment, as well as the use of new nuclear scientific instruments. Mr Grossi also announced a new initiative to encourage more women to study nuclear science and technology. The IAEA Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme will provide scholarships and internships to successful candidates. Nuclear energy Noting that his first foreign trip as Director General had been to the COP 25 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December, Mr Grossi said he sensed that 'the Agency is now being listened to on the benefits of nuclear technology in a way that was not the case in the past. I intend to ensure that our voice is heard.' He announced that the IAEA's annual Scientific Forum in September will focus this year on the ways in which nuclear energy can contribute to meeting climate change goals. 'Whether or not to use nuclear power is a sovereign decision for each individual country. But it is an indisputable scientific fact that nuclear power has an important role to play in curbing greenhouse gas emissions,' he said.

A Motherwell wedding cake designer is raising awareness of climate change and urging couples to think about the environment when planning their big day. Marie-Clare Cake Designs unveiled the four-tier masterpieces at The Scottish Wedding Show last weekend, highlighting a growing trend in sustainable wedding options. Each of Marie-Clare's cakes reflects on some of the key issues surrounding climate change: plastic pollution; the effects of climate change on rural communities and tribes; global warming and deforestation. She could hardly have a more fitting location for her unveiling with the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference being held this November at the same location as the wedding show, the Scottish Event Campus. Marie-Clare Martin, owner of Marie-Clare Cake Designs, said: "Every year we do something extravagant with our cakes for The Scottish Wedding Show, and with the UN Climate Change Conference coming to Glasgow later this year, we wanted to use our platform to draw attention to this global crisis. Each of the cakes tackles an important issue associated with climate change. "Our fire cake acknowledges the terrible Australian bush fires and the sea cake shows how plastic is polluting the oceans and killing our marine wildlife. "We also wanted to draw attention to the brutal repercussions of droughts and unfarmable conditions on rural communities and tribes as well as the beautiful wild creatures that are going extinct such as the now-extinct Spix's Macaw." The cakes are the latest in a series of grand designs by the award-winning cake company, which follows sustainable business practices, including using locally sourced organic ingredients and incorporating a 'no-waste, must-recycle' scheme in the shop. Marie-Clare added: "As a business we're trying to do our bit to be more environmentally friendly and encourage our customers to be more aware of sustainability when planning their weddings. "We've switched to using wax paper instead of cling-film and always recycle materials where possible." \</doc>

Efforts to transform the food system and tackle the impact of food production on climate took centre stage at the UN climate change conference, COP25 , in Chile this week. But while various actors were keen to flag the work already being undertaken, the need to deliver 'radical transformational change' was high on the agenda. Transforming the agri-food chain must be one of the \' main elements\' of solving the climate crisis, Gonzalo Mu\'f1oz, the Chilean high level climate champion for COP25 , argued at yesterday\' s roundtable event focused on the food chain.  We as humankind must deliver a hunger-free, resilient and prosperous 1.5 net zero world by 2050,  he told representatives from business, governments and civil society at the event. Mu\'f1oz argued that there is a need to connect climate action with \' social justice\' , economic impact, the degradation of ecosystems and human health.  This agenda must deliver not only environmental justice but social justice to many areas in the world where the climate crisis is affecting billions.  This agenda also tackles health. It is not only about malnutrition but also obesity We have to incorporate nutrition, knowing when we talk about nutrition we have to talk about hygienic elements bringing safe food products to people that are far from where they are produced. We have to talk about packaging That is an extreme challenge.  Martin Frick, senior director at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), left the audience with no uncertainty as to the scale of the challenge.  If you take everything together I would dare say we are close to 40% of the emissions if we really factor in everything that is related to food. It\' s not just the 20% related to agriculture, \~ Frick\~stressed. Mu\'f1oz nevertheless sounded an upbeat note, arguing that we have the tools at our disposal to address the climate impact of food.  This is something that can be solved and also is somehow being solved We have concrete and strong evidence of what can be done and is already happening related to how food can bring solutions to solve this crisis but at the same time delivering bright jobs and justice to the world, to plates.  The world\' s third-largest emitter: Food waste The climate champion highlighted the potential for development he sees in urban agriculture and circular economy models. For Christine Moseley, founder and CEO of Full Harvest, circular economy solutions will be key to tackling one of the world\' s largest carbon emitters: food waste. According to data from the UN\' s FAO, each year the world wastes one-third of the food produced \- around 1.3 billion tonnes. If food waste were a country, it would be the world\' s third largest emitter behind only the USA and China. Full Harvest is one of the companies working to find a solution. The company has developed a B2B marketplace that connects surplus or \' imperfect\' produce that would be rejected by the supermarkets to buyers in the food and beverage industry.  We solve this as a tech company and an innovation company,  Moseley told delegates.  It is a win-win for everybody. Buyers save money for more affordable healthy food products, get produce direct from farms, help solve food waste and have a digitised supply chain. Growers incrementally improve their business through increased revenue streams.  Diversifying diets through innovation: The case of quinoa\~\~ Nearly half of the calories consumed globally come from just three crops \- rice, wheat and maize \- according to the World Economic Forum. Only around 170 crops globally are grown on a commercial scale. But crop diversification could be leveraged to help build a food system that is more resilient in the face of climate change. Many traditional crops have climate-resistant properties. For example, cactus pear grows in deserts and arid areas, while oca and quinoa survive at high altitudes. Tarcila Rivera Zea, director of Chirapaq and member of the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues, spoke of how her organisation is promoting the development of the quinoa market in Andes, Mexico, by taking \' indigenous knowledge\' to \' produce healthy food recuperate indigenous biodiversity and improve resistance against climate change\' . The challenge, she said, is that quinoa does not fetch a high enough price on the global market. The solution is innovation, Rivera Zea believes.  We are trying to transform quinoa by making, for example, desserts. In the past, we use quinoa in its natural form. But we need technology to innovate and use this product better to continue producing healthy agriculture and have opportunity to sell at the proper and just price.  It is a challenge for us to give value to this kind of food and invest in innovations.  Impossible Foods: 'Product innovation must be included in sustainable food systems' Animal agriculture for meat, eggs and milk generates 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Increased adoption of plant alternatives will be \' necessary\' for the food system to scale production to meet the needs of a growing world population, Moses argued.  Plant-based meat is going to be and must be one of the many tools alleviating climate issues and scaling up our food system.  Why is that? We need to spare land and prevent the expansion of the agricultural footprint, to capture carbon and prevent biodiversity loss and loss of ecosystem services. We need to avoid emissions directly and reduce reliance as demand scales up by as much as 88%. Incremental yield improvements will not be enough.  Impossible\' s plant-based innovation is critical because it enables consumers to switch to a more plant-based diet without challenging the dominant food culture, she suggested.  We cannot expect consumer behaviour to change or to obtain from delicious products they have enjoyed for a very long time. Product innovation has to be included in these new resilient food systems while including farmers in these food value chains.  These transitions are necessary to leapfrog the negative climate and ecosystem service externalities that will occur with a growing population.  Farmers, smallholders and 'climate smart' agriculture Taking a systems approach to the food sector\' s climate impact requires the industry to tackle on-farm emissions \- including those produced by smallholders and family farms.  We really have to understand farmers in a different way, in particular family and smallholder farmers, because these are the people who keep our life support intact. If we just pay them by the food they are producing we are missing the point,  UNFCCC\' s Frick stressed. Organisations working with farmers worldwide are attempting to support knowledge sharing and the adoption of best-practice. For example, Theo De Jager, president of the World Farmers Organisation, said the group wants to develop a \' climate smart agricultural manual'. De Jager explained the WFO is talking to farmers globally, asking \' what can you do on your farm to deliver sustainable food chains and what will it take to get it done?\' But Andrew Cox, from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, stressed that these developments are struggling to produce transformative change at scale.  We have to be very honest that things aren\' t working in the way they need to. We have seen hunger rise for 3 years in a row. We are seeing climate change wreaking havoc on the ground among farmers. \' There are some really uncomfortable realities\' In a similar vein, David Navarro, strategic director of Skills, Systems and Synergies for Sustainable Development (4SD) and professor of global health, Imperial College London, stressed that the size of the change needed and the progress made should not be over-stated.  There are some really uncomfortable realities about what is happening now Business as usual is not any good anymore. Unconventional solutions are necessary from new ways of agriculture through to alternatives like Impossible burgers.  Navarro said that a theme that must be carried into future discussions around food and climate, including the 2021 UN's Food System Summit, is \' how we frame\' the work being undertaken.  There is a choice. Is the framing one that goes for new ways of doing things but within existing political structures in governments, institutions and businesses? Or is the new way of doing things one that is specifically prepared to contemplate radical structural change with the purpose of safeguarding the future for current generations and promoting equity and justice? That is a real choice for all of us.  Nobody leaving this room should feel any comfort at all because the power structures are not right.  \</doc>

The First Minister has visited Brussels to discuss the future of Scotland's relationship with the EU in the wake of Brexit. She will also speak about her vision for the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference - COP 26 - which takes place in Glasgow in November. The SNP leader has made it clear she would want a future Scottish state to join the EU if a majority of Scots were ever to vote for independence at any IndyRef2. READ MORE: 'Scotland can find its way home to the European Union' In a Scotsman column published on Brexit Day, Ms Sturgeon said: "Make no mistake, Brexit threatens to make us poorer." She added: "It poses a direct risk to jobs, prosperity and investment - and, under Boris Johnson's Government, we are poised to see a dangerous divergence from the EU on vital issues such as environmental protection, food standards and workers' rights." Donald Tusk, the former EU President, raised eyebrows in Westminster last week when he claimed an independent Scotland would receive an "enthusiastic" reception if it sought to rejoin the EU. That prompted a stern rebuke from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who hinted that it may encourage other "secessionist" movements in Europe. "I think it was frankly un-European and irresponsible given the secessionist, separatist tendencies in Spain, France and Italy," he said. Fabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the EPC, said in a social media post last week that he was looking forward to welcoming the First Minister to Brussels. He later added: "To many of those who responded to this tweet: I don't care what side you are on but abuse is not an argument, vitriol is not witty and prejudice simply discredits anything you are saying. As for threats, don't bother. Note to Brexiteers: you have no leverage to tell EU what to do." \</doc>

Former prime minister David Cameron has turned down an offer from Boris Johnson to head the UK's preparations for a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow, it is claimed. The current PM asked his predecessor to be the president of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) but was rejected, the Daily Telegraph reported. According to The Times, former Tory leader William Hague was also sounded out for the presidency. The disclosure comes after Mr Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job during the event's launch on Tuesday. Former clean growth minister Claire O'Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, was sacked as president of the talks by the PM's special adviser, Dominic Cummings, on Friday. The Government said the post would be a ministerial role in future. The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris Agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science now clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries - at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations. ``My understanding is that he felt it was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role,'' he told BBC Two's Newsnight. \</doc>

The date has been confirmed for a mass rally for UK agriculture which is expected to bring busloads of farmers from across the country to central London. The rally will take place on Wednesday, 25 March, at the QEII centre in Westminster, NFU president Minette Batters has confirmed. The QEII centre can hold 1,200 people \'e2 and Ms Batters said she expected it to be full at what was an \'e2 unprecedented moment\'e2 for agriculture. See also: Thousands of farmers to rally for UK agriculture \'e2 We will be taking over the QEII centre at Westminster \'e2 we will have tractors outside, we will have branding outside,\'e2 she said. The rally will highlight the importance of the sector \'e2 in terms of high-quality food production, the environment and mitigating climate change. Positive message \'e2 This is not a protest, this is not a blockade, this is not a march,\'e2 Ms Batters said. \'e2 It is a mass rally to show ambition \'e2 that we want to be global leaders, we want to be the most sustainable farmers in the world.\'e2 Farmers would be bussed in from across the country to attend the rally, Ms Batters told an NFU council meeting on Tuesday (28 January) at Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire. The government had a \'e2 massive opportunity\'e2 to set the agenda for agriculture ahead of the 2020 United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow this autumn, she added. But government ministers also faced serious questions over their intentions for British growers and livestock producers. Food standards The fundamental question was whether the government would require food imports to meet the same production standards as British food. \'e2 We want the [UK agriculture] brand to be built on integrity and standards,\'e2 Ms Batters said. The NFU says it is vital that the efforts of British farmers are not undermined by food imports produced using methods that would be illegal in the UK. Growers and livestock producers will lobby their MPs after the rally, which is being held on the same day as Prime Minister's Questions. \</doc>

EXTINCTION Rebellion has revealed its grand plan for 2020, admitting "mistakes" in the past and inviting supporters to contribute to specific policy demands and dates for its next official rebellion. In an Action Strategy Update for the new year, the environmental campaigners set out a "new way forward" for their movement and more training for activists. "This is the year," they claim. "The decisions made over the next 12 months," the document intones, " will define the future of our world." XR has previously been criticised for vague policy goals, and it seems it plans to change this with a "People's Demand" of the new Government, to be finalised in the next few weeks. "It's time to make specific demands, on a local, regional and national level," it says. "It could be to demand an immediate moratorium on airport expansion, an end to all fossil-fuel subsidies, a permanent ban on coal - but most importantly it will be up to the movement to decide," the note reads. In October, XR protesters who climbed on top of trains in east London were attacked by commuters trying to get to work. With regret for the "mistakes", XR admits: "Our tactics struggled to cut through," blaming "increased opposition from the media, police and our Government". XR plans to equip new supporters to avoid similar mistakes. "This year we must train and empower more rebels than ever before" it says. "Rebellion is a way of life, not just a one-off event." Key for the movement is the United Nations Climate Change conference in Glasgow in November. XR calls this "one of the world order's last chances to avert the worst consequences of ecological breakdown" and says: "We must be there in our droves." \</doc>

Chile's president Sebastian Pinera has cancelled the APEC trade summit and pulled out of hosting a major environment conference as his embattled government struggles to HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/23/chile-president-announces-reforms-bid-stem-deadly-street-violence/ handle more than a week of volatile unrest .\~ Mr Pinera made the announcement on Wednesday during the 12th day of widespread protests over inequality and police violence, which have seen at least 20 people killed and more than 6,000 arrested. The president said it was a "very difficult decision". He added it "causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP 25 for Chile and for the world."\~ The APEC summit was due to bring 20 world leaders to Chile on November 16 to 17, including Donald Trump, the US president, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.\~ Mr Trump said he had expected to sign a "phase one" deal with his Chinese counterpart. The climate change conference was scheduled for 2 to 13 December; and the decision could risk disrupting international efforts to address climate change. Just six days ago Teodoro Ribera, Chile's foreign minister, had said there was "no chance" the riots and demonstrations would derail the two conferences.\~ The protests were sparked by a student campaign against a 30 peso rise in Santiago's metro fares two weeks ago. But since then, Chileans across the country have taken to the streets against economic and social inequality, including the almost complete privatisation of healthcare and education, alongside poor pensions and stagnant wages.\~ Many of the demonstrations have been brutally repressed by armed forces, while others have been tainted by vandalism and looting.\~ The announcement comes as NGOs and the UN's human rights commission begin to investigate allegations of abuse and sexual violence against demonstrators in Chile.\~ Mr Pinera had tried to quell the unrest by announcing new social reforms and lifting the state of emergency, but demonstrations continued in full force, with many now calling for a new constitution.\~ Marieke Riethof, a senior lecturer in Latin American politics at the University of Liverpool said: "The decision to cancel the APEC summit and COP25 clearly reflects the government's concerns that the protests would disrupt these meetings." The UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the organisation is "currently exploring alternative hosting options." \</doc>

The world of COP is divided on economic and geographic faultlines. On one side is the global south, which lacks the resources to pick itself up after every new disaster brought on by the climate crisis; at the same time, dissent there is violently quelled. On the other lie northern countries such as the UK, which announced " HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/15/cop25-un-climate-talks-over-for-another-year-was-anything-achieved net-zero by 2050 " plans, by which time many current politicians will not be alive and mega-cities such as Mumbai will be under water. On both sides of the divide, pro-fossil fuel leaders on the right have come to power. This COP pointed to deepening fissures in old blocs, as real-time climate risks widened the rift.

I took pictures with the neon Gandhi in India's massive greenwashing pavilion to send to environmentalists back home. Does the world still need COPs or could they be replaced by an intergovernmental Slack chat? COP25 should have been about welcoming new science, clearing unfinished business on climate finance, and raising trust and ambition. While there were wins on gender, agriculture and capacity building, this became a carryover COP, with decisions around carbon markets unclear, leaving old hostilities and glaring loopholes to sort through next year, an outcome even Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/15/cop25-un-climate-talks-over-for-another-year-was-anything-achieved expressed disappointment with We're now just days away from 2020, when all countries must sit together to communicate and review all that they've done so far and all they can do under their commitments to the Paris agreement. This offers countries a last chance to "update" their national climate pledges to "reflect [each country's] highest possible ambition" before 2025, a time by which we would have blown through more of our carbon budget. What happens at COP26 in Glasgow next year will determine if nations have a reason to stay in the Paris deal at all. But dysfunctional as they are, COPs are perhaps the only international legal forum that are partly open to observers to witness geopolitics and global call-out culture first-hand.

December 15, 2019 Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy at Ceres, released this statement following the closing of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid ( COP25 ) on Sunday. Inside and outside the halls of COP25 , investors, companies and leaders from a cross-section of society sent a clarion call to global governments: Close the ambition gap and step up climate action. Unfortunately, the results of the just-concluded negotiations do no such thing, coming nowhere close to the speed and scale the Paris Agreement demands. Investors, companies, cities and states in the U.S. and beyond are stepping up to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and aiming for net-zero emissions before 2050. National governments must do the same, both at home and through shared implementation of the Paris Agreement. History will judge harshly the failure of global governments to take action at the pace and scale required, particularly the federal government of the United States -- the country that has produced more climate change-causing pollution than any other. \</doc>

Young activists have been quizzing Pontypridd's General Election candidates about how they would tackle the climate emergency. With the looming General Election, climate activists, including representatives from Young Friends of the Earth Pontypridd and the University of South Wales Earth Society, held their monthly march through the town recently and were joined by those hoping to be MPs. The regular march is part of the worldwide Strike4Climate and Fridays4theFuture movement founded by Greta Thunberg to demand urgent, radical action from governments to address the climate emergency. Local young people used the November strike to show election candidates that they want them to focus on climate change. The vote will take place between 7am and 10pm on Thursday, December 12 with results expected on Friday morning to see who will replace Owen Smith of Labour, who is standing down. Here are the questions they asked the candidates and the answers they got: Flur Elin of Plaid Cymru The question put to Plaid Cymru's candidate Flur Elin was: "Wales was the first country to declare a climate emergency. How will your party stop a catastrophe" Ms Elin said: "We'll stop the climate catastrophe by becoming carbon neutral and zero waste by 2030. "Our trinity is zero poverty, zero waste and zero carbon in order to stop the climate emergency. "This is the biggest crisis of our time. It's a challenge but it's also an opportunity for Wales." Sam Trask of the Conservative Party The Conservative candidate Sam Trask was asked if he would rather get Brexit done or save the planet. Mr Trask replied: "The thing is Brexit is something that's very much for the short-term and a majority Conservative government will get Brexit done. "But saving the planet I think is even more important. It's going to take very much a longer time and it's going to require people from every political party to come together and do it." Alex Davies-Jones of the Labour Party Alex Davies-Jones of Labour who is also an RCT councillor, was also asked if she would rather get Brexit done or save the planet. Cllr Davies-Jones replied: "Absolutely no question, we need to save our planet. "That is the most important thing facing our communities, our planet and all of us at the minute. "The climate emergency needs to be tackled so definitely that." Mike Powell standing as an independent Mike Powell, independent who is also an RCT councillor, was asked the question: "Animals are becoming extinct all the time. How are you going to stop this from happening" Cllr Powell said: "One of the best ways to stop animals becoming extinct is obviously to ban the importation of ivory and those sorts of things. "But an even more important one is to actually eradicate third world debt. "Because you've got a lot of poorer countries on the planet who borrowed money and they're paying that money back in interest and to do that they're actually destroying their environment to provide themselves with income." Sue Prior standing as an independent Sue Prior, who is standing as an independent, was asked if she would rather get Brexit done or save our planet. She said: "I'd like to do both. Because I think that until there is some certainty for the country with Brexit we really can't get anything done can we" Jonathan Bishop standing as a "non-party" candidate Jonathan Bishop who is standing as a no party candidate is a community councillor for Taffs Well and Nantgarw. Speaking after the march, he said: "I am the councillor for Nantgarw and convinced councillors to declare a climate change emergency. "Councillors have made a commitment to car sharing and we are looking at installing planters and trees at land at Tawelfryn. "We are also investigating other ways to improve biodiversity so my opponents may walk and talk on climate change but I've actually been doing something while in office." Steve Bayliss of the Brexit Party Steve Bayliss of the Brexit Party was contacted for comment. The views of the young people marching The November youth strike was also part of a global moment of solidarity to ramp up the pressure ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 currently taking place in Madrid. Young people from Pontypridd wanted to make sure their local community had the opportunity to make their voices heard. Ewan from Young Friends of the Earth said: "I'm striking because I'm worried about our future." Rowan said: "I'm striking because I don't want global warming to carry on like this." Jessica Smith is from the University of South Wales Earth Society. She said: "Climate change affects every part of the world, even small home towns like Pontypridd. "It's important to me to support strikes and take part to show everyone that we mean business and we need change. This goes beyond my own personal climate anxiety now, I want my politicians to cease funding into fossil fuels and make a green revolution a law." As well as taking part in Strike4Climate action, members of Young Friends of the Earth are taking practical steps to make their local community a greener place. They have organised a vegan cake sale to raise money for bee friendly planting, have planted up a community bed in Ynysangharad War Memorial Park, taken part in local litter-picking events and run a Christmas craft stall at St Catherine's Church to show others how to make decorations out of recycled materials. \</doc>

"Dead zones" are rapidly appearing in the world's oceans as they lose oxygen at an unprecedented rate due to climate change, sewage pollution and farming practices, presenting an existential threat to marine life and ecosystems, according to a vast new study. The overall level of oxygen in the oceans has dropped by roughly 2 per cent, while the number of known hypoxic "dead zones" - where oxygen levels are dangerously low - has skyrocketed from 45 known sites in the 1960s to at least 700 areas now dangerously devoid of the life-giving compound, some encompassing thousands of square miles. Many larger and more active sea creatures, like sharks, marlins and tuna, HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gulf-mexico-dead-zone-pollution-fertiliser-mississippi-marine-life-a8955296.html are unable to survive in these areas "This is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call from the uncontrolled experiment humanity is unleashing on the world's oceans as carbon emissions continue to increase," said Dan Laffoley, co-editor of the report. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) study is the largest ever analysis of the causes and impacts of ocean deoxygenation, which the organisation describes as "one of the most pernicious, yet under-reported side-effects of human-induced climate change". The study was presented at the UN's climate conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, which has been described as signatories' last chance to ensure the Paris agreement's aim to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels remains achievable. World leaders and delegates are trying to establish new international rules for emissions trading and broker systems of compensation for poorer countries bearing the brunt of climate breakdown, with many countries needing to hash out the details of targets set for 2030 and 2050 before the five-year grace period ends in 2020. "To curb ocean oxygen loss alongside the other disastrous impacts of climate change, world leaders must commit to immediate and substantial emission cuts," said IUCN acting director general, Dr Grethel Aguilar. COP25 ] are even more crucial." While an overall drop of 2 per cent may sound insignificant, some of the world's most productive areas of flora and fauna are formed by ocean currents, rich in nutrients but low in oxygen - meaning these vital hubs of life are particularly vulnerable to even small changes in ocean oxygen levels. Impacts to these currents "will ultimately ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people", the IUCN said in a statement, adding that the loss of oxygen "is starting to progressively alter the balance of life" as species incapable of surviving such conditions die out. The level of oxygen loss already recorded is significant enough to affect the planetary cycling of elements such as nitrogen and phosphorous, which are "essential for life on Earth", Dr Laffoley told The New York Times. While the introduction of too many nutrients that enter the ocean via farming and pollution are contributing to the oceans' deoxygenation, the most significant factor is global warming. The temperature of the oceans has broken records nearly every year over the past two decades, while the rate of ocean warming is equivalent to five Hiroshima-size atomic bombs exploding every second, Dr John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences, HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gulf-mexico-dead-zone-pollution-fertiliser-mississippi-marine-life-a8955296.html wrote in January . This has drastic implications for the rate of global warming as a whole. So far, oceans have acted as a buffer, absorbing more than 90 per cent of the heat associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change protesters glue themselves to Lib Dem electric bus If the heat absorbed by the oceans since 1955 had gone into the lower levels of the atmosphere instead, land temperatures would be 36C warmer, Dr Laffoley said. As the oceans heat up, they expand, meaning oceanic heating bears more responsibility for sea level rise than https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gulf-mexico-dead-zone-pollution-fertiliser-mississippi-marine-life-a8955296.html melting ice caps. In addition, the oceans absorb nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions, but studies have shown this process slows as they grow hotter, leaving more heat-inducing emissions in the atmosphere. While seemingly fortunate for life on land, this absorption has resulted in the acidification of the ocean, which is now thought to be 26 per cent more acidic than in pre-industrial times. The report finds that oceans are now expected to lose between 3 and 4 per cent of their oxygen by 2100. But the kilometre closest to the water's surface, where many species are concentrated, will be more negatively impacted than deeper areas, which are less rich in life. "Urgent global action to overcome and reverse the effects of ocean deoxygenation is needed," said IUCN global marine and polar programme director Minna Epps. "Decisions taken at the ongoing climate conference will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly, progressively and irrevocably lost." \</doc>

Photo credit: Adobe Stock COP25 , David Sassoli said, "We urge those Member States that have not yet done so to increase their contributions to the Green Climate Fund and to support the establishment of a European Climate Bank." The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established by the United Nations to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter climate change. On Wednesday Parliament's environment and public health committee will vote on the assembly's draft objectives for the next "global actions" to fight climate change. RELATED CONTENT European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off Climate change now an 'emergency' says former European commissioner Miguel Ca\'f1ete: Leaders of EU cities and regions must 'lead by example' on climate Finland kicks off EU presidency on green note Disappointment reigns after EU summit fails to deliver on carbon neutrality goal Commission 'failing' to monitor its sustainable development activities, says EU auditors European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has put climate at the top of her agenda, saying she wants the European Green Deal to become "Europe's hallmark." She has tasked senior commissioner Frans Timmermans with overseeing Europe's goal of achieving climate neutrality by mid-century. Timmermans, who is currently serving as first deputy to outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, will also be the Commission's head of climate action, taking over duties from Spain's Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete. Speaking recently, von der Leyen said, "At the heart of the new Commission is our commitment to becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent." "Countries have a number of opportunities ahead to step up and put money on the table soon, including COP25 " Wendel Trio, CAN Europe Director COP25 will gather 25,000 people from some 200 countries and the summit is expected to attract worldwide attention. The unprecedented global mobilisations and strikes for climate taking place this year following activist Greta Thunberg's movement Fridays for Future have placed the climate change debate on top of the public agenda. COP25 The event normally takes between one and two years of preparation, but the Spanish capital has less than four weeks to face the logistical challenge of the most important event of the year to provide solutions to the global climate crisis. Meanwhile, environment groups are, like Sassoli, asking Member States to step up contributions to the GCF. Seven European countries recently confirmed their commitment to double their previous contributions to the Fund, but some other European governments have been accused of "continuing to dodge their responsibility." Luxembourg confirmed the doubling of its previous pledge to the GCF, adding to similar commitments by the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Denmark made earlier. "While the EU's ambitious message for the upcoming COP25 summit is important, it is meaningless without the means" Iratxe Garc\'eda P\'e9rez, S&D leader Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe says that, in contrast, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Switzerland pledged "well below expectations" while Spain, the Netherlands and Austria have made "underwhelming commitments." Many European countries, especially in Central and Eastern Europe have failed to make any contributions so far, says the group. "They also have an important role to play and should be coming forward with generous contributions," it said in a statement. CAN Europe director Wendel Trio said, "An ambitious replenishment of the GCF now would boost the potential of developing countries to up their climate targets. Governments have little time left to deliver new, higher targets, as in the Paris Agreement they committed to do so by 2020." "Countries have a number of opportunities ahead to step up and put money on the table soon, including COP25 ." Elsewhere, Spanish MEP Iratxe Garc\'eda P\'e9rez, leader of the Socialists and Democrats in the Parliament, said, "While the EU's ambitious message for the upcoming COP25 summit is important, it is meaningless without the means." The co-chairs of the European Green Party Reinhard B\'fctikofer and Monica Frassoni, added, "As Greens, we will continue to push the boundaries of the politically possible ahead of the crucial COP25 summit." "As Greens, we will continue to push the boundaries of the politically possible ahead of the crucial COP25 summit" Reinhard B\'fctikofer and Monica Frassoni, co-chairs of the European Green Party In a recent resolution, MEPs said more should be done to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. They said that in order to achieve this goal "in the most cost-efficient manner", the 2030 ambition level will need to be raised. MEPs asked national, regional and local governments, as well as the EU, to take "concrete and swift action" in order not to overshoot the 1.5\'b0C climate limit. The resolution reads, "The EU must therefore send a clear message that it stands ready to review its contribution to the Paris Agreement." It also voices support for the demonstrations, in particular in the form of climate marches and school strikes, "that are raising awareness of these climate risks." \</doc>

Welcome to The Big Questions. Today we're live from the Oasis Academy MediaCityUK in Salford. Welcome, everybody, to The Big Questions. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, declared that 2020 would be a "defining year of climate action" for the planet. The UK Citizen's Climate Assembly has its second meeting this weekend to consider how the UK will meet and producers alike, grants towards buying electric cars are likely to be scrapped by the end of March, while at the same time the government is bringing forward a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040 to 2035. And the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference - COP26 - to be held in Glasgow this November, still doesn't have anyone willing to chair it. The list of those who have turned it down so far reads like a Who's Who of British politics. There are confusing choices facing every one of us. Free capitalist societies thrive on choice. Will capitalism save the planet? Matthew from the Adam Smith Institute, I'm going to start with the words of the profit, if I may, David Attenborough. He said, anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in a finite environment is either a madman or an economist. You are an economist. It can't happen, it's impossible. It defies logic. In 1798, Thomas Malthus told at best -- told us that in 100 years would be starving because there were not enough resources to feed enough people. What has happened since? We have grown seven times bigger as a population and malnourishment is at record lows. The way we prosper is through innovation, through a system that enables us to get more from less, so about 20 years ago the UK reached peak stuff. We are getting more economic growth while using less material goods, and it's the same in the US. If you take the case of agriculture, we are producing more food using less fertiliser, pollute less.

BORIS Johnson threatened to move this year's climate change summit from Scotland amid a bitter row with Nicola Sturgeon, it was claimed yesterday. The UK Government was forced to insist the high-profile UN conference would still be staged in Glasgow after details of an explosive rift emerged. Ms Sturgeon's government infuriated the Prime Minister by booking the Glasgow Science Centre near the main Scottish Event Campus venue as a "Scottish pavilion". Officials in Edinburgh and London traded blows over November's United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP26. Toxic Whitehall sources accused the SNP of "hindering not helping". But the First Minister's office blamed Mr Johnson for creating a toxic atmosphere claiming he had "set the tone" when he told last October's Conservative conference he did not want Ms Sturgeon "anywhere near" the conference. The row overshadowed the PM's launch of the year of hosting the summit attended by Sir David Attenborough. Details of the spat became public when the sacked president of the conference Claire O'Neill, a former Tory Minister, claimed Mr Johnson had dismissed her suggestion that Ms Sturgeon be given a role with "salty language". But she also accused the SNP government of having "behaved disgracefully" by hiring out a building close to the conference and refusing to budge from it. She said there was "a complete standoff" between Edinburgh and London over the issue and COP26 might have to be moved. Tensions are already high amid fears the policing bill could top \£3200million.UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has written to SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay on the Science centre, but the row has not been resolved. The Scottish Government says it is open to discussion, but also that it is reasonable for it to use the science centre as a hub. Ms Sturgeon last night wrote to the PM calling for her Environment Secretary Rosanna Cunningham to attend Cabinet meetings on climate change for COP26. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We will be working with the Scottish government where it's relevant to do so."

THE nuclear industry is launching a last-ditch appeal to ministers about the merits of the power source ahead of a decision on a crucial funding deal that could determine developers' appetite. The Government is expected to decide soon on whether to push ahead with a new model to finance nuclear power plants, which aims to bring down the cost by passing some of the risk to consumers. French nuclear power developer EDF, which is building Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, argues the mechanism can help bring down the overall cost of its next proposed power plant, Sizewell C in Suffolk. This week, Dr Tim Stone, chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association and a former government adviser, will tell industry leaders that the Government and energy sector needs "credible plans" to grow the amount of energy generated from low carbon energy sources. Speaking at a summit on Thursday, he is expected to warn industry leaders that the world will be watching the UK when Glasgow hosts the United Nations Climate Change Conference (known as COP26) in November. He is expected to say: "The Government and the energy sector need credible plans, not just good intentions, if we are to show real international leadership. "We need to be working together - renewables and nuclear - to push for real progress towards COP26. "The good news is there are nuclear projects waiting in the wings, ready to deliver clean power, jobs and investment and we have the means to do this at a dramatically reduced cost starting now - not in several years' time." The UK's nuclear industry is at a critical juncture, with almost all of the current fleet of nuclear power stations set to retire this decade. Yet developers and governments increasingly balk at the cost of new nuclear plants, leaving EDF and its partner, China's state-backed CGN, the only companies building new plants here. CGN's involvement is controversial due to concerns about the Communist state's growing influence and opposition from the US. Under the new financing model known as regulated asset base, investors get a steady return from the project even during the building phase.

A group of activists from Berwickshire joined fellow Extinction Rebellion rebels in Edinburgh last week to target the Scottish investment company Baillie Gifford. It was part of a two week campaign across Scotland against the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell, one of the top ten fossil fuel companies who are responsible for 35 per cent of all carbon emissions worldwide. Pauline Stewart from Longformacus and Kate Duncan from Paxton locked themselves together to block the entrance to Baillie Gifford offices, chosen because it manages MSPs pension funds and has just increased their investment in Shell, by 19 per cent Pauline said: "We fail to see how MSPs can properly regulate the oil and gas industry when their pension money helps fund it." Once in place, the two were joined by around 70 rebels who sat in solidarity on the pavement, or stood with banners, handing out leaflets, singing and engaging with passers by. Kate Duncan said: "Bailie Gifford and MSPs say they care deeply about the impact of climate change - and they may do but they need some joined up thinking. "We say they must stop funding the industry that is the root cause of the problem. "People pay into pensions to provide for their futures, but investing in the oil industry funds the destruction of the planet, all our futures, our children's, my grandchildren's futures." Out on the chilly street, Dr Shelagh King from XR Scottish Borders, was engaging with the public. She reported: "A few raised eyebrows but most said they shared our anxiety, our terror, about the climate crisis and supported our actions. "They've seen fires ripping across Australia, they've seen the melting glaciers in the Arctic, Greenland and the Antartic. "The suddenness and severity of it has shocked so many of us, despite our acute awareness of the dangers." The peaceful and good-natured action, attended by a heavy police presence, lasted eleven hours, from dawn till dusk, eventually ending when the Police and Extinction Rebellion negotiated the unlocking with no arrests and no charges. This year COP 26, The United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Glasgow. Politicians will be under increasing pressure to take action if we are to counter the worst effects of global warming. \</doc>

In view of the ongoing social crisis and civil unrest, matters relating to foreign policy-such as regional and global integration efforts-will take a back seat, as the government will be forced to redirect its focus towards policies aimed at restoring domestic stability. For example, the government decided to withdraw as the host of both the APEC summit of 21 Asia-Pacific economies, scheduled to be held in Santiago on November 16th-17th, and the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (known as COP25 ), scheduled for December 2nd-13th, also in Santiago. The APEC summit was cancelled; COP25 was moved to the Spanish capital, Madrid. The decision to pull out of hosting COP25 will undermine Mr Pi\'f1era's efforts to raise his country's profile by advancing environmental campaigns; it represents a major setback to Chile's international standing and it hints at the perceived longevity of the protests. Allegations of abuse and human rights violations by the police have been made, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights-who happens to be the former president, Michele Bachelet (2006-10; 2014-18)-is sending a team to investigate. This further endangers the Pi\'f1era government's standing among global leaders. \</doc>

ACOMPANY that specialises in reusing battery packs from electric vehicles is travelling to the United Nations Climate Change Conference - and is arriving there by train. Newcastle's Connected Energy is one of just 12 UK companies that has been selected to attend the event, which is being held in Madrid. Sales and marketing officer Warren Hayes and energy storage analyst Frazer Wagg will be travelling to the event by rail, meaning it will take them more than 28 hours to arrive at the conference. By taking the prolonged journey Connected Energy will reduce its carbon footprint during its travel. Matthew Lumsden, Connected Energy's CEO, said: "We focus on reusing electric vehicle battery packs and therefore maximising the value of already committed natural resources before they are later recycled. "Our approach to extracting additional value from the finite resources embedded in electric vehicle batteries, and essentially doubling their working lives, is why we've been asked to present at the event. "If electric vehicle batteries were simply recycled after their first life use, value would be lost. Once installed, our technology remotely operates and monitors the secondlife batteries to maximise their utility. Once they are degraded beyond all usefulness in this application, they are remanufactured and recycled." Connected Energy has developed its technology in collaboration with car giants Nissan, Renault, and Jaguar Land Rover as well as Engie. The firm will be exhibiting in the UK Pavillion during the second week of the conference and was invited to attend by the Department for International Trade as a result of its circular economy approach to battery energy storage. Government officials, climate activists, and businesses will all attend the event, which is expected to attract around 25,000 visitors over its two weeks. Mr Hayes said: "I'm really looking forward to the conference, we're going to be immersed in an environment which is proactively showcasing worldwide leadership on sustainability, it's a fantastic opportunity." Mr Wagg added: "Working at Connected Energy we're so focused on the circular economy on a day-today basis. Being given the opportunity to talk about the work we do to such a powerful audience is a real honour." \</doc>

The vessel had to make an unexpected stop in France because of problems with the water purification system. The weather has been rough and several passengers were seasick, including 18-year-old Adela\'efde Charlier, a co-organiser with Anuna De Wever of the Youth for Climate movement in Belgium. News of the cancellation of the Santiago summit reportedly came as a heavy blow to the activists, some of whom have also endured online trolling and death threats, during the past year. "Quite a number of people started to cry, including Anuna and Adelaide," De Wever's mother, Katrien Van der Heyden, said. "They'd been planning this trip for months and the COP would be the ultimate climax of their trip. Obviously this changes the entire perspective of what they do, and is extremely disappointing." But the group discussed the options and decided to push ahead.

Supporters say he may not even be aware that the climate summit has been cancelled. Other climate groups are also reeling from the immense financial hit of non-refundable airline tickets and the complications of getting visas to a new venue. "We had big plans to bring indigenous representatives and partners to the summit," said Nicole Oliveira, Latin America team leader of HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest 350.org , which planned to bring about 60 people to a climate defenders gathering ahead of the summit, in addition to 16 staff and a dozen other regional partners. The group says the cost of airfares and accommodation could double if the climate conference moves to Spain - which would eat up 10-15% of their budget for the event. "What may not mean anything to the large corporations of the fossil fuel industry, to us as non-profit civil society organizations - and even more to the indigenous organizations - can often represent our survival as active agents of change," Oliveira said. "We expect now that the climate talks move forward with a new focus on public participation and human rights. For far too long, this process has prioritized the voices of big business and corporate polluters. The UN must kick the fossil fuel industry out of the climate talks and make more space for the voices of the people." \</doc>

Pursuing economic growth at the expense of the environment is no longer an option as Europe faces "unprecedented" challenges from climate chaos, pollution, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations biodiversity loss and the overconsumption of natural resources, according to a report from Europe's environmental watchdog. Europe was reaching the limits of what could be achieved by gradual means, by making efficiencies and small cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, with "transformational" change now necessary to stave off the impacts of global heating and environmental collapse, warned Hans Bruyninckx, executive director of the European Environment Agency. "Marginal efficiency gains are not enough - they are not working to bring down emissions," he said. "There is also a higher cost to marginal efficiency gains, if we keep investing in that. If we focus on making current technologies more efficient, there are limits. If we stick to what we know, it may seem easy but it doesn't work in the long term." The EEA scored 35 key measures of environmental health, from greenhouse gases and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations air pollution , waste management and climate change to soil condition and birds and butterfly species, and found only six in which Europe was performing adequately. "Incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals," said Bruyninckx. Further marginal changes would grow only more expensive, he predicted, making large-scale change necessary. "We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable." Wholesale changes could include banning internal combustion engines and scaling up public transport, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations abandoning fossil fuels The old system - of "continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts" - would not deliver the EU's long-term vision of "living well, within the limits of the planet", the report warned. The report, known as European Environment - State and Outlook (SOER), is a comprehensive study produced every five years and details the health or otherwise of all natural systems across EU member states and others including Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The 2020 edition was brought forward to inform the incoming European commission as they discuss a promised HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations "green new deal" , and for delegates at \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations COP25 , the UN conference on climate change HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations currently taking place in Madrid There has been little improvement HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations since the last report in 2015 Global heating has added to the risks to health. For instance, Bruyninckx pointed to the melting ice and permafrost in the far north as a little-considered danger. "Russia has buried some very toxic chemicals beneath the ice and we expect melting ice to release some of them," he said. "Some chemicals are also sensitive to heat, so if we have more heatwaves that is a risk too." Frans Timmermans, the incoming executive vice-president of the European commission, said: "In the next five years, we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming. There will be multiple benefits for Europeans if we get this right and our economy and our planet will be winners too." Green campaigners called for urgent radical action. "Banning plastic straws and nudging renewable energy targets is no longer enough," said Jagoda Munic, director of Friends of the Earth Europe. "Only the boldest action to transform our consumption and growth-obsessed economy will do. Every decision [Ursula von der Leyen, the new European commission president] makes must put environment, climate and justice first." Franziska Achterberg of Greenpeace added: "The new commission must follow [the EEA] advice and rethink the economic system that for decades has rewarded pollution, environmental destruction and human exploitation." \</doc>

Reading West MP Alok Sharma talks in this week's column about the decisions that will 'make or break the zero-carbon economy'. He writes: I frequently receive emails and letters from constituents concerned about the impact of climate change, which is a totemic issue facing the world. When I was appointed Business Secretary four weeks ago, I was also given ministerial responsibility for organising COP26 which is the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in the UK in November. At COP26, we want to leave a legacy which stands the test of time and makes life better for future generations by building on the strong foundations of past conferences, especially Paris, to create a zero-carbon economy which will benefit our children and grandchildren. COP26 will be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted and the top international priority for the Government. Collectively the international community will need to ramp up momentum towards a zero-carbon economy which offers huge opportunities for those who act now. As an example, the UK has grown its economy by 75per cent since 1990 whilst reducing carbon emissions by 43per cent. The transition to a zero-carbon economy must be fair and inclusive, leaving no-one behind. To achieve this, all countries need to commit to significant further cuts to carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero carbon emission as soon as possible. We are focussed on five areas where we need a dramatic acceleration of progress to avoid the worst effects of climate change. First, adaptation and resilience, helping communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. Second, nature, safeguarding ecosystems, protecting natural habitats and keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. Third, energy transition, seizing the massive opportunities of cheaper renewables and storage. Fourth, accelerating the move to zero emission vehicles. Finally, the one that makes all the rest possible, finance, to drive forward a net zero economy. Positively, in addition to governments' own national carbon reduction targets, we are seeing companies moving beyond Corporate Social Responsibility and funding green projects, to integrating climate and environmental factors into decision-making across sectors and asset classes. Each one of us will help write the future when it comes to tackling climate change, including governments, businesses, civil society and individuals. Our choices will make or break the zero-carbon economy. I am confident we can make the right choices as we work towards a successful COP26. \</doc>

December 12, 2019 "We are still losing the climate race", Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in Madrid, "but we can choose another path, the path of climate action and well-being for people and planet", which is about jobs, health, education, opportunities and the future. He maintained that the answer to the climate crisis "lies in transforming how we generate our power, design our cities, and manage our land", but it also requires actions "consistent with making people's lives better". The Paris Agreement agreed in 2015 included "a just transition" for people whose jobs and livelihoods are impacted by moving "from the grey economy to the green", he noted, part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). "We can no longer refuse to face up to the climate crisis", he spelled out, urging governments to commit, businesses to lead and people everywhere to "embrace the transformation that will bring us to a carbon-neutral world by 2050". New Climate Economy Mr. Guterres spoke encouragingly about "enormous opportunities" linked to climate action. According to the UN chief, shifting to a low-carbon economy represents a $ 26 trillion-dollar growth opportunity that could create 65 million new jobs by 2030 - with solar, wind and geothermal energy already being the fastest-growing job creators in several economies. "The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now", he stated, encouraging countries to re-train people so they can "switch careers with the concept that education now became a lifelong enterprise". Stressing that the transition to a low-carbon future be "fair and inclusive", he said that this means "a future of green and decent jobs...of thriving, resilient communities, cities and countries." Climate Action for Jobs Meanwhile, the Climate Action for Jobs initiative, which the UN chief launched at the conference with Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO), puts job creation and livelihoods at the centre of national climate action plans, the UN chief enumerated measures to ensure inclusivity, such as assessing the employment, social and economic impacts of ecological transition and the potential of green jobs. We cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time -- UN chief He underscored that economic growth and tackling climate change are "mutually reinforcing", adding that "failing to tackle global heating is a sure-fire recipe for economic disaster". Cleaner, greener future for all Detailing the need to "reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century", Mr. Guterres said the Paris Agreement must be used as "our multilateral path forward". Without achieving our climate goals, the Secretary-General maintained that only the richest would survive. And because "we cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time", he underlined that developed nations must fulfil their pledges under the Paris Agreement to mobilize at least $ 100 billion dollars a year for mitigation and adaptation in developing nations. Decisive challenge of our time For his part, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told delegates that greening the world of work was "the defining and decisive challenge of our time." He called for "a jobs-and-human-centred policy agenda for climate action, based on country-level assessments, innovative social protection and strong consensus" saying the initiative "can make a major contribution" to this. Moreover, it will focus on three inter-related, complimentary areas of advocacy and outreach; a policy innovation hub that will gather knowledge and generate innovative solutions; and capacity building and support for governments, workers' and employers' organizations. "The fight against climate change is inextricably linked with the battle for greater social justice", he concluded. \</doc>

There is a growing expectation that your organisation should be committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) - and sustainability in particular. Switched-on clients and employees are reviewing how a business is approaching environmentallyfriendly topics - and it's affecting buying decisions as well as where people choose to work. For example, 59 per cent of consumers expect brands to make a stand on climate and environmental issues. Also, 64 per cent of millennials, who are estimated to make up three-quarters of the workforce by 2025, won't take a job if the company doesn't have a strong CSR focus. In addition, stakeholders are savvier than ever before and can easily spot a business simply paying lip service to sustainable practices. Before organisations begin communicating their efforts in this area, it is vital they analyse current activity as well as understand what else they can do. Speaking to staff will also assist with identifying what topics are important to them. People who wish to engage with your brand - prospective customers, job candidates, politicians, local residents etc - will likely visit your website to carry out research. Build a page to evidence your work - and think beyond the typical 'we sponsored a local sports team.' .' From a sustainability perspective, have you introduced electric company vehicles? Have you found a method to manufacture your product that is better for the environment? Do you source your food ingredients from within a certain mile radius? Create separate content on each story. Write a news article for your website and consider whether the media would be interested to use it as editorial. COP26, the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference , is being held in Glasgow in November so media attention on sustainability will likely increase. Consider video interviews with employees. For example, if each member of the team receives one day per year to volunteer for a cause that is close to their heart, film and edit a news-style interview. Share all content across your social media channels and explore paid social media promotion, especially if you're currently recruiting and want to deliver these key messages to prospective applicants. Repurpose the content across all forms of communication. For example, dedicate a section in your annual report to your successes in sustainability and include a story in your e-newsletter. Also focus on internal communication - do you have a staff conference or newsletter? What about an intranet? Your employees can become your biggest advocate and will likely post stories across their personal social media accounts. \</doc>

DAVID CAMERON was asked by Boris Johnson to head the United Kingdom's preparations for a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow, The Daily Telegraph understands. Whitehall insiders said the former prime minister was asked to become president of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November to underline the Government's commitment to the cause. The decision to approach Mr Cameron, whose rivalry with Mr Johnson stretches back to their school days at Eton, suggests the pair have finally mended relations after falling out during the 2016 Brexit referendum. They also indicated that the chosen minister may not acquire the status of president, with other experienced hands to be brought in to assist at ambassador level. The disclosure comes just days after the Prime Minister stripped the presidency from Claire Perry O'Neill, a former energy minister, who yesterday responded by accusing him of failing to understand climate change. Making a footballing analogy, she said: "We have seen a huge lack of leadership and engagement. Our efforts right now are somewhere around the middle of League One." At the time of her sacking, sources said her successor would be a "Tory big beast" who had an international profile and someone with a proven track record of delivering major projects. Meanwhile, those working on COP 26 are expected to be brought under the control of a government department. It follows reports that Mr Cameron last week hailed his former Eton and Oxford contemporary as a "visionary" leader who would become a "brilliant" prime minister "as long as he carries on being well behaved". According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron has "buried the hatchet" with Mr Johnson and is offering him advice. 'We have seen a huge lack of leadership and engagement. Our efforts right now are somewhere around the middle of League One' \</doc>

BORIS Johnson has suffered another blow to his ambitions for the COP26 climate summit after David\~Cameron turned down his offer to head the UK's preparations for the global event in Glasgow. The current PM reportedly asked his predecessor to be the President of the United Nations Climate Change Conference but was rebuffed. It is also suggested former Tory leader William Hague was also sounded out for the presidency but he too did not want the job. The disclosures come after Mr Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job during the event's launch on Tuesday following the blistering attack on his leadership from Claire Perry O'Neill, who was sacked as the COP26 President on Brexit Day. READ MORE:\~Iain Macwhirter: Johnson has been more Jekyll than Hyde, but that will change The former Clean Growth Minister, who stood down as a Tory MP at the General Election, was dismissed from her role by the PM's special adviser, Dominic Cummings, in a phone call on Friday.\~ Ms O'Neill accused Mr Johnson of "not getting" climate change, showing a huge lack of leadership and ambition and engaging in "playground politics" in his dealings with Nicola Sturgeon. The Government has said the post will be a ministerial role in future. The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris Agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science now clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. READ MORE:\~Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson locked in 'complete stand-off' over COP26 amid toxic atmosphere The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries - at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations.

HOTELS in Glasgow have raised their prices by more than 400 per cent for the massive United Nations Climate Change Conference in November. A HYPERLINK www.booking.com search for the Dakota Hotel in the city centre found that a Classic Double Room costs \£38,401 for 14 nights - or \£3600 per night - during the COP26 summit. In October, the same double room cost just \£3117 per night. A similar search for the Radisson Blu Hotel, less than a mile from the SEC campus where the conference will be held, revealed a nightly rate of \£3624 - without breakfast - during the event. The room rate for the previous week was \£3150. A spokesman for the Radisson Hotel Group happily confirmed that bosses were cashing in on high demand. He said: "Every hotel is managed based on the demand and offer, in competitive situations, on market evolution. It is like this in any industry." Up to 30,000 delegates, including more than 200 world leaders, are expected in Glasgow for the UN's Conference of the Parties. And Green Party politicians fear that the sky-high hotel prices will not help the city's image. Glasgow councillor Jon Molyneux said: "The Climate Emergency is the greatest issue facing humanity, and hosting COP 26 gives Glasgow and Scotland the chance to set an inspiring and transformative agenda. "While we have a huge opportunity to deliver climate action, we also want those who come here to leave with a good impression of our city. It would be extremely disappointing if exorbitant pricing negatively impacted on that." The highest price we found during the conference was a staggering \£334,986 for a 14-night stay at the four-bedroom Blythswood Square Apartments in the city centre. But businessman Peter Sunderland insisted he had not put up his prices for the event. He said: "These are very high-end apartments.We get a lot of prosecco girls, hen and stag parties who would book up if they could. We consciously set rates high to discourage them because they are bad for business. You don't want a lot of daft lads upsetting the neighbours. "Instead, we attract a lot of guests from the Middle East, who are happy to pay a lot of money for the right place. I can see where you are coming from but I promise you, our rates have not changed." opinion: page 12 \</doc>

As delegates from nearly 200 countries convene in Madrid for the annual UN climate summit, the gap between the countries willing to reduce emissions and those that are not has become more apparent. Teresa Ribera, Spain's environment minister, said her country's last-minute decision to host the talks was essential to prevent the collapse in international climate efforts, after Chile, the original host, cancelled with a month's notice. "We couldn't have the risk that the conference didn't take place at a critical moment and risk the implosion of the whole system to deal with climate change," she said. "We did this out of conviction that the world needs to commit to multilateral activism," added Ms Ribera, a former law professor. Ahead of the two-week COP25 gathering, which begins today, the European Parliament declared a "climate emergency" in an effort to pressure the EU into more ambitious green policies. Yet others are moving in the other direction, notably the US, the world's biggest per-capita emitter, which has begun exiting the Paris climate accord entirely. The Paris agreement, adopted in 2016 by almost 200 nations, aims to limit global warming to well below 2C, but global carbon emissions have continued to rise nonetheless. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris pact, said that China, the world's number one emitter, and Japan appeared to be climate laggards, with the two pushing ahead with new coalfired power stations and financing coal plants abroad. "If countries are to conform with the spirit and the letter of the Paris agreement, they have to prepare two elements for next year: one is a [climate pledge] that is revised for the better and the second is to prepare their 2050 strategy." Chile remains the chair of summit, but Spain has been busying itself with conference logistics and securing accommodation for many of the 20,000 expected attendees. Delegates' main tasks this year will be to find agreement over a global carbon offset market, and to convince signatories to the Paris pact to submit bolder climate goals in 2020. Dozens of countries, including the UK, have this year adopted targets for net zero emissions by 2050, but almost none have enacted specific policies to reach that goal. For Ms Ribera, the real work begins after the delegates leave, as she seeks to steer through deep cuts in Spain's emissions in the face of domestic political deadlock. Her plan would commit Spain to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 21 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2030. To do this, the renewables' proportion of the country's electricity generation would rise from about 40 per cent today to 74 per cent in 2030, largely by boosting wind and solar power. Spain is also targeting net zero by 2050. Her proposals are a microcosm of the environmental challenge faced by governments across the world, which have signed up to tough climate goals but not put in place the measures to reach them. At a time of deep political dysfunction in Spain, it is far from assured that the plan will become a reality. Ms Ribera is in office in only a caretaker capacity and the government to which she hopes to belong - a leftwing coalition with the Podemos party - has yet to be confirmed by parliament. Some campaigners have criticised the proposals as short on detail and political will. "The commitment to cut emissions by just 20 per cent of the 1990 level compares with the EU objective of 40 per cent," said Jos\'e9 Luis Garc\'eda of Greenpeace. "You can't call that ambitious." Ms Ribera dismissed such complaints and said her plan would be among the first piece of legislation for the new government - assuming it is confirmed in office. Yet Spain's fragmented politics mean it has held four national elections in four years, and none of them have produced strong governments. Under her proposals, Ms Ribera predicted an "explosion" in Spain's solar capacity, which has lagged behind that of other EU countries until now. Iberdrola, Spain's biggest utility group, has pledged to more than triple its planned investment in the country's wind and solar sector to (EURO)3bn by 2022. The minister's plans have tested relations with the country's automobile industry. "The car industry in Spain is making a commotion about things happening faster than they wanted," she said. "The worst thing you can do is deny reality." Opinion page 19 \</doc>

Activist Greta Thunberg, 16, arrived in Lisbon, Portugal in La Vagabonde today She had travelled from Hampton, Virginia in order to attend the COP25 summit Swedish teenager was seen aboard 48-foot catamaran with her father Svante Climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in Portugal after completing a voyage across the Atlantic, as the teenager prepares to speak at a climate summit in Madrid. The Swedish campaigner, 16, and her father Svante travelled more than 3,000 miles from Hampton, Virginia to Lisbon aboard a 48-foot catamaran, the La Vagabonde. Greta, who became world famous for founding the 'school strikes for the climate' movement, refuses to fly in planes because of the carbon footprint. She and her father began their journey on November 13 in order to attend the COP25 summit and save approximately two or three tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Posting on Instagram as she headed into the coastal capital, Greta shared a photograph of herself aboard the vessel and wrote: 'Heading into Lisbon!!' The activist will spend the day holding meetings with Portuguese climate activists and resting before her she departs for Spain. The night before her Wednesday arrival, Greta posted a snap of the vessel in rough seas, writing: 'Our last day on the ocean! We can now almost smell land! We expect to arrive at Doca de Santo Amaro, Lisbon sometime between 8.00-10.00 tomorrow morning.' Portugal's environment minister Matos Fernandes thanked Greta for her activism in a letter last Thursday, having already departed for COP25 . The country's president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, said it was a 'great pleasure' to have her in Lisbon but did not feel it was his place to personally greet the activist. Greta missed last Friday's climate strikes as heavy winds delayed her arrival to Lisbon, but she is due to join thousands of activists marching in Madrid this week on the fringes of the COP25 . The two-week gathering kicked off on Monday with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that the planet had reached a 'point of no return'. Top priorities include establishing a common time frame for countries to implement their national climate commitment plans, and resolving the issue of international carbon markets - the only aspect of the Paris rule book which delegates failed to agree on at last year's COP24 in Poland. \</doc>

Spain, one of the world's big fishing nations, is hosting this year's United Nations climate change conference on the health of our oceans. But its own record on damaging the marine environment, by trawling the seabed with huge nets and by removing vast tonnages of fish, is believed by many scientists to adversely affect the sea's ability to act as a carbon sink. In this sense Spain is a deplorable choice as host nation. Spain had by far the largest fishing fleet in Europe when it acceded to the EU in 1986. It still does. The reason why it is so large dates back to the "navalist ideology", an imperialistic way of thinking which arose in Spain around the turn of the 20th century. But the Spanish fleet's greatest expansion dates from the time of Generalissimo Franco, whose policy of protectionism and intervention favoured shipbuilding. The disproportionate size of the Spanish fishing fleet today is one of the unremarked legacies of fascism. If Germany continued to drive its Panzer divisions over the plains of Europe, it would not go unnoticed. Yet hardly anyone makes the connection when Spain's subsidy-driven fishing fleet works its way around the oceans of the world - and often turns a blind eye to the rules as it does so. That could be partly because these days it is dwarfed by the Chinese fleet, also built on subsidies and out of scale with the planet's resource of wild fish. The size of the Spanish fishing fleet was supposed to be capped by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. In fact, the Spanish fleet escaped limits by fishing in international waters as well as in the territorial waters of, and under the flags of, developing nations. Spain was penalised by the EU for catching too much yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean in 2017. Now experts have found the Spanish fleet to have caught 13,500 tons too much of this overfished stock last year, a catch worth tens of millions of euros, stolen largely from developing countries. Spain disputes the figures. The European Commission has opened an investigation. The Spanish government recently removed Franco's body from its mausoleum near Madrid to signal a break with the past. Its next step should be to curtail another part of his malign legacy: a fishing fleet that is still pillaging the oceans.

A YOUNG female cop has died suddenly after falling unwell at the weekend. PC Natalie Faulds, 25, was found in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, on Saturday and rushed to hospital where she later passed away. Her death being ruled "unexplained" but is not being treated as suspicious by detectives. Natalie worked at the Glasgow's Baird Street police station where she would respond to 999 call outs. Her death has rocked the close-knit unit and the wider force. Scottish Police Federation chief Calum Steel said: "The sad and untimely death of Natalie will be keenly felt by her family, colleagues, and friends. "She was a much loved member of her policing team and as a police family we are all the poorer for her passing. "We extend our deepest condolences to her loved ones at this time." Pals and colleagues posted an image of a thin blue line of their social media accounts to support her loved ones. One wrote online: "Can't believe the terrible news! In shock about it all what a lovely person you were. "The thin blue line is now thinner you won't be forgotten." Another added: "We're all here for each other mate. She was a friend of mine. Beyond gutted." A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "On Saturday, 4 January, 2020, officers attended an address in Marshall Street, Wishaw, following a report that a 25-year-old woman had taken unwell. "She later died at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The death is currently being treated as unexplained and a report will be submitted to Procurator Fiscal. "The woman was a serving police officer and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this time." \</doc>

A group of environmental activists have set sail from Amsterdam on a seven-week voyage to South America to attend the UN climate conference. It had been raining on the Amsterdam waterfront on Wednesday but the sun came out in the early afternoon as a small crowd waved farewell to the 36 activists and five crew on the boat. Over the next seven weeks, they will face long days on the churning Atlantic ocean with no land in sight. But their challenge on arrival is no less daunting: to convince the world's governments meeting at COP25 in Chile that emissions from flying - the quickest, cheapest way from the Netherlands to Santiago - must be curbed urgently to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years prevent global heating HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years reaching \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years calamitous levels . "We really want to make a statement that we have to stop subsidising the aviation sector and we have to start investing in these alternatives," said Anuna De Wever, a founder of Belgium's school strike movement, who aged 18, is one of the youngest on board. As well as learning how to sail the Regina Maris, a three-mast schooner propelled by wind, activists will brainstorm on a plan for greener transport, which they plan to present to the world's governments in Santiago. As well as asking government officials to tax aviation fuel, there is also a message to the public that chimes with the no-fly movement epitomised by Greta Thunberg, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years who recently completed her own transatlantic voyage \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years to New York in a zero-carbon HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years boat. The Swedish teenager, who inspired the global school strike movement, is due to meet the group in Santiago. But Bijker said he is not calling for people to give up flying completely: "But we do ask them to think about why are you flying. Where do you need to go? Do you really need to go? Maybe it's a business flight ... and there is an e-conference solution. Do you need to take short-haul trips four times a year or could you fly once for a longer trip?" The group are urging climate policymakers to take action following reports that emissions from aviation are https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years rising even faster than predicted The plan to sail to the COP began life as a WhatsApp group between Bijker and three fellow Dutch climate activists, who got to know each other through the green transport cause. By the middle of this year the project had snowballed into a project uniting climate activists from nearly a dozen European countries, as well as NGOs and universities, which have offered financial and research support. Vegan meals will be prepared by one of the crew in the tiny kitchen and they will stop along the way at Casablanca, Tenerife, Cabo Verde and Recife to pick up fresh fruit and vegetables and touch dry land for a few hours. Unlike Thunberg's zero-emissions boat, there is an engine to bring the boat into port and avoid days becalmed at sea. "We will try to use it as little as possible but we do want to arrive on time," said Bijker. The Regina Maris is due to dock at Rio de Janeiro in mid November. From the Brazilian coastal city, they will take a bus through the Andes to complete their journey to Santiago, to attend the COP starting on 2 December. "We are a lot of people and it's a small space," said Ad\'e9la\'efde Charlier, another co-leader of Belgium's school strike movement, who like De Wever and Thunberg has put her university studies on hold for climate activism. Drawing a parallel with the world's limited resources, she said: "I think it's part of the symbolic message to be on a small boat for this long with that many people." As the wind whips over Amsterdam's IJ river and the boat bobs in the sway, she admitted worries about sea sickness and the "scary and exciting" journey ahead. "I think it's going to be a hard journey but it's necessary for the message. We have this climate urgency and for almost a year we have been trying to find as many as possible actions that would bring back the topic on the table." Participants do not know yet how or when they will return to Europe. Some are looking at a return journey on the Regina Maris next spring, while others are thinking of cargo ships. "That's also part of the message," Bijker said. "It's more that we want to show how hard it is to get to the other side of the world without flying and basically how strange it is that it is this hard and why are there not more alternatives." \</doc>

GLASGOW artists are being offered \£312,000 to help people across the city unleash their creative talents. A total of 23 artists are being sought by Glasgow Life, the council-linked charity responsible for culture. The aim of the Creative Communities - Artists In Residence project is to give Glaswegians from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to become creative within their local area. Glasgow Life has issued an open call to artists or arts organisations. Applicants must be based in Scotland and emerging artists, as well as highly experienced practitioners, are invited to apply. The programme is open to individuals and groups from a wide range of artistic disciplines. The six-month residencies will each be backed by a \£312,000 fee, plus support for materials. The programme was set up following a 2018 summit, when the council pledged to employ an artist in residence in every community. It kicked off last year, with a consultation that saw 23 artists and arts organisations each spending three months in one of Glasgow's 23 wards. They used craft, music, drama and a myriad of other techniques to engage with community groups and individuals. In the process, they generated conversations about what local people wanted from the programme. In the South Side people shared stories and knowledge through a community-based snakes and ladders game. Elsewhere, artists used film, storytelling and various other means to engage with communities. Now that the exercise is complete, Glasgow Life wants to go further by appointing 23 artists in residence - one in each council ward. Each artist will spend six months working within a community, building on the responses and recommendations gathered during phase one to foster creative involvement. The aim is to create meaningful artworks and activities that are in tune with local needs and which positively enhance the lives of people living in those communities. It's expected that some of the works will reflect important moments in the city, from community gala days to major events such as COP26 - the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference - which takes place in Glasgow in November. Councillor David McDonald, chairman of Glasgow Life, said: "It is well known that involvement in the arts enriches people's lives and can boost health and wellbeing. "That's why we at Glasgow Life are determined to extend opportunities for creative engagement to as many people as possible. "Our Creative Communities programme is designed to do exactly that, and the achievements of local people and artists during the first phase were impressive. "I'm really looking forward to watching that creative potential being extended during phase two. "I have no doubt that the results will be surprising, and inspiring." \</doc>

Climate summits date back to the 1990s, when concern over greenhouse gases led to a commitment to address the problem. We review key moments from these events. Listen to audio Leer en espanol Madrid is hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ), with Chile presiding this year. Chilean Minister of the Environment Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar will preside over the 25th edition of this annual event. With a quarter-century of experience, can we say that we have learned something from all of them? We ask expert Luis Robles Olmos, the director of the climate change strategic consulting firm Liken Carbon Hub. 'The Convention was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992', explains Robles. 'The star measure was to reduce greenhouse gases.' This was the result of concern from the international scientific community over the effects of human activity on the Earth's climate. Since then, 194 countries have signed and ratified this convention, in addition to Palestine and the Vatican. Moreover, there is an additional part of the convention to which the EU, as a supranational body has also subscribed. The first Conference of Parties (COP 1) took place in Berlin and an agreement was reached to hold an annual meeting to control global warming and reduce emissions from polluting gases. Germany is one of the countries with the greatest commitment to the environment, but the first year of the conference was only an initial contact with reality for the countries and their policies. 'The road traveled since COP1 in Berlin in 1995 is long and profound, but despite the failure to reach agreements in the following summits, they all contributed elements that helped us to find ourselves at the end of 2019 on the verge of the Paris Agreement entering into force.' Sometimes COPs are blamed for their lack of usefulness, pointing to their role as a source of expenses and emissions stemming from 25,000 people traveling to participate, without reaching an agreement on the solutions needed to combat climate change. Robles is optimistic, although he notes that: 'Some countries and their ruling classes have interests that go against the public interest.' RESPONSIBLE BANKING BBVA joins the Madrid Climate Summit BBVA will actively participate in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 25 ), which will be held in Madrid, starting on Monday, December 2. Some of the confirmed events include a round table discussion where BBVA Group executive chairman Carlos Torres Vila - together with representatives from other banks - will discuss new climate leadership. In addition, there will be a sustainable meal, sponsored by BBVA and prepared by the Roca brothers for heads of state and government officials. COP3 in Kyoto served to adopt the Kyoto Protocol, in which industrialized countries committed to reduce greenhouse gases, and laid the foundations for the carbon market. Robles explains that: 'Following the success at Kyoto, another fundamental milestone was reached at COP7 in Marrakech (2001), with the rules for the functioning of the Kyoto Protocol's project mechanisms: the Clean Development Mechanism and the Joint Implementation Mechanism.' Later on, COP13 in Bali established a negotiation timetable for a new international agreement including all countries - not just the developed countries covered by Kyoto. This was rounded out two years later at COP15 in Copenhagen. 'The need to extend the Kyoto Protocol in terms of countries and validity put the international community in a position to reach an agreement at COP15 in Copenhagen (2009),' explains Robles. The goal was to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius and finance developing countries. It did not accomplish the desired results. 'The lack of willingness to reach an agreement and the U.S. blocking the negotiations at the heart of COP led to the biggest failure in the history of climate change summits,' Robles added. COP16, hosted by Mexico in Cancun, was a key element in overcoming this situation. There, the Cancun agreements were written, which formalized what had been discussed at Copenhagen. The Green Climate Fund was also created to support climate measures in developing countries. The following year, in Durban, the countries at COP17 agreed to reduce emissions, including the U.S., China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It was the first time a time frame was set: 2020. At COP18 in Doha, an agreement was reached to extend Kyoto to 2020, but the U.S., China, Canada and Russia did not support the extension. COP20 in Lima was the first time the countries agreed to elaborate and share their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The next summit was COP21 in Paris in 2015. An agreement was finally reached to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius, with a goal of not surpassing 1.5 degrees. The Paris Agreement is much more extensive in its content and development than Kyoto, as it establishes that the efforts to reduce or limit emissions belong to all countries, under the principle of common, but differentiated responsibilities. 'It contains specific provisions on adaptation to climate change, international financing and long-term goals, without setting an end date for the validity of the agreement. Its format was agreed upon by consensus to allow for its ratification by the countries, taking into account the legal peculiarities of many of them (U.S., China, etc.). Therefore, its adoption is voluntary and compliance is mandatory,' says Robles. Paris was followed by COP22 in Marrakech. The Paris Agreement was ratified days before the start of the summit and three documents surfaced in line with the Paris commitments. However, at the same time, the U.S. started to express its wariness of all the changes. At COP23 in Bonn, progress was made on how the Paris Agreement would work in practice (the so-called Paris Rulebook) and the countries agreed to share best practices in the so-called Talanoa Dialogue. Furthermore, a platform was launched to promote the participation of and dialogue with local communities and indigenous groups, and gender policies and women's relationship with climate change was on the agenda. Last year, COP24 was held in Katowice. Two months before the event, the IPCC published its devastating report on global warming. And that is where Chile took the baton. The countries will attempt to reach an agreement on issues in the Paris Rulebook that remain pending or unresolved from COP24 in Katowice, Poland. Specifically, the rules for Article 6, which will allow the country to comply, partially, with the national mitigation targets through market-based mechanisms like the international carbon market and projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (renewable energy, fuel replacement, energy efficiency or electric vehicles) to generate so-called 'carbon bonds'. There is a long list of commitments to address at this summit, but experts are optimistic. The conditions are not easy and consensus will be difficult, but the goals are clear. One objective that will be proposed at the Madrid summit is limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius as well as striking a balance between greenhouse gas emission and absorption in the second half of the century.

While the UN climate talks are celebrating their 25th year, carbon emissions around the world have continued to climb. For many, that is where natural solutions could play a key role in managing a dramatic climate transition. Nature-based solutions or the process of working with and around natural ecosystems to deliver real-world benefits for climate resilience and sustainable development, took center stage on day 4 of COP25 in Madrid). The African Development Bank has three main approaches to nature-based solutions; namely, restoring damaged ecosystems (land, forests and water bodies), conserving biodiversity, and integrated natural resources management. Vanessa Ushie, Manager of the Policy Analysis Division at the Bank's African Natural Resource Centre, briefed delegates at COP 25 about the Centre's work during a panel discussion on Tuesday. 'Nature-based solutions are easy to use, and very effective in improving community livelihoods and resilience to climate change. The AfDB is scaling up the use of nature-based solutions to address climate impacts on critical ecosystems and biodiversity in Africa,' Ushie said. UN biodiversity expert Valerie Kapos described a range of natural solutions being implemented across Africa, and around the world. These included protecting rivers, forests, and marine solutions, to benefit local economies. 'We need to be applying that argument to whichever solutions we are choosing,' said Kapos, Head of Climate Change and Biodiversity at the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). This is definitely true for the Seychelles, which has been appointed by the African Union to be the champion of the blue or ocean economy across the continent. While the continent is known for its deserts and jungles, a blue economic transition will be essential for the 48 coastal states that collectively make up the world's longest coastline. 'We have protected 47% of our land, and are moving toward 50%. But our ocean territory is 3,000 times bigger than our land territory, and we are on track to protect 30% of that area,' said Ronald Jumeau, Permanent Representative of the Seychelles at the UN. This was made possible by one of the world's biggest debt-swap programs. The debt-for-nature deal was made possible through The Nature Conservancy, which bought the island nation's $ 400 million sovereign debt at a discount. That money will be re-invested in nature conservation programmes. 'Through this program we have funded mangrove restoration and climate education programmes,' said Angelique Pouponneau, who runs a Seychelles-based trust fund focusing on climate adaptation and conservation. Ushie from the African Development Bank pointed out that 'one thing we are looking at is changing the way in which lending is being channeled to Africa, and how nature can be integrated in the measurement of national wealth and sovereign credit ratings for African countries.'

GEOFFREY COX could be offered the chance to run a major review into judicial activism as a sop for being sacked in Boris Johnson's first reshuffle since his election landslide this week. The Attorney General is being tipped for a move out of government after sources briefed that he was "not a team player". However, Tory sources say that to sugar the pill he could be asked to run a new Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission, which will consider whether to rein in the scope of judicial review challenges in courts. The Tory party's manifesto commits the Government to setting up the commission before December. One senior Tory source said the job had been "pretty much designed for him". Lucy Frazer is being lined up to replace Mr Cox, although one minister told The Sunday Telegraph: "Geoffrey doesn't want to go yet, he certainly wants to stay as Attorney General through the [Brexit] negotiations." Mr Johnson is understood to have set up a large white board on which he is moving around names and faces of his Cabinet. One Cabinet minister said the Prime Minister was keeping his plans very private, adding: "The one thing none of us know is what is in Boris's mind." Westminster has been awash with rumours all week, with some claiming that the positions of Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, were under threat. Other moves being considered include Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden to the culture department, and Mark Spencer to replace Theresa Villiers in the environment, food and rural affairs department. Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is tipped to be given a wider role running the Brexit talks at a beefed-up Cabinet Office. The Prime Minister is also being urged to make the role of the Northern Powerhouse minister - occupied by Jake Berry - a full-time Cabinet position to be a "northern enforcer across the whole of Government". Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park is widely tipped to be given the role of chairing the COP26 United Nations Climate Change conference in November. The jobs of Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the Business Secretary, are under threat. \</doc>

What happened in week one? COP25 climate talks in Madrid may have HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world officially opened on Monday 2 December, but they only really started on Friday evening. That was when Greta Thunberg arrived to join a 500,000-strong march through the centre of Madrid, demanding that world leaders listen. The young activist said that she, and the millions who have marched and protested around the world in the last two years, had HYPERLINK "achieved nothing" because greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Her stark message summed up the disjunction that scientists, campaigners and some politicians have despaired of at these talks: that the sense of urgency scientists have warned is needed, and that is felt in the outside world among those worst affected by climate breakdown, is still missing from these negotiating rooms. Notable developments Earlier in the week, a https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world report on the world's "carbon budget" revealed how far the world is from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Greenhouse gas emissions rose by 0.6% last year - less than in recent years, but not enough to turn the corner. Johan Rockstr\'f6m, the joint director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world said : "We must bend the curve [from increasing carbon to falling emissions] in the next year." What governments did - or didn't - do Meanwhile, negotiators finally managed over the weekend to put out a text on the future of carbon markets. It is only a first step and there are still major disagreements over how carbon credits should be counted and how countries' success in meeting previous carbon targets should be allowed to count towards their future targets. There is still no guarantee of any resolution to the disputes over carbon markets - the so-called article 6 talks, named after the section of the Paris agreement that they are aimed at clarifying. If this issue is not resolved, this technical question will hang over next year's talks too, getting in the way of the substantive issue: the fact that by next year at the latest, countries are supposed to realign their emissions-cutting targets with scientific advice on staying within 2C (and hopefully 1.5C) of global heating above pre-industrial levels. Chile to Madrid These talks were supposed to take place in Chile, HYPERLINK but were relocated after political unrest in Santiago. There are reminders everywhere that Chile is still technically the host - in the logo and signs; in the leadership of the Chilean COP president, Carolina Schmidt, at every important meeting; the conference rooms named after Chilean landmarks, rivers and natural features; and in the protests outside the conference centre by Chilean democracy and social justice campaigners, who say they are being silenced and ignored. Blue COP HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world regulate the climate HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world is damage to the climate Art for climate's sake Campaigners took advantage of the move to Madrid by drawing some of the Spanish capital's cultural icons into the climate fight. The Prado art gallery, in conjunction with WWF, has HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world updated some of its most famous paintings to show how they might reflect a warming world, with Goya now depicting climate refugees and a Vel\'e1zquez painting of Felipe IV showing the Spanish king up to his horse's neck in flood water. Which makes participants wonder what other Spanish artists might have made of the talks. The tortured technicalities of article 6 would test the skills of a Picasso - though the surrealism of Dal\'ed might be more appropriate. Melting watches could stand for how negotiating time seems to have stopped, while poles and glaciers liquefy. What to expect in week two Youth has taken over for the start of the second week, with activists making their presence felt at the conference centre on Monday, fresh from the weekend's marches and protests. On Tuesday and Wednesday, environment ministers and finance ministers will arrive to give directions for their officials, meaning the "high-level segment" of the talks can start and with it the actual decision-making needed to give these talks a concrete outcome, in the form of resolutions on key issues. The EU is also expected to galvanise the talks with its HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world green new deal proposals from the European commission on Wednesday. In normal circumstances the UK, as the host of next year's COP, which marks the deadline for countries to update their Paris commitments, would be expected to play a key role here. But the its delegation has been hobbled by the general election, which means officials and the next COP president, the former UK climate minister Claire Perry O'Neill, are in purdah and cannot speak on the record. Perhaps by Friday, when the UK's votes have been counted, there may be some much-needed clarity. \</doc>

Brazil's environment minister Ricardo Salles has taunted COP25 climate talks with a photo of a large steak after President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed them as a "commercial game". Mr Salles HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rsallesmma/status/1206271937535717377 tweeted the photo with the caption: "To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!" Prior to posting the photo, he criticised "rich countries" in attendance of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference for their lack of progress on carbon markets, a system established by the Paris Agreement. Brazil is one of several countries that want to count emissions cuts achieved by offsetting carbon credits to another country as a boost for their own climate targets. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rsallesmma/status/1206271937535717377 Carbon offsetting allows a country to fund emission reductions in another country to help reach its own reduction targets. The practice, known as 'double counting', was countered by other countries who say it would undermine the entire market. Mr Bolsonaro HYPERLINK told reporters : "I don't know why people don't understand that it's just a commercial game. "I'd like to know: has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?" The recent COP25 talks were widely judged to have been a "disappointment", as countries failed to agree on a number of issues, including new rules regarding the carbon market. A staunch climate change sceptic, Mr Bolsonaro has been criticised for dismantling regulation and environmental and Amazon protections since his first day in office. Brazil is the world's top beef exporter, an industry that drives illegal deforestation caused by cattle farmers who want to convert the Amazon rainforest into pasture to feed their herds. This year, the Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of fires fuelled by cattle ranchers, resulting in irreparable damage of a natural resource and the HYPERLINK deaths of indigenous forest activists . Mr Bolsonaro dismissed concerns about the destruction of the rainforests and said: "I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame." \</doc>

THE UK faces the task of breaking the deadlock on international climate negotiations next year, after the COP25 talks ended in Madrid on Sunday. The meeting overran to become the longest climate summit yet as delegates from over 190 countries struggled to reach agreement on key issues on the framework underpinning the Paris climate deal. Drawing up rules on a carbon market between countries has been deferred until next year, when the UK hosts a landmark climate summit in Glasgow. Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he was disappointed with the outcome, and that leaders had missed an opportunity to be more ambitious on climate change mitigation, adaptation and finance for poorer countries. "But we must not give up, and I will not give up," he tweeted. Scientists said the "minimum compromise" achieved in Madrid means the Glasgow meeting will now need to be a turning point. "Postponing all the relevant issues is hardly in line with the climate emergency that we scientists highlighted during COP25 ," said Johan Rockstr\'f6m at the University of Potsdam, Germany, in a statement. The conservation charity WWF said the summit showed "a staggering failure of leadership by some countries". The intransigence of big polluters \- including China, the US, Brazil and India \- at the meeting led to the European Union, small island states and members of the public expressing frustration. This culminated in a protest at the summit where about 200 campaigners were marched out of the conference by security, though they were later allowed to return. The UN said that more than 70 countries are expected to submit stronger plans to curb carbon emissions next year, ahead of the Glasgow summit. The lack of ambition at the Madrid meeting is a disappointing end to 2019, a year that has seen an outpouring of public concern about climate change. \</doc>

By BBC Monitoring Chile's media reacted with disappointment to what they called "unsatisfactory" agreements reached at the COP25 United Nations climate summit which concluded in Madrid on 15 December, with commentators offering mixed views on the level of blame that should be attributed to the Chilean government for the lacklustre outcome. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera made headlines around the world on 30 October when he announced that Chile would be unable to host the summit due to severe civil unrest, but the South American nation remained heavily involved, with Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt presiding over the negotiations in Madrid. Pundits reflected widespread criticism of Schmidt's handling of the summit in the international press, with Radio Bio Bio's Tomas Mosciatti saying on 17 December that "she was playing in the big leagues and wasn't prepared". Chilean coverage also said the last-minute change of venue, coupled with the absence of President Pinera, may have lessened the South America nation's impact on proceedings. But other reports said the Chilean government defended its handling of the summit, arguing it was "unfair" to expect one country to solve such complex issues. An international 'embarrassment'? Newspaper La Segunda's 16 December coverage ran with the headline: "The government's failed bet for COP25 and harsh return to reality", while noting in a subheading, "world press criticises results of the COP and Chile's role". Leading daily El Mercurio opted for a more moderate tone, headlining its 17 December report: "Chile's presidency of the COP25 is questioned, but also receives support". Business daily Diario Financiero, in an editorial published on 17 December, said it was "disappointing that an agreement around the regulation of the so-called carbon credit market was not reached". But it also criticised "those in Chile who have called the COP25 £ disaster' and a 'total failure'", saying they had "excessive expectations". In an episode of newspaper La Tercera's Cronica Estereo podcast on 17 December, titled "Chile's sins at the COP25 ", journalist Andreas Munoz said, "the expectations were high and evidently I imagine all these last-minute changes had an influence on Chile's running [of the summit]". He added, "inevitably there are going to be costs for having ended a COP in this way, which for many was not very satisfactory". There were other media voices that went further, such as environmental columnist Jaime Hurtubia, who in a 17 December op-ed for news website El Mostrador called the outcome "a great embarrassment, in which Chile's name has been tarnished before the international community". Chilean leadership found lacking Several reports described aspects in which Chile's leadership at the summit was lacking. La Tercera's website wrote on 16 December: "It is often said that one of the keys to a successful COP is in the political ability of its presidency, in knowing how to make alliances and find common ground. On the first day of the COP25 [summit], Chile annoyed the rest of Latin America, its main allies, after cutting off their microphone and accepting Africa's request regarding 'special conditions'." Former Environment Ministry Undersecretary Jorge Canals, in a 16 December interview with CNN Chile, scolded the government for creating "expectations that it wasn't capable of fulfilling", but absolved them of some the blame, arguing that "no one is obliged to do the impossible, it was a very difficult deal". El Mercurio columnist John Muller wrote on 17 December: "It is not reasonable to think that Chile was in a position to solve the world's problems." Government rebuffs criticism In postings on Twitter on 15 December, President Pinera acknowledged the shortcomings of the summit, writing that "the gravest part is that countries who pollute the most were not up to the task and are still in debt. Chile will continue to lead this cause". But when asked about the outcome during an interview with radio broadcasters' association Archi on 16 December, the president sought to shield his environment minister from criticism, saying that "it is unfair to put this on Minister Carolina Schmidt, who did what was humanly possible". Speaking to news website El Libero on 15 December, Finance Minister Ignacio Briones also defended the minister, saying: "Blaming Chile's presidency frankly seems ridiculous to me." He added that "you need the coordination of many countries, which is not an easy exercise, because each one has its [own] interests". El Mostrador reported on 16 December that Minister Schmidt also commented on the outcomes, pointing out that seven of the summit's eight objectives were achieved, and she highlighted a "unanimous consensus of all parties for the oceans to be protected". However, she was also quoted as saying: "Of course we are not satisfied, the agreements aren't up to the mark." Source: BBC Monitoring in Spanish 1840 gmt 17 Dec 19 \</doc>

THE world's nations are once again gathering to debate the climate emergency. Most can be sure to be back again if they cannot make progress this time around. But not all. As presidents and prime minsters began COP25 talks in Madrid, the leader of one tiny Pacific nation says her country is in a "fight to the death". The Marshall Islands have long been considered one of the most vulnerable states on the planet. Last week, five-metre high swells washed across its capital, Majuro. Its President, Hilda Heine, is literally facing rising tides which threaten the very existence of the chain of atolls. Ms Heine said: "Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides. As we speak, hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week. "It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee. But we also refuse to die." Other island nations face similar concerns. Ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), took the opportunity to berate industrial nations for acting too slowly. She said: "We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement. "In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect themost vulnerable. "With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide." The COP 25 As we reported yesterday, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has already said "the point of no return is no longer over the horizon". He said: "In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. "We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions." Around 200 nations are meeting for two weeks of talks in Madrid - the event had been planned for Santiago, Chile, but was moved because of unrest in the Latin American nation. Chile's environment minister Carolina Schmidt opened the summit by saying the meeting needs to lay the groundwork for moving towards carbon neutral economies. This was to be achieved while being sensitive to the poorest and those most vulnerable to rising temperatures - something that policymakers have termed "just transition". "Those who don't want to see it will be on the wrong side of history", said Ms Schmidt, as she called on governments to make more ambitious pledges to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ahead of a deadline to do so next year. The summit aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord. That involves creating a functioning international emissions-trading system and compensating poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change. "We have a common challenge but with differentiated needs and urgencies, which we can only overcome if we work together," said Ms Schmidt as her country took over the chairing of the meeting from Poland. Organisers expect around 29,000 visitors to attend, including around 50 heads of state and government - but not Donald Trump. Except for the European Union's newly sworn-in leadership, which was due to begin a five-year term by paying a visit to the summit, the rest of the world's largest carbon emitters - the United States, China and India - are sending ministerial or lower-level officials tothe meeting. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016 under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages forAmerican workers. Last month, he began the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. \</doc>

Scotland's prime cities have been named among the most active areas for hotel investment last year, with Glasgow finishing in top spot, according to analysis from Knight Frank. The independent property consultancy's UK Hotel Capital Markets Investment Review 2020 found that there was about \£3260 million-worth of hotel deals last year in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Inverness. Beyond the country's four main cities, there was further significant deal activity during the 12 months, with a dozen assets - consisting of about 900 rooms - changing hands for approximately \£3115m. The sale of the Fairmont St Andrews was the biggest deal of the year in the Scottish secondary' market, contributing about 45 per cent of the total investment figure. John Rae, head of Knight Frank's Glasgow office, says: "It [was] a strong year for investment in Glasgow hotels, a reflection of the fact that it is emerging as a highly desirable tourist and events destination. The scheduled COP26 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference for later this year is indicative of the scale of events that Glasgow can now attract and host, and it presents a massive opportunity to highlight all the city has to offer to the world. Rae observes: "There are a substantial number of hotel rooms to be added in Glasgow over the next few years, with a range of well-known and boutique operators confirmed or planning new premises in the city. "As they come on stream, we expect hotel investment activity to remain strong in the years ahead as investors increasingly look to alternative property assets." The Knight Frank report also found that hotel deals in Scotland have been boosted by the growing popularity of ground rents' transactions in recent years - a form of sale and long-term leaseback deal that delivers a steady income for investors and guaranteed access to a property for a hotel operator. According to the firm's analysis, ground rents transactions have accounted for approximately \£3100m of assets over the last three years, including the Hotel Indigo Glasgow, Marriott Moxy Aberdeen, and Apex Edinburgh - which represents a noteworthy uplift on previous years. Alasdair Steele, head of Scotland commercial at Knight Frank, adds: "We have seen a significant increase in the number of ground rents deals since 2017, as investors seek out sources of secure, long-term income and hotel operators look to free up cash to invest in their businesses. "They are also proving popular with similar types of occupiers, including the student accommodation and healthcare sectors. "We expect ground rents to grow in popularity in Scotland, both among investors and occupiers, in line with the rest of the UK." \</doc>

Boris Johnson has been warned that he faces a backbench rebellion if he uses the budget to HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fuel-duty-must-rise-if-we-are-to-cut-carbon-emissions-9prl2w26t raise fuel duty . The Treasury is understood to be looking at HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fuel-duty-must-rise-if-we-are-to-cut-carbon-emissions-9prl2w26t ending the present freeze either this year or next to send a signal of the government's intent to tackle climate change. But a group of Tory MPs - including those in new Conservative "red wall" seats are preparing to write to Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, warning of the electoral danger of reversing the prime minister's election pledge. They argue that with the government's 2050 net zero target and Britain hosting Cop 26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in the autumn, they need to be seen to act if they are to meet their commitments and encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, said that such a move would betray working class voters. Jack Lopresti, the Conservative MP for Filton & Bradley Stoke in Bristol, said the government needed to listen to the concerns of ordinary voters who relied on their car and had no other means of transport. "This would hit people, particularly in rural communities, outside towns and cities and in many parts of the country where we won seats for the first time in the election. We all believe that we need to put significant investment in public transport infrastructure but until that happens we should not be considering raising duty." Howard Cox, the co-founder of the Fair Fuel campaign, said he would be encouraging tens of thousands of members to write to their MPs. "We've been warned that even if it doesn't happen this year it is back on the agenda and we need to start lobbying again," he said. "We don't just want them to continue with the freeze but to cut petrol duty. We are not against clean air - all our members want that but taxes and bans are not the way of achieving that." Mr Cox said he was encouraged by the support he had received from Conservative MPs adding that he expected a large number of the new intake to also get behind the campaign. A Treasury source suggested that a fuel duty was unlikely to be included in Mr Sunak's first budget on March 11. But there is speculation that it could be including in future financial statements - potentially being ring-fenced to support the uptake of electric cars. Other tax-raising measures that have been mooted include reducing pension tax relief on high-income earners and an additional council tax band for multimillion-pound properties. \</doc>

David Cameron has rejected an offer from Boris Johnson to lead this year's climate summit after the Tory in charge was dramatically sacked. The former Prime Minister was asked to step in after Claire Perry O'Neill was dumped as President of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26. Ahead of the November summit in Glasgow, Ms O'Neill claimed Boris Johnson secretly admitted he "doesn't get" climate change Boris Johnson admitted he 'doesn't get' climate change, sacked summit chief says Now it seems David Cameron was unwilling to take her place. But he insisted it wasn't a snub. Mr Cameron -Theresa May rakes in \£3400,000 for speeches after stepping down as PM over Brexit-said it was "an honour to be asked" but it would be better for a Government minister to do the job. "It was an honour to be asked to do that job and I'm very grateful to have been asked," he told the BBC. "But I think it's best in these situations if you have a Government minister doing the job; you then have one line of command rather than, perhaps, two people doing the same thing." Mr Cameron rebranded the Tory party in the late 2000s to show off green credentials but later described environmental measures as 'green cp'. Today he said he also had "a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer's Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work". "But I wish the Government well, I wish this climate change conference well, because it's absolutely vital. "I'm sure that there will be a Government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The Government has my backing as they go forward." Asked about his relationship with Boris Johnson, though, Mr Cameron declined to answer. According to The Times, former Tory leader William Hague was also sounded out for the presidency. The disclosure comes after Mr Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job during the event's launch on Tuesday. The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris Agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. \</doc>

Photo credit: Greenpeace The group's plea comes just ahead of the keenly-awaited COP25 climate conference in Madrid from 2 to 13 December, where world leaders will discuss the next steps in the fight against global warming. S&D deputy leader Miriam Dalli said, " COP25 will mark a decisive turning point in the fight against climate change. The Socialists and Democrats will not stop fighting for this cause." "With US President Donald Trump formally initiating the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, citizens in Europe and beyond are now turning to the EU for direction." RELATED CONTENT COP25 Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off Climate change now an 'emergency' says former European commissioner Miguel Ca\'f1ete: Leaders of EU cities and regions must 'lead by example' on climate The Maltese member said her group planned to table an amendment requesting that Parliament declares a climate emergency, adding, "The EU must act together and lead by example in international climate negotiations through concrete actions and measures." In Parliament's recently-adopted COP25 resolution, the S&D group requested that the EU adjusts its economy-wide target of domestic greenhouse gas emission reductions to 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, in order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The resolution adopted by the environment committee earlier this month says the EU should commit to net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 at next month's UN conference and step up its emissions' reduction ambition for 2030. "With US President Donald Trump formally initiating the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, citizens in Europe and beyond are now turning to the EU for direction" Miriam Dalli MEP Committee members said they expect the European Green Deal, announced by European Commission President-elect Ursula von Der Leyen, to include a target of 55 percent emissions reductions by 2030. French Renew Europe member Pascal Canfin, the committee chair, said Parliament was "showing the way for Europe to be the first carbon-neutral continent in 2050," adding, "While the United States confirmed its exit from the Paris Agreement, we have reaffirmed that we want Europe to be serious about the fight against climate change." But S&D coordinator on the environment committee, Jytte Guteland, a Swedish MEP, says Parliament and the EU should be even more ambitious. Looking ahead to the climate conference in Madrid, she said "Parliament will take a strong and progressive mandate to COP25 . People all over the world demand action to reduce climate emissions. We share the sense of urgency and are fighting for tougher and immediate EU action to mitigate the climate crisis. "We know from experience that the European Parliament plays an important role at the COP conferences to push the parties to reach ambitious agreements" Jytte Guteland MEP "We know from experience that the European Parliament plays an important role at the COP conferences to push the parties to reach ambitious agreements." "The EU has both the economic means and a responsibility to lead by example in this global process. The first step is to sharpen our climate targets for 2030. By aligning our own emissions in line with the Paris Agreement we can show the rest of the world that the Green New Deal is not just possible but in fact has huge potential for society." Further comment comes from S&D rapporteur on COP25 resolution, Mohammed Chahim, who noted, "There is a climate emergency; we now must be ambitious and act accordingly. Europeans do not need more words from politicians; what we need are concrete plans to ensure that this transition leaves no one behind." "It is crucial that all sectors contribute their fair share to meet objectives of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, it is important that we also transform the maritime sector, the aviation sector, as well as the agricultural sector." "Europeans do not need more words from politicians; what we need are concrete plans to ensure that this transition leaves no one behind" Mohammed Chahim MEP Meanwhile, it has emerged that contributions from the EU and its Member States to help developing countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change have more than doubled since 2013. According to the Council, the EU and its Member States remain the largest provider of public climate finance. Their total contributions amounted to (EURO)21.7bn in 2018, up from (EURO)20.4bn in 2017. \</doc>

HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk https://www.gov.uk The second Polish-British Business, Trade and Investment Forum took place on June 27-28 in Warsaw, under the lead theme "Building Clean Growth Together". Participants of the Forum attended a series of workshops and expert discussions on clean growth, offshore energy, e-mobility and green finance, as well as on Polish-British trade relations. The Forum was attended and opened by Minister of Investment at the Department for International Trade, Graham Stuart. The Minister encouraged participants of the Forum to explore the economic benefits of clean growth, and said: The Department for International Trade wants to encourage more British companies to come to Poland, because it is the fastest growing major economy in Europe, and we're also encouraging Polish companies to invest in the UK [...] Polish companies are doing well, their economy's growing fast, and they are building their confidence and capability. If they want to go global, the best place to come is to the UK. One of the highlights of the Forum was an announcement that UK sustainable technology firm Johnson Matthey will soon open a new facility in the Polish city of Konin. A letter of intent was presented by Peter Dickson, eLNO Operations Director at Johnson Matthey, and Polish Minister of Entrepreneurship and Technology, Jadwiga Emilewicz. The factory will produce eLNO, a next generation cathode material for batteries with high energy density. New batteries based on this technology will enable a step forward in battery electric vehicle performance and contribute to the development of electro-mobility in Poland. The Polish-British Business, Trade and Investment (BTI) Forum is a unique platform for Polish and British businesses to connect with a broad range of potential partners, clients and investors, and to hear from experts and analysts about the latest trends and challenges in Polish-British trade relations. The forum was called for by the Prime Ministers of both countries at the UK-Poland intergovernmental consultations in December 2017. The first edition of the Forum brought together over 200 high-level representatives from both countries, who participated in a variety of sessions dedicated to business trends and opportunities in the UK and Poland. This year's Forum focused on the topic of clean growth, under the lead theme "Building Clean Growth Together". The UK remains committed to domestic and international efforts to tackle climate change, and cooperation between the UK and Poland on matters related to clean growth is closer than ever. The two countries have recently launched a global initiative for fostering zero-emission transport, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP24, held in December 2018 in Poland.

The conference of the parties, or COP25 , has begun. The aim of the event, which was originally due to be held in Chile but was moved to Madrid because of civil unrest, is for political leaders and climate diplomats to step up ambitions so that all countries increase their national commitments to cutting emissions. With negotiators bogged down by market mechanisms and arguing over technical terms, it falls to the youth to truly take the lead in pressing for urgent action. However, our hope and optimism is often capitalised upon by leaders for political point-scoring or as a PR opportunity. We desperately need politicians to take the issue seriously and solve the climate crisis - we cannot do it alone. Without them, our message will be drowned out by the voices of huge corporations putting profits over people. During every meeting I attend, negotiators invoke the words of Greta Thunberg but fail to live up to her ambition. For this reason, and for our futures, young people are travelling to COP25 to protest and make leaders stand up and listen to their cause. While demonstrations outside the conference might get press attention, it is unlikely to change much as negotiators scurry from meeting to meeting oblivious of our actions. That's why we will also be protesting inside the event, despite UN regulations requiring youth groups to apply to do so and give minute details of everything that will happen. Everything is scrutinised - from the wording of the banners to making sure we don't carry any country's flag. Still, there is no guarantee they will listen to us. The climate strikes, for example, have energised young people, but very little has changed inside the COP. Negotiators continue to ignore the science, continue to delay at every opportunity and continue to allow fossil fuel lobbyists to rub shoulders with key decision-makers. The COPs were born in 1992 and since then we have had disappointment after disappointment. The last moment of real hope was the Paris Agreement in 2015, but there has not been the same level of enthusiasm from world leaders since. We have fought tooth and nail to bring the climate emergency to the forefront, so why won't those with the power to help take the baton? COP25 is our last chance to influence these negotiators before they send revised emissions-reduction pledges to the COP next year. If we want ambition from our leaders, we have to show our ambition from the ground. That's why we won't stop attending these events and have a visible presence. These negotiators must look us in the eyes and realise our future is worth fighting for. Moving forward, however, we must not focus only on this type of direct action. Governments always think in the short term and refuse to break the mould to fight the climate crisis if it could risk their chances of re-election. Therefore, we must also encourage political engagement. We have to fully mobilise the youth vote and make the climate crisis a priority issue before they will listen to us. We also must learn to harness traditional forms of media that connect better with those in positions of real power across the world. Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events In pursuing these new methods, we must also continue to pass the mic to the global south and frontline communities affected by the crisis. Many do not have the privilege to campaign in the streets, access traditional media or even vote in a democracy. We must make sure world leaders are aware of these experiences and understand the personal impact these problems will have on them, rather than purely financial.

Climate talks in Madrid have ended with a partial agreement to ask countries to come up with more ambitious targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris accord. Few countries came to this year's talks with updated plans to reach the Paris goals, though the EU finally agreed its long-term target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Experts say more ambitious emissions cuts are needed globally if the Paris pledge to hold global heating to no more than 2C is to be met. This year's round of annual UN talks focused on narrow technical issues such as the workings of the global carbon markets, a means by which countries can trade their successes in cutting emissions with other countries that have not cut their own emissions fast enough. By midday on Sunday, more than 40 hours after the talks deadline, agreement on that was still far off and the issue will have to be resolved next year. There were fears that the more substantive issue of future emissions cuts would also be sidelined, but a "high ambition coalition" made up of the EU and many smaller developing countries pressed for a resolution to ask all governments to formulate stronger national plans on cutting carbon. They partially succeeded, and they will now hope to put political pressure - from within the talks, in behind-the-scenes meetings in world capitals, and in the outside world from civil society - on all governments to recommit to the 2015 Paris accord in 2020 through updates to their national climate plans. That will be a difficult task, judging by the scenes at the two-week-long Madrid conference. No major breakthrough had been seriously expected at this year's meeting, known as COP25 , but observers had at least hoped to see a spirit of cooperation and a willingness to press ahead with the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations Paris agreement goal of holding temperature rises to no more than 2C. Both were lacking as the talks moved into the early hours of Sunday. Poor countries grew angry at what they saw as intransigence on the part of some richer nations, while the EU and a coalition of developing countries urged others to come forward with more ambitious plans to combat climate breakdown. In the final hours, weary negotiators wrangled over the wording of provisions for "loss and damage", by which developing countries are hoping to receive financial assistance for the ravages they face from climate breakdown. The US was blamed for refusing to agree to developing countries' demands under what is known in the UN jargon as the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM). A US state department official said: "The US government is the largest humanitarian donor in the world. The WIM should be a constructive space to catalyse action on the wide range of loss and damage issues. A divisive conversation on blame and liability helps no one." Brazil held up agreement over a HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations provision allowing governments to trade in carbon credits . It insisted that its carbon sinks - mainly forests, including the Amazon - should count towards its emissions-cutting goals, while also selling carbon credits derived from preserving forests to other countries to count towards their emissions targets. Other countries said this was double counting and would undermine the carbon trading system. Governments discussed these points for two weeks with little official attention paid to the broader and more urgent issue of how countries can accelerate their plans to cut carbon in the next decade.

Sonam Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, said: "This COP was not able to meet our expectations in raising ambition to address the concerns of our people at home and youth around the world. Now while countries must make transformational improvements to [their emissions reduction] targets by 2020 that put us on a pathway to limit warming to 1.5C." Wangdi pointed to the problems already being seen in some of the poorest nations. "Our people are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. Our communities across the world are being devastated. Global emissions must be drastically and urgently reduced to limit further impacts, and financial support scaled up so our countries can better address climate change and its impacts." Jamie Henn, the strategy director at the pressure group HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations 350.org , said: "The level of disconnect between what this COP should have delivered and what it's on track to deliver is appalling and is a sign that the very foundations of the Paris agreement are being shaken up. A handful of loud countries has hijacked the process and is keeping the rest of the planet hostage." Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a climate and energy thinktank, said: "This is a disastrous, profoundly distressing outcome - the worst I have ever seen. At a time when scientists are queuing up to warn about terrifying consequences if emissions keep rising, and schoolchildren taking to the streets in their millions, what we have here in Madrid is a betrayal of people across the world. It is disgraceful and governments are simply not doing their job of protecting the planet." The most high-profile of those young protesters, Greta Thunberg, tweeted a picture of herself on the way home from the conference on Saturday night. Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany.

January 29, 2020 HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk https://www.gov.uk British High Commission in Bangladesh organised a discussion to convey the UK's ambition for this year's COP26 and its growing collaboration with Bangladesh. On 27 January, the British High Commission in Bangladesh invited government, academic and civil society representation to the High Commissioner's residence to convey the UK's ambition for this year's UN climate change conference (COP26) and its growing collaboration with Bangladesh for advancing the climate agenda towards COP26 and beyond. British High Commissioner HE Robert Chatterton Dickson opened the discussion by reflecting on the global outcomes of COP25 and setting out the UK ambition for COP26. The High Commisssioner said "Climate change is the defining issue of our time. The UK and Bangladesh can form a great partnership to lead global efforts to tackle it. Our combined expertise and leadership mean we can work together to raise the world's ambition before and during COP26, seeking global commitment on adapting to climate impacts and building resilience for the future." Mr Ziaul Hasan ndc, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Focal Point for Bangladesh, delivered the keynote speech. Mr Ziaul Hasan ndc was joined by four distinguished participants of COP25 : Sultana Afroz, Additional Secretary, Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance, Dr Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCAD) and Adviser to the Least Developed Countries Group in UNFCCC; Mohammed Malik, Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.; Sharaban Tahura Zaman, Lecturer, Department of Law, North South University, and LDCs group negotiator at COP25 . The panellists reflected on the process and outcomes of COP25 , the journey to COP26, and opportunities for the UK and Bangladesh to raise global ambition to reduce the emissions gap. DFID Country Representative Judith Herbertson, delivered the closing remarks on UK-Bangladesh cooperation beyond COP26. She said that DFID is planning a new programme to support adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change as well as environmental management in Bangladesh. The DFID Country Reepresentative said The UK, in partnership with Italy, will host COP26 this year in November in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the conference, including heads of state and government; experts; and campaigners. Delegates will be discussing ambitious ways in which the world can lower emissions to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees of warming. While the UK is gearing up for the presidency of COP26, Bangladesh is advancing its preparation to lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Locally-Led Adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). And leading up to COP26, the UK intends to build a stronger partnership with countries like Bangladesh; a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts. As the leading voice against climate impacts, Bangladesh can play a more significant role in the global climate change discourse through COP26. The UK is already a key partner to Bangladesh on disaster management and resilience building. Since 2008, UK and Bangladesh jointly helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones, and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people.

Key international climate talks due to take place in the UK in November have been postponed until 2021. The United Nations Climate Change Conference An announcement from the UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Announcing the postponement, Alok Sharma, the UK business and energy secretary and president-designate of Cop26, said: "The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. "That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26. Patricia Espinosa, the UN climate change chief, said: "Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. "In the meantime, we continue to support and to urge nations to significantly boost climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement." Responding to the postponement of Cop26, Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: "This pause is understandable in light of efforts to stop the pandemic we all now face. "But this should not mean pausing our vital efforts to respond to a climate crisis that is already threatening lives and pushing millions of people deeper into hunger and poverty. "The UK, as host of the summit, must keep global momentum going and cannot miss the opportunity to commit to both a just recovery and a just transition to a greener economy." Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, said: "Postponing Cop26 is the right decision in these unique and difficult circumstances. A huge amount of work has gone into preparing for the event in Glasgow, and that won't be wasted. I very much look forward to Glasgow welcoming the world for a successful Cop26 next year." The UNFCC agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, that was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the chief executive of IIGCC, said investors would support the decision because it "improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis". \</doc>

YOU'RE going to have to wait a little longer for Humber Renewables Awards 2020. The coronavirus outbreak has forced the postponement of the June bash, with a new date of October 2 now confirmed. And it means companies vying for the eight awards welcoming entries have even longer to hone their nominations - with the deadline now put back from May 10 to Monday, August 31. DoubleTree by Hilton Forest Pines Spa & Golf Resort remains the venue, with all sponsors, led by Siemens Gamesa, on board for what promises to be an even more eagerly awaited event. Launched in the week that saw the Humber's green hydrogen ambition brought to the fore and sandwiched between Orsted's two huge projects being built out of the Energy Estuary, key workers continue to accelerate the Energy Estuary's credentials even in the grip of Covid-19. Leading the world when it comes to offshore wind, the Humber has seen critical mass help create the hotbed for a centre of excellence in the past 12 months, as scale brings further opportunity, but this patch isn't purely one focus. Small-scale solar, micro-generation and anaerobic digestion have all been recognised by the Humber Renewables Awards before, and we're looking for the best endeavours of the past 12 months to highlight once more, in what will be the cleanest year yet for energy generating, culminating with the UK hosting the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference in November. Andy Sykes, plant director at Siemens Gamesa's Hull blade plant, said: "We are proud to once again sponsor the Humber Renewables Awards. This region has invested significantly in renewable energy and this has transformed the economy. "This year is set to be the greenest yet for UK energy with record-breaking levels of wind generation and onshore wind farms being built without the support of UK government subsidies. "At Siemens Gamesa, we have been working to counteract climate change for many years and earlier this year we surpassed 100GW of installed wind energy capacity, which is enough clean energy to power almost 83 million European households. This is an important milestone for us which has helped to keep communities going and create thousands of green jobs."

Chile's embattled president has been forced to cancel two major international summits after government concessions failed to defuse weeks of violent protests that have seen thousands of arrests, left at least 20 dead and sent shock waves across Latin America. Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era made HYPERLINK https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/presidente-pinera-informa-chile-ya-no-realizara-la-apec-la-cop-25/883655/ the announcement on Wednesday morning, telling reporters Chile would no longer be able to host November's Apec trade summit and the COP25 UN climate conference the following month. World leaders including Donald Trump and China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been due to attend the first event while climate champions including the teenage activist Greta Thunberg were expected at the second. Pi\'f1era blamed the "difficult circumstances" Chile was facing for the decision and said his government's primary concern had to be "fully restoring public order, security and social peace". "This has been a very difficult decision - which has caused us great pain - because we understand perfectly the importance [of the events] for Chile and for the world," Chile's centre-right president said. "When a father has problems, he must always put his family before everything else. Similarly, a president must always put his own countrymen ahead of any other consideration," Pi\'f1era added. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate change executive secretary, said the UN was "exploring alternative hosting options" for the climate summit after being informed of the decision in a letter from Chile's environment minister. Pi\'f1era said he had warned other world leaders of the cancellation. Chile's protests began in mid-October as HYPERLINK a student-led fight HYPERLINK https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/presidente-pinera-informa-chile-ya-no-realizara-la-apec-la-cop-25/883655/ against a 3.7% hike in metro fares According to HYPERLINK Chile's Human Rights Institute On 18 October Pi\'f1era declared a state of emergency after violence broke out on the streets of the capital, Santiago, later declaring the country "at war" with "evil" delinquents. After such moves failed to quell the unrest, Chile's president tried to placate protesters with a conciliatory televised address in which he asked forgiveness for the "shortsightedness" of the country's political leaders. Pi\'f1era also unveiled a string of progressive economic reforms, a cabinet reshuffle and the decision to end nightly curfews in an effort to calm tensions. But those concessions appear not to have been enough. Daily street marches continue to call for Pi\'f1era's resignation. Schools and offices are functioning sporadically. Lines at supermarkets have eased but little remains of the routine that just two weeks ago led Pi\'f1era to declare Chile an "oasis" in an increasingly volatile region. On Saturday an estimated HYPERLINK https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/presidente-pinera-informa-chile-ya-no-realizara-la-apec-la-cop-25/883655/ 1 million people poured on to the streets of Santiago for a peaceful protest that was reputedly the country's largest since the dying days of \~ HYPERLINK https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/presidente-pinera-informa-chile-ya-no-realizara-la-apec-la-cop-25/883655/ Gen Augusto Pinochet "It is absolutely logical for no one to come. We're in no shape to receive presidents at the moment. I support the decision," said Marcia Ruiz, a 56-year-old protester who was outside La Moneda, Chile's presidential palace, on Wednesday. "The president lost control of this on day one," Ruiz added. "It's sad." The last-minute decision to cancel the UN summit is a blow to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency and will fuel fears that a vicious cycle is emerging in which divisions between and within countries make it impossible for states to act together to deal with the underlying causes of unrest. It is also the second setback for international climate talks in less than a year. Brazil had been due to host COP25 but pulled out last year after the presidential election victory of the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, who has pursued an anti-globalist agenda. A UK government spokesperson said: "We understand Chile's decision to withdraw from hosting COP25 . We will work closely with Chile and other important partners to help ensure that the crucial work due to be undertaken at COP25 is not affected. The UK government remains committed to bringing world leaders together to tackle climate change in Glasgow in 2020." Miguel Crispi, a sociologist and founder of the Chilean political party Democratic Revolution, said: "The cancellation of # COP25 is very bad news. It was a great opportunity to debate the climate crisis. This means the government is assuming that they can't guarantee public order from now until December - and that is also worrying." Peter Hartmann, the director of CODEFF Aysen, an environmental group organizing to protect the wild ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia, said: "It's a shame because the summit was an opportunity for Chile to be more coherent in their environmental outlook and to bring international attention to the environmental issues in Chile." Many activists will now be cancelling flights and hotels in Santiago but several groups are already on their way. School climate strikers from Europe are in the middle of the Atlantic on their way to South America. "We just heard COP25 has been cancelled. We will have a meeting about this now on board, please keep us updated and any ideas are welcome. They can cancel the COP but can't cancel the movement!"

The global Covid-19 pandemic has changed so many things, including the UK's plans to host the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference - also known as Cop26 - which has now been postponed until next year. However, Dr David Cole, director for power generation at Atkins, still has a stark warning for world leaders: "Let's not kid ourselves, the climate crisis needs immediate action." As if to prove his point, the UK government, despite becoming the first major world economy to commit to a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, has HYPERLINK provided little detail since To get a better idea of what the UK's net-zero carbon energy system might look like, and how it might be achieved, Atkins has produced a report: HYPERLINK Engineering Net Zero There's a long way to go, says Chris Ball, managing director of Atkins' nuclear and power business for UK, Europe and the Middle East. He points out that the UK currently HYPERLINK consumes about 300 terawatt hours HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target 645 TWh per year - and all of that [will need to come from] low-carbon generation, which currently accounts for about 150 TWh." Wind power's role in meeting this energy demand is massive, says Andy Thompson, director of offshore wind at Atkins, because it is a comparatively proven technology: "There are technologies we can rely on. When you look at the maturity of this technology and you look at the planning constraints on onshore wind, the size of the turbines, for example - or the amount of land we have for solar - you realise that if you need large-scale build of renewables, offshore wind is the most viable at the moment." The HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target Committee on Climate Change (CCC) report, which recommended that the UK should commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, suggested a scenario where wind could make up to 75GW of the UK's power capacity. "Is it possible? Yes. If we maintain the current build rate [of about 200 turbines a year]. With larger turbines, we can achieve that," says Thompson. Currently, the UK's wind power capacity \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target stands at about 20GW The UK has been the world leader in offshore wind power generation since 2008. Its rapid deployment and ongoing success is partly down to lessons learned in other sectors. "A lot of people who work on corrosion for offshore wind, for example, are bringing expertise they learned from the nuclear sector," says Cerianne Cummings, principal project manager at Atkins, who works primarily on design and foundations for new wind farms. Amy Dowdeswell, a project manager and strategic business development associate at Atkins, who has worked in both oil and gas and renewables markets, echoes that point: "Things we've learned from work on oil and gas platforms we're able to apply to offshore wind-farm maintenance. There's no need for a separate learning curve." Turbine capacity rates - which measure the proportion of time a turbine is generating power - have increased dramatically over the past 30 years. Where a 1990s model might be idle up to 70% of the time, newer models more than HYPERLINK halve that downtime Nuclear is also considered to have a place in the proposed 2050 energy mix: three new plants (including Hinkley Point C, which is currently under construction) account for up to 11% of power generation in the CCC's net-zero carbon scenario. Bandle, who works on Hinkley Point C, spells out why it's difficult to foresee a net-zero carbon future without nuclear power: "A nuclear power station such as Hinkley will power about 6m homes for 60 years. No other technology today comes close to that - you'd need about 8,000 wind turbines to get a similar output." But the high upfront costs of commissioning a plant (despite being offset thereafter by low running costs) have forced the government to seek investment partners for its large-scale nuclear projects, leaving them vulnerable to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target delay and cancellation. HYPERLINK small modular reactors The size of the challenge needs both large nuclear and SMRs working side by side, and with the government yet to make firm, clear announcements on how it plans to make the UK energy mix carbon neutral, SMRs could well have a place in the future energy-generating mix. Yet for all the discussion around the climate crisis, it is the lack of a ubiquitous, urgent understanding among the general public that most concerns Ball. "Every time I flick my light switch at home, the lights come on. That detracts from the message of understanding where our power comes from and where we'll get it from in the future, and this is really important - we have to change that." This article was updated on 3 April 2020 to reflect the decision to postpone the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. \</doc>

new police chief says he wants to engage in a discussion about crime and the challenges facing the force. Chief superintendent Faroque Hussain took office today with two decades of policing experience under his belt. The 42-year-old takes over from previous divisional commander Mark Hargreaves who left the role to take a policing role at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26). Woman left with serious injuries following police incident on A77 Mr Hussain was most recently a strategic firearms commander, having previously been an authorised firearms officer and a tactical firearms commander. Chief Superintendent Hussain said:\~"I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next local police commander for Ayrshire. "I am looking forward to continuing the excellent work and relationships built with local partners and communities across North, East and South Ayrshire by my predecessor chief superintendent Mark Hargreaves. "My priority will be to support our officers and staff ensuring we continue to work hard with our local communities and partners to reduce criminality and help the most vulnerable people across Ayrshire. East Ayrshire Council raise council tax by almost five per cent "I want to engage in a discussion about crime, the challenges facing police and how we will prioritise our activities." Mr Hussain is married with four children aged between three and 17. In May 2019 he was promoted to chief superintendent, head of analysis, performance, demand and productivity. In this role he oversaw the production of Police Scotland's three-year strategic assessment and the introduction of outcome focused public performance reporting. Coronavirus: East Ayrshire Council set aside \£3600,000 to deal with a deadly virus outbreak Mr Hussain began his police career in Glasgow where he served in uniform as a constable and sergeant. He has served in a variety of detective roles within the organised crime and counter terrorism unit from detective sergeant to detective superintendent. This has included secondments to the British Transport Police in London following the 07/07 atrocities and time with the Home Office providing coaching and training to the immigration service. Mr Hussain has also participated in a number of international leadership events that has seen him visit the Middle East and included participation in the US State Department International Visitors Leadership Program. General IYA Widget Mr Hussain added: "As Sir Robert Peel recognised at the beginning of modern policing in the late 1820s, the rule of law, the tacking of crime and effectiveness of policing depend on the quality of the relationship between the police and public. "As the world changes dramatically I need to ensure this fundamental principle remains central. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all of our officers and staff for their continued hard work, professionalism and dedication to the communities of Ayrshire." \</doc>

AT THE Horniman Museum we have a fossil that is between 541 million and 485 million years old. Long before humans were around, this rock shows traces of the living creatures swimming above the seabed. Working at a museum means being a custodian of the longterm, charged with preserving the natural and cultural heritage of the planet for posterity. And therefore we take a long-term view, beyond that of shortterm political and economic cycles. Our collections include meteorites older than the Earth, and fossils from five great extinction episodes. We are now in the sixth, caused principally by humans. As a result, museums have the authority and moral responsibility to speak out about the need to do more to confront the global issues facing us. This year must be remembered as a tipping point, when governments and corporations finally began to do something about the climate and ecological crisis. There were encouraging signs from Davos, but there is still a long way to go before there is anything like a consensus on how to tackle global heating, pollution and extinction. There is a major summit on the UN Convention on Biological Diversity being held in China in October. It will aim to agree on a global biodiversity framework committing governments to take action to protect species in danger of extinction. Glasgow is the host for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. This is the most important global climate meeting since the Paris Agreement was drafted in 2015. If COP26 fails to set a plan of action, it will become more and more difficult to secure a viable future for our children and grandchildren. Museums have a particular voice in this debate. A public hungry for unbiased information, and suggestions for practical actions, can find optimism and inspiration in them. At the Horniman we declared a climate emergency last summer and deposited plastic rubbish in our aquarium tanks in a two-month initiative to highlight ocean pollution. We recently launched a manifesto setting out our actions over the next few years. This includes developing an Environmental Champions scheme to support people to make changes in their own lives, and the Nature And Love project, which encourages visitors to understand the causes of the crisis. The Natural History Museum's new strategy on the "planetary emergency" is bold, and other museums and galleries are responding similarly. We are part of the nation's conscience, and with some 100 million museum visits a year, we have widespread reach. Other parts of the cultural sector are grasping the urgency of the problem as well. But we need rapid and concerted action by governments and corporations if we are to avoid another year going by without significant change. We don't want the museums of the future to record our failure and its consequences.? Nick Merriman is chief executive of the Horniman Museum and Gardens \</doc>

A BISHOPS Castle artist is to carry 10'6" polar bear all the way to Glasgow to highlight concerns over climate change. Bamber Hawes is to make the odyssey, with 'Clarion', later this year in time to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. The 3.2m sculpture of a full size male polar bear will be fixed to a small platform with long poles so it can be carried by two people. It was made with a lightweight frame of thin bamboo poles, with his shape formed from willow withies and heavy duty tissue paper with exterior PVA glue bonding and sealing all together. At the weekend (January 19) it made an appearance on the Stiperstones, where it was photographed at sunset by Andrew Fusek Peters. Bamber is a Bighops Castle-based artist and maker and picture framer. Last year he made a 12' (3.6m) high mammoth from brushwood in the town and a 13' (4m) high willow and tissue paper Trojan Horse for an Extinction Rebellion action in London last October. When asked: 'why a polar bear, and why a pilgrimage?' Bamber replied: "The polar bear is such an iconic animal these days representing the Artic North and the problems of catastrophic ice loss. "I made him in my spare time in my workshop and then was trying to think of a bold way of using him to promote the aims of Extinction Rebellion to wake people up to the real and pressing danger of allowing world leaders to get away with 'business as usual' rather than taking on the responsibilities of the immediate radical change that is so desperately needed. "The walk will start in mid-October so Clarion the Bear will arrive in Glasgow for the beginning of COP26. The total distance will be approximately 300 miles on footpaths, canal towpaths and B roads from Bishops Castle through the West of England and the South West of Scotland. I will do the whole journey, but I will need others to join me as Clarion and I progress through the country. I like the idea of a band of people coming together with a purpose. To walk, to talk, to connect with each other and to connect with the landscape by moving through it slowly. "If people are interested in joining for a single long day's walk please follow me on social media at 'Clarion the Bear' on Instagram and Facebook, where there are details of the route and there will be dates for each leg of the trip.' These images were taken by conservation photographer Andrew Fusek Peters at the top of the Nipstone rocks on the Stiperstones national nature reserve. Andrew has been working for Natural England and the National Trust for the last five years documenting the flora and fauna of the Stiperstones and Long Mynd, where some species are in dangerous decline and the 70 per cent of the heather was recently lost due to climate change (National Trust figures). Andrew's work regularly features in the national media. \</doc>

Countries need to more than double their plans for renewableenergy deployment by 2030, according to a report released during December's UN's COP25 climate-change conference in Madrid, Spain. The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) believes 7.7TW of operational renewable capacity will be needed by 2030 if the world is to limit global warming to "well below" 2oC above pre-industrial levels,in line with the Paris Agreement. But countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs) amount to just 3.2TW of renewable installations by 2030, against 2.3TW at present. Irena said the 7.7TW target can be achieved "in a costeffective way with considerable socio-economic benefits across the world"."Renewables are good for growth,good for job creation and deliver significant welfare benefits," said Francesco La Camera,the agency's director-general. "With renewables,we can also expand energy access and help eradicate energy poverty in line with the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030." Repeat warnings The NDCs in 2020: Advancing Renewables in the Power Sector and Beyond report's warning of the current renewable-energy targets being insufficient to meet global climate targets echoes other recent reports, including the International Energy Agency's analysis of governments' stated policy intentions and targets published in November. A report released to coincide with COP25 showed that global emissions are likely to continue to climb, albeit at a slower rate than in the previous two years. \</doc>

What's wrong with the one that's there? It was good enough for the previous residents of the area. There is also a bridge outside Baird Street police station that looks perfectly useable. Posted online WITH social distancing now part of everyday life it is important to highlight that not everyone can maintain the required distance as easily as others. People who are blind and partially sighted can struggle to know when they are getting closer to someone, or if someone is approaching them. And guide dogs, of course, aren't trained to help in this regard. There have been occasions when individuals have been aggressively berated for coming into too close proximity to others, when the reality is they simply weren't aware of it. In such uncertain times, tensions over distancing can rise. But we would ask that if you feel someone seems to be ignoring the restrictions, consider for a moment whether that person, rather than being careless, might not be able to fully see you.

Australia needs a clear commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 to encourage private investment in low-emissions technology such as renewable energy generation, an investor group has said - but the federal government has confirmed it has no such target and does not intend to set one in the near term. The Investor Group on Climate Change, a collaboration between Australian and New Zealand institutional investors with more than A$2 trillion ($1.3 trillion; (EURO)1.2 trillion) of assets under management that focuses on the impact of climate change on financial investments, said last week that private capital was "critical" in achieving net-zero emissions. "Unlocking this private capital will require a clear signal through an integrated and robust national climate policy suite that Australia is heading for net-zero emissions by 2050 consistent with our international obligations," IGCC director of policy Erwin Jackson said. The federal energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor confirmed last week that the government does not have a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/angus-taylor-says-it-is-not-australian-government-policy-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2050 telling the ABC "our approach is not to have a target without a plan". In a written response dated 12 May, the government told the Australian Parliament it would re-submit its current emissions reduction target before the next United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, also known as COP26, which was due to be held in Glasgow this November but has been postponed until next year due to coronavirus. It added that "Australia's subsequent NDC [nationally determined contributions], including a target to 2035 or 2040, is due to be communicated in 2025". Australia's current commitment is to achieve a 26-28 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 in comparison with 2005 levels. The IGCC made its comments on private capital in response to a HYPERLINK https://consult.industry.gov.au/climate-change/technology-investment-roadmap/supporting_documents/technologyinvestmentroadmapdiscussionpaper.pdf discussion paper that the government published on its Technology Investment Roadmap, which outlined a framework through which it hopes to support investment in low-emissions technologies across a range of industries. The discussion paper said: "This roadmap will bring a strategic and system-wide view to future investments in low-emissions technologies. Our approach will be hard-headed, recognising the economic and technical barriers to widespread deployment today, while remaining optimistic about future advances and the role different technologies may play in the global effort to reduce emissions." It did not contain detailed policy statements, with the government inviting feedback on the paper ahead of the publication of its formal Long-Term Emissions Reduction Strategy later this year. IGCC's Jackson added: "With governments likely to be more fiscally constrained in coming years due to the impact and response to the covid-19 pandemic, private capital will be critical to ensuring a smooth transition to net-zero emissions. "IGCC welcomes that the government will seek specific consultation with the finance sector in further developing its Technology Investment Roadmap, and we look forward to engaging on the opportunities to accelerate private investment flows into zero-carbon technologies. "Unlocking billions of dollars of investment in new industries and new jobs requires a strong partnership between government and institutional investors. Government investment alone will not address the systemic risks that climate change presents to the Australian economy." \</doc>

As young people took to the streets worldwide again on Friday, urging more action to stop the planet heating up, analysts warned the U.N. climate conference taking place over the next two weeks would likely fall short of public expectations. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has inspired a global movement of children who skip school on Fridays to hold marches and rallies demanding politicians treat climate change as an "emergency" and boost efforts to curb planet-warming emissions. In a comment piece written with fellow activists from Chile and Germany, Thunberg said they had a "simple" message for leaders headed to the Madrid talks: "The eyes of all future generations are upon you. Act accordingly." After a year of strikes for climate action, students had succeeded in getting their voices heard in "the corridors of power", but still world leaders "do nothing", they wrote. "We will do whatever it takes to persuade our leaders to unite behind science so clear that even children understand it," they added. This Friday, groups of young Americans are planning a "Black Friday Strike", from Los Angeles to New York, to boycott the celebration of consumer discount shopping and to advocate for "a change to business-as-usual to confront the climate crisis". Andrew Steer, who heads the U.S-based World Resources Institute, noted the rise of "people power" over the past year, with more than 7 million turning out for protests in September as the U.N. chief convened a summit to drive climate action. "The issue is rising on the agenda, both in the United States and globally," Steer told journalists ahead of the Dec. 2-13 U.N. talks in Madrid, known as COP25 . Inand the United States, political contenders have taken part in public debates on climate change ahead of planned elections. Meanwhile, a growing number of governments at national and city level are declaring "climate emergencies", joined on Thursday by the European Parliament. Others, including small-island developing states and some Latin American and African countries, have pledged to work on cutting their emissions to net-zero by mid-century. A total of 68 countries have so far said they intend to raise the ambition of their national climate action plans next year - but they represent only 8% of global emissions. Ahead of COP25 , climate experts said the biggest-emitters - including the United States, Brazil and China - would likely stay "missing in action" as opposition to winding down polluting fossil fuels sharpens among right-wing policymakers. Former Costa Rica climate negotiator M\'f3nica Araya said the "very best" that could be expected from COP25 was "a promise" that countries would upgrade their national climate action plans by the end of 2020, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement. But that outcome would likely seem out of step with the "more angry, urgent moral narrative" shaped by youth-led popular climate strikes around the world since 2018, she noted. "Now more than ever in this COP, we will see a very big gap between the negotiations inside and the emotions outside," said Araya, founder of clean development platform Costa Rica Limpia. Ahead of the Madrid talks, Spain's Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the meeting should mark "the start of a decisive year for climate ambition". It needed to lay the foundation for countries in 2020 to commit to cutting emissions more steeply, as scientists advise, with the aim of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower goal set in the Paris accord, she said. "This is what societies are demanding," Ribera said, noting that efforts would be made to "try to ensure that the demands by young people to raise climate ambition echo throughout COP25 ". In a long-running opinion poll published Friday, Europeans for the first time said the fight to tackle climate change and protect the environment was the most important issue for parliamentarians to address, with 32% putting it as their top priority. The Eurobarometer survey also showed close to six out of 10 European citizens were confident or convinced that youth-led protests had directly impacted national and European policy. Laurence Tubiana, who played a key role in securing the Paris Agreement as France's special envoy, said the student strikers were making governments "show the truth" by speaking "bluntly" about their inadequate response to climate change. "The youth movement has an enormous role to play in keeping governments and business accountable," said Tubiana, now CEO of the European Climate Foundation. At COP events scheduled for next Monday and Thursday, young people will get a chance to voice their views about the need to protect the planet for their own and future generations. Thunberg is sailing back to Europe across the Atlantic on a low-carbon journey to the climate conference after its venue was abruptly moved to Spain from Chile, which has been dogged by violent social unrest. COP25 talks may hamstring broader participation, especially by Latin American activists. The cancellation on Chilean soil disappointed many civil society groups, who could not afford to travel to Spain at short notice, they noted. Araya said the change of venue had been "very painful" for them, with some fearing it would undermine a hoped-for focus on respecting the human rights of environmental defenders, a big issue in South America, which is rich in natural resources. One thread uniting popular climate change movements around the world is a push for governments to take social equity into account when addressing the threat - a conversation that should start at COP25 , analysts said. Niranjali Amerasinghe, executive director of ActionAid USA, said justice issues should be key to climate responses, whether in ensuring a sustainable future for young people or helping poor communities hit hardest by wilder weather and rising seas. "Those things resonate a bit stronger given the (global) political context," she added.

THE economic fallout from Covid-19 will be an important test for the hospitality sector as hotels, pubs, restaurants, travel and leisure businesses alike will be disproportionately impacted. Travel restrictions, event cancellations and individuals' reticence to travel have been immediately felt in the sector. Cashflow will be the greatest test for these businesses as occupancy levels have shown a sharp decline during March with most hotels closed or in the process of closing. This revenue decline has been from the centres out, with large cities with a traditionally strong mix of corporate and leisure demand impacted first. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of the outbreak and counteracting measures, though there are compensating factors which could provide some cushioning during the recovery as and when it commences. Governments and central banks are helping support businesses who have cash flow difficulties. In the UK there is a business rates holiday of 12 months introduced for properties with a rateable value below \£351,000, which is primarily to assist the small businesses. Some owners will cancel investment plans in the short term and redeploy cash into shoring up medium term cash flow. Others may take advantage of the demand shock and delay re-opening some or all of their buildings to facilitate refurbishments while demand levels are low. Longer terms implications will depend on whether we see a "V-curve" a "U-curve" or even a "W-curve" and with cashflows in decline it is possible that some companies could see a fall in the value of their business as investors consider the short-term impact this could have on the hospitality sector. There have also been a significant number of corporate, cultural and sporting events postponed. When normal life resumes these could be quick wins to fill the calendar and stimulate the recovery although with a vaccination estimated to be 18 months away, this could be protracted. The timing of a recovery will be critical for many markets. For example Glasgow is still hoping to host the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference in November. Likewise, if bans on mass gatherings were to be implemented for a prolonged period of time this would have a severe impact on the larger conferences and other major events taking place across the UK. During the Edinburgh Festival in August many hotel owners can expect to realise in excess of 25% of their annual profits, which is now potentially at risk. There is no doubt that this is a challenging time for the global hospitality sector which has been through difficult times before with the SARS outbreak, financial crisis and terror attacks, but still managed to bounce back strong. We can of course draw parallels from these previous difficulties to help understand its impact and prepare ourselves for the times ahead. But the hope is that as fast as this virus arrived, the hospitality sector will bounce back just as quickly. Kerr Young, UK hotels & hospitality director at JLL, is based in Edinburgh \</doc>

The 16-year-old climate activist, who was joined by the golden retriever and black Labrador at Stockholm's harbour on Tuesday morning, captioned the photo: 'Home!' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Thunberg, who was recently named TIME magazine's 'Person of the Year', has been on a continent-spanning climate campaign since sailing to the UN conference in New York in August. But after making it back for the COP25 climate summit in Madrid last week, Thunberg had a rocky journey home when she lashed out at Europe's largest rail operator. The teen was locked in a Twitter spat over the weekend when she shared a photo of herself sitting on the floor of a train carriage heading through Germany. Thunberg's transatlantic odyssey August 14: Sets sail from Plymouth, England. She had planned to travel south to Chile for the COP25 climate summit but because of political unrest it was relocated to Madrid. 'It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way,' she tweeted in November. November 13: Sets sail from Hampton, Virginia. December 3: Arrives in Lisbon, Portugal. December 9: Takes part in a massive rally in Madrid for COP25 . December 13: Fridays for Future protest in Turin, Italy. December 14: Train from Basel, Switzerland, north through Germany. Deutsche Bahn reacted sarcastically to her apparent complaint about 'overcrowding,' and reliably informed the world that Thunberg had been upgraded to First Class. Thunberg had written on Saturday: 'Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I'm finally on my way home!' In a stinging reply, DB said: 'Dear #Greta, thank you for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change! We were pleased that you were on the ICE (Inter City Express) 74 with us on Saturday. And with 100 percent green electricity. 'It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.' Thunberg swiftly replied: 'Our train from Basel was taken out of traffic. So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains. After G\'f6ttingen I got a seat. This is no problem of course and I never said it was. 'Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!' DB followed up their tweets with a press release, in which they added that Greta's travel companions 'were sitting in first class from Frankfurt onwards'. Her online run-in with DB came just a day after she had spoken before a furious climate protest in Turin, Italy, and said that she would 'put world leaders against the wall' if they continued running away from their climate obligations. She later apologised for the remark, made after the summit in Madrid, claiming that a Swedish phrase had been lost in translation. 'Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said "put them against the wall". That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable. That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language.' Ms Thunberg wrote. 'But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I can not enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement - are against any possible form of violence. It goes without saying but I say it anyway.' And that followed on the heels of another high-profile Twitter storm after Thunberg was named TIME's 'Person of the Year.' President Donald Trump - who was given the accolade in 2016 - tweeted that she had £nger management problems' and told her to 'chill'. Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to include the words 'currently chilling'. Thunberg's journey through Germany was the last leg of a continent-spanning trip which began when she travelled to New York on a low-emissions yacht in August. Th 16-year-old activist started a worldwide movement last year when she began to strike from school every Friday to protest government inaction on climate change. Refusing to fly, she has twice crossed the Atlantic by boat in recent months in order to speak at a UN climate summit in New York and the hastily rearranged COP25 summit in Madrid. \</doc>

Australian couple will sail climate activist Greta Thunberg from the US to Spain Swedish campaigner had issued plea for help crossing back over the Atlantic   The COP25 conference had been re-located at last minute from Chile to Spain The Swedish 16-year-old refuses to fly by plane because of the carbon footprint An Australian couple will sail teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg almost 6,300km from the US to Spain so she can attend a UN climate meeting. The Swedish campaigner, 16, revealed on Wednesday she had received an invite from couple Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu to take her to the COP25 conference in Madrid. The group - who will sail on a 48ft catamaran called La Vagabonde - will leave Hampton, Virginia this week. Ms Thunberg had issued a plea on social media for help getting back across the Atlantic Ocean after the summit was moved at the last minute from Santiago in Chile to Madrid due to the protests in the South American country. 'So happy to say that I'll hopefully make it to COP25 in Madrid,' she said in a post on Wednesday. 'I've been offered a ride from Virginia, USA, on the french 48ft sailing catamaran La Vagabonde. 'The two Australians Riley Whitelum, Elayna Carausu and Nikki Henderson from England will take me across the Atlantic Ocean.' Weather dependent, their journey is expected to take about three weeks. Mr Whitelum said in a statement they had seen 'the beauty of this planet first hand and think that it is something we should all strive to protect.' 'It is something I have considered even more since having a child,' he said. The Australian couple have spent several years sailing around the world and have recently had a son, Lenny, together. They have a YouTube channel boasting more than 1.1million subscribers called Sailing La Vagabonde, which documents their travels onboard the boat. 'Through our videos we hope to inspire others to explore alternative options of living and to spread ocean awareness,' the couple said in their channel description. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Ms Thunberg refuses to fly in planes because of the carbon footprint.

TEENAGE activist Greta Thunberg said the world was underestimating "angry children" as she arrived after a three-week journey across the Atlantic ahead of this year's international climate summit in Spain. Her arrival came as the United Nations said this decade will be the warmest on record, with 2019 among the top three hottest years in history. "Everyone should do what they can to be on the right side of history; no country is doing enough," Ms Thunberg said after being welcomed at a Lisbon port by Mayor Fernando Medina. She made the three-week journey on a catamaran with a British navigator and an Australian sailing couple after the summit was moved from Chile to Madrid because of civil unrest in its original host country. Promising to continue her journey to the Spanish capital after a couple of days' rest, Ms Thunberg said she would "fight so that the voices of the people and the young would be heard from the other side of the wall. People are underestimating the power of angry children. We are annoyed and frustrated, but for good reason." Ms Thunberg is expected to speak at the COP25 summit, where countries will attempt to finalise the rules for the roll-out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Recent days have seen several reports on the state of global warming which are intended to put pressure on countries to reach a consensus. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) yesterday said global temperatures so far this year were 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average between 1850 and 1900, meaning that 2019 could turn out to be the hottest year of all those not affected by the El Ni\'f1o phenomenon. Opening the COP25 Supporters of Ms Thunberg hope that she will lead a demonstration being organised by youth groups against climate change on Friday. Among a group of young protesters who gathered outside Spain's parliament on the eve of COP25 , many expressed similar anger and frustration as their Swedish idol. "I'm angry and annoyed with our politicians who do nothing," says Paula Mancebo, a 20-year-old university student from Madrid. "Older people think this is not going to affect them and they are just going to take as much as they can while they can, but it's going to affect everyone.

Glasgow has topped the bill for hotel investment north of the Border, a new report reveals. Scotland's major cities have all been named among the most active areas for hotel investment last year - with Glasgow finishing in top spot - according to analysis from property consultancy Knight Frank. The firm's UK Hotel Capital Markets Investment Review found that there was some \£3260 million-worth of hotel deals last year in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Glasgow was the most active city in Scotland, and third in the UK outside of London, with \£3170m spent across nine transactions in 2019, comprising of more than 1,700 rooms. Beyond the main tourist destinations there was also significant deal activity, the study noted, with 12 assets - consisting of around 900 rooms changing hands for approximately \£3115m. The sale of the Fairmont St Andrews hotel was the biggest deal of the year in the Scottish "secondary" market, contributing about 45 per cent of the total investment figure. Desirable John Rae, head of Knight Frank's Glasgow office, said: "It's been a strong year for investment in Glasgow hotels - a reflection of the fact that it is emerging as a highly desirable tourist and events destination. United Nations climate change conference later this year is indicative of the scale of events that Glasgow can now host and it is a huge opportunity to highlight all the city has to offer. "There are a substantial number of hotel rooms to be added in Glasgow over the next few years, with a range of well-known and boutique operators confirmed or planning new premises in the city. "As they come on stream, we expect hotel investment activity to remain strong in the years ahead as investors increasingly look to alternative property assets." The report also found that hotel deals in Scotland have been boosted by the growing popularity of "ground rents" transactions - a form of sale and long-term lease back deal that involves delivering steady income for investors and guaranteed access to a property for a hotel operator. According to Knight Frank's analysis, ground rent transactions have accounted for about \£3100m of assets over the last three years, including the Hotel Indigo Glasgow, Marriott Moxy Aberdeen, and Apex Edinburgh, which it described as a "noteworthy uplift" on previous years. Alasdair Steele, head of Scotland commercial at Knight Frank, said: "We have seen a significant increase in the number of ground rents deals since 2017, as investors seek out sources of secure, long-term income and hotel operators look to free up cash to invest in their businesses. "They are also proving popular with similar types of occupiers, including the student accommodation and healthcare sectors. We expect ground rents to grow in popularity in Scotland, both among investors and occupiers in line with the rest of the UK." Earlier this week hotels group Macdonald Hotels said it had sold a landmark East Lothian hotel to a US property firm. The Macdonald Marine Hotel in North Berwick is set to undergo "extensive renovations" \£dfollowing the sale to AJ Capital Partners.

MICHAEL Gove has declined to answer questions on who will take over as chair of a crucial climate event set to take place in Glasgow later this year. Speaking at a conference in London held by the environmental think tank Green Alliance, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, pictured, refused to be drawn in on who would take over as president of November's 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference , otherwise known as COP26. Former minister Claire O'Neill was abruptly sacked from the role at the end of last month - but Gove said he is waiting, like everyone else, for the announcement expected later this week. Asked whether he himself would like the role, he said: "I am very happy with the job that I have and there are many, many other people who could do the job of COP president better than I ever could." READ MORE:\~Nicola Sturgeon requests role for Scotland in COP summit planning A number of high-profile Tory figures, including David Cameron and William Hague, are said to have turned down the position. Gove also said that the UK Government needs to do more to tackle climate change, commenting that "even as we do celebrate what we've achieved, be in no doubt the Government recognises there's so much more we need to do in order to genuinely demonstrate leadership". "It is not enough to look at the trajectory in the past. We have to be more ambitious in the future." He added: "One of the reasons we think it's so important is not just because we're hosting COP but also because we believe the UK has a moral responsibility to lead." A member of the audience soon called him out, however, saying there was a need for more than "recognition of the need to act" which had already been made 20 years ago. READ MORE:\~Prime Minister insists COP26 will be fantastic despite shambolic organisation At the same conference, Nicola Sturgeon told the audience that it is "vital" that the future event is successful in the face of the urgent need for climate action. The First Minister said that the Scottish Government would work "closely and constructively" with the UK Government in order to deliver the summit. Asked about the handling of the event so far, she said she was "concerned" about O'Neill's sacking, but hoped those concerns would be laid to rest upon the announcement of the new appointment to the role. She added: "It's vital that COP is a success. It's a massive opportunity and we have a duty - and I take that duty as First Minister of Scotland very seriously - to do everything we can to make it a success because that's certainly in Scotland's interest, but it's in the interest of the UK as a whole and most importantly in the interest of the planet." She also highlighted to the conference that Scotland has world-leading targets to reach net zero by 2045 and had produced a budget that would help towards doing so. \</doc>

BORIS JOHNSON'S reshuffle tomorrow will not be "a revolution", Government sources said last night, as Cabinet ministers prepared for a limited shakeup in which several Remainers will be promoted at the expense of Leavers. The Prime Minister was putting the finishing touches to a reshuffle which he hopes will decisively put the bitter three years of arguments about Brexit behind him. The scale of the reshuffle has been radically pared back since speculation of a much wider shake-up in the immediate aftermath of the general election. The source added: "It is not going to be a revolution." Chloe Smith, Oliver Dowden and Lucy Frazer - all Remain supporters - are tipped to be promoted to the Cabinet at the expense of Brexit supporting ministers such as Geoffrey Cox, Andrea Leadsom and Theresa Villiers. Ms Villiers, the Environment Secretary, is also widely expected to be sacked, leaving Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, as the only member of the Cabinet who consistently voted against Theresa May's Brexit deal. Brexiteers including Mr Johnson, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House of Commons all backed her deal at third "meaningful vote" last March. One Government source said: "The labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' were binned as soon as we got Brexit done - no one mentions them now." In other changes Mark Spencer, the Chief Whip, is understood by two Westminster sources to be "pushing" to take over at the top of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Mr Spencer is one of four partners in CH Spencer and Son, a farming business based in Mapperley, Notts, which receives up to \£315,000 a year under the CAP. Mr Spencer did not return a request for comment. The Government is committed to replacing the CAP funding for farmers with payments for "public goods" such as giving access to the countryside. In other moves Chris Pincher, a minister of state in the Foreign Office, could be brought in to run the Whips' Office. Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is tipped to be given overall control of the talks about a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Jake Berry, the Northern Powerhouse minister, could be given a full time Cabinet position, while Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park is tipped for a role at the COP26 United Nations climate change conference in November under Mr Gove's leadership. Ben Wallace, the Defence Secre tary, and Mrs Leadsom, the Business Secretary, are both expected to be de moted. Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, has been shored up after she was name-checked by Mr Johnson in his trade speech last week. No10 sources confirmed at the weekend that Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is safe. \</doc>

Insiders at Whitehall have told the paper that the former Prime Minister was given the opportunity by Mr Johnson to head the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , which is coming up in November. It is a move which is set to show the Government's commitment to climate change. It is thought that Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson - who have shared a rivalry since their days together at Eton College - have recently mended their former fractious relationship. Related articles But Mr Cameron has reported to have rejected the proposal. And this means Mr Johnson will have to turn to a ministerial appointment to head the conference. One of the names touted is Lord Hague, a former Tory leader and foreign secretary, according to Telegraph sources. Initially Tory sources had indicated her successor would be a "Tory big beast", someone with a huge profile worldwide plus a history of delivering major projects. But with Mr Cameron's rejection, is it thought the Prime Minister will turn to Lord Goldsmith, following a reshuffle, who's a reputable environmentalist. Officials who have been working on COP26 are thought to be taken under control of the Tory Government soon. Despite the snub, Mr Cameron was full of praise for the Prime Minister last week. He hailed him as a "visionary" leader, and that he would go on to be a brilliant Prime Minister, just so "long as he carries on being well behaved." Indeed, the pair have seemingly put water under the bridge, according to the Mail on Sunday. The news comes as Mr Cameron's entourage was left red-faced as one of the former Prime Minister's bodyguards left a loaded Glock in a British Airways fight's toilets. A passenger was shocked to find the 9mm pistol in the toilets, with a mass panic ensuring onboard the transatlantic flight. The plane even had to be grounded for over an hour before the pilot announced that certain personnel on board the flight were allowed to carry such weapons for the commute. But one sticky passenger refused to accept the situation, and the gun was finally removed from the plane. The retrieved weapon is thought to be a 9mm Glock 17 pistol that the close-protection officer had taken off his weapons holster to use the toilet - but had forgotten to pick up again. A source said to the Express they were just glad the gun been found by a passenger who informed the crew staff. They said they were thankful it had been picked up by someone who did the right thing. "If it had been found by someone with malign intent it could have turned into a very serious incident for everyone on board." Scotland yard confirmed the officer involved in the incident has been suspended, pending an investigation. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police Service said: "We are aware of the incident on a flight into the UK on February 3 and the officer involved has since been removed from operational duties. We are taking this matter extremely seriously and an internal investigation is taking place."

29th Jan 2020 - 10:55am Liontrust Sustainable team challenges companies on zero carbon emissions strategy Submitted 29/01/2020 - 10:55am The Liontrust Sustainable Investment team today announces it is stepping up its engagement with companies to ensure that they reduce their absolute carbon emissions to zero. This is to ensure the companies the team invests in will continue to be profitable and attractive in the ultra-low carbon world of the future. \~ The Liontrust Sustainable fund managers believe companies that are being proactive on reducing carbon emissions, and are able and willing to articulate this in their business strategy, will gain a competitive advantage and generate better investment returns. Those that do not will face increasing risks to their businesses. \~ The One and a Half Degree Transition Challenge is calling for all companies held within the team's equity and bond funds to explain before the end of 2020 the strategy to decarbonise their businesses to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. \~ Over 200 companies held across the funds have until the end of 2020 to provide a plan for how they are going to reach zero carbon emissions and over what time period this will be achieved. The team is also asking for evidence that companies will have started the process of reducing carbon emissions before the end of this year. \~ The global companies held within the funds have a capitalisation of more than GBP2 billion and those listed in the UK have a capitalisation above GBP500 million. \~ The team will report on how the companies it is invested in are progressing towards ultra-low carbon emissions in preparation for the COP26 (the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ), which starts in Glasgow on 9 November 2020. \~ The Sustainable Investment fund managers will use all measures at their disposal, including voting and ultimately divesting over time, to persuade companies to reduce their absolute carbon emissions to zero. The team have been engaging with companies on reducing carbon emissions for two decades, with the result that their funds are already up to 77% less carbon intensive than their respective indices and have up to 30% invested in companies accelerating the shift to a lower carbon economy. \~ The urgency of this engagement, the need for companies to increase their ambition and to speed up the pace of positive change, however, is accelerating as the science is showing the increasing impact of the climate crisis. \~ Harriet Parker, Investment Manager on the Liontrust Sustainable Investment team, says: \€  Companies that do not develop and enact a rapid decarbonisation of their business activities will face rising costs and risk to their future success. They need to start the transition now. \~ \€  We are not being prescriptive on how companies achieve zero carbon emissions, although we expect it to include energy efficient products, low carbon energy, renewables and improving building efficiencies.\€ \~ Mike Appleby, Investment Manager, adds: \€  Companies need to set a date for achieving this, identify the key challenges that need to be met and how they will accomplish the target.\~ \~ \€  Given the scale of the challenge, all companies will need to play their part, even those in parts of the economy that are not the most carbon intensive.\€ Tags \</doc>

A major summit where Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping were set to sign an interim agreement to end the 15-month trade war, has been cancelled by Chile's president. Sebastian Pinera blamed ongoing protests for the decision to call off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting (APEC) slated for 16-17 November. He also cancelled the United Nation's COP25 climate summit scheduled for the first two weeks of December. Mr Pinera said he had taken the "painful" decision to better focus on restoring law and order to the country following 12 days of protests in the South American country which has left 18 people dead. Demonstrators demanding greater economic equality and better public services have forced the shutdown of numerous subway stations. Some have resorted to vandalism and arson. "This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP25 for Chile and for the world," Mr Pinera said. Mr Trump and Mr Xi had been expected to sign an interim agreement to end the 15-month trade war between their nations at the APEC summit. Meanwhile the UN's COP25 summit on climate was to be the latest iteration of the influential meeting of world leaders to tackle green issues. The conferences have previously marked global turning points in the campaign to resolve climate issues - including in 2015 when it was used as the backdrop of the Paris Climate Agreement. The UN is urgently seeking a new venue for the conference, but said it may need to delay the event after Chile became the first country to pull out of the event at such short notice. "We have lost a unique opportunity in the country's history," said Matias Asun, Chile director for Greenpeace. He added it was a "huge failure for the government in the face of environmental demands and injustices facing the country". It comes as Mr Pinera attempts to hold onto power in his homeland after the violent protests. The unrest began when students opposed to a 4 per cent rise in train fares began demonstrations. But they quickly escalated into anger over the cost of living across the country. Mr Pinera has blamed the resulting protests and riots on "criminals" and declared a state of emergency in the country's capital Santiago where soldiers were deployed for the first time since the country was ruled by a military dictatorship. Chile's embattled leader also fired almost half his cabinet this week - including his finance, interior and economy ministers - in a bid to quell protests which had little impact in the country where low wages, underfunded health systems and low pensions have caused financial difficulties for millions. The country suffers one of the worst rates of income inequality among OECD countries - with only Costa Rica and South Africa experiencing a greater divide between the rich and the poor. \</doc>

THE policing bill for this year's climate change summit in Scotland could be more than \£3200million, the nation's chief constable has warned. Iain Livingstone said the figure is a 'very indicative' estimate of the cost of policing the UN conference in November. And he insisted Police Scotland should not be expected to bear the brunt of the enormous bill. An estimated 90,000 people, including around 200 world leaders, are expected to take part in the highprofile Glasgow event. Police also believe a march planned to coincide with the summit could attract as many as 500,000 climate change demonstrators. Speaking at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), Mr Livingstone said officers will be brought in from every force in the UK, with the cost of housing them potentially running into tens of millions of pounds. Mr Livingstone said: 'There cannot be detriment to the funding of the police service in Scot-land as a result of us delivering on the UK Government's intention to host this conference on climate change in Glasgow. Mr Livingstone said the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP26, will be 'one of the biggest events ever hosted in the UK, with a significant number of heads of state expected to attend, as well as tens of thousands of delegates'. He also warned it would attract 'significant and legitimate demonstrations and protests'. Mr Livingstone said: 'It will focus the attention of the world on the collective ability of Scotland to host a safe, secure and productive international conference with empathy and integrity. 'Policing will be central to that and the supporting police operation required is of itself a significant undertaking. 'Our early assessment indicates the policing cost of COP26 could potentially exceed \£3200million.' Mr Livingstone said the scale of the summit, which runs from Novermber 9 to November 20, was comparable to previous high-profile events such as the G8 summit. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins warned of the huge numbers that could gather for any protest marches. He said: 'We could reasonably anticipate in excess of 100,000 people, that's a conservative estimate because when it happened in Madrid it was reported it was 500,000 people that took to the streets.' Mr Livingstone said his 'key priorities' are to police the event 'while of course ensuring that the citizens of Scotland are effectively protected'. But he added: 'Any suggestion the conference will not impact on the wider community is fanciful.' The authority was also warned of growing concern over the 'structural deficit' in the force's budget, where a shortfall of cash has been allowed to build up. SPA vice chairman David Crichton said 'difficult choices' will have to be made, as the majority of the budget has been allocated to cover officer and staff costs. He said: 'Frankly, current officer numbers are not sustainable within the existing budget so something has to change. The deficit is simply going to continue to increase if something does not change.' 'Officer numbers not sustainable' 'Seeking full cost recovery' \</doc>

UN climate talks broke up in acrimony yesterday, with countries failing to agree new rules for a global carbon trading market after two weeks of fraught negotiations in Madrid. The talks, known as COP25 , ran two days over time and set a record for the longest climate negotiations, but yielded no big achievements and left international efforts to address global warming stalled despite mounting warnings from climate scientists. "The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis," said Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general. Global carbon dioxide emissions rose to record levels this year, millions of students led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg marched in climate protests and leading economies adopted new "net zero" emissions targets. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the outcome was "totally unacceptable", adding: "Governments need to completely rethink how they do this." There was also dismay among some business leaders. " COP25 has been mired in the politics of low ambition in a way that is totally out of step with the [need for] urgent collective action," said Eliot Whittington, head of the European Corporate Leaders Group. The failure of COP25 to agree on the carbon market rules will complicate the task facing the UK as it takes over the presidency of the next UN climate talks in Glasgow next year. Geopolitical tension and the low-profile stance taken by the US and China, the world's two biggest emitters, severely handicapped the negotiations, which descended into open bickering on the plenary floor in the final hours. The Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C, has been signed by 197 countries. But the agreement operates by consensus, and the original 2015 deal left many details to be worked out in future summits, a task made more complicated by fraying multilateralism and increased US opposition. The US is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord. The withdrawal of the US, and efforts by Brazil and Australia to water down the outcome, helped lead to a result that many countries said was dismaying. But Brazil also expressed disquiet. "We find it very frustrating that at the end of the day we were not able to arrive at a final agreement," a Brazilian delegate said. The EU delegation said it was disappointed by the lack of accord on carbon markets. It was "deeply concerned" that countries' existing climate targets were far off track from what was needed to achieve the goals of the Paris accord. The UK's handling of next year's summit is set to be one of the biggest diplomatic challenges after Brexit for prime minister Boris Johnson. Climate talks page 3 \</doc>

Event The government has announced that two major international summits scheduled to take place in the capital, Santiago, will no longer go ahead there, amid ongoing protests and civil unrest. Analysis The decision to cancel the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum's 21-country summit, scheduled for November 16th-17th, and Chile's withdrawal as the host of the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (known as COP25 ), scheduled for December 2nd-13th (which has been transferred to the Spanish capital, Madrid), came in light of the unrest that has paralysed the country over the past few weeks. During a televised address to explain the decision, the president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, said that, although difficult and painful, it was necessary in order to prioritise the government's efforts to address some of the popular demands that triggered the wave of protests. The move is one of a series of measures taken by Mr Pi\'f1era's government in recent days to quell discontent. These have included a major shake-up of his cabinet, which resulted in changes in eight ministries, including new heads in the interior, finance, economy and labour ministries. The APEC forum was meant to provide a backdrop for a long-elusive interim trade deal between US and China; its cancellation will impact negatively on Chile's image abroad. The decision to pull out of hosting the COP25 summit is also likely to undermine Mr Pinera's efforts to raise Chile's profile by championing environmental campaigns. \</doc>

While many airlines are engaged in a variety of programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, new research from the University of Surrey suggests they must do much more to reduce air pollution and tackle climate change effectively. A new research paper was published this month by Professor Susanne Becken and Mr Paresh Pant in connection with leading travel technology company Amadeus. The paper, which looks at the true effectiveness of airline carbon emission initiatives, was officially launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December with an audience of over 200 government representatives and climate change activists including Greta Thunberg. The objective of Professor Becken's paper is to consolidate airline initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to understand the impact of these initiatives in the fight against climate change and how can we accelerate the speed at which emissions are being tackled at global level. Professor Becken, Vice-Chancellor Research Fellow at the University of Surrey and Professor of Sustainable Tourism at Griffith University in Australia, found that both biofuel and carbon offsetting may not present long-term viable solutions, although they present short-term opportunities to contribute to climate change mitigation. In particular, alternative fuels are often mentioned in the media as the solution to decarbonising air travel, but many biofuels have a negative climate impact and any use should be based on thorough examination of the net carbon impact. Synthetic fuels and electric aircraft are more likely to achieve emission reductions, but at this point these solutions are not available at a commercial scale. The biggest surprise in the review was that even progressive airlines who boast bold initiatives are still growing their total emissions, despite some making considerable improvements in carbon efficiency per available seat kilometre. Professor Becken said: 'This is the first time that research has identified the details of how inadequate most airline initiatives are in terms of meeting global climate goals. Most airlines these days would say that they reduce weight or improve aircraft efficiency, but when we actually look at the numbers the saving is very small - often less than 0.1% compared with 5% or more of annual growth. 'While airline carbon emission initiatives set out to make a difference, the reality is that they are ineffective and carbon emissions continue to grow. At this point, and for an individual traveler, there is really only one way to substantially reduce emissions and that is to fly less. For unavoidable travel, and as a short-term measure, there is carbon offsetting.' The paper recommended to invest heavily into research and development of truly carbon neutral fuels, such as synthetic fuels using CO2 from the air, in addition to governments' move towards taxing air travel to dissuade extravagant flyers. Providing better travel alternatives like rail travel or encouraging travelling closer to home will help shift embedded travelling behaviours resulting from over-accessible flying, complemented by no-fly movements such as flightshaming.

GLOBAL efforts to tackle climate change have stalled due to a lack of ambition, the UN Secretary General has said, as the COP25 conference in Madrid drew to a close with a watereddown agreement. The 197 parties to the UN talks agreed to the need for new emissions cuts yesterday morning after negotiators worked through the night. But they stopped short of concrete commitments and left the outstanding issues of the Paris Agreement undecided. "The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition," said Antonio Guterres. "But we must not give up, and I will not give up." Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris accord and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: "The result of this is really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed." Brazil, Australia and the United States were singled out for their refusal to compromise on their emissions targets. The European Union had led a coalition of countries who were calling for greater commitments and resistance to compromises over carbon trading - the remaining unsolved aspect of the Paris Agreement. Brazil in particular had led a push to be able to "double count" its carbon emissions cuts, selling credits to other countries while also counting them towards its own targets. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission climate chief, had earlier in the week told the COP25 conference that "no deal was better than a bad deal" when it came to carbon markets. Perhaps the most important moment during the two-week talks came in Brussels this week, when the commission launched its Green New Deal plan to cut EU carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The lack of progress in Madrid sets up the UK for a tough diplomatic challenge in November 2020 when it hosts the next COP in Glasgow. " COP25 "From countries who felt this was an unimportant bump in the road en route to Glasgow, and from a presidency that - in the face of opportunistic blockers including the US, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia - defaulted to proposing a lowest common denominator outcome." The snail's pace of the talks was in marked contrast to the alarm and sense of urgency raised by activists and scientists. In the days leading up to the agreement, reports noted that global emissions had risen since 2015, and current warming was on track to lead to a 3C (37F) increase in world temperature.

In view of the ongoing social crisis and civil unrest, foreign policy issues-such as regional and global integration efforts-will be put on the back burner, as the government will be forced to redirect its focus towards policies aimed at restoring domestic stability. For example, the government decided to withdraw as the host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit of 21 countries, which was scheduled to be held in November 2019 in Santiago but was cancelled owing to protests. It also withdrew from hosting the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (known as COP25 ), which subsequently took place in December in Madrid (instead of Santiago). The decision to pull out of hosting COP25 has undermined Mr Pi\'f1era's efforts to raise his country's profile by advancing environmental campaigns; it has also had a negative effect on Chile's international standing. One of the major criticisms facing the Pi\'f1era administration internationally is its negligent response to bouts of human rights abuses. Four international organisations-Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and (most recently) the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR)-have issued reports condemning police brutality and the government's mishandling of the issue. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights-who happens to be Chile's former president, Michelle Bachelet (2006-10; 2014-18)-is sending a team to investigate the allegations of abuse. UN investigators say that they have verified four cases of unlawful deaths involving state agents, and the most recent report published by the UNHCHR on December 13th 2019 stated that there had been 113 cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees; this has further weakened the Pi\'f1era government's standing with global leaders. \</doc>

Telefonica has taken advantage of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid to announce five new environmental pledges ahead of achieving its ultimate target of carbon neutrality by 2050. The goals set out by COO Angel Vila include reducing its energy consumption per unit of data traffic by 85 percent in 2025 and using 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. Other commitments are halving overall emissions by 2025 and reducing them by 70 percent in 2030 on the way to zero-net emissions 20 years later, and avoiding 10 tons of CO2 for every ton produced by 2025. \</doc>

AGuildfordwoman is part of a team sailing activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic for aUNclimate change conference. Yachtswoman Nikki Henderson is sailing from the United States to Madrid, Spain, with the 16-year-old campaigner, along with Australian YouTube couple Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu. Thunberg initially travelled over to the States by yacht in August and has since found herself stranded after the COP25 climate meeting location was changed from Chile. The Nobel peace prize nominee will now be using a 48ft catamaran named 'La Vagabonde', which was due to set sail from Virginia on Wednesday morning (November 13). Guildford resident Henderson, 26, initially rose to fame in 2018 after becomingthe youngest-ever professional skipper in the world's largest ocean race- the 40,000 nautical mile Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. Today's top stories She ended upfinishing the mammoth racein second place. The YouTubers have more than one million subscribers and journey around the world with their young son. Swedish teenager Thunberg had initially put out a social media appeal on November 1 to ask for help in making the journey across to Europe, as she refuses to travel by aeroplane.

What is COP25 ? The Conference of the Parties: United Nations jargon for the annual meeting of nearly 200 countries to talk climate change. Where is it happening? There has been a game of musical chairs concerning who is hosting. Originally, it was Brazil, which later backed out. Then Chile stepped in, but social unrest in Santiago saw the conference moved to Madrid in Spain at the eleventh hour. Who is going? Around 30 heads of state, plus the UN secretary general, Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a catamaran to attend, as she didn't want to fly back from the US, where she gave a passionate and often angry address at UN climate talks in September. What is the aim of the talks? They are largely a stepping stone to 2020, the most important year for global climate efforts since the Paris deal was agreed in 2015. That is because countries are expected to upgrade their carbon-curbing plans and potentially outline their long-term plans to get to net-zero emissions, ahead of a crunch summit in Glasgow next year, COP26. In the meantime, the talks in Madrid need to tidy up outstanding questions about the rules of the Paris Agreement. Like what? Largely technical stuff \- but with real effects. One issue is how international carbon trading between countries, known as Article 6, will work. The key there is to ensure the rules avoid double counting carbon credits. Timelines and clarity for when countries should submit carbon plans in 2020 should also be set. What are the expectations like? Mood music for COP25 has set the bar low. That's partly because the UN summit that Guterres organised in New York in September failed to catalyse significant new action by world leaders. The hope is that, at a time when the US has begun to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement, countries will reaffirm their commitment to the framework that secured the deal. "I think COP25 can deliver, at the very best, a promise to do what governments agreed in Paris," says M\'f3nica Araya, a former climate negotiator for Costa Rica. Who are the key players? The US played a vital role in the run-up to Paris, which continued until Donald Trump became president. Araya sees leadership in smaller nations, such as New Zealand, which recently passed a law to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. But the focus is on China and the EU. Why are they so important? The EU's member states could reach an agreement on a net-zero 2050 target on 12 December. The expectation is that the EU and China will make an announcement at a joint summit next September in the run-up to COP26, detailing their more ambitious carbon plans, in a similar way to an influential move by the US and China before the 2015 Paris summit. But tensions have flared between China and the EU over the latter's recent proposals for a "carbon border tax", which could complicate matters. \</doc>

At the Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) being held in Madrid, the EIB and Iberdrola today announced two new agreements to promote climate action by investing in renewable energy projects and electricity distribution networks. To do so, the Vice-President of the EU bank Emma Navarro and the President of Iberdrola Ignacio Galan agreed two loans for a total of EUR 690m. EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, head of climate action at the Bank and its operations in Spain and Latin America, remarked: 'We are delighted to be signing these agreements at the Madrid Climate Change Conference, because they are a great example of the EIB's efforts to support climate action inside and outside of Europe. To fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we need to mobilise resources on an unprecedented scale, and the EIB is seeking to lead the response to this challenge. We are the EU's climate bank, and that is why we have strengthened our climate ambition. We are working on mobilising up to EUR 1tn over the coming decade through projects that, like the ones we are supporting today, are going to help with the transition towards a low-carbon economy by promoting renewable energies.' Ignacio Galan expressed his satisfaction for sealing this deal during the Climate Change Conference. 'The byword for this COP is the need to start taking action, and that is what Iberdrola and the EIB are doing today: undertaking specific actions that will help to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5-degreeC' He also said that Iberdrola 'got a head-start with this transition 20 years ago, when we realised that the economy of the future had to be carbon-free. Since then, we have invested EUR 100bn in renewables, smart networks and efficient supply, becoming one of the world's largest utility companies.' The Iberdrola President also congratulated the EU bank on its decision to increase its climate ambition and to cease financing projects based on fossil fuels: 'We all have to be part of the solution. As leaders in sustainable financing, we believe that agreements such as the ones we are signing today are essential to turning climate change into an opportunity and leaving an inhabitable planet for future generations.' Of the EUR 690m total, EUR 250m will go to financing the construction of 15 wind farms to be developed in the country by Neoenergia, the Iberdrola subsidiary in Brazil. These new facilities will be located in three states in the north east: Paraiba, Bahia and Piaui. Once operational, they will have a total installed power of 520 MW and produce an annual average of 2,300 GWh of clean energy. Commissioning these wind farms will help to reduce CO emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country's electricity generation. The investments in these new wind farms will be made over a five-year period and will enable the creation of 2,300 jobs. Iberdrola, through Neoenergia, has become one of Brazil's two largest electricity utilities by number of customers, with 13.9 million supply points. The company combines electricity generation, distribution, transmission, and retail activities in a concession area spanning 835,000 square kilometers. Iberdrola's Brazilian subsidiary operates 3,700 MW generation capacity, 88% of which are renewable energy. If projects under construction are included, capacity jumps to 4,550 MW. The EIB is granting this financing under the Latin America lending mandate 2014-2020, meaning that the agreement is covered by the EU budget guarantee. By supporting this project, the EU bank is helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. The EIB has been working in Latin America for some 30 years and one of the major priorities in the region is to promote climate action. SMART ELECTRICITY NETWORKS IN SPAIN These networks are key to the energy transition, as they enable the integration of more renewables, sustainable mobility, smart cities and decentralised consumption. Transforming the networks into smart infrastructure that is more reliable and more secure puts consumers at the centre of the business, giving them greater decision-making power and connectivity. Iberdrola, through its distribution company i-DE, operates 270,000 km of electricity grids in Spain, serving 17 million people. Over the past few years, the company has invested EUR 2 billion in grid digitisation by installing 11 million smart meters and supporting infrastructure while adapting 90,000 substations which now incorporate remote management, monitoring and automation capabilities. THE EIB AND CLIMATE ACTION The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2-degreeC and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5-degreeC in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, with the goal of ensuring that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1bn by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021. The EIB is the world's largest issuer of green bonds and was the first organisation to make an issue on this market in 2007. In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. The EIB makes long-term finance available for sound investment in order to contribute towards EU policy objectives. IBERDROLA, A REFERENCE IN CLIMATE ACTION Iberdrola is a global leader in the energy market, the leading supplier of wind power and one of the largest electricity companies by market capitalisation in the world. The group supplies energy to some 100 million people in dozens of countries, such as Spain, the UK (ScottishPower), the USA (AVANGRID), Brazil (Neoenergia), Mexico, Germany, Portugal, Italy and France. With a workforce of some 34 000 employees and assets exceeding EUR 113bn, it turned over EUR 35 075.9m and made a net profit of EUR 3.014m in 2018. Iberdrola is leading the energy transition towards a sustainable model through its investments in renewable energies, smart networks, large-scale energy storage and digital transformation to offer its clients cutting-edge products and services. With its commitment to clean energy, it is one of the companies with the lowest emissions and sets an international example with its contribution to climate action and sustainability. The company is the world's largest issuer of green bonds, with some EUR 10bn issued since 2014, and has agreed loans for around EUR 1.5bn, as well as credit lines subject to sustainability conditions for nearly EUR 9bn.

GOVERNMENTS in Westminster and Holyrood have set legally binding net zero carbon targets and Nicola Sturgeon has declared a climate emergency. So, what next? Aberdeen is known worldwide as a city that's entrepreneurial, dynamic and innovative; a place that likes to get things done. Having been a global leader in the oil and gas sector for over half a century, now we're utilising our incredible skills and research strengths to develop new energy technologies. An iconic symbol of this great transition is the world's first floating wind farm by Equinor, off the north-east coast. And in Aberdeen Bay, Vattenfall's offshore wind test and research centre will help establish which way the wind is blowing for this rapidly growing part of the UK energy mix. These renewable innovations sit alongside NorthConnect, a \£31.5 billion project providing an electricity link between Scotland and Norway to support the growth of renewable power. In addition, the UK and Scottish Governments have committed funding to develop a world-leading carbon capture and storage project at Peterhead. We also have the new National Decommissioning Centre in Newburgh, a \£338 million partnership between the Oil & Gas Technology Centre and the University of Aberdeen, which aims to position Scotland as the global leader in technologies related to the decommissioning of existing oil fields enabling the re-use of infrastructure to support the development of hydrogen and CCS initiatives. Much of this is underpinned by our expertise in subsea engineering. We already have the world's largest cluster of businesses in this sector in the region and plans are advanced for the creation of a global underwater hub that will put our supply chain at the centre of the emerging blue economy. There's a well-developed programme led by Aberdeen City Council and partners to position the area at the forefront of hydrogen technology. Its hydrogen bus fleet has passed the million-mile mark and there are plans for homes powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Offshore Europe, the continent's leading energy exploration and production conference takes place at our new world class venue, P&J Live @ TECA this week. The 36,000+ delegates will be in the most sustainable events complex in the UK, powered by local renewable energy sources and featuring the country's largest hydrogen fuel cell installation. And the Chamber is working with Zero Waste Scotland to deliver a business engagement programme promoting the adoption of circular economy practices and motivating behaviour change to create a society where resources are valued and nothing is wasted. It is great news Glasgow is to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2020 and we believe Aberdeen has a role in delivering a programme that will demonstrate the work going on right now in this region that puts Scotland at the heart of the energy transition agenda. The success of the Aberdeen city region will no longer be linked to the price of a barrel of crude. Europe's oil and gas capital is utilising the expertise, transferable skills and supply chain here to make a significant contribution to the creation of a net zero carbon economy. Russell Borthwick is the chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce. \</doc>

It was perhaps fitting that the United Nations climate conference in Madrid ended as it had begun, with a row about Greta Thunberg. The Swedish climate activist, 16, named last week as Time magazine's person of the year, had arrived in Spain by yacht from the United States only for it to emerge that her skipper had flown to New York from Britain, thereby wiping out her saved emissions. Her journey to Sweden yesterday prompted new accusations of hypocrisy when she tweeted a photo of herself sitting on the floor of an overcrowded German train only for Deutsche Bahn to point out that she had a seat in first class. Earlier in the day she had been forced to apologise for saying that world leaders should be "put against a wall", an expression which she explained did not have the same connotations in Swedish. In fact world leaders should be grateful to Ms Thunberg for deflecting attention from their failure to achieve the limited goals they had set themselves at the meeting, known as COP25 . The objective had been to agree some of the mechanisms necessary to hit the emissions targets established under the 2015 Paris accord. That committed 186 countries to limit global warming to 2C, beyond which scientists warned that climate chance could become uncontrollable. Scientists have since reduced that estimate to 1.5 degrees of warming. Meanwhile, emissions have risen by 4 per cent since 2015 and UN researchers say that it will take cuts of 7 per cent a year over the next decade to reach the Paris target. Yet most countries are still falling short of their Paris commitments and many have no credible plans to meet them. The best that could be said for COP25 was that it brought the emergence of a "high-ambition coalition" of 73 countries committed to faster reductions in emissions. This includes the European Union, which formally committed itself last week to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, as Britain has done already. Nonetheless COP25 failed to persuade some countries with the highest emissions, including the US, Australia, China, India and Brazil, to sign up to tougher global targets in line with the latest science. Nor did it succeed in establishing the rules for a global carbon-trading system, as proposed under the Paris agreement. This was scuppered by objections from some developing countries such as Brazil. And it failed to reach agreement on a new compensation system for developing countries, particularly those in low-lying areas most vulnerable to climate change. That collapsed in part amid objections from the US, which has already said it will walk away from the Paris treaty. It will now fall to Britain, as the host of the COP26 in Glasgow in November next year, to find a way forward. Further evidence of the high costs of climate change should spur ministers to make this a priority. We report today how the increased pace of coastal erosion in Suffolk and Norfolk has prompted calls for changes to planning rules to require buildings in vulnerable areas to be portable. The newly elected Conservative government has rightly committed to tough binding targets to reduce Britain's carbon emissions. Boris Johnson also says that he wants a post-Brexit "Global Britain" to play a leading role on the world stage. He should make it his mission that when the delegates leave Glasgow they're talking about him and not Ms Thunberg. \</doc>

Glasgow will host a major United Nations climate change conference next year if the UK government succeeds in its bid for the event. The conference, which is expected to attract 30,000 delegates including world leaders, is considered an important milestone in the effort to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. Five years on from the Paris agreement - under which nations agreed to limit the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels - it is the first major test of the commitment to work harder to tackle climate change. However, concerns were expressed yesterday that "post-Brexit spats" between the governments at Westminster and Holyrood could undermine the event. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute, an environmental think tank based in London, said that it was important to avoid "distractions" in the run-up to the conference, including "displays of domestic political disharmony" caused by Britain's withdrawal from the EU. The UK is bidding in partnership with Italy. The pair will compete against Turkey to host the fortnightlong programme at the end of next year. Claire Perry, a former energy minister and the British government's nominated conference president, said: "As one of the UK's most sustainable cities, with a record for hosting high-profile international events, Glasgow is the right choice to showcase the UK's commitment to the environment. The UK is a world leader in emissions reduction, having cut our emissions by over 40 per cent since 1990, faster than any other G20 country since 2000. And we recently committed to go further, by legislating to reduce our net emissions to zero by 2050." News of the conference was welcomed by environmental charities and by the Scottish Conservatives, who said the decision to host the summit in Glasgow was part of the "Union dividend". Lang Banks, director at WWF Scotland, said: "This will be a vital milestone in the global response to the growing climate crisis. The fossil fuel era began in Scotland and in 2020 the global community must come to Glasgow and say that this will be the last fossil fuel generation and that we are ready to take on the climate and nature emergencies we face. "This would be a huge event and the Scottish and UK governments must be ready to show that we have our own houses in order and have strong climate emergency plans in place." Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment and climate change secretary, said: "I welcome the announcement that Glasgow has been chosen as the prospective host city of such an important international event if the UK bid is successful. It is natural that [the conference] should take place in the city given its strong global presence and ambitious plans for climate action. "We have been supportive of the UK government's joint bid with Italy to host [the conference] and are committed to working collaboratively to deliver an ambitious and effective conference that includes a strong role for Scottish ministers, represents the interests of Scotland and promotes increased global ambition on climate change." \</doc>

The action star and former California Governor posted pictures on Instagram It showed the pair on a bike ride together and meeting his daughter Christina   Greta opened the 2019 Austrian World Summit of non-profit environmental organisation R20 Regions of Climate Action, set up by vegan Arnie in 2011 Their day out comes after the 16-year-old also met with Leonardo DiCaprio Thunberg's highly publicized journey has so far involved traveling through North America by train and in an electric car borrowed from Schwarzenegger Greta Thunberg can certainly count Arnold Schwarzenegger among her growing list of celebrity fans after the pair went biking together and the actor lent the teenage activist his electric car. Their day out comes after the 16-year-old also met with Leonardo DiCaprio. In May Greta opened the 2019 Austrian World Summit of non-profit environmental organisation R20 Regions of Climate Action, set up by vegan Arnie in 2011. Backed by the United Nations, R20 is a coalition of governments, international organisations and private companies that implement green infrastructure in cities. Oscar winning actor Leo - who has been widely criticized for his use of private jets despite his interest in environmental causes - said it was an 'honor' to speak with the climate activist, posting an image of the two of them together on Friday. In an Instagram post the actor said he hopes Greta's message is £ wake up call to world leaders', adding that the schoolgirl makes him 'optimistic about what the future holds'. 'As # COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help,' Thunberg tweeted from Los Angeles. 'It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)' 'Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,' said the teen, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved. Thunberg's highly publicized journey has so far involved crossing on a zero-emission sailboat from the coast of England to New York, traveling overland through North America by train and in a Tesla borrowed from Schwarzenegger. She was one of around 25,000 delegates expected in Santiago for the United Nations climate summit, until Chile pulled out as host this week due to deadly anti-government protests. COP 25 will finally take place in Madrid, on the original scheduled dates of December 2-13. The Swedish teen activist Thunberg rose to prominence last year after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden's parliament, holding a sign reading 'School strike for climate.' Students across the world began emulating her campaign, leading to organized school walkouts and the rise of the 'Fridays for Future' movement which targets government action on climate change. Ellen described Greta as 'real and raw' during filming for her show in California last Friday. \</doc>

Japanese environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has called for the government to reconsider its support for a coal-fired power plant in Vietnam, claiming it breaks Japan's commitments to combat climate change\~and would be opposed by public opinion. "This (project) is not something we can get the understanding of Japanese citizens or the international community for," Koizumi\~said. Koizumi\~said that he intended to speak to government agencies that dealt with energy to rethink the project. The un-named project is being supported by a subsidiary of Mitsubishi,\~while Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and others are considering lending to the project, Japanese media reported. He said that he had already sought ways to reduce coal technology exports, but he had been unable so far to come up with specific measures. Infrastructure exports and energy policies are run by the more pro-coal Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). The Japanese government's basic energy plan supports investment in coal power only if the cutting-edge, high-efficiency generating technology provided by some Japanese manufacturers is used. Japan currently intends to finance $4.8bn of investment in coal plants in Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh, according to a study by Global Energy Monitor that was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid in December. Although Koizumi\~did not name the project,\~Mitsubishi, JBIC and a number of Japanese commercial banks are involved with the 1,200-MW Vung Ang 2 plant in Vietnam, while Mitsubishi is involved with the Chinese-backed 1,980-MW Vinh Tan 3 plant. In December, Standard Chartered Bank followed Singapore's OCBC Bank in withdrawing from Vung Ang 2, while Hong Kong's CLP Holdings, which is Mitsubishi's partner in the OneEnergy development company, has also announced its exit from coal. Too late An official at the METI, which oversees energy policy, told local media: "The construction of high-efficiency coal-fired thermal plants meets government standards, and such projects will contribute to cutting carbon dioxide emissions." Meanwhile, JBIC said that it had not yet committed any financing, and would follow government advice. The project already has support from many government ministries, and Koizumi's comments might be too late. "It's difficult to stop the project in Vietnam now," a senior Environment Ministry official said. Breaking ranks Koizumi\~has effectively broken ranks with the government over coal technology exports, and his remarks come as Japan's continued financial and technical support for coal projects across Asia runs counter to the current retreat from coal in global investment circles. Tokyo's technology giants, investment banks and export support agencies are still committed to coal projects, despite the Japanese government's aggressive global initiatives to promote renewables, such as hydrogen fuel. He told the UN COP25 conference in Madrid in December that global criticism of Japan's "addiction to coal" was beginning to take effect. Political agenda Indeed, Koizumi's opinion carries considerable weight in Japan, where concerns about climate change and emissions are high on the political agenda and in the corporate world. A recent survey of large corporations by Reuters Corporate Survey found that 62% of Japanese firms wanted the government to curb its coal-fired power projects, while 20% said Japan should ditch coal plans altogether. Only 18% said Japan should continue to promote coal-fired power. More than one-third of the firms said abandoning coal plans would harm their business by raising electricity bills and squeezing profits. While 60% saw no impact at all from abandoning coal, the remainder expected it to bring positive effects. Conclusion Japan's continued support for coal comes as BlackRock and a number of other major investors have said they will reduce their exposure to the fuel, claiming it is now too high an investment risk. Governments\~such as the UK government\~have also made commitments to avoid coal in their investment and development finance policies. In Japan, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved new plans to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote support for hydrogen and carbon capture technology. The COP 25 Madrid conference in December 2019 saw UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres call for all countries to stop building coal plants after 2020 in order to meet the temperature goals in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Koizumi\~is trying to bring Japan into line with these global movements, but Tokyo is being slow to break its link with coal. Coal's share of generating output is forecast to stay level at 26% until 2030, according to government plans. This would require the construction of 20 new coal plants to replace outdated plants that are closed down. Its investment houses and manufacturers have continually talked up clean coal technology, and Asian emerging economies such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh view coal as a cheap and convenient way to provide much-needed electricity in industrial areas. The government supports coal sites alongside widespread investment and policy commitments to renewables. Prime Minister Abe told Parliament recently that Japan now aimed to become a decarbonised society by investing in new emissions reduction technology. Koizumi\~is calling for a faster retreat from coal in Tokyo, but his arguments are not being taken up by the government, which risks falling behind global trends and laying itself open to continued international criticism. \</doc>

Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has been left stranded in the US after the COP25 climate summit moved from Chile to Spain. The Swede - who sailed from Plymouth to New York in August en route to the UN Climate Action Summit - is now turning hitchhiker, appealing on social media for a ride back across the Atlantic to mainland Europe. COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help," Greta tweeted from Los Angeles. "It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way :) "Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful." Her plea comes as Hollywood actor and fellow activist Jane Fonda (inset), ex-pressed concern for the teen's welfare, given the intense media scrutiny she is under. "I worry about her. I have not met her, I hope one day to meet her," Fonda told the BBC. "She understands that if she's attacked it's because she's making a difference and that scares people." Fonda has vowed to protest every Friday until January to demand for action to be taken to address climate change. She spent a night in a local jail after her fourth arrest in as many weeks while participating in a climate change demonstration on Capitol Hill. This week, Greta met another Hollywood star with environmental credentials, Leonardo DiCaprio - he called her "a leader of our time". She addressed another climate rally in Los Angeles and appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she repeated her contention that meeting the US President Donald Trump would be "a waste of time".

The 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg was approaching the coast of Portugal last night in a yacht on her way to a global climate summit that opened yesterday in Madrid. She posted a picture of the vessel ferrying her in rough weather, writing: "We're speeding towards Europe! "Estimated time of arrival is Tuesday morning [local time]. We'll be arriving at Doca de Alcantara, Lisbon. We are all looking forward to seeing you there!" She will then head to Madrid to speak at the Cop25 climate change conference, which was opened by Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general, and Pedro S\'e1nchez, Spain's caretaker prime minister. Ms Thunberg had accepted a ride on the yacht from two Australians, Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu, after becoming stranded in the United States. She is travelling with her father, Svante. Ms Thunberg had sailed to America to speak at the UN Climate Action Summit in September and planned to travel overland to Chile, where the Cop25 conference had been due to take place until riots forced a switch of venue to Madrid. She is scheduled to hold media interviews in Lisbon then take an overnight train to Madrid, according to Portuguese reports. In his opening speech, Mr Guterres rallied governments to take firmer action, citing scientific data showing that greenhouse gas levels had hit a record high. The US sent a delegation to the conference but President Trump has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord. Democratic members of Congress led by Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, who is in Madrid, said that the US remained committed to the 2016 agreement's goals and that climate change posed a threat to public health, the economy and national security. "We're still in it," Ms Pelosi said. \</doc>

Iberdrola's Chairman and CEO, Ignacio Galan, stated today that the company will have virtually zero emissions in Europe by 2030 and maintained the commitment to achieve global emissions neutrality by 2050. The commitment was made to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, during his speech at the high-level meeting 'Caring for Climate', organized by the UN Global Compact at COP25 . During his participation in the panel 'Our only future - the Role of the Private Sector in Reaching 1,5-degreeC and Net-Zero', Galan discussed the company's strategy to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which began 20 years ago. As it stands today, Iberdrola's emissions are a quarter of those of its European competitors. 'Our commitment to renewable energy means we have already reached a level of zero emissions in many of the countries where we operate, such as the United Kingdom, Germany or Portugal,' explained Galan. To reach this leadership position, Iberdrola has invested more than 100 billion dollars since 2001 in new renewable energy, smart grids and efficient storage and the company will continue to devote more than $ 10 billion per year to these activities. The investment has allowed the company to grow globally and become a world leader in wind power, network digitization and green finance. Ignacio Galan stated that Iberdrola's model shows that the transition to a green, low-carbon economy is a source of opportunities. He said: 'We have supported transformation in intensive industries that were in decline, such as shipyards, and encouraged the launch of entirely new companies, like some of those working with us to deliver smart meters or components for photovoltaic plants or offshore wind farms.' In this transition, the electricity sector, responsible for 25% of emissions, plays a key role: it is necessary to replace polluting technologies with renewable energy while promoting the electrification of other industries such as transport and heating. Galan also reiterated the need to take immediate action, in line with the ethos of COP25 . 'The energy transition is feasible. We have the necessary technology at an affordable cost, but we have little time. The time for action is now', said Galan. He added: 'As the European Commission says, this is an opportunity for an industrial renaissance, creating jobs and wellbeing for everyone'. IBERDROLA AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE Following the approval of the Paris Agreement in 2015, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, Iberdrola incorporated the goals in to its business strategy and corporate governance system. Aligned with activities, the company focuses their efforts on climate action (SDG 13) and on the supply of affordable and non-polluting energy (SDG 7). In the context of COP25 , Iberdrola reiterates its commitment to a climate scenario fully aligned with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5-degreeC and with an adequate framework of working conditions and fair transition for decarbonisation. Both commitments were formalised in September when the company signed two pledges proposed by Governments and organisations at the United Nations Climate Action Summit (UN Global Compact, BTeam and Spanish Government).

GREEN Party members in Tatton constituency have again selected well-known local campaigner Nigel Hennerley to contest the General Election which could be called in the next few weeks. Nigel, from High Legh, said: "The Green Party believes the only sensible thing to do given this EU membership crisis, given that so much has changed and has been distorted, is to go back to the people and allow people to vote for the deal they want. "Whether that is to Leave the EU and under what terms or the opportunity to vote to Remain in the EU and recognise that perhaps that is the best deal. "This situation has been dealt to us from a fractured Conservative Party, which has infected the whole country. We must now allow the country an opportunity to resolve this crisis. "Moving forward, Climate Change needs to be central to all our plans. "Next year will see the 26th Conference of Parties - the UN conference on climate change - taking place in the UK. This may well be our last chance to avert irreversible climate chaos for our children's generation and beyond. "Schemes like HS2 contradict what the science tells us. Ever more airport expansion and economic growth based on business as usual. "The challenge is how we can thrive sustainably and perhaps swap GDP for Greater Wellbeing. "Using enormous amounts of energy just to travel a bit quicker is no alternative to better public transport links and improving existing rail services." \</doc>

Virgin: We're facing a climate emergency and we must face it together. As the scale of the climate crisis continues to increase The B Team have brought together America's most influential CEOs to jointly call on the US to stay in the Paris Agreement. For our planet, our communities, our workers and our economy to thrive, we need ambitious climate action - we need the Paris Agreement. A group of CEOs, who employ more than two million people in the United States, and union leaders who represent 12.5 million workers, have joined together to take a stand for the country's workers and its economy - urging the US to stay in the Paris Agreement. Richard Branson has signed the statement along with Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Alan Jope, Marc Benioff, and many more. The B Team, Paris,Climate Change The statement, entitled 'United For The Paris Agreement', coincides with COP25 and highlights that driving progress on addressing climate change is what's best for the economic health, jobs, and competitiveness of American companies and the country. The statement reads, 'Staying in the Paris Agreement will strengthen our competitiveness in global markets, positioning the United States to lead the deployment of new technologies that support the transition, provide for our workers and communities, and create jobs and companies built to last.' This moment in time marks an opportunity for labour and business to come together to secure a thriving future and economy. As global policymakers gather in Madrid for the UN's annual climate summit ( COP25 ) they must work to facilitate a just transition through holding dialogue with workers, unions, employers and governments, ensuring millions of new jobs are decent, family-supporting jobs.

The most important news first: Daniel Abt is fit again after his accident in Mexico and ready for the next race in his Audi e-tron FE06. The German had crashed into the track barriers in practice after a communication problem of the software in his car and had to be checked in hospital before the race. "The days after the race were pretty tough, so I took a break from everything to recover completely," says Abt. And now he's back in his old form: "I had really set my sights high for Mexico, which is one of my absolute favourite races - now I'm trying to make up for that at Marrakesh." Morocco made its first appearance on the calendar in the third season and was held in parallel with the 22nd United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh. The circuit at the gates of the fascinating North African metropolis is a mixture of permanent race track and public roads. Last season Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler experienced a difficult weekend. Lucas di Grassi and Daniel Abt qualified for the race outside the top 10. After the start they fought their way through the field and scored points finishing seventh and tenth. Lucas di Grassi had the fastest race lap. Both drivers have so far been denied a podium position in the only Formula E race on the African continent. "We wanted to attack in Mexico, but after an extremely turbulent day for the whole team we were only able to limit the damage with Lucas' sixth place. We have put that behind us and are now only focused on the race day in Marrakesh," says Team Principal Allan McNish. "We have a strong team at home in Neuburg, in the garage at the track and in the cockpit and we know: if we put everything together from the first practice session, we can have both boys on the podium." Lucas di Grassi, who was the first Formula E driver to break the 750-point barrier in Mexico, is now fifth in the championship and only 15 points behind the leader of the standings. In the first four races the Brazilian has made up 31 positions on the track. "The championship is still young, we have four different winners so far, nothing has been decided. What's important is that we score points even if we catch a less than perfect day," says di Grassi. "My goal for Marrakesh is a better qualifying, despite the difficult first group. With a grid position in the top 10, anything is possible." The race in Marrakech starts on Saturday at 4 PM local time and runs as usual over 45 minutes plus one lap.

FEW events in Glasgow's history can match the significance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2020 due in November. Perhaps James Watt's moment of brilliance on Glasgow Green in 1765 might have a claim or Adam Smith's education at the University of Glasgow, both contributions to the Industrial Revolution that set the world on a pattern of economic growth unprecedented in human history. I joined the Glasgow team attending the formal launch of COP26 in London at which Boris Johnson acknowledged the particular responsibility the UK is taking on as host of these global negotiations. As the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, he said, the UK has arguably the longest - though not the biggest - record of carbon emissions to offset. We are all now becoming familiar with a flurry of government targets being set for achieving net zero emissions - 2050 for the UK, 2045 for Scotland and in Glasgow itself, 2030. Individual businesses are responding with their own targets, with BP having perhaps one of the most difficult tasks in meeting its 2050 goal - and Microsoft being the most ambitious in aiming to be carbon negative by 2030, while stating in its January announcement that by 2050 it will have 'removed from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975'. Closer to home Scottish Power has made the transfer from fossil fuel generation to 100% renewable sources and has pledged to help Glasgow meet its target with its own investment in a mass electric vehicle charging system across the city. I also met Peter Hill, CEO for the COP26 Delivery Team, and the conference now has a President in the shape of Alok Sharma, the new Secretary of State for BEIS, who has the responsibility for co-ordinating negotiations needed to persuade countries to sign up to any new accord at the Glasgow conference. When you consider the challenge involved in securing consensus between the US, China, Australia and the rest of the world, the last thing you need is constant squabbling between UK and Scottish governments to organise the conference. Both governments have been at fault and if both are to retain the moral credibility they seek in leading the response to climate change, they must rise above our national politics and think only of the bigger picture. The response to climate change involves one of the most fundamental debates about our economic system ever encountered. Is the answer a deft albeit radical shift in technologies systematically phasing out, for example, internal combustion engines for electric ones or replacing gas central heating with ground source heat pumps? Or is that, as some well-known figures argue, simply insufficient? Are we to plan instead for a future not just of net zero emissions but of net zero economic growth? Is net zero emissions sufficient or must it be pure zero with no allowances made for carbon offsetting? The fact that Glasgow will be at the very heart of the debate, assuming that the internal governmental tussles do come to an end and the conference is not shifted to London or elsewhere in the country, no doubt means our local decisions will be minutely scrutinised. Some will take issue, for example, with the city having an ambitious growth target for international tourism often dependent on air travel, or that the Scottish Government recently launched its new strategy for expanding exports. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce has a very long history of arguing for free trade and international commerce. We are ready to have that debate once again. Stuart Patrick is the chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce \</doc>

The First Minister of Scotland went on a rant on Twitter after seeing comments by the Prime Minister's spokesman which indicated the UN summit may not take place in Glasgow as planned this November. Boris Johnson's spokesman insisted the Government was "committed" to the event taking place in Scotland but called on the Scottish Government to do more and work together with the UK. Sebastian Payne, Financial Times' Whitehall correspondent wrote on Twitter: "Will COP26 move to London? Related articles "Prime Minister's spokesperson says 'we are committed to holding to COP26 in Glasgow. But the Scottish government needs to work with us to ensure it's a successful summit'. "Committed doesn't mean it will happen...piling the pressure on @NicolaSturgeon." The SNP chief then reacted furiously and accused Mr Johnson of "playing politics" and reiterated Scotland's commitment to hosting the event. Ms Sturgeon fired back: "This is just silly . "If he insists on playing politics it will be on him, not me." She wrote: "It's not a row. It's a PM playing politics with the biggest issue of our time - he should be called out on it, not indulged." It is understood Downing Street has considered the ExCel Centre in London's docklands at a potential replacement venue. There are concerns in Whitehall about whether the estimated costs of policing the event put forward by the Scottish Government are realistic. Former Environment Secretary Michael Gove has acknowledged the Government needs to do more to show leadership on global warming. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is thought to be inline for the role of President of the COP26 summit.

HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron David Cameron has turned down an offer from Boris Johnson to head the UK's preparations for a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow, saying he already has "a lot of things" to do this year. The former prime minister was asked by Johnson to be the president of the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron 26th United Nations HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron Climate Change Conference HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron (COP 26) but Cameron rejected the offer. Cameron said: "[There are] a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer's Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work." He called the climate change conference "absolutely vital", adding that he wished the government well. "I'm sure that there will be a government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The government has my backing as they go forward." Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron Lord Barker of Battle The former Conservative leader William Hague was also reported to have been offered it and to have also declined. On Tuesday during the conference's launch event, Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job. The former clean growth minister Claire O'Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron was sacked on Friday as president of the talks by the prime minister's special adviser, Dominic Cummings. The government said the post would be a ministerial role in future. The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries, at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations. Johnson has HYPERLINK brought forward the UK's phaseout of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years to 2035 and hastened the phaseout of coal-fired power by a year to 2024. He reaffirmed the UK's pledge to switch to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and urged other nations - without naming any - to do the same. "I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades," Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. "We're going to do it by 2050, we're setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let's make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve manmade climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren." \</doc>

From this week, representatives of Governments and businesses from around the world will gather in Madrid for the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ). The event brings together those working to implement the Paris Agreement and develop solutions to address the escalating climate crisis. As a business committed to leaving the world in a better state than it is today and to underline a commitment to being truly people and planet positive, representatives of Inter IKEA Group - the owner of the IKEA Concept and the worldwide IKEA franchisor - will attend and participate in COP. Ahead of the event Inter IKEA Group have announced they will invest (EURO)200 million to speed up the transformation to becoming a climate positive business. More than half of the IKEA climate footprint comes from materials in the products and production. The investments will be divided into two, the first will support the ambition to use 100% renewable energy (electricity, heating, cooling and other fuels) across the value chain and in production, by 2030. It will be built on collaboration with direct suppliers. The second, will invest in projects aimed at removing and storing carbon through reforestation and responsible forest management. Wood is one of the main materials that IKEA uses and for many years IKEA has worked to promote responsible forest management around the world. Responsibly managed forests play a vital role in protecting ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and climate change mitigation. The projects in the second strategy will be built in collaboration with partners to achieve scale and maximum impact. The projects will consider the wider aspect of land use and include activities to combat deforestation and support restoration of degraded land. According to the IPCC, global greenhouse gas emissions would be heavily reduced if deforestation was stopped. Announcing the investments, Torbj\'f6rn L\'f6\'f6f, CEO at Inter IKEA Group, said "Our ambition is to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms by 2030 than the entire IKEA value chain emits, while growing the IKEA business. To reach this goal, we will continue to invest in areas that create impact. This investment will speed up the transition to using renewable energy across our supply chain and remove carbon from the atmosphere through reforestation and better forest management practices" "By taking responsibility and working together we can make a true change. We have a long-term perspective and the financial strength to invest in activities that will benefit both the planet and our own business future," Lena Pripp-Kovac, Chief Sustainability Officer, Inter IKEA Group, said "We believe that the best way to minimise our climate impact and to contribute to limiting climate change to 1.5\'b0C is mainly by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions - but we also need to remove existing carbon from the atmosphere. We can make a positive difference through our integrated supply chain, our global presence and our forest and climate expertise." Inter IKEA Group will lead and participate in several events and panels throughout COP25 , covering issues as diverse as what it means to be climate positive, the role of the food chain within the climate agenda, and land use and biodiversity. Inter IKEA Group consists of three core businesses: Franchise, Range & Supply and Industry. This includes developing, designing and producing IKEA home furnishing solutions, supplying products to IKEA's 13 franchisees and as a manufacturer of IKEA's wood-based products, IKEA Ltd. (UK and Ireland), operates IKEA's UK retail business, including 22 IKEA stores, three Order and Collection Points and two Planning Studios, and is part of Ingka Group, the largest of the IKEA franchisees. \</doc>

Gridlocked UN climate talks aimed at securing more ambitious commitments to tackle emissions under the 2015 Paris accord have come to a close, with a key decision on the most challenging issues postponed for another year. After two weeks of drawn-out negotiations on tackling global warming, the delegates from almost 200 nations attending the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid did pass declarations calling for greater ambition in cutting planet-heating greenhouse gases and in helping poor countries suffering the effects of climate change. But despite the 25th instalment of the annual conference proving the longest in its history and exhausted attendees racking up more than 40 hours of overtime, the future of global carbon markets remains unwritten. Strong, last-minute disagreements on the topic mean the decision will have to be delayed until next year's gathering in Glasgow. Among the early documents to be passed by delegates was the "Chile-Madrid Time for Action" declaration calling on countries to improve their current pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is needed to come in line with the Paris Agreement target of avoiding a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. So far, the world is on course for a three to four-degree Celsius rise, with potentially dramatic consequences for many countries. Delegates also agreed to designate funds for the most vulnerable countries to compensate them for the effects of extreme weather events, one of the most pressing issues for small island states and other developing nations. But environmental groups and activists accused the world's richer countries of showing little commitment to seriously tackling climate change. "The Paris Agreement may have been the victim of a hit-and-run by a handful of powerful carbon economies, but they are on the wrong side of this struggle, the wrong side of history," said Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International's executive director. "Climate blockers like Brazil and Saudi Arabia, enabled by an irresponsibly weak Chilean leadership, peddled carbon deals and steam-rolled scientists and civil society," she said. Looking on from the sidelines, US Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was even more damning in her assessment, branding the talks an "utter failure". " COP25 and conferences like it are intended to be actual negotiations to urgently drawdown global carbon emissions - not cocktail parties to make politicians feel better about themselves as they squash dissent and sell off our futures to fossil fuel interests," the progressive and Green New Deal architect wrote on Twitter. Chile chaired the talks, which had to be quickly moved to Madrid amid violent anti-government protests back home. Despite the pressure to deliver a positive outcome, activists criticised the Chilean government of president Santiago Pinera for holding on to coal-fired power plants until 2040. Carbon markets, which economists consider key in providing incentives for the world to move towards low-carbon growth models, remained one of the trickiest points of contention and ultimately no resolution could be found, despite the best efforts of negotiators. Setting a price on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, the markets allow countries or companies to trade emissions permits that can be steadily reduced - encouraging the uptake of low-emission technologies. Europe and other countries had said that no deal on how to govern the exchange of carbon credits was better than one that could undermine a dozen or so existing regional mechanisms. The talks have been accompanied at times by angry protests from indigenous and environmental groups, both inside and outside the venue. The demonstrations reflected growing frustration, particularly among young people, at the slow pace of government efforts to curb climate change. Helen Mountford from World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank, said the talks "reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the streets". She added: "They need to wake up in 2020." Additional reporting by AP \</doc>

Spain has offered to host the COP25 UN climate conference in December after weeks of violent protests HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest forced the Chilean government to cancel both the global environmental meeting and next month's Apec trade summit. On Thursday afternoon, the Spanish government said the acting prime minister, Pedro S\'e1nchez, had offered to help the Chilean president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, "in any way that might be needed - including hosting the summit in Madrid". In a statement, it added: "Spain believe that multilateral climate action is a priority for both the UN and the EU, and one which demands the highest commitment from all of us." The Spanish government said its offer had been relayed to the UN by Carolina Schmidt, the Chilean environment minister who is also the president-designate of COP25 . It will now be studied by the UN climate change panel at a meeting in Bonn next week. Pi\'f1era had blamed the "difficult circumstances" HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest Chile was facing for the decision to withdraw from hosting COP25 , and said his government's primary concern had to be "fully restoring public order, security and social peace". "This has been a very difficult decision - which has caused us great pain - because we understand perfectly the importance [of the events] for Chile and for the world," Pi\'f1era said on Wednesday as he announced the decision. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate change executive secretary, said the UN was exploring alternative hosting options for the climate summit. "It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change, the biggest challenge facing this and future generations," she said in a statement. Environmental activists expressed relief that the COP may still go ahead, but also concern about the logistics and cost for cash-strapped organisations who lost non-refundable tickets to Chile. "It's great that there is an offer on the table from Spain. But there is still uncertainty," said Jennifer Tollman, policy adviser for climate diplomacy with HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest E3G . "A lot of people sank a lot of money into this. For participants in developing countries this is a huge issue. Without support, this could impact participation by the global south." The change in venue could also affect the content of the talks. Tollman said the protests in Chile reminded delegates that social equality has to be part of the equation. "Climate policy has to be social policy. That's what will be discussed inside and outside the negotiation rooms." Former climate negotiator for Colombia, Isabel Cavelier, agreed that the demonstrations in Santiago should focus the minds of participants on the need to halve emissions and radically restore nature. "Otherwise the situation we are seeing in Chile - which led president Pi\'f1era to this extreme decision - will become the new norm, as social unrest will only be exacerbated by the climate crisis." Chile's protests began in mid-October as HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest a student-led fight According to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/chile-protests-president-sebastian-pinera-protest-unrest Chile's Human Rights Institute On 18 October, Pi\'f1era declared a state of emergency after violence broke out on the streets of the capital, Santiago.

Multilateral Development Banks have been at the forefront of supporting our clients' efforts to pursue ambitious climate action for more than a decade. In light of growing climate change impacts, including on the poorest and most vulnerable, each of our institutions is taking urgent action to help our clients adapt to and mitigate climate risks. These actions include: ACTION 1: Each institution has individually committed to support increased climate finance levels over time: Given the growth in climate finance support each of us has achieved to date, we expect our individual efforts to collectively total at least USD$ 65 billion annually by 2025, with $ 50 billion for low and middle income economies, 50 percent above current levels.1 We expect our collective efforts to double the total level of adaptation finance provided to clients to USD$ 18 billion annually by 2025, compared to current levels. This responds to the urgent need to scale-up support for climate resilience in client projects and for enhanced systemic resilience. ACTION 2: Based on current trends, we expect our collective efforts to also result in a further $ 40 billion of climate investments mobilized annually by 2025 from private sector investors, including through the increased provision of technical assistance, use of guarantees, and other de-risking instruments. ACTION 3: Commit to helping our clients deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. At COP25 we will present key elements of our common framework, which defines clear principles each institution will incorporate, starting from 2021, in ways reflective of their unique client base and operations. Principles for intermediated financing activities are still under development and will be presented by the time of COP26. ACTION 4: Develop a new transparency framework to report on both the impact of each MDB's activities and how these are helping clients meet and exceed commitments they have made, to be presented at COP25 . This framework will be informed by consultations with multiple stakeholders, with the objective of broadening its use across the financial sector, beyond MDBs. ACTION 5: Each institution will take actions to help clients move away from the use of fossil fuels by: Sharing at COP25 principles that can help our public and private sector clients design and implement long-term low GHG emissions and climate resilient strategies that grow in ambition over time. This approach should help governments assess their individual progress on their climate commitments and help bridge the gap between the countries' current efforts and the long-term goals of signatories to the Paris Agreement. Continue working with national development banks and other financial institutions, to develop, by COP26, financing and policy strategies supporting a just transition that promotes economic diversification and inclusion. In all of our actions, we will focus on building and strengthening partnerships that enhance support for clients. Specifically, we will accelerate dissemination of international best practices on climate risk disclosure across the financial sector. We will continue to work with commercial bank partners and DFIs, in particular with the members of the IDFC, and through the Climate Action in Financial Institutions Initiative and regional initiatives. Our work with national governments, the private sector, the donor community, civil society organizations, and global climate funds, such as the GCF, GEF and CIF, will remain key for countries to achieve ambitious transformation in line with their Paris Agreement commitments. 1 Climate finance commitments are made by each institution individually, and any reporting on collective totals in no way implies an obligation to help another institution achieve their commitments.

The world's governments will meet in Madrid this December to discuss the climate emergency, it has been confirmed, after a HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation last-minute intervention by the Spanish government to save the talks. The conference had been set to take place in Santiago, Chile, but the government of President Sebastian Pinera HYPERLINK decided on Wednesday to call it off After Chile withdrew, there was concern that the annual talks might have to be scaled down, postponed or even abandoned. However, on Friday afternoon, the UN's top official on climate change, Patricia Espinosa, issued a terse statement that COP25 would go ahead on the original dates, 2-13 December, but in Madrid. Scientific warnings have become increasingly insistent that time is running out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the worst damages of global heating. But international negotiations under the UN have been slow and plagued by upsets and backsliding, such as the US plans to withdraw from the Paris agreement, Brazil's rejection of its commitments by President Jair Bolsonaro, and the rise of political populism in other regions. Katherine Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, said: "It's a shame that COP25 won't be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region. But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice ... but it shows how important countries view the UN process for tackling climate change that they are prepared to do all they can to keep the talks on track." Tasneem Essop, the interim executive director of the Climate Action Network, made up of many NGOs with an interest in the issue, said: "We hope all steps are going to be taken ... to make access to this COP fair and inclusive. It is important that there is the full participation of climate activists and observers from different parts of the world to COP25 where important negotiations on the Paris agreement are due to be undertaken." Some activists who had HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation set sail for Chile from Europe Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who sparked the global student strikes, had travelled as far as Los Angeles without flying and was planning to continue to Santiago in time for the conference. On Friday she made a plea for help getting back to Europe in time for the conference. "It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way," HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/spain-offers-host-un-climate-conference-after-chile-cancellation she tweeted . "Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November ... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful." This year's talks are essential to putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice and to pave the way for a crunch conference in the UK next year at which the long-term response to the climate emergency will be decided. Many of the world's national commitments to cut greenhouse gases are pegged to a 2020 deadline, and if new commitments are to be set then next year will be crucial. \</doc>

Photocredit: European Parliament Audiovisual Coordinators in Parliament's environment committee will also later this week be asked to endorse a request for an official parliamentary study into the environmental impact of operating the highly controversial two-seat campaign. Commenting on the latest events, ECR environment spokesman Alexandr Vondra compared Parliament's recent declaration of a "climate emergency" to its continued and much-criticised practice of decamping to Strasbourg every month. Vondra, a Czech member, said: "In declaring a climate emergency, it's important that MEPs get their own house in order and end the monthly travelling circus to Strasbourg. If we want voters to trust us on ambitious climate plans, then public bodies like the European Parliament need to lead the way and show that we are playing our part." RELATED CONTENT EU policymakers gear up to underscore urgency of climate action at COP25 Climate change 'did not originate' in the Arctic, conference hears MEPs to press Commission to declare "state of climate emergency" in Europe COP25 COP25 'critical' in ensuring 2015 Paris Agreement put in place, says senior MEP Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Other MEPs blasted the European Union's "hypocrisy" in wanting to combat climate change while maintaining the dual seat system. A treaty change is necessary to alter the arrangement and some deputies are now challenging Member State governments to scrap the so-called travelling circus that sees the legislature and its staff shuttle back and forth every month between Parliament buildings and suites of offices hundreds of kilometres apart in Brussels and Strasbourg. The practice of holding parliamentary sittings in both the Belgian capital and the French city is stipulated in the EU treaties in a clause which France has so far resisted all pressure to amend. MEPs have for years led the campaign for a single seat. "If we want voters to trust us on ambitious climate plans, then public bodies like the European Parliament need to lead the way and show that we are playing our part" Alexandr Vondra MEP Now the ECR group is spearheading fresh attempts to "shame the EU into action" by inserting a last-minute clause into the bloc's list of recommendations to the COP25 global summit on climate change, which started on Monday in Madrid. The paragraph calls on the EU's governments to agree on a single seat and end the "huge" carbon footprint created by the shuttle arrangement. UK ECR member Geoffrey Van Orden, leader of Britain's Conservative MEPs, also said: "The dual-seat system is a relic of the past that has no place in a modern world. Wherever the Parliament may sit at any one time it leaves another massive building standing largely empty and useless, but heated and lit." "MEPs don't want this - years ago we voted to scrap the Strasbourg Parliament. Thousands of officials, boxes of files and equipment are ferried back and forth in fleets of pantechnicons and specially-chartered transport. The monetary cost is in the millions and the damage in CO2 emissions is shameful." He added, "No organisation can honestly claim to be serious about tackling climate change and still maintain a way of working which is so manifestly destructive to the environment as this." In 2016, Parliament proclaimed itself to be the first 100 percent carbon-neutral EU institution, by offsetting all of its "irreducible" carbon emissions. The ECR and other groups argue there is greater scope for Parliament to cut its emissions and provide "low-carbon leadership" as one element of its supposedly "irreducible" emissions can be still be significantly minimised: those emissions which are a consequence of its two-seat arrangement. "Wherever the Parliament may sit at any one time it leaves another massive building standing largely empty and useless, but heated and lit" Geoffrey Van Orden MEP A Parliament resolution, dated 26 March, on the budgetary discharge of the EU for the financial year 2017, states that its environmental impact is significant and stands at "between 11,000 and 19,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions" per annum. This, it is said, is broadly equivalent to driving between 2,000 and 4,000 passenger cars for an entire year. It is claimed the Parliament has been aware of these external costs since at least 2007 when the Greens/EFA group presented their own study. This report concluded that "the Strasbourg operation imposes a CO2 burden that is at the very least 18,901 tonnes greater (and probably much more) than if the sole seat was in Brussels." Although Parliament's guidelines for the 2019 and 2020 budgets recognise this as a legitimate issue, the resolutions call only for a "roadmap" to a single seat, with no fixed commitments or deadlines. An ECR spokesman said, "This environmental burden, combined with the energy costs entailed by relocating to Strasbourg each month, undermines and cheapens Parliament's claim to be carbon neutral." \</doc>

Photocredit: European Parliament Audiovisual Environmental groups and NGOs have given a guarded welcome to the Commission's financing plans for its much-vaunted "European Green Deal", a flagship initiative of the new executive which aims to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050. The Commission's proposal for a seven-year, (EURO)100 billion "Just Transition Fund" is meant to help EU regions, particularly the most carbon-intensive ones, speed up their transition away from fossil fuels. The ten recipients will be Poland, Germany, Romania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands. Commission executive vice-president Frans Timmermans started a "European tour" last week in Berlin, to promote the Green Deal he is charged with implementing.

After a vote on Wednesday, the EPP group, the assembly's biggest, insisted that the Fund "should not force, but help" Europeans to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. However, a Commission spokesman has now warned, "The EU is committed to becoming the first climate-neutral bloc in the world by 2050 but this requires significant investment from both the EU and the national public sector as well as the private sector." "The transformation ahead of us is unprecedented and it will only work if it is just and if it works for all. We will support our people and our regions that need to make bigger efforts in this transformation to make sure that we leave no one behind"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen New Commission president Ursula von der Leyen adds: "The transformation ahead of us is unprecedented and it will only work if it is just and if it works for all. We will support our people and our regions that need to make bigger efforts in this transformation to make sure that we leave no one behind." EPP MEP Esther de Lange has cautioned that the deal "should include industrial and trade policies to ensure a just transition to greener jobs." Reaction from the NGO world to the "Just Transition" mechanism proposal has come from Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, saying the financial support "will spur climate action across Europe's regions and shows the EU can put its money where its mouth is." "The lack of financial means can no longer be used as an excuse for not committing to increase climate ambition. On the contrary, this fund should pave the way for raising the EU 2030 climate target to 65 percent emissions cuts in line with the Paris Agreement." "But it must go hand-in-hand with a climate-friendly EU budget for the next decade that stops subsidizing fossil fuels and invests a lot more in climate action than today," Trio added. "It [The Just Transition Fund] must go hand-in-hand with a climate-friendly EU budget for the next decade that stops subsidizing fossil fuels and invests a lot more in climate action than today"Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe Further reaction comes from the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR), a body that represents Europe's outermost regions, which says it welcomes EU commitment to "an ambitious climate agenda" but warns "such ambition should not lead to a diversion of funding." Some fear that finances being pumped into the European Green Deal in the coming years will be at the expense of future cohesion funding for Europe's poorest regions and Vasco Cordeiro, CPMR president, said: "We welcome the proposed mobilisation of fresh resources to support the new fund but this cannot justify further cuts in the cohesion policy envelope in the MFF 2021-2027 negotiations." "Preserving an ambitious EU budget and a strong budget for cohesion policy must remain the main priority to support climate action at territorial level." Elsewhere, Koen Coppenholle, chief executive of CEMBUREAU, the European Cement Association, remarked, "Our revised low-carbon roadmap will be aligned with the Green Deal ambition of a carbon neutral Europe, looking at all actions and policy levers needed to achieve carbon neutrality along the cement and concrete value chain. It is already clear that the forward-looking policies of our industry on innovation, waste, CO2 transportation networks, access to affordable energy and sustainable construction will play a leading role.'' Alban Maggiar, president of SMEunited, the body that represents Europe's SMEs, noted, "SMEs are pleased the Commission intends to focus support on the most impacted regions, making the support conditional to a transition plan and including support for investments in SMEs." \</doc>

The teenager has just landed in the US after a 14-day sail from the UK to avoid carbon emissions from a plane She joined hundreds of protesters demonstrating outside the UN headquarters calling for climate action   It is the latest in her Fridays for Future marches for climate which sparked worldwide protests Climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn large crowds in New York today after her two-week sail across the Atlantic. The 16-year-old Swede led a protest march in front of the United Nations as she called for greater action on climate change. She was surrounded by hundreds of youth activists chanting 'fossil lobbyists have got to go' and 'it's too hot' - a reference to global warming. Thunberg urged 'everyone who cares about our future' to join her when world leaders gather in New York next month. The activist has led weekly Fridays for Future, strikes carried out by schoolchildren which have taken place in 100 cities worldwide. The teenager became the face of the climate activism movement last year after she started missing school to force Swedish politicians to pay attention to what she calls £ war on nature'. Today, she joined 14-year-old New Yorker Alexandria Villasenor, who began picketing outside the United Nations in New York last December. A couple of hundred of other young protesters supported them with signs that read 'Help my home is on fire,' 'If you won't act like adults, we will' and 'Science not silence'. Their chants included 'we are unstoppable, a better world is possible' and 'sea levels are rising and so are we.' Wearing t-shirts that read 'In Greta we trust,' New York students Bianca Pilcher, 11, and Lila Sabag, 10, said they had one message for world leaders: act now. Bianca said: 'I don't want to live a short life, I want to live a long life and I want to have my world be healthy as well. 'I also want to experience having children, having grandchildren and them to not be like "what have you brought me in to?"' Lila said she wanted to help save the planet by trying 'to not use much carbon dioxide or fossil fuels or plastics.' Then both girls chimed in together: 'Always reuse.' Thunberg will speak at a September 23 climate summit during the annual gathering of world leaders for the UN General Assembly. She sailed into New York Harbour on Wednesday in a zero-carbon emissions boat, completing a nearly 14-day journey from England. In a statement when she arrived in New York, Thunberg said: 'Everyone who cares about our future should join and strike on 20 and 27 September.' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces a climate emergency and challenged leaders to come to the 193-member United Nations next month with concrete, realistic plans on how to better tackle the emergency. 'We absolutely need to keep the rise of temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius to the end of the century and to be carbon neutral in 2050 and to have a 45 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030,' he told reporters in France on Monday. Thunberg plans to attend the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, and intends to make her way there without using air travel. She has taken a year off school to campaign for climate action in the Americas with plans to also visit Mexico and Canada. \</doc>

Greta Thunberg returned to Sweden this week after a round-the-world venture 16-year-old resumed her climate strike outside Stockholm's parliament on Friday   Weekly 'school strike for climate' is what catapulted her to international fame Since then she has addressed the UN and become Time Person of the Year Greta Thunberg has resumed her climate change protest outside Sweden's parliament after returning home following a four-month round-the-world tour. The 16-year-old activist joined protesters in Stockholm at a Fridays for Future rally, which she began in August 2018 and has since catapulted her to worldwide fame. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Thunberg uploaded a photo of herself to Instagram clutching her now-famous 'school strike for climate' banner along with the caption: 'School strike week 70. Stockholm!' The schoolgirl's dogged activism has seen her invited to speak at parliaments across the world, give a speech to the UN, and become Time's Person of the Year. For the last four months she has been taking her protest to countries around the world without using planes because of their environmental impact. Thunberg's transatlantic odyssey August 14: Sets sail from Plymouth, England. She had planned to travel south to Chile for the COP25 climate summit but because of political unrest it was relocated to Madrid. 'It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way,' she tweeted in November. November 13: Sets sail from Hampton, Virginia. December 3: Arrives in Lisbon, Portugal. December 9: Takes part in a massive rally in Madrid for COP25 . December 13: Fridays for Future protest in Turin, Italy. December 14: Train from Basel, Switzerland, north through Germany. The epic voyage saw her cross the Atlantic from the UK to America before visiting cities across the US and Canada, then returning to Portugal earlier this month. From there she went by train to a climate summit in Spain - which ended without an agreement - before visiting Turin and Basel on her way back to Sweden. She celebrated her return on Tuesday by posing with her pet dogs, Moses and Roxy. During her last climate protest in Turin, Italy, she threatened to 'put world leaders against the wall' if they continued running away from their climate obligations. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par She later apologised for the remark, made after the summit in Madrid, claiming that a Swedish phrase had been lost in translation. 'Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said "put them against the wall". That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable. That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language.' Ms Thunberg wrote. 'But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I can not enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement - are against any possible form of violence. It goes without saying but I say it anyway.' And that followed on the heels of another high-profile Twitter storm after Thunberg was named TIME's 'Person of the Year.' President Donald Trump - who was given the accolade in 2016 - tweeted that she had £nger management problems' and told her to 'chill'. Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to include the words 'currently chilling'. Thunberg's journey through Germany was the last leg of a continent-spanning trip which began when she travelled to New York on a low-emissions yacht in August. Th 16-year-old activist started a worldwide movement last year when she began to strike from school every Friday to protest government inaction on climate change. Refusing to fly, she has twice crossed the Atlantic by boat in recent months in order to speak at a UN climate summit in New York and the hastily rearranged COP25 summit in Madrid. \</doc>

The 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg sailed into the port of Lisbon this morning after crossing the Atlantic in a yacht on her way to a two-week global climate summit that opened yesterday in Madrid. She posted a picture of the vessel carrying her this morning as it approached the port and wrote, "Heading to Lisbon!". A few hours earlier she posted a photograph of street and house lights on the Portuguese coast before daybreak, captioned "Land ahoy!". Ms Thunberg will head to Madrid to speak at the Cop25 climate change conference, which was opened by Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, and Pedro S\'e1nchez, Spain's caretaker prime minister, where she is expected to issue warnings over climate change. HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-skipper-flew-in-for-greta-thunbergs-atlantic-crossing-w5d5gmp7b accepted a ride on the yacht from two Australians , Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu, HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-skipper-flew-in-for-greta-thunbergs-atlantic-crossing-w5d5gmp7b after becoming stranded in the United States . She is travelling with her father, Svante. The white catamaran carrying her made its way slowly up the River Tagus in bright sunshine against a biting wind. Ms Thunberg was due to be met in Lisbon by local dignitaries and activists. Her representatives said they could not confirm when she would travel onward to the Spanish capital, but reports suggested she may take an overnight train to Madrid. Before the catamaran docked in Lisbon there had been some concerns raised by the Portuguese media that the vessel would not be able to enter the port without help and would depend on a tug to reach the pier. Ms Thunberg had sailed to America to speak at the UN Climate Action Summit in September and planned to travel overland to Chile, where the Cop25 conference had been due to take place until riots forced a switch of venue to Madrid. Her arrival in Portugal coincided with a new scientific report saying there is mounting evidence that the world is getting ever hotter. The UN's World Meteorological Organisation said that preliminary temperature data show the years from 2015 to 2019 and from 2010 to 2019 are, respectively, almost certain to be the warmest five-year period and decade on record. \</doc>

For Greta Thunberg the climate - and weather - have become a very real issue. The 16-year-old campaigner was last night being buffeted by an Atlantic gale with gusts of 30-40mph, as the yacht carrying her to a UN climate change conference tried to outrun a potentially bigger storm racing up behind. She also faces being becalmed, with forecasts showing that the gap between the two weather systems contains little wind. If the weather allows, Thunberg will dock in Lisbon early this week and head for Madrid to speak at the UN's Cop25 climate change talks, which start tomorrow. Thunberg's 3,000-mile winter crossing is courtesy of two Australian YouTubers, Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu, and their 11-monthold son, Lenny. They offered Thunberg, and her father Svante, a lift on La Vagabonde, their 48ft catamaran, when she got stuck in America. Thunberg had sailed to the US to speak at September's UN Climate Action Summit and planned to travel overland to Chile where the Cop25 conference was set to take place until riots forced a switch of venue to Madrid. In theory, the voyage saves the roughly two or three tons of CO2 emissions that flights from Washington for her and her father would otherwise have generated. There was, however, one hitch. Sailing the Atlantic in November requires an experienced crew - and La Vagabonde needed an extra hand. The answer was Nikki Henderson, 26, from Guildford, Surrey, who is one of Britain's best young offshore yacht skippers. She volunteered to help - but was in Britain, and had to buy a plane ticket to join them. The emissions from her transatlantic flight will have undermined those saved by Thunberg and her father. The science to be revealed in Madrid this week suggests neglect is a mild description. One report, the World Meteorological Organisation's Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2018, will warn that 2019 could be the second or third warmest year on record with global temperatures up by 1.1C on the pre-industrial baseline of 1850-1900 and on track to rise by 4-5C by 2100. It is the UK's Met Office which predicts the scariest future. Its projections suggest that the greenhouse gases already released will make sea levels rise for hundreds of years. By 2300 coastal cities such as London, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh face rises of as much as 12-14ft, it said in a new report. \</doc>

Spain has offered to step in after Chile cancelled its hosting of next month's global climate change conference in the face of widespread looting and anti-government protests that have left at least 20 people dead. A day after announcing that he could not hold the United Nations COP25 in Santiago, President Pi\'f1era said he hoped "that this generous offer represents a solution". Pedro S\'e1nchez, the Spanish prime minister, said that he was ready to do what was needed to receive COP25 delegates from 190 countries in Madrid. UN representatives will discuss the offer next week. Mr Pi\'f1era also cancelled the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting, due to be held in Santiago this month. The decisions are a serious blow to Chile's image as one of Latin America's wealthiest and most politically stable countries. Chile has been racked by nationwide demonstrations since October 19, on a scale not seen since the military dictatorship that ruled between 1973 and 1990. For the first time since that period, the military has been deployed on the streets of the capital to try to repress protesters. More than one million people took to Santiago's streets on Monday. Masked and hooded protesters set fire to buses, banks and an upmarket shopping mall near the planned venues for the conferences. Mr Pi\'f1era, 69, a right-wing billionaire, is accused by his opponents of having little empathy with the working classes. The riots were triggered by fare increases on the metro in Santiago, but quickly escalated to violent demonstrations against the poor state of health care, education and pensions amid growing anger at high living costs and income inequality. Chile's human rights commission, which has observers in hospitals and police stations across the country, has recorded 1,233 people who have been hospitalised, 37 with gunshot wounds, since the violence broke out. At least 20 people have been killed during demonstrations, according to the commission. It is also investigating cases involving torture and sexual violence. It claims that 26 people have lost their sight and dozens have been partially blinded by rubber balls and tear gas canisters fired by police into crowds of demonstrators. "Violence should never be accepted in a democratic society," Mr Pi\'f1era said in his address to the nation this week when he announced a cabinet reshuffle in a desperate attempt to quell the unrest.

The UN climate talks in Madrid ended in stalemate on Sunday, with the negotiations running two days over time as countries squabbled over rules for a new global carbon trading market.\~ The talks, known as COP25 , ran for 14 days and set a record for the longest-ever climate negotiations, but failed to produce any agreement on\~trading in carbon credits.\~ This year global carbon dioxide emissions rose to record levels, millions of students marched in climate protests and leading economies adopted new net zero emissions targets. But none of that translated into measurable results at the negotiations.\~ Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the outcome was  totally unacceptable .  It is not adequate to just come back next year and say you are going to do more, she said.  Governments need to completely rethink how they do this. \~ The failure of COP25 to agree on the carbon market rules will complicate the task facing the UK, which takes over the presidency of the next UN\~ HYPERLINK climate talks in Glasgow next year. Geopolitical tension and the low profile of the US and China, the world\' s two biggest emitters, severely handicapped the negotiations, which descended into open bickering on the plenary floor in the final hours. Delegates appeared to be exhausted after all-night negotiating sessions on Friday night and Saturday night as negotiators raced to salvage a deal.\~ The Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C, has been signed by 197 countries.\~ But the agreement operates only by consensus and the original 2015 deal left many details to be worked out in future climate summits  a task that has been made much more complicated by fraying multilateralism and US opposition to the climate deal. The US is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord on the instructions of President Donald Trump, and this year is the last it will participate as a signatory.\~ The withdrawal of the US, and efforts by Brazil and Australia to water down the outcome, all helped lead to a result that many countries said was dismaying.\~ Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general, said he was disappointed with the result of the COP25 talks.  The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis, he said.\~ Farhana Yamin, an activist with Extinction Rebellion and former climate negotiator, said the Madrid talks had been a  setback .  The world is seeing how difficult it is to get countries to self-agree on something they don\' t want to agree on, she said.  It is not the failure of the agreement itself, it is the failure in many countries, reflecting a return to the climate denial agenda. The EU delegation also said it was disappointed that the meetings failed to find agreement on carbon markets.  This COP did not deliver all we came here for, the EU said in its final statement, adding that it was  deeply concerned that countries\' existing climate targets were far off track from what was needed to achieve the goals of the Paris accord. As the UK prepares to take charge of next year\' s climate talks, its handling of the summit is poised to be one of the biggest diplomatic initiatives for Boris Johnson, prime minister, after Brexit, which is scheduled for the end of January. As president of the Glasgow talks, the UK\' s job will be to rally more countries to adopt new climate targets for the middle of the century and to pick up the pieces on carbon markets.\~ Claire Perry O\' Neill, the UK-appointed president of next year\' s talks, said she welcomed the challenge of sorting out the carbon markets issue.\~  No deal is definitely better than the bad deal proposed, she said, referring to the carbon markets framework discussion.  We will pull no punches next year in getting clarity and certainty for natural carbon markets. \</doc>

SIR KEIR Starmer's shadow cabinet team sees familiar faces return after a long frontbench absence, some promotions, a few shuffles and a first crack at a frontbench job for others. After the new Labour leader unveiled his appointments for the top posts on Sunday, Ed Miliband's presence as shadow business secretary is arguably the most notable among the new list. He spent five years as Labour leader until 2015 and also served as energy and climate change secretary in the government of Gordon Brown. He has continued to display a keen interest in climate change matters from the backbenches. The role seems a natural fit for Mr Miliband as Business Secretary Alok Sharma is responsible for tackling climate change and is officially minister for COP 26 - the United Nations climate change conference to be held in the UK. David Lammy held ministerial posts under Tony Blair and Mr Brown, and now makes a return after 10 years to a frontbench position as shadow justice secretary. Bridget Phillipson, the new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, takes on her first major role having previously served as a whip in the time of Mr Miliband. She was clear in her pro-EU views and critical of the party's approach to Brexit under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Ian Murray is back as shadow Scottish secretary following his deputy leadership bid. Thangam Debbonaire moves from the whips' office to become shadow housing secretary and Rosena Allin-Khan follows her strong deputy leadership bid with a place as shadow mental health minister, notable given her ongoing work as an A&E doctor. John Healey leaves his housing brief to replace Nia Griffith as shadow defence secretary, who in turn is now shadow Welsh secretary for a second time. Steve Reed is promoted from his junior shadow education role to become shadow communities secretary, and succeeds Andrew Gwynne who announced he is planning to recharge his batteries on the backbenches following a difficult election campaign. Emily Thornberry re-emerges as shadow international trade secretary, replacing Barry Gardiner. This is likely to set up some highly watchable questions sessions with her counterpart Liz Truss, and Ms Thornberry previously held the post of shadow foreign secretary - now a role for leadership contender Lisa Nandy. Rebecca Long-Bailey, another leadership hopeful defeated by Sir Keir, moves from business to become shadow education secretary - replacing her friend and flatmate Angela Rayner, the new deputy leader and chairwoman of the party. Jo Stevens returns as shadow culture secretary having previously last appeared on the Labour frontbench as shadow Welsh secretary in January 2017. Preet Kaur Gill is promoted to shadow international development secretary, replacing Corbyn loyalist Dan Carden - who she served under as a junior shadow minister. Jim McMahon is promoted from his shadow communities post to shadow transport secretary while Andy McDonald moves from that role to become shadow employment rights and protections secretary Marsha de Cordova is the new shadow women and equalities secretary, moving from her shadow work and pensions ministerial role. Louise Haigh becomes interim shadow Northern Ireland secretary after a series of confident displays at the despatch box in her shadow Home Office role. Tony Lloyd is currently in hospital being treated for coronavirus. Those remaining in post include Luke Pollard as shadow environment secretary, Cat Smith as shadow minister for young people and voter engagement, and Valerie Vaz as shadow Commons leader. In the Lords, Baroness Chakrabarti is another Corbyn backer to lose out as she is replaced as shadow attorney general by Lord Falconer of Thoroton - formerly justice secretary for a period under Mr Blair. \</doc>

The United Nations climate change conference , COP26, which is to be held in Glasgow has been postponed because of disruption caused by coronavirus.\~ The decision was reached by UN leaders in light of the "unprecedented global challenge" of the disease, the UK's business secretary Alok Sharma, who is in charge of the event, said.\~ The event had been expected to attract over 30,000 delegates from around the world, including heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus.\~ It is expected the event will be rescheduled to the middle of next year.\~ The announcement comes as the Edinburgh summer festivals were cancelled for the same reason.\~ The Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the Military Tattoo, the Art Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival were all cancelled on Wednesday.\~ Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, the Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop, who is also in charge of overseeing major events, said that "there was no alternative".\~ Hyslop said that the decision to cancel COP26 because the people involved with planning for the event were focussed on the public health crisis.\~ She also said that for both COP26 and the festivals that the dangers associated with international travel prevented any rescheduling of the events for later this year.\~ On the cancellation of the climate change conference, Hyslop said : "The whole point of having COP is not to just to hold an event, it's for effective decision making, and we want countries to be in the best place to make effective decisions to tackle climate change. "As we go through this crisis, people are behaving differently, they're doing things that are different, and perhaps that might be an opportunity for us when we get through this to think about how we change our lives to deliver what COP wanted to do, which is substantial changes in climate emissions of the world in order to tackle that emergency." On the summer festivals she said she felt "hugely disappointed". She added: "we really want to work with them to make sure that they recover and the a strong 2021 season." Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "We welcome the common sense decision to postpone COP26. "Given the global health and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that hosting an international conference in November would be difficult if not impossible. The decision also means that much needed resources can be focussed on the immediate task of saving lives and protecting the economy. "The Scottish Government remains committed to supporting Glasgow as host of COP26. When the time is right, we look forward to welcoming delegates to a successful COP26 in Glasgow, that sets the world on course to net-zero in a way that is fair and just." Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: "Postponing COP26 is the right decision in these unique and difficult circumstances. A huge amount of work has gone into preparing for the event in Glasgow, and that won't be wasted. I very much look forward to Glasgow welcoming the world for a successful COP26 next year." Scottish Greens Climate Spokesperson Mark Ruskell MSP said: "While it is naturally disappointing that COP26 has now been postponed, it's clear that it would have been almost impossible to make the necessary preparations and negotiations in the face of the current COVID19 crisis. "The climate and health emergencies mean that we must re-build the economy in a way that that supports people and creates new jobs in sectors that are vital for our future. That will need fresh thinking about how governments can develop a Green New Deal that intervenes and invests in the economy, creating fair work while also improving our health and wellbeing. "When COP26 does eventually arrive in Glasgow next year I am confident that global leaders will be more determined than ever to ensure that meaningful climate action is achieved, especially if there is a new US President." \</doc>

THE Paris Agreement on climate change has been gutted and the prospects for developing countries look "dire", according to an environmental charity, which has said wealthy countries are refusing to pay for the climate damage they have caused. Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) said northern governments and corporation were pushing forward with carbon trading and the repression of peoples' demands in Chile had been echoed by the aggressive silencing of civil society voices at the Madrid climate summit, which it said has been out of touch with reality. FoES said the chances of keeping the planet at a liveable temperature for all are on a knife-edge with the carbon "budget" for 1.5 degrees almost exhausted. Yet, it said, the rich countries which created the climate crisis in the first place, including Scotland, the UK and the EU are using loopholes to evade emissions cuts rather than keeping fossil fuels in the ground. The FoES remarks came as the COP25 summit in Madrid drew to a close. Sara Shaw, climate justice and energy programme coordinator for FoE International, said: "Just as we thought the slow pace and weak ambition shown at the climate talks couldn't get worse, along comes COP25 . "And we have seen a refusal by developed countries to pay up for loss and damage finance, while they try to introduce language that would remove their liability for the impacts their emissions have caused." COP26 will take place in Glasgow next year under the presidency of the UK government, and FoES head of campaigns, Mary Church, added: "The COP in Glasgow will be the fourth in a row to take place in the global north, putting additional barriers in the way of global south participation. In light of yesterday's election results we anticipate the continuation of the racist 'hostile environment' UK border controls. The UN must put pressure on the new UK government to ensure the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are not silenced or excluded at COP26." \</doc>

BARRING any unprecedentedly large political bust-ups, the biggest international event that the UK has ever held will come to Glasgow in November. The United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP26 as it is more commonly known, will not only be huge it could be of vital historic significance and if so will be referred to, not just for years, but for decades to come. It is an event that potentially provides massive opportunities for the city and for Scotland as a whole and for its business community. It is a chance for businesses here to be at the forefront of national and international efforts to combat climate change. We tease out various aspects of its potential significance in our Science and Technology Review (page 33) and in our report on the Conferences, Events and Hotels sector (page 55). Given the potential for much advancement in protecting our planet, in our scientific advancement and in our business tourism and hospitality sectors it is to be strongly hoped that our politicians will see sense and cooperate across UK Government, Scottish Government and city council. I would suspect that if that is not the case then there would be a very high price to be paid at the ballot box. It is, of course, far from the only area where events from the political world are impacting on our businesses and our ability to trade and earn. The effects of our departure from the European Union are beginning to be felt more strongly in many different industrial sectors and areas. We look at some of the nitty gritty effects of the coming changes in areas like construction, life sciences, agriculture and fisheries and in employment and the workplace more generally. (Brexit Begins page 27). As speakers at our Top500 Business Breakfast made clear (page 102) Brexit is far from done - in truth there is still a hell of a long way to go (I believe I use the words advisedly). But at least the forward motion on Brexit - whether it proved very much in the wrong direction or not - has ended part of the uncertainty. The General Election result gave a clear outcome - whether you like it politically or not - and that did give a boost to the number of transactions at the tale end of the year. In fact as we report in our quarterly review of Deals (page 65) deal numbers finish at an all-time high. There is much to pore over in the figures for that last quarter of 2019. The end of the political deadlock has sparked a rise in optimism in the construction sector, although as we report (page 45), that is a sentiment that is running ahead of recovery. Optimism is also something that seems to be strongly exhibited by backers of the Ayrshire Growth Deal - we report on its progress one year on (page 81). Much of the ambition - and a possible 4,000 out of a hoped for 7,000 jobs boost - focuses on aerospace and space. There has been quite a lot of comment about Prestwick Airport and its lack of flights but that, the space around it and its geography does actually provide a platform on which growth in the sector in Scotland can be built. It is probably not very widely known that there are already 4,000 jobs in aerospace in the Prestwick area - it is a cluster which can be further developed. While the size of aerospace may not be widely known even less so is the scale of the maritime sector in Scotland. People currently think only of shipbuilding and ferries in particular but as we report (page 77) it is truly a hidden jewel of the Scottish economy. \£6 Professor John Curtice has estimated that we have come 15 per cent of the way towards Brexit in three years with 85 per cent to go by the end of this year \</doc>

Police Scotland will face major challenges in 2020 and there are serious problems that may make them even more difficult, writes Tom Wood. This year is set to be the biggest yet for Police Scotland. Not only will the force have to cope with its usual demands, it will have to shoulder the ongoing growth of cyber crime, the never-ending investigation of historical sexual crime, and to cap it all Cop26, the United Nations climate change conference , which is set to be the biggest event held in the UK in living memory. If the bickering between the UK and Scottish governments doesn't get out of hand, up to 200 world leaders and 90,000 delegates will descend on Glasgow in November. It's billed as a make-or-break event, no more long grass - tough decisions must be made. Difficult enough, then add to the mix the usual gaggle of celebrities, protestors acting like anarchists, and anarchists disguised as protestors - you get the picture. READ MORE: Crime could soar if systemic underfunding' of Police Scotland continues, says top cop READ MORE: Police Scotland \£350 million funding black hole risks 750 officers So how well placed is Police Scotland to face this challenge? Well, to get an idea, let's look at three of the essential components - leadership, resources and governance. On the first point, we can take some comfort. In its seventh year, police leadership has at last settled. We now have a good experienced command team headed by a Chief with the vision and the grip to take on the toughest challenges. So far, so optimistic - a green light. Value for money On resources, it's far from perfect, there are problems especially in the Capital Budget for cars, buildings etc. The recent Scottish Government Budget has, however, applied some sticking plaster. So let's give resources the benefit of the doubt - an amber light. Lastly we come to accountability and scrutiny where the picture is bleaker. While some may see policing as simply crime prevention and investigation, it's a lot more complicated. The police service is a huge publicly funded business requiring complex systems of challenge and support to make sure the job is done and we all get value for money. Which brings me to the Scottish Police Authority, the replacement for the old regional police boards. The SPA is tasked with promoting improvement, reviewing the service and holding the Chief Constable to account. It's a function vital to the health of policing. Of course, the SPA is not the only body tasked with police scrutiny. The courts, Parliament, HM Inspectorate and even an independent body (PIRC) all have a piece of the action. It's a cluttered landscape and that's part of the problem. Root canal treatment If the operational side of Police Scotland has had teething problems, the SPA seems to have been undergoing root canal treatment since inception in 2013. In fairness they started with a big disadvantage, as unlike their predecessors the SPA are unelected appointeesand have nowhere to hide from political interference. It hasn't gone particularly well. In an unprecedented move, HM inspectorate recently went on record to express concerns about the SPA's performance - a red light. And without overplaying dental metaphors, authority chairs have been chewed up and spat out with alarming regularity. Now, once again, a new chair is being sought. The SPA manages a big business and needs the requisite skills so let's hope a chair with the appropriate experience is chosen and left to get on with it without micromanagement. Every component of Police Scotland must be running smoothly in this year of challenge. We need green lights. Tom Wood is a writer and former Deputy Chief Constable \</doc>

The 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker will be marked with a special exhibition in A number of historical artefacts from the roots of the scotch whisky giant are to go on public display for the first time at the Dick Institute. The exhibition comes11 years after Diageo - who own the brand - pulled out of Kilmarnock, axing 700 jobs in the process. It was in Kilmarnock in 1820 that young John Walker set out in business with the opening of a grocery store. And now, two centuries later, the rarest items from those humble beginnings will be put on display for the public to visit and view. The John Walker exhibition is a partnership between the Dick Institute and the Johnnie Walker Archive. Diageo's decision to axe Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock is still raw Key items, never before available for public display, will include:  The 1819 hand-written inventory from the sale of Todriggs Farm near Kilmarnock - the oldest item in the Johnnie Walker Archive collection, recording the sale of the farm after the death of John Walker's father, which funded the establishment of his grocery store.  An 1825 hand-written inventory from John Walker's grocery store. The oldest existing record from John Walker's shop detailing its stock of exotic teas from China, spices from Jamaica and, of course, scotch whisky.  A John Walker stock book dating from 1857, recording the growth of the business and its increasing focus on whisky in the year of John's death when the business passed to his son Alexander. Ayrshire dad's plea for new home after heart failure means he's unable to access bathroom Also included in the exhibition is a rare original copy of a book by renowned Victorian whisky writer Alfred Barnard who visited the Walker's premises in Kilmarnock in 1893, and the first international medals awarded to Walker's whiskies, from the Sydney International Exhibition in 1879, Adelaide in 1887 and Melbourne in 1888. Fittingly, the Johnnie Walker exhibition will sit alongside the Dick Institute's Robert Burn display, home to an original Kilmarnock Edition - the first book of Burns poetry published in 1786. Councillor Elena Whitham, depute leader of East Ayrshire Council and chair of East Ayrshire Leisure said: "We are delighted to be hosting this display as part of the celebrations to mark 200 years since John Walker started his business in Kilmarnock. "We have always recognised him as a son of Kilmarnock and it's entirely appropriate that these incredible artefacts will be on display in his home town. "He was an outstanding entrepreneur, born and bred in Kilmarnock. He set up his first shop near Kilmarnock Cross and laid the foundations for a whisky that has reached every part of the globe. Ayrshire police chief quits top role for job at United Nations Climate Change Conference "Kilmarnock is the home of the most famous whisky in the world and we are proud of what Johnnie Walker means to the heritage of East Ayrshire and indeed Scotland as a whole." Christine McCafferty, chief archivist at the Johnnie Walker Archive, said: "These items really are the crown jewels of our collection. They are remarkable historical documents that give us a fascinating insight into the roots of Johnnie Walker. "I'm delighted that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of John Walker starting out in his business we are able to put these items on display to the public in the town where the story began." The Johnnie Walker display will be a permanent feature in the Dick Institute, with different artefacts from the Johnnie Walker Archive being rotated on a regular basis. The current loan items will be on display until October. \</doc>

Boris Johnson's HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle/ Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday will not be "a revolution" Government sources said as ministers prepared for a limited shake-up that will see several Remainers promoted at the expense of Leavers. The Prime Minister was putting the finishing touches to a reshuffle which he hopes will decisively put the bitter three years of rowing over Brexit behind him. The scale of the reshuffle has been radically pared back since speculation of a much wider shake up in the immediate aftermath of the general election. The source added: "It is not going to be a revolution." Remain-supporting Chloe Smith, Oliver Dowden and Lucy Frazer are all tipped to be promoted to the Cabinet at the expense of Brexit supporting ministers like HYPERLINK Geoffrey Cox , Andrea Leadsom and Theresa Villiers. Ms Smith is tipped for a wider Minister for the Union role based at the Cabinet Office while Mr Dowden is a straight swap for Baroness Morgan running the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport department. Nusrat Ghani, already a junior Transport Minister, is also set to be made HS2 Minister, The Telegraph understands, although she could face criticism because her Wealden constituency is nowhere near the HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle/ \£3106 billion railway Ms Villiers, the Environment Secretary, is also widely expected to be sacked, leaving Home Secretary Priti Patel as the only member of the Cabinet who consistently voted against Theresa May's Brexit deal. Brexiteers including Mr Johnson, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House of Commons, all backed her deal at the so-called third Meaningful Vote stage last March. One Government source said: "The labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' were binned as soon as we got Brexit done-no one mentions them now." The source also admitted that the scale of the reshuffle has been radically pared back since speculation of much wider shake up in the immediate aftermath of the general election. The source added: "It is not going to be a revolution." In other changes Mark Spencer, the Government chief whip, is understood by two Westminster sources to be "pushing" to take over at the top of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Mr Spencer is one of four partners in Mapperley-based farming business CH Spencer and Son which receives up to \£315,000 a year under the Common Agricultural Policy. Mr Spencer did not return a request for comment on Tuesday night. The Government is committed replacing the current CAP funding for farmers with payments for "public goods", such as maintaining access to the countryside and planting meadows. HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle/ Last month Mr Spencer told The Telegraph : "The system will change and it is a great opportunity to improve the environment and to do something positive." Meanwhile, Chris Pincher, currently a Minister of State in the Foreign Office, could be brought in to run the Whips' Office. Michael Gove, the Chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster, is tipped to be given HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle/ overall control of the talks about a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union at a beefed-up Cabinet Office. Jake Berry, the Northern Powerhouse minister could be given a full time Cabinet position, while Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park will be given a role at the COP26 United Nations Climate Change conference in November reporting to Mr Gove. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, and Ms Leadsom, the Business Secretary, are both tipped to be demoted. Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle/ has been shored up after she was repeatedly name checked by Mr Johnson in his well-received trade speech last week. Number 10 sources confirmed at the weekend that Grant Shapps, the Transport ecretary, is definitely safe in his role. \</doc>

It says a lot when even the lowest of expectations end in bitter disappointment and boiling anger. Hardened veterans arrived for the UN climate talks in Madrid with little hope of a long-sought "breakthrough moment". Those low expectations were sadly proved right. Not even extra time, with the talks extended for two days, could make the difference. The world is screaming out for action but this conference responded with a whisper. In truth, much of the script for this episode of the 25-year soap opera was focused on important but often technical discussions. But while the world burns, the diplomats talk, and talk, and talk. The big plot twists, we are promised, will instead happen in national capitals over the next few months with each country expected to enhance their plans to cut emissions by 2030. It is critical they do so quickly. The deadline is the talks in Glasgow next November. In the meantime, many decisions were either put on pause or stuck firmly in slow motion in Madrid and these negotiations, known as COP25 , have done little to inspire optimism. Not even Greta Thunberg could manage to press fast forward. Flanked by security and media, she has been an ever more articulate advocate for young people's rising anger, but even before the final outcome was issued, her judgment on the speed of climate action was damning. "The real danger," Thunberg warned a meeting of all 196 nations, "is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact, almost nothing is being done." The 16-yearold added sharply, but fairly: "This is not leadership. This is not leading. This is misleading." Too many rich, high-polluting countries failed to make Madrid matter for poorer countries on the front lines of a crisis they did little to cause. For them, this soap opera already has a devastating ending. Not even some Hollywood stardust could get things moving. Harrison Ford joined others from America in declaring "We're Still In", despite President Trump pulling the US out of the Paris agreement. "Like many of you, I have felt despair for the state of the world, for our future'' he said. "A future that includes my five children, my three grandchildren, their children. People are scared, angry." People like Ilisapeci Masivesi from Fiji, a country at risk because of rising sea levels. "It's right there on our doorstep. It's a matter of our survival," she told me. "It's about our identity, our generation, our sovereignty. Where does this all end if we're not going to get action?" It's a fear shared 9,000 miles from Fiji in Malawi where smallholder farmers, who make up most of the population, are locked in a cycle of droughts and floods. One of them, Ellen Matupi, carried a simple message to COP25 : "The emergency is now, disasters are now, we want relief now." The deadline for rich countries to deliver their promised $100 billion a year to help poorer countries reduce their emissions and adapt their lives is 2020. The commitment is the glue that holds together the Paris agreement - but it's coming unstuck and it's eroding trust. "2020 is just around the corner," Matupi said. "We will see if their promises are true or not, but so far we're not being helped." COP25 brought some new financial commitments, but not enough. While the headline figure of $100 billion a year could still be reached, too much is given as loans rather than grants, too little reaches those who need it most, and much of the money is relabelled development funding rather than being new and additional. Worse, increasingly extreme weather events and slow-onset disasters such as sea-level rise mean that more and more communities are facing irreversible climate impacts. They can simply no longer cope. Their homes are becoming uninhabitable, their land unfarmable and their lives unbearable. Once more, wealthy countries that got rich from high-carbon activities continued to sidestep liability by failing to commit new money to cover losses and damages. COP25 created a path forward through an expert group that will examine the issue, but the trail is narrow and far from certain. The talks brought a promise to enhance women's leadership in climate decision-making. Realising this commitment is vital. However, indigenous women from Latin America aren't waiting for an invitation to lead. In Madrid, they shone a painful light on how their land and human rights are being trampled underfoot by deforestation. As Nina Gualinga, from the Ecuadorian Amazon, put it: "If we don't listen to indigenous women, we're not going to get out of this climate crisis". We must stick with all those who create and sustain reasons for hope. With those powerful indigenous women. With the islanders standing firm in the face of rising seas. With the farmers fighting for survival. And with the young people whose influence will only grow more powerful. Young people like Dylan Hamilton, 15, who went to Madrid to represent the Scottish Youth Climate Strike. After standing hand-in-hand with Thunberg in front of the world's media, he told me: "I do think governments know there will be a lot more backlash if they don't take the right action." The talks failed, but we cannot give up. And with the talks in Glasgow still 11 months away, it's more essential than ever that the people's voice is heard. Together we can ensure that there are better plot twists to come. We have no choice, too many lives depend on it.

The United Nations Secretary General has added his voice to attempts to shame nations into action at the Madrid climate conference. Ant\'f3nio Guterres said yesterday that the world had a choice to tackle climate change or surrender. He urged delegates at the COP25 conference to decide whether they "really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burnt". Speaking at the opening of the two-week UN meeting in the Spanish capital, Mr Guterres said that new data showed levels of greenhouse gases had hit a record high. Mr Guterres (inset) said that big greenhouse gas emitters in particular needed to step up their efforts or risk steep temperature rises by the end of the century: "The impact on all life on the planet - including ours - will be catastrophic." Spain's interim prime minister joined in, noting that "only a handful of fanatics deny the evidence" of climate change, without naming any individuals or countries. Pedro S\'e1nchez said "alternative facts" must be fought with actions."There is no wall that will protect any country, as powerful as it might be," he added, calling for Europe to lead the global efforts for decarbonisation. The remarks were no doubt aimed at the prominent climate-change sceptic Donald Trump. But yesterday Democratic members of the US Congress insisted that America should remain committed to the Paris climate accord, despite the President's decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement - a decision that he will be able to enact on his first day in office if he wins a second term. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, told an audience in Madrid yesterday that "we're still in it". Ms Pelosi, who led a delegation of more than a dozen members of Congress to Spain, said that climate change posed a threat to public health, the economy and national security. The congressional group is separate from the official US delegation at the COP25 , which is led by the ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat. The US technically remains a member of the Paris accord until 4 November next year. Delegates from almost 200 countries have begun the conference that seeks to step up efforts to stop global warming. One island nation says it is in a "fight to the death" with climate change. President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific told the summit that powerful swells averaging 16ft washed across the capital, Majuro, last week. \</doc>

Event The president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, is rapidly becoming a champion of the environment, with a call at the G7 summit of world leaders to help lead the fight against climate change and deforestation through reforestation projects on a vast scale. Analysis Mr Pi\'f1era is burnishing his environmental credentials ahead of hosting the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in the capital, Santiago, on December 2nd-13th 2019. Chile is taking an active role in combating climate change, and claims to lead in the adoption of renewable energy technologies, the banning of single-use plastic bags and boasts the second-largest electric vehicle fleet per capita, after China. In January Mr Pi\'f1era tabled a bill for stiffer fines and custodial sentences for serious violations of Chile's environmental laws, marking a shift towards increased environmental scrutiny. The initiative would also make it a crime to mislead environmental inspectors or to obstruct the enforcement of environmental laws. In a first for Chile, Mr Pi\'f1era addressed a climate change panel at the G7 summit of world leaders, held in France in late August, just as wildfires devastated areas of the Amazon forest. He has assumed a role as mediator, amid flaring tensions between Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, and other world leaders and environmental activists, incensed by Bolsonaro's initially dismissive response to global concerns over the fires, many of which were for illegal forest-clearing. Mr Pi\'f1era considers himself a close ally of Mr Bolsonaro and has persuaded him to attend a summit of Amazon basin countries in Leticia, Colombia on September 6th to discuss forest protection. Environmental lobby groups want the G7 to strengthen import restrictions on beef, soya, minerals and other products that originate from areas affected by deforestation, enhance oversight of investment in the Amazon and support Brazil to achieve climate targets. Meanwhile, France and Ireland have threatened to block an EU trade deal with Brazil and three other Latin American countries if it fails to protect the Amazon. Impact on the forecast Chile's diplomacy under Mr Pi\'f1era is boosting its international standing. We expect recent events and the COP25 meeting to boost Mr Pi\'f1era's previously flagging popularity at home and, in turn, improve support from lawmakers for his reform plans. \</doc>

Ellen Matupi didn't cause the climate emergency, but she's now on its frontline. "The emergency is now, disasters are happening now, and we want relief now. When I don't get a good crop, I will not put food on my table for my children." As a subsistence farmer from Malawi's northern district of Rumphi, the global climate negotiations are normally very far from Ellen's mind; she has much more immediate challenges. But this year she's travelled more than 5,000 miles to COP25 - the UN climate talks in Madrid - to raise her voice and to speak for millions more who can't be here. "In Malawi, we are still farming using hoes; it's a back-breaking exercise. It is so hard. The soils have become harder than before. "Farming is unpredictable these days. We have a number of problems like droughts and floods." In Malawi, the vast majority of people are smallholder farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture to survive. Earlier this year, floods induced by Cyclone Idai affected many parts of southern Malawi damaging houses and crops. Across Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique more than 1,000 people were killed. Alongside reducing emissions faster, boosting support for countries on the frontlines of the climate emergency is at the top of the agenda at COP25 , which was relocated from Chile amid civil unrest over growing levels of economic inequality. At the core of the climate negotiations is a deep-rooted injustice: the poorest half of humanity - 3.5 billion people - are responsible for 10 per cent of carbon emissions yet are being hit first and worst by a crisis they did little to cause. In contrast, the richest 10 per cent produce around half of global emissions. Rich countries promised $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor countries cut their emissions and adapt to a changing climate. "2020 is just around the corner," said Ellen. "We will see if their promises are true or not, but so far we're not being helped." Just $71.2bn was mobilised in 2017 - though this over-states actual support by a huge margin, with most of the funds given in the form of loans that need to be paid back, double counting, and too little of it committed to help people adapt. Worse still, due to slow emission reductions, climate impacts are increasingly going way beyond what it is possible to adapt to. Rich countries must therefore do more to pay off their ever-growing climate debt by helping poorer countries rebuild towns and rehome communities after climate disasters. Take Scotland. On top of our historic emissions, even if we achieve our welcome new net zero emissions by 2045 as per our new climate change law, our past and present emissions will continue to make the climate emergency worse. Scotland can't look away. While it is not a formal party to the Paris Agreement, unlike the UK, Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change Roseanna Cunningham is at COP25 in Madrid amid growing calls for increased action. Scotland can be proud of our early commitment to climate justice, but now is the time to increase this example. With just 11 months until the world's climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland must rapidly reduce its emissions. But we must also renew our commitment to helping the world's poorest countries adapt to this crisis. Having declared a "climate emergency", the Scottish Government must now identify ways to boost our Scottish Climate Justice Fund by identifying new sources of revenue and then ensuring it reaches communities being devastated right now. And we must go further by introducing ring-fenced additional funding to support those facing unavoidable loss and damage. By innovatively using the Scottish Parliament's revenue-raising powers, Scotland can set a powerful example ahead of COP26 in Glasgow that more funding can be secured without raiding existing international development budgets. "Scotland is already supporting Malawi. They should continue, and perhaps add some more," Ellen said. "My message to all world leaders is they should keep their promise that they will provide climate finance for adaptation, as well as for loss and damage."

SEBASTIAN PINERA, the president of Chile, has cancelled a major trade summit and pulled out of hosting a global environment conference as his embattled government struggles to handle more than a week of unrest. Mr Pi\'f1era made the announcement yesterday during the 12th day of widespread protests over inequality and police violence which have seen at least 20 people killed and more than 6,000 arrested. The president said it was a "very difficult decision". He added it "causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP25 for Chile and for the world". The APEC summit was due to bring 20 world leaders, including Donald Trump, the US president, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, to Chile on Nov 16-17. Mr Trump said he had expected to sign a "phase one" deal with his Chinese counterpart. The COP25 Six days ago, Teodoro Ribera, the Chilean foreign minister, said there was "no chance" that the riots and demonstrations would derail the conferences. The protests were initially sparked by a student campaign against a 30peso (three pence) rise in Santiago's metro fares two weeks ago. But since then, Chileans across the country have taken to the streets against economic and social inequality, including the almost complete privatisation of healthcare and education, alongside poor pensions and stagnant wages. Many demonstrations have been brutally repressed by armed forces, while others have been tainted by vandalism and looting. Chilean businesses have been hit with losses of around $1.4billion (\£31.1billion) as a result of the unrest, while Santiago's public transport system suffered nearly $400million (\£3310million) in damages. The announcement comes as NGOs and the UN's human rights commission begin to investigate allegations of abuse and sexual violence against demonstrators in Chile. Mr Pi\'f1era had tried to quell the unrest by announcing new social reforms and lifting the state of emergency, but demonstrations continued in full force, with many now calling for a new constitution. Patricia Espinosa, the UN climate change executive secretary, said the organisation was "currently exploring alternative hosting options". \</doc>

We've all been there: you're most of the way through a pretty arduous journey - perhaps on the way to a meeting, a party, or something you feel indebted to make - when you receive an ominous call from the host. "Very sorry," they might say, "but we've had a bit of an emergency and we're going to have to cancel. Please tell me you haven't set off yet?" It is, you'll agree, annoying. Now, imagine that "meeting" you were due to attend was in fact a UN conference on climate change in Santiago, Chile. And the "journey" involved travelling from the UK to South America (just the 7,000 miles) without emitting any carbon dioxide and using only non-fossil-fuel transport - meaning cycling, paddling, sailing and electric vehicles - to raise awareness about the global climate emergency. And that, at the moment you heard the conference was cancelled, you were bobbing somewhere across the Atlantic, in a 100-year-old tall ship, with weeks still to go before landfall. And that you were filming the whole thing. And that, oh, you'd emptied your \£350,000 life savings to fund it all. Now that would be annoying. "It literally knocked me sideways," says James Levelle, 38, to whom all this happened. "I was bloody miles from anywhere, with still a long way to sail, when I had a message saying it had been cancelled. Everyone on board was saying: 'Oh my God, what are you going to do?' Then began a big old think." Levelle, a relentlessly buoyant filmmaker, who has made are massive...' documentaries in some of the most extreme environments on Earth, had intended to record his adventure and a series of "global climate crisis messages" from young people along the way - delivering the footage to politicians at the conference. He had set off from Dorset in a sailing boat at the end of August, and travelled across Europe (mainly by bike) with a small crew, before arriving in Seville in September, where he jumped aboard a ship heading for the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, via Tenerife and Cape Verde. From there, he found his way to Buenos Aires, and planned to head across the Andes to Santiago for Monday this week, when the conference, also known as COP25 , was to begin. The meeting was set to draw climate activists from all over the world - including Greta Thunberg, who had already sailed across the Atlantic in September. But Chile's embattled president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, was forced to cancel in late October, when violent protests in his capital city - which had seen thousands of arrests, as well as left dozens dead - failed to defuse. Within hours, the UN announced that it was "exploring alternative hosting options", and the next day, another venue was found. It was in Madrid. Thunberg appealed to her three million Twitter followers for help. "It wasn't like I could say, 'Right, let's turn this ship around' - I was going to South America whether I liked it or not. Part of me almost laughed at the farcical nature of my position," he says. Filming from The choice became binary: should he wait to arrive in South America, then somehow try to get back to Madrid? Or plough on regardless? He plumped for the latter. "After a while, it became really clear to me: the job's not done. There were still quite a few events going on in Santiago that were relevant, so I knew that was where I should be. I said I would do something... and so I wanted to finish it." So that's what he'll do - barring another wild plot twist. At the time of writing, Levelle has missed his deadline by a couple of days. Cycling furiously across the Andes, having driven for 1,000km from Buenos Aires in an electric Renault van, he ought to arrive today. Throughout his time in South America, he has relied on the kindness of strangers, both for accommodation and general help. His crew has slimmed down - it's now just him and cameraman Eoghan McDonaugh - but his mission is otherwise unchanged: he's still capturing his journey, and still collecting video messages from children he meets in person and via his website, with a view to showing the film next week. Levelle was raised in London; his father was in advertising and his mother was a health practitioner. A degree in English from Edinburgh University was enough to convince him he'd like to avoid office work. He has successfully followed his hero, Sir David Attenborough, into documentaries, only Levelle's methods are quite a lot madder. Over more than a decade, he's documented child labour in India, met pirates off Sierra Leone and gone undercover in the Chinese illegal fur trade. Most audaciously, in 2015, he and another filmmaker, Rob Greenfield, travelled more than 5,000 miles from one side of South America to the other without money, just to see if they could and if people's generosity would sustain them. (Spoilers: they could and it did.) Sept 21: In Bilbao on UN International Peace Day He's mining that Latin goodwill again - although this time with a team of family and friends back in London, where he's rented out his houseboat, and he is very much using money. "I don't want to know how much I've spent," he admits. "A lot. I cannot bear to look at my bank balance. The most expensive thing has been paying for three of us to travel on a tall ship - \£35,000 a pop. I know it's a high-risk personal endeavour, but so many young activists are encouraging people to do something about the climate crisis that it got to the point where I had to. I'm hoping to get more funding, but I'm taking a hit." Levelle is effusive about Thunberg, who "deserves all the acclaim and attention she gets", but his motivation is to help young people without her extraordinary platform. "Not every young person can 'do a Greta'," he says, "so that's where I'm stepping in and lending a hand as best I can as a filmmaker. I would love to be able to call up Leo DiCaprio and ask for an electric car... but I'm not in that position, so I have to work with what I've got." The Andes, he adds, have been "one hell of a cycle", but he seems to say it with relish. It's lucky he's of an optimistic disposition. "I am. I'm feeling good and positive. And I've never quit anything before, so I'm not about to start now." For more about James's epic journey, visit HYPERLINK http://www.raceforfuture.com www.raceforfuture.com \</doc>

Queen Letizia, 47, was in Madrid today for a forum for traffic accident victims Modest Spanish royal dusted off one of favourite Zara skirts for the event   Paired the stylish snakeskin midi skirt with a simple black top and stud earrings Queen Letizia of Spain looked ready for business today as she attended a forum on road safety in Madrid. The modest Spanish royal, 47, who is well known for cleverly reworking and re-wearing pieces in her wardrobe, dusted off one of her favourite midi skirts - from Spanish high street giant Zara - for the occasion. She paired the stylish snakeskin skirt with a simple black top and added a touch of glamour with a knee-high black stiletto boot in suede. The Spanish royal appeared relaxed as she attended the forum at the Arbetis headquarters to discuss a new report by the London School of Economics on the socio-economic impact of traffic accidents with child victims. Looking stylish from head-to-toe, the former journalist wore her hair loose in voluminous, well-coiffed waves, showing off a hint of sparkle in her unique earrings. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The royal sported bronze eye shadow which she complimented with a light layer of bronzer and dark pink lip. Letizia previously wore the trendy snakeskin skirt while welcoming members of Vogue Spain and the organising committee of 'Fruit Attraction', a fruit and vegetable trade show, to her home, the Zarzuela Palace, back in January. Ahead of the conference, the royal posed for snaps alongside officials at the Arbetis headquarters. It's been a busy week for Letizia, with the royal attending several events for the COP25 climate change conference in Madrid over the past few days. The UN COP25 The convention has become the main instrument for advancing commitments of states against the acceleration of human-induced climate change, since it's adoption in 1992. The COP meet periodically to evaluate their achievements and to discuss working towards new objectives. This year's conference was set to take place in Santiago, Chile but was moved to Madrid due to an internal situation. Attending today's event solo, the Spanish queen was without her husband King Felipe, whom she married at the Almudena Cathedral at Royal Palace, Madrid, in May 2004. The couple are parents to Princesses Leonor, 14, and Sofia, 12. Before marrying into the royal family, Letizia had previously worked as a reporter for the news channel 24 Horas where she held a weekly anchor position on the show Informe Semanal and also a position on the daily morning news programme. \</doc>

Are you feeling a little flygskam after your summer holidays? Well you should be, unless Elton's arranged a 'carbon offset' for you, as he did for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (in which case, crack on). In these fragile, environmentally aware times, the 'flight shame' movement is spreading around the world at speed, picking its victims willy-nilly. Think of it like the conceptual equivalent of Ulrika Jonsson: well-meaning, slightly rapacious and, to some, almost irresistibly Swedish. But while you think about how you'll ever be able to look your grandchildren in the eye again after that long-haul trip, pick a celebrity green warrior to align with. And then be sure to recycle this magazine after you've read it. We will check, you know. SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 'I have never run a car,' the Granddaddy of Green has said. 'I could say that this is because I have this extremely tender environmentalist conscience, but the fact is I hate driving.' He actually feels the same way about elephants: doesn't ride them, because he can't stand 'big, tusky beasts'. I made that bit up. CARRIE SYMONDS Say what you like about her relationship, but having an environmental campaigner in Boris Johnson's inner sanctum can only be a good thing. And if she thinks she can change him, she might just be able to save the planet. Let's hope she doesn't prorogue the partnership any time soon. GRETA THUNBERG What did your teenager do this summer? Did they sail 3,000 miles to New York, with only a bucket for a toilet and three blokes for company, before telling the UN how to save this godforsaken planet? No, they played Fortnite until their thumbs went rigid and started secretly vaping in the shower, didn't they? All hail Greta. CROWN PRINCESS VICTORIA OF SWEDEN mm Sweden's heir apparent I s a patron of something called the Junior Water Prize. The 2019 win- announced last month in Stockholm, was presumably condensation. Yet again. PIERRE CASIRAGHI You wouldn't think a principality famous for motor racing and superyachts could produce anything helpful for the planet, but it was Casiraghi, grandson of Monaco's Grace Kelly, who offered Greta a lift to New York. THE SUSSEXES Prince Harry recently said that he travels commercial '99 per cent of the time', apart from when there's a 'unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe'. Safe from what? Easy Jet paninis i and boozy stag dos? In that case, I don't blame him. LEONARDO DiCAPRIO Some people reckon Leonardo's $5 million pledge to help the Amazon is the clearest sign of his commitment to the environment. Others will say that it's his campaigning documentaries. But what about this for a stand: these days, he only dates women born after the first United Nations Climate Change Conference . In 1995. GISELE BUNDCHEN Among numerous achievements as an eco warrior, the Brazilian supermodel and Greenest Celebrity at the 2011 International Green Awards also pioneered the 'horse walk' - when models pick their knees up and kick their feet out to 'stomp' down the runway. And who among us can truly say we understood the animal kingdom before that action? CRISTIANO RONALDO As the world's most-followed individual on Instagram, Ronaldo was congratulated for posting about the Amazon fires recently. But he's definitely not a birth striker: in 2017, when he already had a seven-year-old via a surrogate, he had twins by another surrogate, then another baby with his girlfriend five months later. That's a quick-fire hat trick. STELLA McCARTNEY If you've ever doubted Stella's commitment to the planet, just mosey on down to her flagship sustainable-luxury store on Bond Street. There, you'll find rocks shipped from her father's farm on the Mull of Kintyre sitting on a newly reinforced floor, spray-painted the perfect kind of grey to complement the rest of the shop. \</doc>

Scotland and the UK should not yet be boasting about their "world-leading" action to save the planet after Glasgow was selected as the venue for next year's prestigious United Nations climate change conference , environmentalists are warning. On winning the bid to stage the summit, international development secretary Alok Sharma said the decision was "testimony to the UK's leading role in the global fight against climate change". But campaigners have pointed out that landing the Conference of Parties (COP) is not based on a country's environmental credentials and more to do with the depth of its pockets. The 2013 and 2018 summits were held in Poland, a country powered by coal, and in 2012 in oil-rich Qatar. Conversely, although Fiji presided over the 2017, meeting the event itself was held in Bonn, Germany, as the South Pacific island could not handle the logistics and expense of staging such a large-scale gathering. Campaigners have welcomed the international event, which is seen as the most important since the Paris conference in 2015, but warn that much tougher action is needed if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided. "One only has to look at the recent hosting of COP by the right-wing, coal-loving Polish government to know that hosting these talks is not because you are the best in class. "The talks are an enormously complex, expensive undertaking for which there are few volunteers." International experts have agreed that a 2C rise in global temperature over pre-industrial levels would spark catastrophic and irreversible climate change. However, analysis suggests the world is currently on course to hit at least 3C by the end of the century. Westminster has outlined intentions for the UK to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, while Scotland intends to get there five years earlier. So all eyes will be on the UK as international leaders and the world's top climate scientists gather in Glasgow next December to discuss progress on pledges to restrict global warming to 1.5C, as set out in the Paris Agreement. Friends of the Earth Scotland is warning that both the UK and Scotland must drastically step up action to reduce greenhouse gases to have any hope of helping curb warming. The group has joined a number of other organisations in their call for tougher targets to be included in Scotland's forthcoming new Climate Bill, which is due to face its final vote at Holyrood on 25 September. Ministers have set out aims to cut emissions by 70 per cent by 2030, 90 per cent by 2040 and to reach net-zero by 2045. But the coalition Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, which includes Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB and Christian Aid as well as Friends of the Earth, is calling for an even more ambitious goal - 80 per cent by 2030. Dixon says actions over the next decade will be "crucial" in the fight against climate change and the Scottish Government still has an opportunity to set an example to the rest of the world ahead of COP26 by raising the bar higher still. "The UN's landmark report last year was crystal clear that emissions must fall significantly between now and 2030 if we are to have any hope of staying within 1.5C of warming," he said. "By setting a target to cut emissions by 86 per cent by 2030, Nicola Sturgeon's government would be able to hold their heads up high at the talks next year." Scottish climate change secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "It is right that this conference should come to Scotland, given our leadership in climate action. "Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to acknowledge the global climate emergency and the Scottish Government has introduced the toughest targets in the UK to ensure our action matches the scale of our climate ambitions." \</doc>

The past decade has "almost certainly" been the hottest on record and 2019 is on course to be one of the warmest years ever recorded, according to weather experts. An annual assessment of the Earth's climate by the HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation World Meteorological Organisation HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation heatwaves and encroaching seas ahead of two weeks of talks in \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Spain aimed at tackling \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation climate change . "If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing," Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary-general, warned in a statement. "Heatwaves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences," he added. In 2019, countries such as the HYPERLINK Bahamas , \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Japan and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones, Mr Taalas said, while "wildfires swept through the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Arctic and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Australia ". The secretary-general also warned of the threat posed to crop yields and "considerable food security challenges for vulnerable countries" from climate change. Average temperatures from both the last five years (2015-19) and the last 10 years (2010-19) are set to be the highest on record and 2019 is on course to be the second or third warmest year on record. Arctic sea ice neared record lows in September and October, with Antarctica seeing record lows several times in 2019. The WMO has warned climate change is a key driver of a recent rise in global hunger after a decade of steady declines, with more than 820 million people suffering from hunger in 2018. The report also noted that "marine heatwaves", which have a devastating effect on underwater life, have become more common. It added that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere hit a record level of 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and has continued to rise in 2019. At the start of the HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation COP25 climate summit on Monday, UN secretary-general \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning that the planet was nearer "the point of no return" and called current attempts to combat climate change "utterly inadequate". The past year has seen a rise in environmental activism across the world, prompting some major political parties and companies to commit to slashing emissions. However, experts still face an uphill battle to convince major emitters, such as the US, to embrace radical changes to combat the climate crisis. The COP25 HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-meteorological-organisation Mike Pompeo , the US secretary of state, announced that the US was formally withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which sought to commit countries to keeping increases in global average temperatures to below 2C.

For HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-will-edit-today-programme-to-warn-of-tomorrow-dnlp0cf7q Greta Thunberg the climate - and weather - have become a very real issue. The 16-year-old campaigner was last night being buffeted by an Atlantic gale with gusts of 30-40mph, as the yacht carrying her to a UN climate change conference tried to outrun a potentially bigger storm racing up behind. She also faces being becalmed, with forecasts showing that the gap between the two weather systems contains little wind. If the weather allows, Thunberg will dock in Lisbon early this week and head for Madrid to speak at the UN's Cop25 climate change talks, which start tomorrow. Thunberg's 3,000-mile winter crossing is HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-will-edit-today-programme-to-warn-of-tomorrow-dnlp0cf7q courtesy of two Australian YouTubers , Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu, and their 11-month-old son, Lenny. They offered Thunberg, and her father Svante, a lift on La Vagabonde, their 48ft catamaran, when she got stuck in America. Thunberg had sailed to the US to speak at September's UN Climate Action Summit and planned to travel overland to Chile where the Cop25 conference was set to take place until riots forced a switch of venue to Madrid. In theory, the voyage saves the roughly two or three tons of CO emissions that flights from Washington for her and her father would otherwise have generated. There was, however, one hitch. Sailing the Atlantic in November requires an experienced crew - and La Vagabonde needed an extra hand. The answer was Nikki Henderson, 26, from Guildford, Surrey, who is one of Britain's best young offshore yacht skippers. She volunteered to help - but was in Britain, and had to buy a plane ticket to join them. The emissions from her transatlantic flight will have undermined those saved by Thunberg and her father. The science to be revealed in Madrid this week suggests neglect is a mild description. One report, the World Meteorological Organisation's Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2018, will warn that 2019 could be the second or third warmest year on record with global temperatures up by 1.1C on the pre-industrial baseline of 1850-1900 and on track to rise by 4-5C by 2100. It is the UK's Met Office which predicts the scariest future. Its projections suggest that the greenhouse gases already released will make sea levels rise for hundreds of years. By 2300 coastal cities such as London, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh face rises of as much as 12-14ft, it said in a new report. \</doc>

Climate change has been at the top of the agenda recently, and Worcestershire residents were amongst the thousands of people who travelled to London from across the country to lobby their MPs to act on climate change. It was rewarding to meet my constituents, hear their concerns, answer their questions and explain the Government's contribution to ending climate change. For instance, last week MPs passed a legally-binding target for the UK to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. The target is bold but achievable, and we are the first major economy to commit to such a target. I hope more countries will follow our example. I have also been involved in gathering signatures for a petition which called for the UK to host next year's international summit on climate change, and I was delighted to meet some of the signatories whilst at the mass lobby. The petition urges the Government to do everything it can to ensure London hosts the UN Conference on Climate Change (COP26), which will see world leaders update us on the steps they have taken to meet climate change targets agreed to at the 2015 Paris Summit. I received signatures from constituents both young and old, highlighting how this important subject is not a generational issue. Having presented the petition to Parliament the Prime Minister has given her full backing to our petition, and as things stand only Turkey and the UK are the remaining host contenders. The final decision is due soon. I am sure it has not gone unnoticed that we will soon have a new Prime Minister. However, I know that, whichever candidate wins, tackling climate change will receive the attention it deserves, and I will do whatever I can to keep raising this important subject. \</doc>

Chile\' s president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era requested the resignation of his entire cabinet on Saturday in a bid to defuse a political crisis that erupted with mass protests a week ago over inequality in one of Latin America\' s wealthiest countries. The centre-right leader also pledged to cancel a state of emergency by the end of Sunday after Chile\' s armed forces lifted curfews in Santiago and other major cities on Saturday. Civil unrest has died down even as broader, more peaceful protests gather momentum.\~ Officials confirmed that some 1.2m protesters descended peacefully on Plaza Italia in downtown Santiago on Friday in what is being hailed as the largest demonstration in the country\' s history. As many as 2m of Chile\' s 18m population took to the streets nationwide.\~  We have all listened to the message. We have all changed. With unity and help from God, we will follow the path to that better Chile for everyone, tweeted the centre-right president on Friday night, commending the  happy and peaceful protests.\~ Several key ministers were quick to come out in support Mr Pi\'f1era\' s decision to appoint a new cabinet, which the billionaire former businessman said was aimed at  confronting these new demands and taking charge of these new times. At least 19 people have died in the turmoil that has gripped Chile, with Mr Pi\'f1era becoming the first Chilean leader to bring troops on to the streets since the fall of the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in 1990.\~ Normality is gradually returning, with public transport services being reinstated and shops reopening after the unrest that began as a protest over a 3 per cent rise in metro fares spiralled into a mass movement over inequality and high living costs.\~ The Chilean stock market suffered its worst week in two years, falling by almost 5 per cent, while the peso weakened by more than 2 per cent. Santiago\' s chamber of commerce estimated that the protests had cost business some $1.4bn. Just over $900m of the losses were due to looting, and the remainder in missed sales.\~  A peaceful day that will leave its mark on our history. Chile is not the same as it was yesterday. Politics didn\' t change it. It is politics that must change, tweeted Felipe Kast, a senator for the ruling coalition, referring to the demonstration on Friday.\~ Although doubts persist over whether conditions are suitable for Chile to host two major international summits soon, foreign minister Teodoro Ribera said on Thursday that there was  no chance of calling off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in mid-November or the UN climate change conference COP25 in December.\~ Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist who is expected to attend the COP25 meetings, posted images on Twitter of the mass demonstration in Santiago on Saturday, commenting:  A beautiful sight. My thoughts are with the people of Chile. \</doc>

The Scottish Government has been accused of ``not doing enough'' on climate change ahead of a major summit being hosted in Glasgow next year. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the Government is missing its own targets - which were set earlier this year and heralded by the First Minister as being among the most ambitious in the world. Ms Johnstone said 500,000 people had marched in Madrid against climate change this week during the UN's COP25 summit - with the next iteration taking place in Glasgow in 2020. She claimed there is a ``cosy consensus'' in the Scottish Parliament which ``ignores the science''. She added: ``The science says we must not use the fossil fuels we know about, let alone exploring for more. ``Opening COP25 Responding, the First Minister said her Government ``does accept the science'', adding: ``That's why we put forward and had passed in this Parliament the most ambitious climate change targets of any country in the world. ``In terms of fossil fuels, I have made very clear that we are in a transition away from fossil fuels, that transition must accelerate. ``But we must make sure that transition satisfies two things. Firstly that it doesn't lead to an increase in our dependence on imports - which would increase not decrease our carbon footprint. And secondly, we must do it in a way that is just and fair, so we don't leave people behind.'' But Ms Johnstone took issue with Ms Sturgeon's claim that the transition has started, saying: ``The First Minister is fond of saying that the tap can't be turned off overnight, and no-one is asking for that, but the just transition the First Minister speaks about has to start now and frankly, the evidence that's happening is unavailable. ``The Scottish Government is not doing enough to reduce demand for fossil fuels.'' The Green MSP went on to list a number of ways she believes the Scottish Government could speed up the transition, including reallocating funding for roads improvements to boost public transport and the insulation of every home in Scotland. She added: ``Since the Paris Agreement, oil and gas extraction is up in Scotland, transport emissions are up in Scotland, and the world-leading targets are being missed.'' Ms Johnstone implored the First Minister to ``get her act together before thousands of people march at COP26 in Glasgow''. Ms Sturgeon insisted the transition away from fossil fuels has already started, pointing to the fact that 75% of Scotland's electricity comes from renewables, but warning the UK Government's ``perverse'' policies on onshore wind and nuclear power had ``frustrated'' the Scottish Government's approach to climate change. end \</doc>

For the past six months, I have supported a group of British women of Bangladeshi origin who are facing redundancy, through no fault of their own. Their jobs have been the first and only of their lifetime, having been born and raised near their workplace. In total, between them, these five women have served in this workplace for 72 years. They all began as full-time employed staff, and only became part-time when they had children. As stipulated under the Employment Rights Act 1996, the redundancy payout they received was calculated only on their part-time hours, even though they had worked far more full-time years than part-time years. Although some men will also be affected by this if they change their hours from full to part-time, many women are at a disadvantage as they are more likely to change their hours after having a baby, before phasing back into full-time work. The Fawcett Society recently launched the Right To Know Bill at an event that I attended, which has cross-party support for a women's right to know how much their male colleagues are being paid for performing the same role. It is a motion that I have submitted for debate at my council meeting in March to give women the right to know pay inequity in the council's workplace. The Global Gender Report 2020, which covers four areas of economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment, revealed that gender parity would not be attained for 100 years. It's worth emphasising how stark this statistic is: none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and neither will many of our children. Have we become more accepting of our circumstances, or have our struggles made us as resilient as ever to demand an equal world? As women, are we doing enough, or are we too accepting of our lot and believe that no one will listen? Baroness Lorely Burt, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for women, says: "Every year Women's Day comes around and I mark the fact that we have made incremental steps forward, and some steps backwards. It behoves all of us who have a voice to speak out for a happier, more fulfilled and more equal world for women and girls." This year's international women's celebrations theme is #eachforequal, promoting the message that an equal world is an enabled world and is fundamental to thriving economies. The 2020 March4Women will take place on Sunday, International Women's Day, and comes before the UK hosts the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow later this year. The march will be a feminist call to action for politicians to play their part in addressing climate emergency. Singer Emeli Sande, who will perform as part of the rally, said: "The climate crisis affects every single one of us on our shared planet, but the poorest are enduring the worst of it - with women and girls disproportionately affected, as they so often are when disasters strike. It's time we step up and demand a fairer world." There are many women who have had the tenacity and courage to fight for equality. Yet many more are silently enduring pay discrimination or are unaware they're being treated unfairly. Even our own government is at fault. Recently, the Financial Times' analysis of official figures revealed that despite the government wanting to make the civil service the UK's most inclusive employer, four departments reported a widening of the gap between what men and women are paid. The 2019 gender pay gap figures revealed that eight in 10 UK firms pay men more than women, but that women from Bame backgrounds are disproportionately affected. It is not because they are less educated - quite the opposite. Over the last 11 years, for example, more Muslim women than men are gaining degrees, yet despite evidence still shows they are still struggling to enter the labour market because of discrimination. As I think of all the women I have met, supported, cried and laughed, struggled and celebrated with I am reminded of Isabelle Adelle's words: "I can promise you that women working together - linked, informed and educated - can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet." We women can do the impossible - however long it takes us. Rabina Khan is a Liberal Democrat councillor for Shadwell in Tower Hamlets \</doc>

A BARRISTER who has said that the courts should stay out of politics has been appointed as the Government's most senior lawyer amid Boris Johnson's growing battle with the judiciary. Suella Braverman, a former leader of backbench Tory Eurosceptics, replaced Geoffrey Cox as Attorney General in a Cabinet reshuffle in which the Prime Minister rewarded loyalists and sacked those who defied him. Other promotions included Oliver Dowden, from Cabinet Office minister to Culture Secretary, and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former defence minister and Johnson ally who takes over as International Development Secretary. United Nations Climate Change conference in November as well as Business Secretary. The appointment of Mrs Braverman, a Cambridge law graduate, will set off alarm bells for judges after she said Parliament must "retrace power ceded to the courts" in an article last month. She wrote: "Repatriated powers from the EU will mean precious little if our courts continue to act as political decision-maker, pronouncing on what the law ought to be and supplanting parliament. Traditionally, parliament made the law and judges applied it. But today, our courts exercise a form of political power." She also said that while the Human Rights Act was "noble", the concept "has been stretched beyond recognition". Overall Mr Johnson cut the number of Cabinet ministers from 31 to 26, by slashing the number of junior ministers who can attend from nine to four - Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Leader of the House of Commons, Chief Whip and Attorney General. Other ministers representing housing, northern powerhouse, business and environment, and the paymaster general, lost their right to attend. The reshuffle fell short of the predicted merger of the Foreign Office and international development departments, although four ministers were appointed to roles in both departments: James Cleverly, the former party chairman; Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park; Baroness Sugg; and Nigel Adams, the former culture minister. Lord Goldsmith was given a third role as minister in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Nine ministers were given new Cabinet roles. Rishi Sunak replaced Sajid Javid, who quit after being asked sack five of his special advisers. George Eustice was promoted to Environment Secretary while Amanda Milling, a former whip, was made party chairman. Steve Barclay, the former Brexit secretary, was made Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and will attend Cabinet. Ministers who clashed with Johnson or defied him were fired move which one Tory source showed Mr Johnson was "a jealous god". Julian Smith was sacked as Northern Ireland secretary amid claims that had left Mr Johnson blindsided over risk of more prosecutions to veterans, and clashes over Brexit. He was replaced by Brandon Lewis, the former Home Office minister. Andrea Leadsom, who once challenged Theresa May for the party leadership, was sacked days after warning the Prime Minister not to fire female ministers. Esther McVey was sacked as housing minister amid concerns about meeting the Government's housing target after a well-publicised spat with Johnson ally Robert Jenrick. Ms McVey was replaced by Chris Pincher, the former Foreign Office minister, making him the 10th housing minister in the past decade. Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, held on to his job despite overnight reports that he could be sacked. Nohad briefed on Wednesday that he being replaced by Andrew Murrison, Foreign Office minister. However, Murrison was then sacked in a 8.30am phone call by Mr Johnson yesterday. At the Department for Transport, Grant Shapps stayed on, but lost two his junior ministers, George Freeman and Nusrat Ghani, who had been tipped to be new HS2 minister. There was a return to the Government for Penny Mordaunt as new Paymaster General and James Brokenshire as Home Office minister, while Jeremy Quin was made defence minister. Helen Whately has been made minister of state in the Department of Health and Social Care and Chloe Smith is promoted to Cabinet Office minister.

Brussels is preparing to unveil ambitious new carbon emissions targets as the European Parliament stepped up pressure on the incoming European Commission by declaring a "climate emergency" in the EU. According to a leaked paper, incoming commission president Ursula von der Leyen will begin her term by asking members to commit by next year to cut 2030 carbon emissions from a target of 40 per cent to "at least 50 per cent and towards 55 per cent". The plan emerged as parliament declared a climate emergency in the EU, ahead of next week's UN Cop25 summit in Madrid. The symbolic move makes the EU the first power, along with countries such as the UK and France, to make the declaration. "The fact that Europe is the first continent to declare a climate and environmental emergency, just before Cop25 ... and three weeks after Donald Trump confirmed the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement, is a strong message to citizens and the rest of the world," said Pascal Canfin, the French En Marche MEP behind the motion. Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP, said: "This must be followed by serious and credible actions." The 2030 target has emerged as a sensitive flashpoint in EU climate policy. Nine members, including France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain, have pushed Brussels to embrace a higher 55 per cent target but business groups said that raising agreed goals would impose fresh burdens. To soften criticism, Brussels will draft a "comprehensive plan" on how to raise the 2030 target by next autumn, insisting it has to be done in a "responsible way", the document said. EU officials said the 50-55 per cent range was chosen to avoid antagonising governments such as those of Germany and Poland which are reluctant to hasten the pace of emission cuts, fearing their businesses will not be ready. Supporters of faster cuts say the EU cannot reach its goal of becoming the world's first climate neutral continent by 2050 without speeding up shortterm measures. They argue that even a 55 per cent target is not enough to limit global warming to less than 2C, as agreed under the Paris climate accord. Franziska Achterberg for Greenpeace, said the October 2020 deadline would mean EU governments would struggle to make the pledge in time for the next UN summit in 2020. Brussels' "green new deal" will also propose the EU's first climate law, enshrining the 2050 net zero target into domestic legislation by March 2020. The package will be unveiled on December 11, a day before a European leaders' summit at which Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will be urged to agree on the bloc's 2050 carbon neutrality target.

Brazil minister taunts climate talks with steak dinner Brazil's environment minister Ricardo Salles has taunted COP25 climate talks with a photo of a large steak after President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed them as a "commercial game". Mr Salles tweeted the photo with the caption: "To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!" Prior to posting the photo, he criticised "rich countries" in attendance of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference for their lack of progress on carbon markets, a system established by the Paris Agreement. Brazil wants to count emissions cuts achieved by offsetting carbon credits to another country to boost their own climate targets. Reuters Amnesty says 304 killed in Iran unrest, thousands arrested At least 304 people have been killed in Iran during anti-government unrest last month, according to Amnesty International. Thousands have been arrested including children as young as 15 in a crackdown, London-based Amnesty said in a statement. Iranian authorities have dismissed Amnesty's previous figures and have yet to give a death toll from the deadliest protests In Iran in decades. Hundreds took to the streets on 15 November to protest against fuel price rises. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down. Iranian authorities earlier this month acknowledged that some "rioters" were killed by security forces. The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denounced the unrest as a "very dangerous conspiracy" by Iran's enemies. AP Police in Argentina arrest four in killing of British tourist Police in Argentina have arrested four men suspected in the killing of a British tourist who was shot during a robbery attempt, authorities said yesterday. Authorities were searching for a fifth suspect in the murder of Briton Matthew Charles Gibbard in Buenos Aires on Saturday, according to Argentine officials. Gibbard, 50, was shot as he and his stepson approached a luxury hotel in the Puerto Madero area of the Argentine capital. The stepson, a 28-year-old Briton, suffered a gunshot wound. The assailants were on a motorcycle and supported by accomplices in a car, and the tourists tried to resist the attack, according to an official account. Japanese man jailed for killing son with kitchen knife A former Japanese government official has been sentenced to six years in prison after killing his son with a kitchen knife. Hideaki Kumazawa stabbed 44-year-old Eiichiro in the neck and chest more than 30 times at their home in Tokyo before calling the police and admitting to the crime. The 76-year-old, a former vice minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, pleaded guilty during a trial at Tokyo District Court. His son suffered from a development disorder and was routinely violent towards his mother, the court heard. Kumazawa's lawyers claimed their client had acted in self-defence and was fearful his son might harm others. \</doc>

Photo credit: Adobe Stock The international community, including the EU, has been told that climate change "did not originate" in the Arctic. Bard Ivar Svendsen, ambassador for the Artic at the Norwegian foreign affairs ministry, said, "The climate changes we are seeing in the Arctic are very dramatic. But we also have to remember that a lot of these changes did not actually originate in the Arctic but are the result of things like pollution in other parts of the world." He also told the conference in Brussels on Monday that renewed efforts were needed to ensure that the currently "thriving" communities in the Arctic could survive. RELATED CONTENT MEPs to press Commission to declare "state of climate emergency" in Europe COP25 COP25 'critical' in ensuring 2015 Paris Agreement put in place, says senior MEP 2020 can be the start of a new Greens decade, says Monica Frassoni Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight The conference comes just ahead of the keenly-awaited COP25 climate conference in Madrid. The "Arctic Futures Symposium 2019" was co-organised by the Brussels-based International Polar Foundation and Brussels Capital Region. The aim was to highlight a range of Arctic affairs as well as climate change. Einar Gunnarsson, ambassador for Arctic affairs at the Icelandic foreign affairs ministry, gave a stark warning about the impact of climate change, saying that even if EU Member States and other countries meet the targets set out by the Paris Agreement, the world can still expect "strong and significant climate change" until the middle of this century. The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. "A lot of these changes did not actually originate in the arctic but are the result of things like pollution in other parts of the world" Bard Ivar Svendsen, ambassador for the artic at the Norwegian foreign affairs ministry Gunnarsson said, "If we fail to meet these common goals then we have very good reason to be seriously concerned. And this, remember, is the best-case scenario." "Warming climate is having unprecedented influence worldwide and it is having an acute effect in our region. Our glaciers are retreating, our icecaps are thinning, our oceans are acidifying and rising. The consequences are both foreseeable and unforeseeable. They are tangible and intangible, visible and hidden." "We see new plants, animal species and natural phenomenon emerge and immigrate, while others change, retreat or disappear. The same holds true for human activity." "People are looking towards the Arctic and not only that, people are also increasingly moving, travelling and exploring possibilities for investments in the Arctic. The region's identity is taking on a new shape. What used to be a relatively untouched region is fast developing into a melting pot for human activity." He added, "It is our common human responsibility to make sure that this melting pot does not boil over and make a mess everywhere." He said the "primary responsibility" was to make sure that all activities in the Arctic, both established and new, will be sustainable. He told the packed audience, "We need to keep our eyes on the temperature. It shouldn't rise over 1,5\'b0C and certainly not over 2\'b0C. Here we all have a shared responsibility. And for that we have numerous tools at our disposal." "Our glaciers are retreating, our icecaps are thinning, our oceans are acidifying and rising. The consequences are both foreseeable and unforeseeable" Einar Gunnarsson, ambassador for Arctic affairs at the Icelandic foreign affairs ministry He underlined the role of the Arctic Council which is also comprised of three EU Member States - Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The Council, he said, is becoming increasingly inclusive in its core work, in gathering, organising and analysing science-based knowledge that policy makers and politicians, in and beyond the Arctic, can use to make "enlightened" decisions. "The Arctic Council is unique in that it gives the representatives of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic a seat at the table along with its eight member states. It also has 39 observers and the EU following, and to a considerable extent participating, in its work." He said that the role of the private sector was also important, including the Arctic Economic Council, founded at the initiative of the Arctic Council. "It is an independent body comprised of representatives from the circumpolar business community and the indigenous peoples of the arctic." He added, "In the face of today's challenges we have to choose the right path forward. We need to strengthen environmental protection, economic development and social development in the Arctic." \</doc>

THE New Year has kicked off with a real sense of ambition and momentum here in Glasgow. In recent days I was delighted to bring delegates at a major conference up to speed with the performance of our city economy and what must be done to ensure we continue to forge ahead. No-one can be under any illusion, however. With Boris's Tories firmly in power at Westminster and Brexit on our immediate horizon, our task won't be easy. Major hurdles, not of our making, have been placed in Glasgow's way. But with 2020 barely a week old I was able to discuss one of the most exciting projects being progressed in Glasgow for quite some time - our plans for a new metro system. Glasgow Times readers may be aware that two years ago I commissioned a group of experts to come up with a series of proposals to make our city's public transport offering fit for the needs of the 21st century. We are decades behind European cities of similar size when it comes to moving our citizens around, connecting them with employment, education and leisure opportunities. And to reach our sustainability targets necessary to halt the impact of climate change we really need to persuade motorists to switch from their cars. The expert Connectivity Commission published its recommendations in April, the most eye-catching of which was for a city metro. Their plan was an entirely new transport model which would initially connect the city centre with major destinations, including Glasgow Airport, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Renfrew and Braehead. In the relatively short time since, the Scottish Government has pledged to consider the potential for a metro, while our partners at Renfrewshire Council agree it should be a priority project for the City Region. It was particularly pleasing to hear the First Minister support the plans in Parliament just last week. The next step for us is to make sure the feasibility work - including all technical and business cases - is completed so it can be considered as one of the major projects which Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government will deliver over the next decade or so. The case for a Glasgow Metro really is compelling. It will deliver benefits for communities and businesses all across the City Region, has the potential to support that shift away from the car and allow us to deliver on carbon neutrality. It will help to take Glasgow to the next level as a major European city. And if Scotland is to thrive then its only true metropolitan region must also. We have the backing of council leaderships, the Chamber of Commerce and Glasgow Airport, and trust now that all political parties can get behind this project for the long-term good of our city and its people. It's particularly apt that it's 2020 that this has accelerated because this year presents Glasgow with a major opportunity on the world stage. Just 10 months from now, we host the United Nations Climate Change Conference , better known as COP26, when 170 world leaders gather in Glasgow to push forward global efforts to reduce emissions. Make no mistake, this is massive. It will be the biggest event Scotland has ever hosted and will be impossible to ignore. It will also be a challenge, but city life will continue throughout. Based on our past record, I have no doubt the positive legacy will far outweigh the challenge. It will generate tens of millions of pounds for our economy and promote Glasgow to new, global audiences. And as host city for the most significant climate change event since the Paris Agreement in 2015, we're ideally placed to position Glasgow as the city which has cracked sustainability, job creation and economic growth. It was also encouraging to report that our city economy remains, by and large, in good health. There were some surprising findings. Most people don't know that Glasgow makes more satellites than anywhere else outside of Silicon Valley. And that we're home to more than a third of Scotland's jobs. Glasgow is in a great position to match the ambition and achievements of those European cities leading on quality of life and economic performance. I believe this is the year we will make strides on delivering economic prosperity all our citizens share in and one which properly addresses our climate emergency. \</doc>

Photocredit: Adobe Stock I have been inspired by the passion, conviction and energy of the millions of our young people making their voice heard on our streets and in our hearts. It is our generational duty to deliver for them." These were the words of Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen in her political guidelines, and she is completely correct. Not just young people, but also the vast majority of Europeans want to see action on climate. And they are right to seek this; the world has to act to avoid a major catastrophe. If we are unable to stabilise the temperature at 2 degrees above the industrial level, or even 1.5 degrees, we risk passing dangerous tipping points. RELATED CONTENT Nicol\'e1s Gonz\'e1lez Casares: Setting new ambitions COP25 2020 can be the start of a new Greens decade, says Monica Frassoni Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight For example, if the permafrost in Siberia melts, huge amounts of methane will be released into the atmosphere, bringing with it a much higher climate change potential than CO2. If the world does not take the right decisions in the next twenty years, in the coming centuries our grandchildren, and all future generations, may no longer be able to control climate change. The sea level may rise by five metres or more and other devastating consequences will follow. At the COP24 climate conference, the global community came together to discuss how to best implement the targets that were agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. Although the overall result was not perfect, important steps have been taken towards international climate protection. "In the coming centuries our grandchildren, and all future generations, may no longer be able to control climate change" Where we did indeed succeed was on agreeing upon a comprehensive rulebook. This allows for comparisons at international level, to see how each party is getting along with implementation of their individual nationally-determined contributions (NDCs). This rulebook is applicable to all countries, not just the EU and its Member States, but also to third countries. It is important that large emitters such as China also act and take responsibility in the international fight against climate change. A huge majority of the European Parliament shares the objective of fighting climate change. This is also reflected in the recent results of the ENVI committee vote on the COP25 taking place in Madrid: 62 committee members voted in favour and 11 members voted against the draft COP25 resolution. First, pursuing jobs and growth is not a contradiction to climate mitigation. We want to approach climate policy in a way that does not cause us to lose our industrial base and create unemployment, but rather to support industry to be climate-neutral. The 2050 strategy of the European Commission shows that if we get the policy framework right, climate neutrality can be achieved with a net gain of jobs and economic growth. But for that, we need to work with industry, not against it Second, we need to focus much more on activities in the rest of the world. Even if the EU were to stop emitting immediately, passing the tipping points for dangerous climate change will not be avoided unless other emitters follow. This is why it is important to focus much more on the rest of the world and work with, for example, major economies such as China, India, Canada and South Africa that are debating increasing their NDCs. "It is important that large emitters such as China also act and take responsibility in the international fight against climate change" We think that increasing the European NDC to 55 percent is the right thing to do, if we create global alliances and if a proper impact assessment prepares a concrete way forward. Third, sustainably-managed forests are the best climate protectors. In contrast to what some political groups and activists may say, it is important that humanity intervenes in the forests. Natural forests are not the best way to protect the climate; managed forests absorb more CO2 and the resulting wood can replace materials that currently produce a great deal of CO2. European forests are in a critical state in many Member States; that is why support for forest owners is crucial if we are serious about climate mitigation. Last, an Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) instead of taxes and prohibition policy. Greens and Social Democrats in the European Parliament very much support policies based on prohibiting technologies and intervening in behaviour by command and control. We are convinced that this is not the right approach. We think that the ETS, as a market-based mechanism, will deliver emission reductions at the lowest possible cost. If we want to convince other partners in the world, we need to be efficient and not base our policy on prohibition. While the ETS has suffered from past weaknesses, it now delivers concrete emissions reductions - a separate ETS for transport and building could be a good way forward. \</doc>

Urgent UN talks on tackling the climate emergency are still not addressing the true scale of the crisis, one of the world's leading climate scientists has warned, as high-ranking ministers from governments around the world began to arrive in Madrid for HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world the final days of negotiations Talks are focusing on some of the rules for HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world implementing the 2015 Paris agreement , but the overriding issue of how fast the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions has received little official attention. "We are at risk of getting so bogged down in incremental technicalities at these negotiations that we forget to see the forest for the trees," said HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Johan Rockstr\'f6m , joint director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. "There is a risk of disappointment in the UN process because of the inability to recognise that there is an emergency." In the next few days, environment and finance ministers from more than 190 governments will begin the "high-level segment" of the HYPERLINK UN talks , which began on 2 December, and will finish on Friday.

The situation was so dire that governments should be starting to consider geoengineering technology, he said. Such projects could use a combination of natural and artificial means, from seeding clouds to erecting reflectors in space. "Geoengineering has to be assessed, maybe even piloted already in case we need to deploy it," he said. "It makes me very nervous.

Britain will play host to next year's conference at which world leaders must pledge much greater cuts in emissions than have yet been made, if the 2015 Paris accord is to succeed. Claire O'Neill, the former Tory climate minister designated to lead next year's conference, is in Madrid but cannot make official announcements because of the "purdah" rules surrounding political announcements in the run-up to the general election. However, the UK's plans were rated as "insufficient" in a key independent analysis called the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Climate Action Tracker "There has been a dearth of new significant climate policies in recent years which, if left unaddressed, will leave the UK missing its medium and long-term targets," concluded the analysis of global emissions-cutting plans. That would damage the host nation's credibility at next year's crucial talks in Glasgow, campaigners said. Dr Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, which carried out the study, said it was clear which of the two biggest parties had the better plans on the issue before this week's general election. "While both major political parties have proposed further climate action, the Conservatives have not put sufficient proposals on the table to close this gap, whereas [our analysis shows] the Labour's \£3250bn could easily close that gap and push on towards a 1.5C pathway," Hare said. \</doc>

Ireland is among the worst-performing European countries for climate action, according to the UN. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, launched on Tuesday at the UN Climate Conference COP25 in Madrid, shows that although Ireland has slightly improved its position since last year, it still ranks among some of the worst-performing countries in Europe. In greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland ranks third from bottom for EU countries. The report reads: "Ireland's GHG greenhouse gas per capita emissions remain at a relatively high level, and significant challenges lie ahead in closing Ireland's emissions gap, meeting the current 2030 target and aligning Ireland's emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for 2050. "Therefore, the country still ranks among the bottom ten performers in this indicator." The report also criticises "the significant lack of progress in decarbonising key parts of the economy, mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector". It said: "The Government must go much further in implementing policies across all sectors that drive sustained emissions reductions over the next decade." On a positive note for the Government, the index report welcomed Ireland's new proposals set out in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, including putting the 2050 target into law and introducing legally binding five-year carbon budgets. Campaigners have long criticised Environment Minister Richard Bruton's policies on the climate emergency, which they say do not go far enough to tackle the issues. Catherine Devitt, head of policy at the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, said: "Ireland's polluting emissions remain on an upward trend, the Government has yet to join other member states in calling for the EU to urgently raise its ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, and the scale of 2% emissions cuts per year presented in the Government's action plan is wholly inadequate. "The science and the mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that we need far-reaching transformation across all aspects of society. "If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be delivered." The publication of the CCPI report comes as Mr Bruton is expected to participate in the high level segment on December 10 and 11 at COP25 , where heads of state and government will make national statements on increasing their targets. \</doc>

COP 25 marked the culmination of a year where public awareness and activism over climate change reached an inflection point. The UN's troubling forecast last month that global emissions show no sign of slowing at the rate needed to prevent profound ecological and economic changes has further reinforced the sense of urgency expressed by the Extinction Rebellion movement. It is easy to think business leaders do not also recognise the need for urgent action. Yet, in the past few months alone, more than 100 international businesses, from L'Or\'e9al to Ikea, have set targets to help limit global warming to pre-industrial levels of 1.5C by 2050. This is vital. Businesses of all sizes together make up a significant proportion of global energy consumption, and so will play a crucial role in the mission to reach the net zero target. Policy changes at a national level will also be key, but businesses need to do their part to drive this change within their own organisations and industries as well. However, making this commitment, while positive, is just the first step. Emissions targets are only meaningful if business leaders put plans in place and take the necessary measures to get there. This goes beyond simply trying to reduce consumption. It requires a fundamental shift in the way businesses approach energy supply and management. That is, the approach needs to change from one where energy is viewed as a necessary but peripheral cost, to one where it is embedded in a business's overall strategy and long-term growth trajectory. Despite the mounting public response to climate change in the business community, it seems other factors may still be taking priority when it comes to actual energy policy decision-making within organisations. Clearly, short-term financial pressures are detracting from companies' ability to meet their ambitious future sustainability targets. While this is understandable, a shift in mindset is required so that commercials and sustainability are no longer seen to be in conflict. Energy managers and executives will benefit when it is realised that achieving energy efficiencies across an organisation can help to reduce both costs and emissions. The greatest way businesses can start to take a longer-term approach to energy and sustainability is by investing in renewables and flexibility services. By investing in wind, solar or other forms of renewable on-site generation, businesses can curb their reliance on fossil fuels and, at the same time, gain greater autonomy over their energy use and supply. Combining renewables with battery storage also allows companies to start effectively engaging in demand-side response (DSR). By limiting energy use in peak hours, and potentially selling surplus energy back to the grid, companies can play an active role in helping support the more decentralised energy grid of the future. As we accelerate towards a more renewable energy industry, the degree to which businesses can be flexible with their energy consumption will be vital to accommodate the fluctuating supply that comes with wind, solar and other forms of renewable generation. Electrification of transport A business's energy usage is often considered to simply entail the energy consumed by its various offices, factories and other buildings. However, many businesses operate large transport fleets that remain one of the biggest challenges to meeting sustainability goals. While the government has set a phase-out of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, this doesn't mean businesses should not explore transitioning their fleets to electric vehicles (EV) today. This is particularly the case as EVs have become far more commercially viable in recent years - the cost of EV batteries dropping by more than 80 per cent in the last eight years. It can seem like EVs are another issue thrown into the mix, adding to the conundrum facing businesses: which sustainability challenge do I tackle first? Transport, energy consumption and reliance on the grid or heat. However, transportation and the efficiencies that can be achieved through EVs is not an area that should be overlooked. The rallying of the business community to tackle climate change will be one of the most decisive developments and factors in achieving net zero. However, a 2050 plan to reduce carbon emissions requires businesses to think and plan in equal lengths of time. This will be key to success if business leaders' sustainability ambitions are to marry up with reality. Ben Spry, head of flexibility services, Npower Business Solutions, Energy HQ \</doc>

The Grand Tour is set to return with a brand new special titled The Grand Tour: Presents Seamen. The group's latest venture will see Jeremy Clarkson take off in a boat across Vietnam and Cambodia alongside Richard Hammond and James May. However, the three found it difficult to navigate the Mekong river, finding parts of it had dried up all together. Related articles The difficulties in filming in the dried up remains of Tonl\'e9 Sap lead Clarkson to make somewhat of an epiphany when it comes to the existence of global warming. However, he still slams the idea that global warming is a manmade issue, making a number of jibes at young climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Speaking to Express.co.uk along with other media outlets, he discussed his discoveries about climate while filming in Cambodia. The host revealed that while aiming to film in the rainy season of Cambodia, their trip was "hot and sunny" grinding the boats to a halt as they became beached at some points. READ MORE: The Grand Tour season 4:Jeremy Clarkson crashes his boat in new series READ MORE However, the Grand Tour host won't be becoming an activist anytime soon as he went on to make a huge swipe at Greta Thunberg. He said: "We have simply said here's an example of it. What do you want me to do now get in a carbon fibre yacht and go and shout at Donald Trump?" Speaking of Greta, he said: "There's that weird swede running around making all kinds of we're all going to die noises so we're all aware of it... I just think she is a weird swede with a bad temper." He went on to brand the young activist a "liar" for claiming to have began a low carbon footprint journey to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid. He then said: "Did you see she went to Chilli for the climate conference which was then moved to Madrid? I literally st myself laughing. She's an idiot because scientists will solve it, and nobody's going to solve it by going on strike and not going to school cause the you're not in your science lessons so she's a fool. "I know that lots of people think she's great and I think she's foolish." When asked if he feels guilty about the carbon footprint of The Grand Tour, the host went on to make the claim that he's completely carbon neutral. He said: "I'm completely carbon neutral I have a thousand acre farm plant hundreds of trees every year and grow crops so I have no carbon footprint at all quite the opposite. It's nothing."

The 16-year-old environmental activist desperately asked for "help" after arriving on the wrong side of the Atlantic for a UN meeting. The Swedish environmental campaigner had been travelling to the talks known as COP25 in Santiago, Chile before it was suddenly moved more than 6,000 miles to Madrid, Spain. The Chilean Government announced at short notice it would not host the event scheduled to take place between December 2-13, following widespread protests and unrest in the South American country. Related articles Ms Thunberg wrote on Twitter: "As # COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help. "It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way. "Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful." Ms Thunberg has since been widely mocked on social media. One user wrote on Twitter: "I bet the people of Chile are well chuffed." A second user said: "Almost like you should stay and school get an education, then a job that affords you the ability to travel. " Whilst a third simply said: "There is an invention called an airplane." The environmental campaigner later confirmed she would not be attending the event in the Spanish capital. "But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. "We're in a climate and ecological emergency. "I send my support to the people in Chile." Ms Thunberg accused world leaders of "betrayal" and said "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction".

The Latest : Large-scale protests have swept Chile in recent days. On October 6, the Chilean government announced a 3.7% increase in the cost of public transportation. The fare increase, which came shortly after a 10.0% increase in the cost of electricity, was initially met with minor, student-led protests. However, by October 18 the student protests had forced the closure of Santiago's subway system, sparking a weekend of widespread protests, rioting and looting. Media reports as of October 21 estimate that the rioting has left 11 dead, resulted in 1400 arrests and caused at least USD300mn in damage. In response to the unrest, President Sebastian Pinera declared a two-week state of emergency, deployed 10,500 soldiers and police officers and announced a curfew in major cities across the country on October 19 and 20. Implications : The state of emergency is the first in Chile due to civil unrest since the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). While Pinera has walked back the increased transit costs that initially sparked protests, the speed with which the protests spread and the rapid escalation of violence point to deeper societal discontent. Local media highlight causes including stubbornly high inequality, the rising cost of living and a growing sense among Chileans that the political elite are disconnected from average citizens. Inequality Persists Despite Rising Income {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - GINI And Real GDP Per Capita, USD {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Note: Higher GINI indicates higher level of inequality. Source: World Bank, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell In our view, the protests are likely to grind Pinera's legislative agenda to a halt in the near term, with an investor-friendly tax reform the mostly likely initiative to be abandoned. Pinera's approval stood at only 29.0% on October 17 according to polling firm Cadem Chile, and in recent days two key senators in Pinera's centre-right Chile Vamos (CV) coalition publicly criticized the tax reform and Pinera's approach to passing the legislation. In addition, the unrest poses a significant downside risk to our forecast of 2.8% y-o-y real GDP growth in 2019. Extended protests would likely undercut business confidence and private investment in the country, the lone bright spot in Chile's economy during the H119 slowdown. What's Next : At Fitch Solutions, we expect the upheaval to continue in the short term. The curfew in Chile's major cities was extended to the night of October 21, and there have been calls for work stoppages at Chile's largest copper mines over the coming days as workers display solidarity with the anti-government protests. We also see a significant risk that protests re-emerge over the medium term, given the international attention that will be on Chile when Santiago hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings on November 16 and 17 and the United Nations Climate Change Conference from December 2 to December 13.Finally, over the coming week we expect a clearer picture of the political fallout to emerge. Before the protests, Pinera faced growing dissent within the CV, and public anger at his response to the unrest may push him to carry out a second cabinet re-shuffle in less than a year. At the same time, the opposition leaders remain increasingly divided on the best response to the unrest. Members of centrist parties in Congress, such as the Partido Democrata Cristiano, have supported the government rhetorically, while the leftist Partido Socialista de Chile and the Partido Comunista de Chile demanded that Pinera end the state of emergency and agree to major changes in the political agenda before they would commit to a dialogue with the CV. In coming weeks we will look to whether the opposition parties can agree to a common approach and build support ahead of key regional elections in October 2020.

The use of composite materials in renewable energy market will play a vital role in the manufacturing of structures that will enable the harnessing of sustainable energy sources. The modern composite materials used these days have an advantage that they are light as well as strong. Composites also provide the design flexibility where these materials can be moulded into complex shapes. The increase in the climatic changes happening around the world is forcing the global market to switch to the use of renewable energy. The United Nations Climate Change Conference at Paris was a major achievement bringing about a global agreement between 55 countries to reduce the effect of climate change by limiting global warming to less than 2-degree Celsius to accomplish the main goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions between 2030 and 2050. This has resulted in the escalation and expansion of the companies to use composite materials in renewable energy market. Hence, the use of composites in renewable energy will prove to be a positive step towards protecting the environment and promoting the use of renewable energy to reduce global warming. The global composite materials in renewable energy market report analyses the attention of the key companies towards providing creative and innovative ideas and ways to use composite materials in the generation of renewable energy.

A MAJOR summit on climate change due to take place in Scotland later this year has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. The announcement was made in a joint statement by the UK and UN after a 'virtual' meeting of officials. Glasgow had been set to host the COP26 summit at the Scottish Events Campus in November, with hundreds of world leaders set to attend. It is expected the conference will now take place by the middle of next year. Around 30,000 delegates, journalists and environmental campaigners had been due to attend the conference. A statement on the UK Government website for the event stated: 'In light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of Covid-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible. Rescheduling will ensure all parties can focus on the issues to be discussed at this vital conference and allow more time for the necessary preparations to take place. 'We will continue to work with all involved to increase climate ambition, build resilience and lower emissions.' COP26 President-Designate and Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Alok Sharma, said: 'The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26. 'We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.' Commenting on the announcement, Scotland Secretary Alister Jack said: 'Postponing COP26 is the right decision in these unique and difficult circumstances.' UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said: 'Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. 'Soon, economies will restart. This is a chance for nations to recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient.' Environmental groups said they agreed with the decision to postpone. Friends of the Earth Scotland Director Dr Richard Dixon said the delay was 'understandable'. However, he added that 'rich countries' must not use the postponement of the talks 'to delay taking urgent action on reducing emissions'. It had been claimed the summit would bring a \£373million boost to Glasgow's economy, but concerns were also raised over a massive policing bill. Police chiefs warned earlier this year that it could cost the force around \£3200million. The COP25 meeting in Madrid last year - where governments struck a deal on limiting carbon emissions - saw keynote speeches from experts and activists, including 17-year-old Greta Thunberg.

HYBRIT's owners SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall welcome the higher ambitions to reach climate targets discussed at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. The companies cite the need for powerful measures to secure industrial transition. The HYBRIT initiative for fossil-free steel production shows that zero net emissions is possible. At Monday's meeting of the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall jointly highlighted a number of conditions needed, both within the EU and globally, to rapidly decarbonize industry worldwide. The three companies were invited to the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September to participate in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, with the aim of converting even the hard to abate industries such as steel and cement. The Leadership Group is one of the UN climate tracks initiated by the governments of Sweden and India. 'We welcome further concrete steps to reach the global climate targets. The EU has an opportunity to lead the industrial transition. A European Green Deal must include an ambitious Industrial strategy that focuses on innovation, supports the upscaling of new technologies, and facilitates access to private and public funding. It should also emphasize creating markets for low carbon products, for example through an effective ETS system, and facilitate the necessary infrastructure for fossil-free electricity and hydrogen,' says Martin Pei, CTO of SSAB and Chairman of HYBRIT. 'Our goal is to create a completely fossil-free value chain, from the mine to the finished steel product. A fossil-free steel industry has the potential to reduce the world's total carbon dioxide emissions by 7 percent, and the transition is a necessity if we are to meet our shared climate goals,' says Jan Mostrom, President and CEO of LKAB. 'Continued sufficient access to fossil-free electricity with high delivery reliability and competitive pricing, as well as initiatives for better flexibility, are needed to enable the industrial transition globally. The HYBRIT project's objective of storing hydrogen also contributes to increased flexibility by using storage to balance and stabilize the energy system,' says Cecilia Hellner, Head of Public and Regulatory Affairs Sweden at Vattenfall. The three companies are represented at COP25 by Martin Pei (SSAB), Jan Mostrom (LKAB) and Cecilia Hellner (Vattenfall), among others. Hybrit Development AB is a joint venture of SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall with the aim of advancing HYBRIT technology from laboratory scale to full production scale to enable the world's first fossil-free ore-based steelmaking. By using fossil-free electricity and hydrogen instead of coke and carbon for iron ore reduction, the byproduct will be normal water instead of carbon dioxide. At Lulea in northern Sweden, HYBRIT is now building the world's first pilot plant based on direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen, which will be ready in 2020. SSAB's goal is a market launch of the first fossil-free steel products in 2026.

The world has 18 months to keep HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/cleanair/poverty-health-housing-stock-london-climate-action-week-a4180731.html climate change at 'survivable levels', The Prince of Wales has warned, as he vowed to support the Commonwealth in its efforts to find a solution. Speaking at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference reception at Clarence House yesterday, Prince Charles https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/cleanair/poverty-health-housing-stock-london-climate-action-week-a4180731.html said the survival of humanity was dependent on forthcoming UN talks, which are set to take place across the world over the next year and a half. "I am firmly of the view that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change to survivable levels and to restore nature to the equilibrium we need for our survival," he said. "The next 18 months will see critical meetings that will collectively determine the global agenda for the coming decade." The Commonwealth is "uniquely positioned" to lead by example, he added, stating: "I stand ready to support you in these efforts and to seeing the Commonwealth at the forefront of a global solution". Read more Population Matters: How smaller families will reduce carbon emissions The meetings to which the Prince refers include the UNSG's Climate Action Summit this September, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity set for Beijing, China next October, as well as the 2020 Commonwealth Heads of Government gathering in Kigali, Rwanda. These meetings lead up to the Conference of the Parties next November - the annual UN conference on climate change , held between the 197 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - which, the Prince hopes, will be hosted by London. The world is currently battling global warming to keep the earth's temperature from rising more than 1.5C, with reducing HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/cleanair/poverty-health-housing-stock-london-climate-action-week-a4180731.html carbon emissions a key focus.

By NFUS climate change policy manager, Ruth Taylor ' COP25 The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meet every year to assess progress in tackling climate change - and we are acutely aware that next year it is the turn of Glasgow to host. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions while providing food for an ever-growing world population, set to reach 10 billion by 2050, poses an enormous global challenge. However, after listening to discussions, expert panels, and to the negotiations on agricultural emissions at UN level, it is apparent that farmers from across the globe, and not just Scotland, are committed to finding a solution. At COP25 Agriculture as a global industry is hugely diverse, and there will clearly be no silver bullet to solve this challenge. There is a recognition that this diversity must be factored into in the delivery of future policy, and that successful mitigation and adaptation policies will have to be provided as a package of measures. We need to make sure that targets set at both national and international level are translated into policies that reflect local priorities and needs, as well as providing incentives and support for innovation. NFU Scotland has always been clear that measures introduced to mitigate climate change are supported by robust scientific evidence. It was encouraging to see that message emphasised by members of the international farming community, with the President of the World Farmers' Organisation emphasising: 'If the process is not science-led then it is not sustainable'. With next year's conference taking take place in Glasgow, climate change will undoubtedly remain at the forefront of the public and political agenda. By then, decisions on carbon markets will have to be made and all countries will be expected to have made new climate change commitments. Climate change will continue to be a critically important issue for Scottish farming, and COP26 will be a key opportunity for Scottish farming to showcase all the vital work farmers across the country are doing to reduce their emissions and sequester carbon. It is clear that there will be no successful climate change process without the involvement and contribution of the agriculture sector.'

Boris Johnson has insisted there is "no reason" to hand Nicola Sturgeon the powers for a second independence referendum as a poll predicted the SNP will unseat all 13 Scottish Tory MPs in the forthcoming general election. The Prime Minister said the Nationalists repeatedly told voters in the 2014 referendum that it was a once-in-a-generation event "and I don't see why I should go back on it." His intervention came after Ms Sturgeon disclosed this week she intends to table a formal request for the powers before Christmas, and pledged to put the issue at the heart of the SNP's election campaign. A You Gov poll published last night by the People's Vote campaign for a second EU referendum suggested all 13 Scottish Tory MPs are on course to lose their seats to the SNP in the contest. The survey said the Scottish Tories' average vote share in their seats has fallen from 44 per cent to 30 per cent, while the SNP's has rise from 34 per cent to 42 per cent. Lord Cooper of Windrush, a former Downing Street strategy director and pollster to Ruth Davidson, said the poll sent a "very serious message" to the party and "a decade of patient hard work" could be undone. But the Prime Minister insisted the Conservatives would "do very well indeed" and would "fight, fight, fight to get our message across" of defending a HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/05/will-stand-scottish-farmers-stop-nicola-sturgeon-creating-international/ "proud, strong Scotland within the most successful Union there has ever been." In contrast, he said Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP were "plotting" to put the Labour leader in 10 Downing Street in return for him agreeing to the break-up of the UK. HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/05/will-stand-scottish-farmers-stop-nicola-sturgeon-creating-international/ Ms Davidson will stage a political comeback , praising her as a "wonderful leader" despite their difficult relationship. The Prime Minister visited Peterhead fish market in Aberdeenshire on Friday morning to highlight the opportunities for the industry following Britain's departure from the EU and the hated Common Fisheries Policy. HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/05/will-stand-scottish-farmers-stop-nicola-sturgeon-creating-international/ He then headed to a beef farm near Banchory to unveil \£3211.4 million for Scottish farmers, including \£3160 million to resolve a long-running dispute over EU support. Later, he attended a party event with around 100 members in Tory MP Andrew Bowie's West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine seat. He and his partner, Carrie Symonds, were due to spend the night at Balmoral.\~ The Prime Minister, who will fly back to London on Saturday night, said: "I think it's odd that both Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP claim to be attached to democracy when their mission is to smash up the oldest and most successful political partnership in history in the form of the Union in spite of the very clear promise that was made to the people of Scotland in 2014 that that referendum would be a once in a generation event.\~ "That was an assurance people took in good faith when they cast their votes and I see no reason to go back on it." Based on a uniform swing in the YouGov poll of Scottish Tory-held seats, the People's Vote campaign predicted that Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, would lose by 11 points to the SNP in his Dumfries and Galloway constituency. It claimed the only three MPs who are narrowly behind the SNP in their seats are John Lamont in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (one point behind), David Mundell in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (three points) and Mr Bowie (six points).

"And I think people need to understand that is the vision of the Scottish Conservatives and I'm afraid Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP would break that up," he said.\~ Ms Davidson blamed the demands of motherhood for her decision to resign as Scottish Tory leader last week. However, political factors, including her opposition to a no-deal Brexit and her difficult relationship with Mr Johnson, also contributed. The Prime Minister said: "She clearly has a young family and she wants to devote herself to that at the moment. But she and I have had good conversations about this and plainly Ruth has a big future and I would want to see her come back." \</doc>

Nancy Pelosi traveled to Madrid for a United Nations summit on climate change and was greeted at a reception by the country's king and queen Pelosi is leading a delegation of Democrats to Cop25 , a United Nations summit on climate change She said she went to reassure allies that the U.S. was committed to the Paris accord, despite Donald Trump moving to leave it 'We're here to talk positively about our agenda to save the planet for future generations,' she said House Speaker Nancy was greeted by Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia in Madrid Monday at a reception at the city's Royal Palace as she attended a climate change summit. The Speaker was the highest-profile guest at the palace as the Spanish royal family marked the start of the Cop25 summit on climate change - which is not being attended by a senior figure from Donald Trump's administration. Other guests included Spain's acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, Argentinian president Mauricio Macri, and Prince Albert of Monaco. Pelosi took her duel with Trump to the climate summit, pledging that Congress would urgently tackle global warming despite the president's opposition to an international pact. 'By coming here we want to say to everyone we are still in, the United States is still in,' Pelosi told reporters on the first day of the two-week United Nations climate talks in Spain. Trump says complying with the accord would hurt the U.S. economy, restricting domestic producers while other big polluters such as China increase emissions. But Pelosi, who is also leading the Democrats' push to impeach the Republican president, sought to reassure allies. 'Our delegation is here to send a message that Congress's commitment to take action on the climate crisis is iron clad,' she said, flanked by Democratic Congressional representatives. 'We aren't here to talk about impeachment of the president of the United States,' Pelosi said in response to a question. 'We're here to talk positively about our agenda to save the planet for future generations.' The United States rallied support for the Paris Agreement under the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. Democrats want to reassure the rest of the world they will once again throw their country's weight behind the deal if they regain power at elections in November 2020. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Florida Congresswoman Kathy Castor, chair of the House select committee on climate, said the committee will put forward recommendations in March for a comprehensive climate change bill to bring U.S. emissions to net zero by 2050. But achieving consensus around future U.S. legislation will be a challenge, with campaigners pushing lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates to pursue a sweeping Green New Deal that twins climate action with social justice. \</doc>

Union No1 for Codelco's Chuquicamata has joined Sindicato No1 for BHP's Escondida in backing protestors, whose opposition to inequality in the country has escalated into alleged looting and arson, and to violent confrontations with the military. Codelco's Union No2 said that it could participate in a national strike, while Union No3 also criticized the recent increase in public transportation fares and other action taken by the federal government, but did not say that it might strike. While sound macroeconomic management has placed Chile on a solid economic footing, the challenge remains of how to raise productivity, improve global competitiveness and reduce inequality. According to a recent report for the Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD), Chile's income inequality gap is more than 65% wider than the OECD average, with one of the highest ratios between the average income of the wealthiest 10% of its population and that of the poorest 10%. But a further factor might lie behind the call to potential strike action made by some unions representing one of the country's relatively highly paid industries. And it is related to the environment. COP25 host Chile is set to host the 25th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP25 , in December. In June, Chile announced its plan to completely phase out the burning of coal by 2040 and to aim for carbon-neutrality by 2050. It already has renewable energy targets of at least 60% by 2035 and 70% by 2050 for electricity generation. These ambitious targets inevitably have an effect on the country's mining sector, where companies have been working to adapt their practices to ensure that they are fully compliant. That does not seem to be enough in some instances, however. Chilean mining industry sources say that the government is expected to announce the closure of Codelco's Ventanas copper smelter during the COP25 conference. A year ago, shutting the plant would have been understandable. Ventanas came under intense scrutiny last year after a gas leak in the industrial zone where it operates led to more than 100 local residents seeking medical treatment for nausea and vomiting. But Codelco has since invested millions in the plant, making changes to ensure that it complies with new regulations designed to reduce emissions. Those laws from the country's environmental watchdog, Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente (SMA), took effect at the end of last year, and required existing smelters to capture 95% of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and arsenic emissions, up from the previous level of 90%. Yet Ventanas is still a target for closure. Just this week, Codelco itself said that it is considering a closure of the plant, citing economic and environmental factors, even though the smelter is fully in line with watchdog rules. Chile smelters If Ventanas is still at risk, what then is the future for other smelters in the country, some of which still do not meet the new standards? These include Chuquicamata, which produced 320,000 tonnes last year and is still working to meet targets. Also included is Potrerillos, part of Codelco's Salvador division and which has the capacity to process 600,000 tonnes per year of concentrates, although it has not done so for quite some time. Along with the Caletones smelter at Codelco's El Teniente division, which is now compliant with the regulations, the Chilean miner handles nearly 4 million tpy of concentrates. In the event of closures, where would these unrequired concentrates "" some sourced from the country's small and medium-sized mines - find a home, and what about the shortfall of acid produced? For Ventanas alone, this would add 430,000 tpy of concentrates to the local market and reduce acid production by around 360,000 tpy. Fastmarkets' copper concentrates treatment charge (TC) index, cif Asia Pacific, was $56.30 per tonne/5.63 cents per lb on October 18, down slightly from $56.70 per tonne/5.67 cents per lb a week earlier. The index recently recovered from an all-time low of $49.20 per tonne/4.29 cents per lb on August 30. To be clear, Codelco has never said that it plans to shut its smelting capacity at any one of Chuquicamata, Caletones or Potrerillos, and the government has never called it in to question. But with the fate of one of Codelco's four smelters already less than bright, despite making all the necessary changes to meet environmental requirements, the remaining three must wonder what the future might hold for them. It is perhaps no wonder that tensions are running high and resentment toward the government has heightened. Codelco's announcement of the possible closure of Ventanas might have been the last straw for its trade unions. \~ \</doc>

Photocredit: Adobe Stock I will attend the annual climate summit as chair of the European Parliament's delegation, which is an honour for me. Especially since it is likely that the European Parliament will travel to Madrid with a strong mandate when it comes to increasing the 2030 CO2 reduction target. I predict a lot of talk about 'markets' and 'long-term strategies' at COP25 . Those are important topics, but it should not divert attention from the most pressing issue of all: the huge gap between what has to be done and what is being done. We need to close that gap. We need countries coming forward with concrete pledges for additional climate action. That is, in the end, the only real benchmark for success. RELATED CONTENT COP25 'critical' in ensuring 2015 Paris Agreement put in place, says senior MEP Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off Climate change now an 'emergency' says former European commissioner Miguel Ca\'f1ete: Leaders of EU cities and regions must 'lead by example' on climate The Paris Agreement provides a framework on how the world will tackle climate change. The details on making that agreement operational are determined in the so-called 'rulebook'. Last year at COP24, the rulebook discussion was not entirely finished. There is one unsolved issue left: Article 6 on 'Markets'. This article sets out the specific rules under which countries can trade in emission reductions. For example, the rules have to ensure that no double counting can occur: a situation where both countries taking part in a trade count the same reduction. "It was shameful to see how developing countries were coming forward with additional promises for action, while the richest economies remained silent" The EU always has a decent position when it comes to this specific topic, but the rules have to be robust. And is the EU willing to bang its fists on the table for it? International trade in emission reductions is nothing new, but there have been many problems with it, including situations where factories were built only to be closed directly afterwards in order to sell the corresponding emission reduction credits. Brazil and Australia are particularly problematic in the debate on the new market rules; they are doing everything they can to make them as weak as possible. Brazil wants to make easy money; Australia wants to meet its targets without doing anything. Interestingly enough, these are also two countries the EU is talking about doing new trade deals with. If you ask me, the EU should not even hold trade talks if the countries involved are so blatantly trying to weaken international climate rules. Is the EU willing to play that card if needs be, in order to get to an integer outcome on the market rules? Obviously, getting market rules correct is extremely important, but that is not why millions of people are participating in climate marches and strikes. They want politicians to do what is necessary to advert a climate crisis. They want to see the promises made in Paris translated into concrete measures. The national climate plans (NDCs) of the parties to the Paris Agreement are far from sufficient, including that of the EU. "If you ask me, the EU should not even hold trade talks if the countries involved are so blatantly trying to weaken international climate rules" If all those climate plans are implemented to the letter, we still face a temperature rise of more than three degrees Celsius. That is what people want to see changed. Thus far the strongest economies are, at least at the international level, completely deaf to such calls. Two months ago, a special summit was held in New York by the Secretary General of the UN to push countries to increase their climate pledges. It was shameful to see how developing countries were coming forward with additional promises for action, while the richest economies remained silent. This is the moment for the EU to shine. Why would other countries make stronger international pledges, if the EU - an economic giant with lots of historical responsibility - does not manage to increase its NDC of minus 40 percent CO2 to at least minus 55 percent in 2030? And that is only the absolute bare minimum of what the Paris Agreement requires us to do. The clock is ticking. The Paris Agreement will enter into force in 2020. After that, the next official moment to increase climate pledges will be in 2023. Once again we risk losing time that we simply do not have. The vagueness of the new European Commission - on the timing and extent of the increase - is not helpful. The unwillingness of the European Council to even seriously discuss the topic - exactly twelve minutes during the last Council meeting - is very damaging. It makes the upcoming vote on the COP25 resolution, which will set out the mandate of the European Parliament in Madrid, extra important. The new Parliament will vote on the question of whether the EU's 2030 target should be increased to minus 55 percent. Is the new Parliament as ambitious as the previous Parliament in this regard? Are the conservatives still voting against this idea? We will find out during the Strasbourg plenary in late November. I assume, however, that the Parliament will travel to Madrid with a good mandate in this regard. Be assured that I will defend it tooth and nail. \</doc>

Climategate: Science of a Scandal Thursday, 9pm, BBC4 aaaae Measured, cautious, these were unlikely men to be at the heart of a global storm of controversy. Although in a sense, global storms were their m\'e9tier. Ten years ago, the scientists of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia were accused of withholding and manipulating data after more than a thousand emails were hacked in an attempt to deny their findings on climate change. Police investigating the breach classed it as a Category-A crime, as serious as terrorism: the perpetrator was attempting to sway the decisions of nations on an issue of global concern. The hacker was never caught, but this documentary rounds up the other key players to lay out the tale of "Climategate", which derailed the 15th UN conference on climate change in Copenhagen, and sowed doubt about the reality of global warming. It began with a simple image. Michael Mann, a Penn State University professor, using CRU data, produced a graph to illustrate the gravity of rising global temperatures, its straightish line with dramatic upwards curve dubbed "the hockey stick". This caught the eye of Steve McIntyre, a Canadian who had spent his working life in metal mining (it is hard to divorce opinions from professional affiliations in this story). Thinking that analysing the data would be a good recreational use of his mathematical skills, he began a blog and opened up a vigorous correspondence with the CRU scientists. Climate data comes in two forms: the "instrumental period", since measuring devices were invented, and "climate proxies", culled from natural archives such as tree growth rings and ice cores. The latter help push the record back from about 300 years to 1,000. But the CRU's data came from several sources. It wasn't theirs to give away, they thought, when McIntyre came calling. Before long the CRU was being bombarded with freedom of information requests. Then came the hack, revealing a mass of emails between the CRU and other scientists, and out of them a handful of phrases that seemed to hint at a sinister collusion. Three inquiries absolved the scientists of misconduct, but were they a little too high-handed in their interface with the public? "We weren't 100 per cent transparent at that time," one admits. There's an extraordinary coda, almost a happy ending. For the vindication of science, that is, not for the planet. SF \</doc>

A European Union (EU) programme aimed at reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has made significant progress despite low prices in carbon markets, according to a study at the Universities of Strathclyde and Pittsburgh. Under the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), introduced in 2005 in response to the Kyoto Protocol, governments set a cap on an allowable total amount of emissions over a certain period. They also issue tradable emission permits, which allow for one ton of CO2. It is widely considered that carbon markets require high prices to reduce emissions but many observers believe they often set prices which are considered too low. However, the study by Strathclyde and Pittsburgh has found that the EU ETS saved around 1.2 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016, nearly half of what governments pledged to reduce in their Kyoto Protocol commitments. The study has been published in the journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America). Strathclyde's home city, Glasgow, is due to host the next United Nations Climate Change Conference . Dr Patrick Bayer, a Chancellor's Fellow in Strathclyde's School of Government & Public Policy and lead author of the study, said: "The ETS was set up to cover some of the most polluting industries. It has focused on very carbon-intensive energy production and manufacturing but there is evidence in other research suggesting that these industries have started to diversify their business models and to look into adopting carbon-neutral technologies or, at least, are interested in thinking about how to change their operations. "Firms got an initial endowment of permits free but if they had emissions in excess of what they were allowed, they needed to buy more. If firms are to change their behaviour in the long run, prices of permits should be as high as possible to incentivise them to change away from carbon-intensive production. "It turned out prices in carbon markets were fairly low, which then caused major concerns for environmentalists and policy-makers, because they felt they might not provide sufficient incentives. "It depends on the sector or size of firm but we argue that, if firms think of carbon regulation as a long-term project, then they do need to start to change their behaviour." The study used emissions in sectors not covered by the EU ETS to estimate what emissions would have been in those sectors the system does cover. It found that emissions in covered sectors decreased by between 8.1% and 11.5%, compared to expected emission levels without the EU ETS. This translates to a decrease of around 3.8%, compared with the EU's total emissions during 2008 to 2016. Dr Bayer said: "In the energy and electricity markets, we have seen even big players thinking about how they can run their operations when becoming less dependent on fossil fuels. But there can be a threat that, whenever prices in those markets go up, an industry or business becomes exposed to high costs. "The appeal of carbon markets is that, once they are established with the right rules, you can connect them to other markets. Climate is not concerned about whether emissions are reduced in the UK or Germany or China; so long as they are reduced, that helps to address the problem. If you have carbon markets scattered across the world, you might be able to trade across those markets. "The UK's future place in the ETS is still up for discussion but all options are on the table. Whether any UK carbon market would be connected to the European market isn't clear and would probably depend on negotiations with the EU and how trade will be regulated in future relations. Assuming there were agreement on this and some strong economic integration between the two countries, it would probably make a lot of sense to connect those markets. "The UK has been successful in decarbonising its economy in the past decade or so and has a strong role to play in continuing to advocate for future decarbonisation."The period our study covered, from 2008 to 2016, included the financial crisis and economic downturn, when demand for the permits reduced. We used a statistical model to account for the effect of the crisis. The emission reductions that we measure are in addition to lower demand for permits due to the economic crisis, energy efficiency targets and climate policies that try to address carbon emissions."

The move comes following a vote by delegates gathered in Tampere, Finland for the Greens bi-annual summit earlier this month. Speaking after the vote, Huytebroeck said her election comes at a "critical time in our history." RELATED CONTENT COP25 2020 can be the start of a new Greens decade, says Monica Frassoni Surfing the Green Wave in Europe: The new kingmakers 'Green Wave' dominates groups' reactions to preliminary EU election results European Green Party leaders urge second Brexit referendum "It is essential that we come together as Green parties across Europe to tackle climate destruction and biodiversity loss and build on our recent Green Wave successes. I will continue to work together with Green parties everywhere to strengthen our ties to civil society and support all those pushing for a real transformation of society that is both just and Green." She added, "I have been engaged in Green politics in Belgium since the early 1980s at various levels, including as a government minister. My aim will be to build on this experience to support our elected officials and activists across Europe." She served as co-chair of Belgium Green Party Ecolo between 2002-2004 and was a member of parliament for the Brussels regional assembly between 2014-2019. Huytebroeck was also Minister for Energy, Environment and Social Affairs for a decade between 2004-2014. "It is essential that we come together as Green parties across Europe to tackle climate destruction and biodiversity loss and build on our recent Green Wave successes" Evelyne Huytebroek Fellow new-elected co-chair Waitz said, "Both Evelyne and myself come from countries - Austria and Belgium - where the Green Wave has moved the general political discourse toward climate-friendly, sustainable and socially-just solutions." "In the months ahead, we will work together with civil society and beyond ideological concerns so that we can help deliver concrete policies across Europe that secure proper living conditions for the next generation." Waitz added, "Through Europe-wide campaigning, we will strengthen the prospects of Green ideas and parties everywhere, especially in southern and eastern Europe. The daily needs and concerns of European citizens will always be our number one priority so that we can reach a critical mass of changemakers to turn the ship around towards a green future." He recently completed his mandate as an MEP for the Austrian Green Party Die Gr\'fcnen and holds a so-called 'Brexit seat' for the current mandate which means he would return to the European Parliament as an MEP if the UK leaves the EU. Green parties from across Europe meeting in Tampere also pledged to build a "far-reaching campaign to transform climate emergency declarations into concrete action to speed up the process towards climate neutrality." "The daily needs and concerns of European citizens will always be our number one priority so that we can reach a critical mass of changemakers to turn the ship around towards a green future" Thomas Waitz Reacting to approval of the resolution, Waitz said Green parties from across Europe were urging governments at all levels to "not just declare a climate emergency but take concrete and substantial action." He added, "There is no longer any doubt that if we do not act now our very future is in peril. We must reach climate neutrality as soon as we can. In order to do this, we need to deliver concrete cross-sector solutions. All political actors together with the business world must now converge around this goal so we can attempt to preserve our planet for future generations." His comments come just ahead of the COP25 climate conference in mid-December which will now be held in Madrid. Also speaking ahead of the keenly-awaited event, an environmental group has called for the EU to increase spending on so-called "climate finance." In 2018 the EU provided (EURO)21.7bn in climate finance to developing countries but Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe says this is only a "marginal" increase compared to (EURO)20.4bn in 2017 and (EURO)20.2bn in 2016. "European countries continue to dodge their responsibility to empower developing countries to cut emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis." Trio said many developing countries have recently committed to scale up their climate targets in 2020 but only if they receive the necessary financial support to do so. "European countries have a number of opportunities ahead to step up and put money on the table, including COP25 in December. They can do so by doubling their previous contributions for the Green Climate Fund replenishment taking place at the moment." \</doc>

A new era and decade herald fresh opportunities, but environmental impact must continue to be at the top of the industry's agenda It is a new year, a new decade, we are out of the EU and dry January is over, at last. There are so many issues to be considered, I thought that I would start the new roaring twenties with a glimpse of the horizon.

It seems that everybody, except President Trump, has accepted we are cooking the planet and must stop if we want a decent place for us and other life to live.\~ Only 3% of animals are wild - that is truly shocking On biodiversity, one estimate I have seen has it that 97% of animal life on Earth, by weight, is either human or domesticated animals. So only 3% of animals are wild - that is truly shocking. COP26, the UN climate change conference held in Glasgow next November, looks set to be a major milestone. It is already creating a political storm. The SNP is complaining it has been frozen out of organising the event and appears to have retaliated by booking out some major venues. Boris Johnson has sacked his conference organiser Claire O'Neill but cannot persuade David Cameron or William Hague to fill her\~shoes.\~ More fundamentally, the stakes are being raised. Johnson says he will ban all internal combustion cars, including hybrids, from sale after 2035 in the UK. Let's hope the grid is decarbonised and beefed up to take the load by then - and we have a few more charging points that work.\~ HYPERLINK https://d2vhdk00tg424t.cloudfront.net/CMS/s3/ubm-library/web/m/c/m/cop25shutterstock_1582701982_428019.jpg?w=660 COP-25 -shutterstock_1582701982 Source: Shutterstock The previous climate change conference, COP25 , was held in Madrid in December Microsoft has announced that it is not only going carbon zero, but carbon negative to claw back all the carbon it has emitted since it started in business.

COP26 is a massive opportunity for the UK to show real leadership and get in place a new worldwide agreement that can get us back on track to control climate\~change. The mood seems to be: for good or evil, let's make the best of it Brexit is next. We have finally exited the EU and are in "transition" towards either a Canada-style deal with the EU or an Australian one - also known as World Trade Organization rules with tweaks. The mood, typified by even Tony Blair, seems to be: for good or evil, let's make the best of it.\~ Car production and sales may be down, but Johnson will throw borrowed money at infrastructure, such as HYPERLINK https://www.building.co.uk/news/trending/hs2-latest the out-of-control \£3100bn HS2 project , and the North, to keep faith with his new voters and ensure a second term. There is a lot to play for running up to 31 December this year, our true Brexit date, but, despite his flaws, Johnson, aided and abetted by Dominic Cummings, has proved to be a better negotiator than Theresa May. Meanwhile, London is booming as indecision is over. Estate agents are run off their feet by the most house buyer interest for the past 15 years and a one-month price jump of 2.1%. This avoids the ridiculous time it takes to get planning permission for new projects Corporately, it is a sellers' market as developers have been extremely cautious over the past three years, but business has continued to grow. So, the big technology players are in the market, along with a slew of substantial law firms looking for offices. Large good-quality space is expected to run out by the end of the year, meaning firms are looking well ahead and pre-letting space in yet-to-be-built projects - often six or seven years ahead.\~ If I were a developer, I would be looking at the quickest way to bring new space to the market, which has to be refurbishing good existing stock, as this avoids the ridiculous time it takes to get planning permission for new projects - but that is a whole other article. As for the day job at Perkins and Will, 2019 was a good year, but 2020 looks like a great one. In London, we have assembled our three studios under one roof: PW, Portland and our new sister company Penoyre & Prasad. In our own Brexit-defying move, we have opened in Dublin, which is very exciting. We have enjoyed working there for some time and with the Irish capital being in the EU and having GDP growth of more than 7%, it makes great sense to open an office there.

Filmmaker James Levelle had a grand plan: travel from the UK to Chile for the UN climate conference without burning any fossil fuels. So what did he do when he realised the event was cancelled? Guy Kelly found out We've all been there: you're most of the way through a pretty arduous journey - perhaps on the way to a meeting, a party, or something you feel indebted to make - when you receive an ominous call from the host. "Very sorry," they might say, "but we've had a bit of an emergency and we're going to have to cancel. Please tell me you haven't set off yet?" It is, you'll agree, annoying. Now, imagine that feeling, only the "meeting" you were due to attend was in fact a UN conference on climate change in Santiago, Chile. And the "journey" involved travelling from the UK to South America (just the 7,000 miles) without emitting any carbon dioxide and using only non fossil-fuel transport-meaning cycling, paddling, sailing and electric vehicles - to raise awareness about the global climate emergency. And that, at the moment you heard the conference was cancelled, you were bobbing somewhere across the Atlantic, a 100-year-old tall ship, with weeks still to go before landfall. And that you were filming the whole thing. And that, oh, you'd emptied your \£350,000 life savings to fund it all. Now that would be annoying. "It literally knocked me sideways," says HYPERLINK https://www.instagram.com/james_m_levelle/ James Levelle , 38, the unfortunate soul to whom all this happened. "I was bloody miles from anywhere, with still a long way to sail, when I checked the satellite tracker and had a message saying it had been cancelled. Everyone on board was saying: 'Oh my God, what are you going to do?' Then began a big old think." Levelle, a relentlessly buoyant filmmaker, who has made documentaries in some of the most extreme environments on Earth, had intended to record his adventure and a series of "global climate crisis messages" from young people along the way - delivering the footage to politicians at the conference. He had set off from Dorset in a sailing boat at the end of August, and travelled across Europe (mainly by bike) with a small crew, before arriving in Seville in September, where he jumped aboard a ship heading for the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, via Tenerife and Cape Verde. From there, he found his way to Buenos Aires, and planned to head across the Andes to Santiago for Monday this week, when the conference, also known as COP25 , was to begin. The meeting was set to draw climate activists from all over the world - including HYPERLINK Greta Thunberg, who had already sailed across the Atlantic in September. But Chile's embattled president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, was forced to cancel in late October, when violent protests in his capital city - that had seen thousands of arrests, as well as left dozens dead - failed to defuse. Within hours, the UN announced that it was "exploring alternative hosting options", and the next day, another venue was found. It was in Madrid. Thunberg appealed to her 2.98m Twitter followers for help. "It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way," she wrote. "Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful." She received ride from some improbably good-looking YouTubers, but Levelle - who by this point had heard the news and resisted "running around the ship breaking stuff" - was still in his big think. "It wasn't like I could say, 'Right, let's turn this ship around' - I was going to South America whether I liked it or not. Part of me almost laughed at the farcical nature of my position," he says. The choice became binary: should he wait to arrive in South America, then somehow try to get back to Madrid? Or should he plough on regardless? He plumped for the latter. "After a while, it became really clear to me: the job's not done. There were still quite a few events going on in Santiago that were relevant, so I knew that was where I should be. It really wasn't a puritanical mission. I just said I would do something... and so I wanted to finish it." So that's what he'll do - barring another wild plot twist. At the time of writing, Levelle has missed his deadline by a couple of days, but can currently be found cycling furiously across the Andes, having driven for 1,000km from Buenos Aires in an electric Renault van. He ought to arrive by today and can be found in remarkably good spirits. Throughout his time in South America he has relied on the kindness of strangers, both for accommodation and general help. His crew has slimmed down to just him and cameraman, Eoghan McDonaugh, but his mission is otherwise unchanged: he's still capturing his journey, and still collecting video messages - from children he meets in persion and HYPERLINK https://www.instagram.com/james_m_levelle/ via his website - with a view to showing the film next week. Levelle was raised in London; his father was in advertising and his mother was a health practitioner. A degree in English from Edinburgh University was enough to convince him he'd like to avoid office work and see the world like his hero, Sir David Attenborough. He has successfully followed Attenborough into documentaries, only Levelle's methods are quite a lot madder. Over more than a decade, he's documented child labour in India, met pirates off Sierra Leone and gone undercover in the Chinese illegal fur trade. Most audaciously, in 2015 he and another filmmaker, Rob Greenfield, travelled more than 5,000 miles from one side of South America to the other without money, just to see if they could and if people's generosity would sustain them. (Spoilers: they could and it did.) He's currently mining that Latin goodwill again-although this time he has a support team of family and friends back in London, where he's rented out his houseboat, and is very much using money. "I don't want to know how much I've spent," he admits. "A lot. I cannot bear to look at my bank balance. The most expensive thing has been paying for three of us to travel on a tall ship - \£35,000 a pop. I know it's a high-risk personal endeavour, but so many young activists are encouraging people to do something about the climate crisis that it got to the point where I had to. I'm hoping to get more funding, but I'm taking a hit." Levelle's is effusive about Thunberg, who "deserves all the acclaim and attention she gets", but his motivation is to help young people without her extraordinary platform. "Not every young person can 'do a Greta'," he says, "so that's where I'm stepping in and lending a hand as best I can as a filmmaker. I would love to be able to call up Leo DiCaprio and ask for an electric car... but I'm not in that position, so I have to work with what I've got." The Andes, he adds, have been "one hell of a cycle", but he seems to say it with relish. It's lucky he's of an optimistic disposition. "I am. I'm feeling good and positive. And I've never quit anything before, so I'm not about to start now."

Halting overfishing and the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/aug/29/plastic-pollution-im-giving-up-you-probably-should-too-video plastic pollution of the oceans could help tackle the climate emergency by improving the degraded state of the world's biggest carbon sink, a report has found. The oceans absorb both the excess heat generated by our greenhouse gas emissions, and absorb carbon dioxide itself, helping to reduce the impacts of climate chaos. But we are rapidly HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/aug/29/plastic-pollution-im-giving-up-you-probably-should-too-video reaching the limits of the oceans' absorptive capacity as our pillage of marine life is disrupting vital ecosystems and the natural carbon cycle. Creating ocean sanctuaries and forging a new treaty to protect the oceans, with a target of safeguarding at least 30% of the oceans by 2030, could restore many areas to health and combat global heating, according to the report entitled Hot Water: the climate crisis and the urgent need for ocean protection, published by Greenpeace International on Wednesday. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/aug/29/plastic-pollution-im-giving-up-you-probably-should-too-video Phytoplankton such as algae, for instance, transform dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which then forms part of the food chain.

But krill populations have been in HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/aug/29/plastic-pollution-im-giving-up-you-probably-should-too-video long-term decline since the 1970s Marine life at the other end of the scale also plays an important role. Large baleen whales are estimated to store 910m tonnes less carbon than they did before commercial whaling began, Greenpeace noted, while working to rebuild key whale populations would remove 160,000 tonnes of carbon every year. "The ocean's biology is one of our best allies in the fight against climate change," said Louisa Casson, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK. "But over-exploitation and our addiction to fossil fuels have pushed our ocean to the brink of collapse. Ocean protection is climate action - if we can save our ocean, it can save us." The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/aug/29/plastic-pollution-im-giving-up-you-probably-should-too-video highlighted the perils the oceans face from climate chaos , in its first report to focus solely on the marine environment.

Oceans are scheduled to be a key topic at the UN climate change meeting in Madrid, where governments are now discussing progress on the Paris climate change agreement.

Greenpeace also called for a ban on deep-sea mining, made economically feasible by technological innovation but which remains largely unregulated.

Documentary capturing Greta Thunberg's activism to be released through Hulu Film - with the working title 'Greta' - is slated for release in the summer of 2020   It will be produced by Cecilia Nessen and Frederik Heinig through B-Reel Films Greta Thunberg's journey from a 'quiet teenage schoolgirl' to the figurehead of a global climate movement has been captured for an upcoming documentary. Those involved in the project are said to have been following the Swedish teenager since she first began her 'school strike for the climate' movement in Stockholm last August. The film - with the working title 'Greta' - is slated for release on Hulu in the summer of 2020, Deadline reported. It will be produced by Cecilia Nessen and Frederik Heinig, through B-Reel Films, and is said to be directed by Swedish journalist and filmmaker Nathan Grossman. The documentary will follow the 'quiet teenage girl on the autistic spectrum' as she begins a climate campaign with one simple question: 'If you don't care about my future on earth, why should I care about my future in school?' It will then show the eco-warrior as she becomes a world famous activist when her modest school strike evolves into a global movement within months. An insider told Deadline that Hulu became involved with the project £ while back' and had been working 'behind the scenes while deals were being made'. On Tuesday, Greta celebrated returning to Sweden after an epic four-month odyssey without using planes by posing with her pet dogs, Moses and Roxy. The 16-year-old climate activist, who was joined by the golden retriever and black Labrador at Stockholm's harbour on Tuesday morning, captioned the photo: 'Home!' Thunberg, who was recently named TIME magazine's 'Person of the Year', has been on a continent-spanning climate campaign since sailing to the UN conference in New York in August. COP25 climate summit in Madrid last week, Thunberg had a rocky journey home when she lashed out at Europe's largest rail operator. The teen was locked in a Twitter spat over the weekend when she shared a photo of herself sitting on the floor of a train carriage heading through Germany. Deutsche Bahn reacted sarcastically to her apparent complaint about 'overcrowding,' and reliably informed the world that Thunberg had been upgraded to First Class. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Thunberg had written on Saturday: 'Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I'm finally on my way home!' In a stinging reply, DB said: 'Dear #Greta, thank you for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change! We were pleased that you were on the ICE (Inter City Express) 74 with us on Saturday. And with 100 percent green electricity. 'It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.' Thunberg's transatlantic odyssey August 14: Sets sail from Plymouth, England. August 28: Arrives in New York, USA. She takes in Washington, D.C. Montreal, Quebec, Iowa City, Iowa, Standing Rock Indian Reservation, South Dakota, Denver, Colorado, Vancouver, British Columbia, and finally Los Angeles, California. She had planned to travel south to Chile for the COP25 climate summit but because of political unrest it was relocated to Madrid. 'It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way,' she tweeted in November. November 13: Sets sail from Hampton, Virginia. December 3: Arrives in Lisbon, Portugal. December 9: Takes part in a massive rally in Madrid for COP25 . December 13: Fridays for Future protest in Turin, Italy. December 14: Train from Basel, Switzerland, north through Germany. Thunberg swiftly replied: 'Our train from Basel was taken out of traffic. So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains. After G\'f6ttingen I got a seat. This is no problem of course and I never said it was. 'Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!' DB followed up their tweets with a press release, in which they added that Greta's travel companions 'were sitting in first class from Frankfurt onwards'. Her online run-in with DB came just a day after she had spoken before a furious climate protest in Turin, Italy, and said that she would 'put world leaders against the wall' if they continued running away from their climate obligations. She later apologised for the remark, made after the summit in Madrid, claiming that a Swedish phrase had been lost in translation. 'Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said 'put them against the wall'. That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable. That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language.' Ms Thunberg wrote. 'But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I can not enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement - are against any possible form of violence. It goes without saying but I say it anyway.' And that followed on the heels of another high-profile Twitter storm after Thunberg was named TIME's 'Person of the Year.' President Donald Trump - who was given the accolade in 2016 - tweeted that she had £nger management problems' and told her to 'chill'. Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to include the words 'currently chilling'. \</doc>

For two weeks at the end of every year, the world's governments meet to work on a global response to climate change. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world This year is the 25th meeting of what is known as the conference of the parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Those who attend know it as COP, or COP25 . Here's what you need to know about this year's talks, which started on Monday in Madrid, and what they could mean for Australia. Where does Australia stand coming into the talks? There are nearly 190 countries represented at the UN climate talks and, contrary to some perceptions, Australia is not just a bit player. Under UN greenhouse accounting, Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of annual pollution, which places it 16th on a ladder of polluting nations. It emits more each year than 40 countries with larger populations, including G7 members Britain, France and Italy. On other measures Australia performs worse. It emits more per person HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world than any other developed country HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world third for exported emissions It is the world's HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world biggest seller of coal HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world either number one or two for natural gas . It is easily the largest emitter in the south Pacific, and has been \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world increasingly drawing criticism from Pacific leaders for not doing more to tackle the issue. As the talks began last week, Australia was at the forefront of the climate emergency in other ways, as drought and bushfires made HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world global \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world headlines . Scientists say \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world both are unprecedented Observers such as HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Howard Bamsey , the country's former special envoy on climate change, say events in Australia are noticed and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world could be used to influence other countries to do more. But the government's message focuses on its own actions: that it has set a 2030 emissions reduction target, that it more than met previous targets it set for itself and that it will meet this one. Australia has a HYPERLINK 21-strong delegation In the second week's political stage, Australia will be represented by Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction. It is his first time at climate talks. He arrives HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world under pressure on \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world several fronts , including a bizarre \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world public spat with American author Naomi Wolf . How is Australia positioning itself? Australia is a member of what is known as the umbrella group of countries - a coalition of mostly developed nations outside the EU, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the US (which has a big delegation despite planning to leave the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Paris agreement next year). The group doesn't agree on everything but works together when like-minded. Observers say the first week of talks has been slow. Australia is in a camp that does not want the meeting to focus on increasing the ambition of targets volunteered under the Paris deal and emphasises the need to implement what has already been agreed. Non-government groups say it is a concerning sign ahead of the next summit in Glasgow at the end of 2020, when countries are meant to HYPERLINK come armed with new commitments According to a UN report published before the talks, global emissions HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world must fall by about 7.6% a year for the next decade to give a chance of meeting the 1.5C goal. Current targets would result \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world in more than 3C warming HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world dangerous tipping points Scott Morrison has indicated Australia HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world has no plan to increase what it is doing beyond its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels, which is less than what government advisors \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world found would be Australia's fair share or it could afford to do.

It did this by including an accounting loophole known as carryover credits. More on that in a moment.

Potentially. Beyond holding the line on targets, Australia's most prominent negotiating position is using these credits. They are an accounting measure that allows countries to count emissions cuts from exceeding previous targets against future targets. They were allowed under the soon-to-be-obsolete HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Kyoto protocol . They are not mentioned in the Paris agreement and Australia \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world is the only country planning to use them under it. Australia accrued the credits after setting unambitious targets, including that it would increase national emissions by up to 8% between 1990 and 2012. The government says it will have credits equivalent to 411m tonnes of carbon dioxide to use against its Paris target, effectively cutting what it needs to do in new emissions reductions by more than half. Critics say it is HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world exploiting a loophole HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Britain , the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world European Union, Canada HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world Pacific nations , have either raised doubts or said outright they should not be used. Analysts say use of the carryover would be at odds with other clear principles set out in the Paris deal. https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world The text of the agreement says HYPERLINK Investor Group on Climate Change A potential scenario is that developing countries introduce an effective ban on using Kyoto carryover credits into the draft text that governments are negotiating over. Richie Merzian, a former government climate negotiator, now director of the climate and energy program with The Australia Institute, says the Morrison government has yet to formally declare to the UN that it plans to use carryover credits. They do not appear in the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world statement submitted under the Paris deal explaining how Australia would meet its target. What else is on the agenda? A major issue is what is known as Article 6, the part of the Paris rulebook that aims to revive a global carbon market that would help countries cut emissions by paying for measures that reduce pollution in developing countries. The credits generated through these markets differ from carryover credits, as they are tied to actual emissions cuts. Debate over Article 6 is looking at carbon market design and operation and what to do about HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world concerns that some countries led by Brazil are trying to "double count" by claiming emissions reductions for credits sold to wealthy nations. The HYPERLINK Australian business community has been concerned in the lead-up to the talks that Article 6 may not be resolved. The government's position is arguably contradictory. Morrison was \~ HYPERLINK a frequent pre-election critic But Bill Hare, the chief executive and scientist at Climate Analytics and an adviser to small developing countries, says Australia is not working to ensure the rules guarantee that the use of offsets always results in real emissions reductions. "I think it's all about having the ultimate flexibility in what countries want to do, rather than rigorous or accountable oversight," he says. What happens at the conclusion? However the conference ends, the negotiations push on. Next year will be a major test of whether many countries are prepared to deliver on the pledge made in Paris and ramp up commitments before meeting again in to Glasgow. In Australia, the environment department has been quietly working on a long-term climate strategy that is expected to be released for feedback in the new year. Thus far the government has said little to indicate what that might involve. \</doc>

May 12, 2020 HYPERLINK http://www.parliament.uk http://www.parliament.uk Nigel Topping, UK Climate Action Champion and Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the UN-supported: Principles for Responsible Investment are to appear before the Environmental Audit Committee as it continues to scrutinise preparations for COP26. Background The Committee is keen to ensure continued progress towards making the summit a success, despite its postponement due to the coronavirus outbreak. Now widely anticipated to take place in 2021, the success of the summit is likely to depend on fulfilling outstanding issues failed to be agreed at the COP25 summit in Madrid. These include the enhancement of Governments' nationally determined contributions, the invitation to provide long-term strategies, the pathways to decarbonisation to net zero in 2050, and the promise of $ 100 billion a year to help the poorest countries green their economies. Purpose of the session Many of the discussions will be intended to drive action from finance, investors and businesses, and how they can drive progress towards tackling climate change. During the evidence session on Thursday, MPs will be scrutinising this work to date and how the coronavirus outbreak is impacting on the necessary negotiations and preparations. It will also consider what other areas of environmental policy the outbreak is affecting.

Since 1927, TIME has selected the people they believe has most influenced the world over the last year. The decision is made by TIME editors, and last year they decided on "The Guardians and the War on Truth". This consisted of a group of four journalists, including Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed for his criticism of the Saudi Crown Prince. Related articles This also included Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters journalists who were arrested in Myanmar investigating the massacre of Rohingya Muslims, and Maria Ressa - editor of a Philippines-based news website which covered controversial president Rodrigo Duterte. The news organisation, Capital Gazette, was also honoured, as four journalists and a sales assistant were killed by a gunman in their newsroom. This year's winner was revealed on US network NBC's Today show on Wednesday - and it was Greta Thunberg who takes home the prize. Speaking about why Greta was chose, TIME Editor-in-Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: "Meaningful change rarely happens without the galvanizing force of influential individuals, and in 2019, the earth's existential crisis found one in Greta Thunberg. "Thunberg has become the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet-and the avatar of a broader generational shift in our culture that is playing out everywhere from the campuses of Hong Kong to the halls of Congress in Washington. "This was the year the climate crisis went from behind the curtain to center stage, from ambient political noise to squarely on the world's agenda, and no one did more to make that happen than Thunberg."

Trump was named as TIME's Person of the Year in 2016, following his election as president. The House Judiciary Committee have recently announced two charges of impeachment against Trump, which could see the president ousted from office. Nancy PelosiHouse Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi has been at the forefront of US politics over the past year. Pelosi announced the House of Representatives' decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into allegations plaguing the Trump administration. Trump has been accused of asking Ukraine to probe Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's son, in return for military aid and a visit to the White House.

The officer reported the contents of a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Following publication of the phone call, the House launched their impeachment investigation on the US president. Greta ThunbergSwedish teen activist Greta Thunberg has become synonymous with the climate movement. The teenager first rose to prominence for staging a "School Strike for Climate" in front of the Swedish Parliament in 2018. The 16-year-old sparked school strikes across the world, and famously attended the United Nations climate change conference this year by boat. 'The Hong Kong Protestors'News of protests in Hong Kong have dominated international headlines over the last year. Following a controversial extradition bill which would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China, hundreds of thousands of protestors have taken to the streets. The protests have since evolved into a wider, pro-democracy movement. Other people to have made the final 10, but not the final shortlist of five, include Trump's personal lawyer and New York Mayor during the September 11 attacks, Rudy Giuliani - who has been implicated in the scandal involving President Trump. The final 10 also included President of China Xi Jinping, who has been at loggerheads with Donald Trump this year over trade war and the protests in Hong Kong.

Jeremy Clarkson has long backed the remain campaign and has seldom held back before launching an attack on anyone who dares disagree with his political ideologies. Earlier on this year the ex Top Gear host branded Brexit voters "Coffin-dodging idiots", claiming they "screwed it all up" after Jaguar Land Rover set out plans to cut 4,500 jobs from its UK workforce. However, Clarkson has become slightly more exasperated with the whole deal in recent weeks, launching his latest attack on Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn. Related articles One of Clarkson's latest political tweets reads: "I've had a really good idea. Why don't we all just agree this Brexit business is far too complicated and pretend it never happened?" However, it seems Clarkson is not so willing to "pretend it never happened" when it comes to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's appearance in the crunch ITV debate in the run up to the General Election 2019. The Labour leader had become the talk of Twitter after his glasses began to slip down his face during the debate. During an interview with Express.co.uk and other members of the press about his latest Amazon Prime Video special The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen, the host quickly got political. READ MORE: The Grand Tour season 4: Jeremy Clarkson makes global warming U-turn READ MORE When questioned about his decision to compare Jeremy Corbyn to Pol Pot in the special episode, Clarkson quickly launched a scathing attack on the politician. The host said: "I mentioned him a lot. You should have seen how much was edited out." He then went on to share his views on Corbyn after watching the debate. He began: "Corbyn's glasses didn't fit. "You can't vote for someone who can't shave and and can't even buy a pair of glasses that he can get straight on his face. "Jeremy Corbyn... mmm... 'I could run the country - can't organise my specs.' No. I'll just vote for ABC." When asked what was meant by "ABC" he swiped: "Anyone but Corbyn don't give a st." Corbyn wasn't the only one on the receiving end of the former Top Gear presenter's sharp tongue.

[ANALYSIS] While filming in Cambodia for The Grand Tour's latest special alongside co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, filming in the dried up remains of the Tonl\'e9 Sap during the rainy season lead Clarkson to make somewhat of an epiphany when it comes to the existence of global warming. However, he still slams the idea that global warming is a manmade issue, making a number of jibes at young climate change activist Greta Thunberg. He said: "We have simply said here's an example of it. What do you want me to do now get in a carbon fibre yacht and go and shout at Donald Trump?" Speaking of Greta, he said: "There's that weird swede running around making all kinds of we're all going to die noises so we're all aware of it... I just think she is a weird swede with a bad temper." READ MORE He went on to brand the young activist a "liar" for claiming to have began a low carbon footprint journey to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid. He then said: "Did you see she went to Chilli for the climate conference which was then moved to Madrid? I literally st myself laughing. She's an idiot because scientists will solve it, and nobody's going to solve it by going on strike and not going to school cause the you're not in your science lessons so she's a fool.

HYPERLINK http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/199200192 Chiesi Farmaceutici SPA The Italian group has announced at the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid that by the end of 2025, it hopes to bring a breakthrough, environmentally-friendly pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) to the market for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As part of the plan, Chiesi said it has inked a multi-million-euro commercial agreement to secure supply of a new propellant called HFA 152a (1,1-difluoroethane) which "will minimize the carbon footprint of a pMDI down to a similar level as a dry powder inhaler." Recent research from the University of Manchester noted estimates that over 630 million pMDIs are manufactured annually worldwide using over 10,000 tons of propellants. The two hydrofluorocarbon propellants which are currently used in these inhalers - HFC-134a and HFC-227ea - have "significant global warming potential," the researchers said, hence the interest in developing a different propellant with a lower threat to the environment. Chiesi's supply deal is with leading medical propellant manufacturer Koura, which has been developing HFA 152a for several years for respiratory disorders. It is currently used as a consumer aerosol propellant, in air duster products (canned air), and as a foam blowing agent. Of the aforementioned (EURO)350m, Chiesi told Scrip it had already invested approximately (EURO)50m in manufacturing facilities in Blois, France for the new formulation which has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of pMDI inhalers by 90%. It will work jointly with Koura to finalize the toxicology package demanded by worldwide regulatory agencies, prior to entering the next stage of clinical testing as required for any new drug. In September, Chiesi committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2035 and received 'B Corp' certification in June. Similar to Fairtrade status, B Corp denotes a company that works for social and environmental good, not just to generate profit. Chiesi stated that it is "the first company in the pharmaceutical industry to publicly announce a solution to address the carbon footprint of pMDIs while safeguarding necessary therapeutic options for patients." \~ \~ In a BMJ Open commentary, a number of UK clinicians cited some of the headlines in the media prompted by the report, such as "Asthma inhalers are as bad for the environment as a 180-mile car journey", "Asthma sufferers should switch to "green" inhalers to help the environment and save millions for the NHS" and "Some asthma inhalers are as bad for the environment as eating meat". The doctors said that "these messages clearly have the potential to stigmatize patients with asthma and COPD for taking their essential medication, and there are anecdotal reports of children, many of whom benefit particularly from pMDI therapy, not wanting to be seen using their inhalers in public. We know of no other situation in the National Health Service where patients are stigmatized for using licensed and approved medications, and the situation will doubtless further impact on the issue of compliance." They concluded that there was no mention in the study "or indeed in the media, that correct delivery of inhaled drugs by an inhaler device which can be used efficiently and reliably by individual patients improves symptoms and quality of life and reduces morbidity, mortality and hospital acute care costs." Ugo Di Francesco, Chiesi's CEO, echoed those views, saying that "protecting patient health and the environment should not be a matter of compromise. We are proud to supply both pMDI and dry powder inhalers and to have taken decisive and ambitious action to ensure patients can continue to access the inhaler options that best suit their needs, whilst innovating to find the most environmentally conscious solution available." He went on to say that switching treatments for non-clinical reasons has the potential to have a negative impact on patients' health, as well as placing an added strain on resources. "Patients should not have to shoulder the burden of environmental responsibility when considering treatment options that affect their health. In the face of a global climate crisis, we must all share the burden of action. I can only encourage other industry players to join us," Di Francesco added. Respiratory is a core area for Chiesi, led by Fostair (beclometasone/formoterol) for asthma and COPD and Trimbow (beclometasone/formoterol/glycopyrronium), the first triple therapy to get European approval for COPD in 2017.

The IAEA's work has a direct impact on fundamental issues of war, peace, health, energy, food and water, Rafael Mariano Grossi told a Special Session of the Agency's General Conference following his appointment as IAEA Director General. Mr Grossi, a senior Argentinian diplomat with a career spanning several decades in nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, will take office on 3 December. Read his CV here. Following his statement, Member State representatives joined Conference President Martha Delgado Peralta, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights at the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in congratulating Mr Grossi on his appointment as the sixth Director General of the IAEA. An 'indispensable' organization By verifying that nuclear material is not being diverted from peaceful purposes and supporting countries in the use of nuclear science and technology to improve living standards and boost economic growth, the IAEA impacts the lives of millions, he said. 'The world is safer because of the dedication and vigilance of our inspectors,' Mr Grossi said, speaking of the IAEA's nuclear safeguards verification mandate. 'The fact that the Agency is known to stick to the facts has immense value and gives us unique credibility. Countries recognize this. Not everyone always likes what we report. But the Agency cannot be accused of being politically biased or of lacking objectivity.' Turning to the Agency's work to make nuclear technology available for peaceful purposes, he stated: 'We touch the lives of millions of people by improving access to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy, enabling farmers to grow more food, supporting the management of scarce water resources, and in countless other areas.' Clean energy to combat climate change When it comes to responding to climate change and the need to secure adequate supplies of energy in the future, Mr Grossi said that nuclear energy is not part of the problem but can be part of the solution for countries wishing to use it. Noting that the United Nations Climate Change Conference is opening today in Madrid, Mr Grossi stressed the vital contribution that nuclear power can make in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power provides about 10% of the world's electricity and contributes one third of all low-carbon electricity. 'When considering the future of nuclear power, we must acknowledge that there is substantial public concern about whether nuclear power is safe,' he stated. 'Everyone remembers Chernobyl and Fukushima. The fact that nuclear power actually has an excellent overall safety record is not widely understood.' Science-based analysis of its risks and benefits compared to those of other energy sources should facilitate a better understanding of nuclear power's potential and address public concern about its safety. Guarding against nuclear terrorism Noting that nuclear safety and security are national responsibilities, he stated: 'It is vital that we remain ahead of the curve in guarding against nuclear terrorism. The Agency already brings together senior government officials and technical experts from around the world to consider the best ways to do this. I intend to build on the great political impetus seen in nuclear security in recent years, expand our support to all Agency Member States and work to transform our nuclear security guidance into mainstreamed norms.' New sources of funding Fundamental to the future will be seeking new and innovative sources of funding for the IAEA's work, Mr Grossi said, including partnerships with other international organisations, regional organisations, banks and major international companies. 'Our technical cooperation programme has made a huge contribution over the decades. But the needs of developing countries are great and they expect us to do much more,' he stated. 'It is unrealistic to expect a significant increase in our budget in the coming years, so we must find new sources of funding.' Reaching gender parity Mr Grossi welcomed the fact that women now account for 30 percent of senior positions in the Agency but said his goal was full gender parity. 'To me, gender parity means 50 percent women and 50 percent men - and that is the goal I set for myself. It will be challenging, but it is not impossible.' The IAEA should be able to succeed, where other organizations already have, and make use of all of the world's talent, not only half of it, he added.

KPMG is calling on the UK Government and business community to put the green agenda at the heart of its economic recovery plans. The firm is urging business and political leaders, preparing for long-term post-Covid-19 recovery, to act more proactively and collaboratively to drive 'transformational' change to respond to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change, and the transition to a net-zero economy. The UN conference on climate change In June 2019, the UK passed a law committing to end its contribution to global warming by 2050, joining 109 other countries and a growing number of states and cities who have either agreed or are considering similar measures. While some of the country's leading brands have unveiled ambitious plans, the response from the business community remains patchy and inconsistent. Companies should use the response to Covid-19 to factor their plans on climate risk, by carrying out a climate risk and opportunity assessment, seeking strategic advice on how to transform, and adapting to mitigate the risks and take advantage of the opportunities available in a low carbon economy. Bridget Beals, director of power and utilities at KPMG UK, said: "Achieving the UK's net-zero targets in a period of profound economic instability will require transformational change across all sectors of the economy. "Policy and regulation changes will undoubtedly drive the agenda forward, but different legal levers will create a raft of potential risks, so it's incumbent upon businesses to lead the way, rather than waiting and responding." Simon Weaver, energy and natural resources partner at KPMG UK, added: "Recent research suggested 67% of the British public care more about the environmental impact of their consumptions than they did five years ago, while 62% say they're looking to corporate Britain to make sure their consumption is responsible. "The immediate pressures on boards can make it difficult to stop and reflect, but taking the time to think about climate risks, running scenarios and making the relevant changes to business models and strategies can help us stretch the corporate and political planning horizons. "We need to do this to respond to the challenge of climate risks effectively, and ultimately make our businesses and wider economy more resilient to the change to come." \</doc>

Thunberg, 16, tweeted about the 'overcrowded train' on her way back to Sweden Deutsche Bahn tweeted sarcastic 'thank you' for supporting electric transport   Thunberg tweeted a swift clarification saying she preferred overcrowded trains She apologised Saturday for saying she would put politicians £gainst the wall' Greta Thunberg engaged the German railway service Deutsche Bahn in Twitter warfare after sharing a photo of herself sitting on the floor of a packed train. The 16-year-old Swede, who was later upgraded to First Class, wrote on Saturday: 'Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I'm finally on my way home!' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par In a stinging reply, DB said: 'Dear #Greta, thank you for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change! We were pleased that you were on the ICE 74 with us on Saturday. And with 100 percent green electricity. 'It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.' . COP25 climate summit in Madrid, quickly wrote back: 'Our train from Basel was taken out of traffic. So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains. After G\'f6ttingen I got a seat. This is no problem of course and I never said it was. 'Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!' DB followed up their tweets with a press release, in which they added that Greta's travel companions 'were sitting in first class from Frankfurt onwards'. As a First Class passenger, Thunberg would have had access to more legroom in plush leather seats, free food and drink, as well as complimentary WiFi and newspapers. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Her online run-in with DB came just hours after she had spoken before a furious climate protest in Turin, Italy, and said that she would 'put leaders against the wall' if they continued running away from their climate obligations. She later apologised for the remark, claiming that a Swedish phrase had been lost in translation. 'Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said "put them against the wall". That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable. That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language.' Ms Thunberg wrote. 'But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I can not enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement - are against any possible form of violence. It goes without saying but I say it anyway.' And that followed on the heels of another high-profile Twitter storm after Thunberg was named TIME magazine's person of the year. President Donald Trump tweeted that she had £nger management problems' and told her to 'chill'. Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to include the words 'currently chilling'. Thunberg's journey through Germany was the last leg of a continent-spanning trip which began when she travelled to New York on a low-emissions yacht last August. Th 16-year-old activist started a worldwide movement last year when she began to strike from school every Friday to protest government inaction on climate change. Refusing to fly, she has twice crossed the Atlantic by boat in recent months in order to speak at a UN climate summit in New York and the hastily rearranged COP25 summit in Madrid. \</doc>

British Frozen Food Federation - BFFF: GLOBAL BIOGAS INDUSTRY LEADERS CALL ON GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO UNLOCK THE FULL POTENTIAL OF BIOGAS IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. If all barriers were removed, the biogas industry could abate up to 4bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, representing at least 12% of today's global emissions, by 2030. Today only 2% of the feedstock available globally to produce biogas is captured and recycled. At the COP25 meeting, the World Biogas Association and its leading corporate members will present UNFCCC with a Declaration in which they commit to delivering the full potential of biogas by 2030 and call upon world governments to support this ambition. In a ground-breaking Biogas and Climate Change Commitment Declaration, major biogas industry corporations, led by the World Biogas Association (WBA), call on the world's governments to act urgently to unlock the sector's potential to cut global greenhouse gases emissions by at least 12% within the next 10 years - and therefore make a considerable contribution towards meeting their Paris Agreement targets. In return, these companies commit to putting their full human, financial and technological resources behind enabling the rapid expansion of biogas in all parts of the globe. It is the first time that so many powerful biogas organisations join forces to both demand - and deliver - solutions to address climate change. In its recent report, the Global Potential of Biogas, WBA estimated that the number of industrial plants operating globally are currently 132,000. By 2030 there needs to be at least 1 million large scale installations (each handling over 100,000 t/pa of feedstock) plus millions of smaller scale digesters, to achieve the emissions reductions targets. All of these units would enable the biogas industry to prevent 4bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent from being emitted annually - the equivalent of all the emissions of the EU28 in 2017. The sector will need to invest some $ 5 trillion to design, build and operate those plants, but all barriers to those investments existing today must be eliminated if the industry is to achieve its goal. If deployed to its full potential, WBA estimates that the industry would employ around 10 million people worldwide, from 350,000 currently WBA President David Newman said: 'With measures on the ground not yet aligned with countries' Paris Agreement targets and UN Sustainable Development Goals commitments, the biogas industry calls on the world's governments to urgently pass legislation to unleash the enormous potential of the biogas industry. We provide a ready to use technology to cut emissions in the hardest to decarbonise sectors, while creating a circular system that transforms the greenhouse gas-emitting organic wastes society produces into renewable energy, biofertilisers and other valuable bioproducts. The speed at which climate change is accelerating emphasises the urgent need for responses that go beyond business-as-usual to remove the barriers to large scale investment in biogas technologies. We need decisive actions now.' David and WBA Chief Executive Charlotte Morton will deliver the Declaration in person to H.E. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the COP25 meeting in Spain, which they will be attending as the WBA is an Observer Party to the Conference.

November 7, 2019 HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu http://www.europarl.europa.eu The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. In August, it presented a report on climate change and land and in September one on the oceans and cryosphere in a changing climate. The reports are the latest scientific input for the UN climate summit COP25 to be held in Madrid in December. The scientists behind the reports presented their findings to Parliament's environment, development and fisheries committees on Wednesday 6 November. Food production and climate change a two-way street Professor Jim Skea told MEPs climate change was exacerbating land degradation, such as erosion and pollution, which in turn affects infrastructure and people's livelihoods. Better land management can help tackle climate change but it must be complemented by other action, he added. Dr Jean-Francois Soussana noted that the food system accounts for between a fifth and a third of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. At the same time, climate change affects food security through declining crops of wheat and maize. He warned that in future the stability of our food supply would decrease further as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events increases. \</doc>

Sir, Further to your leading article ("Cop Out", Dec 16), the strained outcome of the Madrid COP25 climate meeting underlines the huge hurdles facing the UK in hosting the next. One of the most positive features last week was the EU (Poland aside) adopting the goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050, like the UK. Our prime minister has committed himself to a huge expansion of offshore wind, which will require deep involvement with the European energy market in particular to sell surplus electricity, and potentially to manage fluctuating gas demand given the closure of UK gas storage: we cannot build pipes or power cables to the US or China to offset any reduced energy trade with the EU. The COP we will host in Glasgow next November, in partnership with Italy, will revolve around national long-term strategies and increasing the ambition of the existing inadequate pledges from around the world. In Madrid, the EU, with the UK fully integrated, was a driving force for enhanced ambition, as one of the three major global centres of power. After Brexit, and in the trade negotiations to follow, a priority must be to maintain the UK as a central player in both EU energy markets, and in the diplomatic weight of European energy-climate policy.

October 16, 2019 PEFC and AB Group Packaging are working hard to promote sustainable alternatives to plastic packaging. European Paper Bag day is an annual day of action which aims to raise consumer awareness about paper carrier bags as sustainable and efficient packaging that contribute to fighting climate change and environmental pollution. Sustainable, forest-based packaging such as paper bags, reduce plastic waste and carbon emissions and make a significant contribution to the circular economy. As the worldwide discussion on mitigating climate change grows in urgency, this year's COP25 event that will be held in Santiago, Chile from 2-13 December, will be seeking to encourage permanent action and transformation towards truly sustainable development. The conference theme - Time for Action - will focus on a number of initiatives, three of which directly relate to PEFC's sustainable forest management programme: Forests, Biodiversity and the Circular Economy. Alun Watkins, Executive Director of PEFC UK said: "We are delighted that our colleagues in Chile will be able to supply visitors to their stand at this internationally-important conference with a paper bag which has been sustainably-produced, is strong enough to be reused and at the end of life, can be readily recycled." PEFC works to protect the world's forests by promoting sustainable forest management through certification - encouraging responsible stewardship and use of forests and forest lands to maintain biodiversity, forest eco-systems, regeneration and vitality. Currently, 311 million hectares of forests and 750,000 forest owners are certified globally. AB Group Packaging has been manufacturing low carbon, sustainable paper bags in the UK, Ireland and Europe for over 30 years and is a strong advocate of PEFC's work and a regular supporter of their events. To mark European Paper Bag Day, the company has supplied a stock of PEFC-certified and branded paper bags to distribute at Certfor's (the Chilean member of PEFC's global alliance) stand at COP25 in Chile to help promote the impactful, practical work that the independent certification alliance undertakes to help alleviate climate change by promoting responsible forest management. With a long record of environmental credentials AB Group Packaging manufactures sustainable recycled and full-circle products, including the world's first PEFC-certified fully recyclable, biodegradable, 100% sustainable Reusable Paper Bag. Tested to carry the heaviest items up to 26kg, this water and tear resistant super-sturdy bag is fast becoming the most consumer appealing bag of choice to replace thick plastic bags. AB Group Packaging CEO, Dermot Brady added: "We were delighted to make this donation of sustainable paper bags to assist PEFC to promote responsible forest management around the globe. Our alliance with PEFC plays a vital role in ensuring that the world's forestry resources continue to fulfil their critical part in mitigating climate change."

Every year since 1994, the UN has gathered together the world's governments at its Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference of the parties (COP), held in a different country each time. The convention's ultimate aim is to prevent 'dangerous' human interference with the climate system. The onus is on developed countries to lead the way and the convention directs funds to developing countries to help them in their efforts. COP25 , held in Madrid at the beginning of December 2019, did not end well. Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg's solemn speech gave short shrift to countries neglecting their responsibilities, and the likes of the US President, Donald Trump, and Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, responded with personal attacks. Tensions ran high when climate justice activists were barred from entering the venue and talks stalled, and negotiations ending two days late with a compromise deal on cutting global carbon emissions. Given the raised status of the world's climate emergency, it was a disappointing end to a conference for which many had high hopes. In the cold light of a new year, everyone from activists to world leaders are reflecting on COP25 's ultimate failure to set down rules on creating a carbon market between countries. But already, behind the scenes, the UK is looking to the next summit - because this year COP26 will be pitching its tent in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to descend on the city in November 2020. For those who live and work in Glasgow it will be a chance to experience being part of an important climate action event. People from around the country will be able to participate in hundreds of events that will be happening across the city. So why will COP26 be such a big occasion for Glasgow, and what will the city itself bring to the mix? Why hosting COP26 is a big deal As world summits go, they don't get much more important than the UN's climate change convention. In those three decades, this will be the first time a COP summit has been held in the UK. From a policy perspective, COP26 will be important for at least four reasons: 1. It will take place in the year when all countries are asked to submit their new long-term goals - so ambition to address the global climate emergency will be high on the agenda. 2. It will have to finish the work that COP25 was unable able to conclude - setting out the rules for a carbon market between countries. 3. From Glasgow onwards, the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement will be the key driver of international climate action. 4. COP26 will come just weeks after the US presidential election with the potential implications this will have for US climate policy and US participation in COP26. Come November 2020, the eyes of the world will be firmly on Glasgow. Glasgow on show Scotland has a long and rich history of discovery and innovation, including Glasgow's past as a world-class centre of shipbuilding, trade and industrial production - a legacy that has contributed to greenhouse gas emissions but has also added much to the quality of human life. From pioneering work on the steam engine and wind turbines, to the invention of television and the life-saving discoveries of penicillin, gin and tonic and Billy Connolly's shipyard humour, Glasgow has helped shape the modern world. Glasgow and its history can also shed light on how cities, societies and people can reinvent themselves from a former industrial workhorse to a city of culture, services and new green technologies. Scotland's collective commitment to net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2045 now puts the country at the forefront of real action on the climate emergency. During COP26, Glasgow's research and innovation will be on show to the world. Engineers are leading the development of renewable technologies such as tidal energy and floating offshore wind turbines. Scotland is at the forefront of establishing hydrogen as a viable energy source, providing hubs for related skills and knowledge-sharing, to ensure that new technologies can be integrated into the grid and controlled. Scotland also leads the way not only on the science innovation, but on ways in which research and development can provide community-informed solutions to sea and climate change challenges, and on how climate change relates to Scotland's coastline and islands. Researchers in Scotland are also at the forefront of the science-policy-practice interface, working with people in the field to deliver climate change risk and adaptation policies. And with climate change already a reality, Glasgow is also producing science that helps communities become more prepared and resilient. More than a political event Glasgow's experts and innovators will have their moment to shine at COP26 - a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to connect with those deciding the direction and effectiveness of the global debate on climate change action. COP26 Glasgow can also be an inspirational event for Scotland's young people, the generation which will inherit both the burden of climate change and the means to address it. As we build up to COP26, the Scottish government and Glasgow City Council, alongside the universities of Strathclyde, Glasgow and Glasgow Caledonian, will be planning numerous events that will run alongside the main COP26 activities. The countdown has begun. Glasgow will seek to demonstrate to the world how Scottish research and innovation is playing an important role in tackling the global climate emergency.

MADRID: Mass anti-government protests in Chile led president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era to cancel the country's preparations for a key international climate change conference, COP25 , which had been scheduled for December. Soon after, the Spanish government announced it would host the talks in Madrid. While the decision was praised across the world, conservative newspaper El Mundo saw it as a political stunt by socialist prime minister Pedro S\'e1nchez in the run-up to fresh elections. "You cannot accuse him of lacking the ability for innovation," the paper remarked in an editorial. That extends to giving off the impression that he is at the head of a functioning government, it argued. "We are talking about a conference that more than 25,000 people will attend and that governments from 200 countries and many international organisations will take part in, requiring any host country to spend many months in complex preparations," claimed the paper. "But in the Moncloa [the prime minister's residence], they have decided that four weeks of doing nothing are more than enough." However, there are serious reasons to be concerned about the government's security arrangements, it continued. The unrest in Catalonia is draining the security services of resources, it added. If the crisis continues into December, "the challenge of splitting the resources of the Interior Ministry between there and Madrid will be immense". \</doc>

Photocredit: Press Association The resolution is backed by several mainstream groups, including the Greens, Renew Europe (RE) and the Socialists, the second biggest in the assembly. Speaking at a news briefing in Parliament on Friday, a Socialist group spokesman said its leader, Spanish member Iratxe Garc\'eda P\'e9rez, will call on the incoming new European Commission "to take concrete action on climate action." An RE spokesman, speaking at the same pre-plenary press conference, said, "We decided to put forward this resolution because we urgently need to declare a state of emergency in Europe." RELATED CONTENT COP25 : Nicol\'e1s Gonz\'e1lez Casares "Setting new ambitions" COP25 2020 can be the start of a new Greens decade, says Monica Frassoni Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Parliament President urges Member States to intensify climate change fight European mayors call for urgent climate action as global strike kicks off "The time has come for us in Europe to act and, in adopting this resolution next week, send a clear signal that the EU's Green Deal is a project for our generation." A Greens spokesman said it too backed the resolution, adding, "We also need to see some concrete action to back this up and avert climate crisis." Each group was asked how their calls for a climate emergency squares with the fact that the Parliament itself continues to travel to Strasbourg 12 times a year. A spokesman responded by pointing out that efforts had been made in the past to deal with the issue, so far to no avail. "We decided to put forward this resolution because we urgently need to declare a state of emergency in Europe" Renew Europe spokesman They also stressed that any alterations to Parliament's split site arrangement would require a change to the EU treaties. One spokesman said, "The treaties give the right to Parliament to meet in Strasbourg." It was also pointed out that a German MEP has proposed a possible solution to the problem of MEPs having to decamp to Strasbourg 12 times a year, as demanded by the EU treaties. Nico Semsrott, from the satirical party Die Partei, in a letter to Parliament President David Sassoli, said, "My team of top legal minds has found a way forward. The treaty protocol that determines Parliament's place of business says simply that it must meet in Strasbourg, it does not specify whether that is Strasbourg, France, or Strasbourg, Saskatchewan - or whether Strasbourg is a city at all. That's why I have renamed the Brussels plenary hall 'Strasbourg' so we can instead meet there 12 time a year, fully in line with the treaties." A study has been commissioned on the economic impact of trekking to Strasbourg 12 times a year. A spokesman told reporters, "This study will, we believe, add more weight to the single seat campaign." Elsewhere next week, MEPs will be asked to back calls to set up a special committee to probe cases of alleged interference in elections in Europe. "We also need to see some concrete action to back this up and avert climate crisis" Greens spokesman An RE spokesman said, "We need to have this debate and see how we can, in the future, tackle the problem because it's become a threat to our democratic process." Arguably the most important vote next week will be on the new college of commissioners. MEPs will first have a debate with Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission President-elect and her new team, before the vote on Wednesday. A simple majority is needed for the team to be approved and start work. The groups will first meet briefly to discuss their position before the vote and the Greens spokesman said they had still "some concerns" about the Hungarian nominee who has been ordered to answer more questions from MEPs after his nomination hearing. The Socialists say the programme put forward by von der Leyen, which will be voted on next week, has "clearly been influenced by our group. It means that climate action and the Green Deal are now at the core of next possible future commission." "A lot of work was done to influence this and our nine (Socialist) commissioners now have key positions in the college. Frans Timmermans will also lead the fight for new Green Deal." The Socialists said the group will make its final decision on the new team headed by von der Leyen on Tuesday. The political groups were also asked about the UK's decision not to send a commissioner, despite infringement proceedings being started by the Commission. A Parliament spokesman said, "It is clear from the advice from the legal services at the three EU institutions that the vote on the new college next week can still go ahead. It was the UK's choice not to appoint anyone." An EPP spokesman said, "The UK may try to delay the start of a new Commission, but this cannot be allowed to happen. "This is the UK's problem, not ours." The Greens spokesman said, "We still want the UK to play a full role and submit a commissioner but we will leave this up to the EU's legal services." MEPs will, in a busy week, also vote on the 2020 EU budget with the Parliament saying on Friday that it has now secured "more funding for its priorities including youth policies and R&D." They will also prepare for the December EU summit where climate change and the EU budget will take centre stage. MEPs will also next week vote on a resolution combatting violence against women and girls with Parliament President David Sassoli planning to light the Parliament building in orange in a bid to raise awareness of the issue. \</doc>

The world's leaders and diplomats are gathering at a\~United Nations climate summit\~in Madrid today amid growing concerns over the global warming crisis.\~\~ As the Spanish capital prepares to welcome some 29,000 delegates at the two-week conference of the parties, or COP25 , UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that "the point of no return is no longer over the horizon". That message is echoed in an article in HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0 Nature journal written by a group of leading scientists, who warn that the Earth's climate is closer to reaching crucial "tipping points" than was previously thought. Here are some of those thresholds. Ice collapse Evidence shows that the HYPERLINK https://www.theweek.co.uk/102044/precipitous-decline-in-antarctic-sea-ice-since-2014 Antarctic ice sheets Collapsing ice sheets leads to higher sea levels, one of the most dangerous consequences of climate change.

Biosphere boundaries Climate change threatens to trigger biosphere tipping points, some of the consequences of which are already being felt. Ocean heatwaves have caused coral bleaching and the loss of half of the shallow-water corals on HYPERLINK https://www.theweek.co.uk/91121/great-barrier-reef-australia-pledges-60m-to-halt-decline Australia's Great Barrier Reef Deforestation and climate change also risks destabilising rainforests such as the HYPERLINK https://www.theweek.co.uk/102901/brazilian-wildfires-bolsonaro-accuses-ngos-of-burning-rainforest Amazon . The scientists say that "estimates of where an Amazon tipping point could lie range from 40% deforestation to just 20% forest-cover loss". About 17% has already been lost since 1970. Global cascade The biggest risk is a "global cascade" of tipping points "that led to a new, less habitable, 'hothouse' climate state", says report author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. Evidence suggests that exceeding one tipping point can increase the risk of exceeding others, with such links found for 45% of possible interactions. Arctic sea-ice loss is amplifying warming in the area, which contributes to an influx of fresh water in the North Atlantic. This in turn contributes to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a large system of ocean currents that distribute heat and energy around the world and determine the climate we feel all around the globe. A further slowdown of the AMOC could destabilise the West African monsoon, triggering drought in Africa's Sahel region. The\~phenomenon could also dry the Amazon, disrupt the East Asian monsoon, and cause a heat build-up in the Southern Ocean, which could further accelerate Antarctic ice loss. ------------------------------- For a round-up of HYPERLINK https://subscription.theweek.co.uk/subscribe?utm_source=theweek.co.uk&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=brandsite&utm_content=in-article-link-politics the most important stories https://subscription.theweek.co.uk/subscribe?utm_source=theweek.co.uk&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=brandsite&utm_content=in-article-link-politics The Week magazine HYPERLINK https://subscription.theweek.co.uk/subscribe?utm_source=theweek.co.uk&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=brandsite&utm_content=in-article-link-politics Start your trial subscription today Is it too late?

"We might already have lost control of whether tipping happens," they write. "A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping - and hence the risk posed - could still be under our control to some extent." "To be honest, I think we know enough climate science to act, yet we are not acting decisively, so we need to put resources into action," report author Lenton told HYPERLINK Vice .

Thunberg stuck to routine and joined a 'Fridays for Future' march on her birthday She joined activists outside the Swedish parliament on Friday as she turned 17   Eco warrior tweeted picture of herself holding her now-famous school strike sign Teenage eco warrior Greta Thunberg stuck to routine on her 17th birthday and joined a weekly 'Fridays for Future' march outside the Swedish parliament. She joined other climate activists outside the parliament in Riksdagen, in Stockholm on Friday, January 3, for the 72th consecutive week of the marches. Thunberg tweeted a picture of herself at the march early this morning, wrapped up warm in the cold weather and holding her trademark sign reading in Swedish: 'School strike for climate'. The school strike for the climate marches were sparked by Thunberg when she staged her first protest in August 2018, at the age of 15. It has since spread all over the world to involve more than 100,000 schoolchildren who take time off from class to participate in demonstrations to call for action on climate change. Thunberg arrived back in her home country last month after an epic voyage saw her cross the Atlantic from the UK to America before visiting cities across the US and Canada, then returning to Portugal. From there she went by train to a climate summit in Spain - which ended without an agreement - before visiting Turin and Basel on her way back to Sweden. The young climate activist refuses to travel by plane due to the environmental cost and has twice crossed the Atlantic by boat in recent months. The schoolgirl's dogged activism has seen her invited to speak at parliaments across the world, give a speech to the UN, and become Time's Person of the Year. She was nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize after spearheading a global movement demanding world leaders take action on climate change. Greta is currently on a gap year from her education and heads back to school in August. Greta's father has recently revealed how his daughter suffered with depression, but the teenager says her activism has been like a medicine. She told Radio 4: 'It really helps in getting out of that depression because it gives a feeling you are having an impact.'

Have you ever tried walking on a travellator? You know, those moving platforms at airports that help you get to your destination when you are in a hurry or tired, or have a lot of baggage to carry. Have you also tried to walk in the wrong direction on it? Depending on your own pace and the speed of the travellator, you could either make slow progress, or no progress at all, or go backward. Climate Change: A Clear and Present Danger This is the image I have of the last few Conferences of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations. To keep the analogy going, let's think of the travellator as climate change, which seems unstoppable and is, in fact, getting faster. The COP Summits At the COP summits, representatives of almost 200 countries get together over a week or so. They discuss the latest data on climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions and then negotiate on the required actions to address climate change - move forward on the travellator - and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assist developing countries in achieving emissions reductions and adapt to a changing climate. But it hasn't been easy, and it never was going to be easy. As I explain in my book, "A Climate for Denial," climate change is classified as a wicked problem - one that is complex, ever-changing, difficult to define and involving multi-disciplinary aspects, constraints and solutions. But it is also one that must be addressed and solved.

But these meetings and negotiations are often bogged down in detail and lack of agreement even on fundamental issues. These include how to account for greenhouse gas emissions and how to allow developing countries to develop economically without penalizing them, while developed countries defend their right to maintain their high dependency on energy usage and economic prosperity. Due to the huge discrepancies between developed, developing and underdeveloped countries in their emissions profiles, economic development, and technical and economic capabilities, negotiations can rarely get past first base. A fundamental roadblock preventing progress has been because of the complexities of allowing developing countries to catch up with developed countries while reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases. That's why the 2015 Paris accord relies on a vague agreement to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. When that agreement was signed in 2016, every country was asked to determine its own target and pledge to meet it, which would supposedly achieve the overall 1.5-degree goal. The Paris accord is a vague agreement mainly because it's not legally binding and, therefore, doesn't guarantee its intended achievement. The end result speaks for itself: emissions continue to rise and global warming is not stopping. The whole idea of voluntary action on an extremely complex issue such as the reduction of global emissions is therefore fraught with manipulation, loopholes and lack of urgency due to national priorities and interests ahead of global interests. A great example of this is Australia's insistence to use the 1997 Kyoto Protocol's "left-over" credits to meet its Paris targets. This clearly is against the spirit of the Paris Agreement as it tried to be forward-looking, having drawn "a line in the sand" on where emissions were in 2015-16 and where they needed to be in the future. It's equivalent to telling someone that they need to lose weight for their health, and then the person saying they've lost weight over the past few years. One of the greatest challenges in these negotiations and agreements has been the huge discrepancies in the emissions profiles, energy requirements and economic development between countries. On the one hand, we have nations that have still to provide electricity to large areas of their population and, on the other, developed countries that rely primarily on fossil fuels and emit proportionally large amounts of greenhouse gases per capita. COP25 in Madrid So, what was COP25 meant to achieve - which took place in Madrid earlier this month - and what did it actually achieve? The main aims of the climate conference were to finalize the rules by which the Paris targets are achieved and begin the processes by which the commitments made in December 2015 could be systematically raised. There were also a host of technical matters related to carbon markets, as well as details on how poorer countries would be compensated for climate-related damage. The achievements of the COP25 summit could only be classified as decisions, not achievements. They were mainly to do with initiatives to foster mitigation and adaptation relating to oceans and land; funding for the repair of damage and loss to help poor countries that are suffering from the effects of climate change - although there was no allocation of new funds to do so; periodic review of the long-term 2-degree target starting in 2020; and establishing a few rules to do with carbon markets. But many questions and issues remained unanswered, unresolved and left for future meetings. The agenda for the next conference (COP26) in November 2020, to be hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy, will once again be filled with ambition and promise, and circular discussions. I know this is going to sound somewhat cynical, maybe very cynical to some, but my summary of the COP processes, so far, can be summarized as follows: Meeting 1: Let's all get together and talk about this problem of global warming and climate change. many meetings later Meeting: Different countries seem to have different viewpoints and problems, so these meetings are really useful to get some consensus. Meeting: Let's agree to do something positive. a few meetings later Meeting: We're getting somewhere, why don't developed countries help developing countries and get credit for doing this (Kyoto). a few meetings later Don't get me wrong, there has been considerable progress made all around the world on the installation of large, renewable energy generation systems, and this has meant some improvement in balancing economic development of countries that are still catching up with the highly-industrialized nations. But, in reality, such progress hasn't been adequate. So, back to our analogy. While the travellator continues to take the world backward in terms of emissions reductions, global action is limited to meetings, targets and pledges. \</doc>

Donald Trumpsays he spoke toPrince Charlesfor around 90 minutes including a long exchange onclimate changewhen the pair met on the first day of his visit. The Prince of Wales had earlier greeted the US President at Buckingham Palace one year after he reportedly snubbed him during his last visit. The pair have had differing views on the environment which the billionaire addressed in a wide-ranging interview with Piers Morgan onGood Morning Britain. The broadcaster asked the 72-year-old president if he believes in climate change. To which, Trump insisted he had spoken to Prince Charles at great length about it and what can be done. "What he really wants and what he feels strongly about is the future.\~He wants the best climate for the future. He wants a good climate and not a disaster.

Chile has pulled out of hosting two major international summits, including a UN climate change conference, amid anti-government protests. President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era said the decision "caused him a lot of pain" but his government needed "to prioritise reestablishing public order". The COP25 climate summit was originally set for December, while the Apec trade summit was next month. The UN said it was now "exploring alternative options". Chile's decision comes amid global climate protests, including strikes led by activist Greta Thunberg last month. As the news was announced, a US-based organisation separately revealed millions more people are at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise within the next century than previously thought. Meanwhile, it was hoped the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum - due to be held in Santiago from November 15-17 - would help ease tensions between the US and China. White House officials said US President Donald Trump had been planning to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at Apec, to discuss a possible trade deal. The two nations have been locked in an escalating trade war for some 18 months. At least 20 people have been killed since the mass protests in Chile began. While many protests were peaceful there were also deadly incidents of arson and looting, as well as violent clashes between the security forces and protesters. \</doc>

There has been a surge of interest in transatlantic voyages as travellers try to avoid "flight shame" and emulate the climate activist Greta Thunberg's carbon-neutral sailing trips. Ms Thunberg, 16, arrived in Madrid yesterday for the start of the UN climate conference. She had disembarked in Lisbon after a 21-day crossing from Chile on a sailing yacht. The conference, known as Cop25 , had been moved from Santiago after civil unrest there. Mobbed by the media on arrival after taking an overnight train from Lisbon, she gave a press conference at which she said: "The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power." In the evening she joined thousands of protesters marching through the centre of Madrid. British travel agents have said that interest in sea crossings rose four months ago when Ms Thunberg sailed from Plymouth to New York on a carbon-neutral racing yacht to attend the UN general assembly. Kevin Griffin, managing director of the Cruise People, a UK travel agency specialising in sea journeys, said: "More and more people cite their concern for the environment when booking sea passages." Transatlantic cargo bookings had risen by 10 per cent on last year, he said, and "the demand for cross-Atlantic passages for Cop25 came from zero to several dozen on routes to Chile ... we couldn't fulfil all the demand". Since last year his company has offered berths on a weekly Atlantic Container Line service, which can take about 600 passengers a year in each direction. European fares are (EURO)937.50 per person each way to Canada and (EURO)1,225 each way to the US. The journeys take nine days from Liverpool to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and 11 days to New York. "A cargo ship can only sail in a day as far as a plane can travel in an hour, creating a lot of hotel nights on board," Mr Griffin said. However, opinion is divided on how much better for the environment it is to travel by cargo ship. Tristan Smith, an expert in low-carbon shipping at University College London, said that a passenger's CO2 footprint was difficult to calculate because it depended on whether emissions were allocated to the voyage's primary purpose - freight transport - or, if not, how the emissions were shared. "I would tend to argue that the passengers should have no or a very minimal share of the CO2 responsibility and this would make this a low carbon way to travel," he said. Steve Fletcher, professor of ocean policy and economy at the University of Portsmouth, said that if it were treated as a country international shipping would have been the sixth biggest emitter of energy-related CO2 in 2015, just above Germany. Professor Fletcher said sailing was the most obvious zeroemission form of travel, and increasingly feasible with online services matching private owners with travellers. VoyageVert in the UK plans to create a fleet of sailing vessels to accommodate up to 200 passengers. Ross Porter, its director, said: "Since Greta sailed to the US there has been a big upsurge of interest." However, he acknowledged that demand far outstrips availability and that sailing has its difficulties with speed and comfort. Ms Thunberg's journey from Plymouth to New York took 15 days and the yacht she travelled on, the Malizia II, is a specialised racer with hydrofoils that lift her out of the water and help her to reach 37 knots. Professor Fletcher said this was "significantly faster than the typical sail time of three to four weeks, but that's still not for anyone in a rush". Following Ms Thunberg's example, 36 young activists set sail from Amsterdam on October 2 to make the 5,000 nautical mile voyage to Chile on the Regina Maris. When the summit was moved they were left stranded. \</doc>

ONE of the stories making headlines last week was the unlikely showdown at Davos between Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg. If there was ever any doubt that climate change was firmly on the global policy agenda, the clash between the US president and the teenage climate campaigner will have surely eradicated them. The international effort to combat climate change will feel closer to home later this year, when the United Nations Climate Change conference , COP26, arrives in Glasgow. An event that will put Scotland centre stage on a generation-defining challenge. And why not? Scotland should, in theory, be in a position to lead the world on this issue. Both the Scottish and UK governments have committed to targets to reduce emissions, albeit at different rates. However new fuel poverty statistics released this week revealed the scale of the challenge we face when it comes to reaching net zero emissions. The Scottish House Conditions Survey (SHCS) showed more than 600,000 homes in fuel poverty. This is when a household is spending more than 10 per cent of their income after housing costs on fuel bills. What's more, one in 10 of our households spent more than 20%. At Citizens Advice Scotland we back net zero, but believe it is now time to move beyond warm words to a clear plan of action that protects those consumers who are on the lowest incomes. After all, one of the biggest challenges in meeting Scotland's new climate targets will be reducing emissions from our homes. While the path for doing this remains uncertain, it will likely require that many of us change the way we heat our homes and the way we use energy. But to achieve this, policymakers need to understand the realities of how people live day-to-day and the reasons why they consume energy as they do. Particularly those on low incomes. Citizens Advice Bureaux see this up close, with people coming through our doors every day who are deep in debt to their energy supplier or are having to choose between heating their home or putting food on the table. To such a family, meeting Scotland's climate change targets are frankly not top of their priority list. It's true that changing their energy behaviour could help some people reduce their fuel bills, but it's not that simple. Many of them are caught in a trap of low incomes, cold, draughty properties, and expensive heat sources. Electric-only heating, for example, which is becoming lower and lower in carbon emissions, is four times as expensive per unit as gas heating, and the SHCS this week revealed that fuel poverty rose by 5% between 2017-18 among those who use electric-only heating. This group tends to include the poorest people in our communities, and because many of them are renting their homes they are not in a position to change their heating source - even if they could afford to. Similarly, new low-carbon technologies, such as heat pumps, could help reduce the costs of heating a home with electricity, but these are expensive to install and they would not be appropriate for all households. So while in an ideal world emissions and fuel poverty should reduce hand in hand, the reality is that we need to be bold and creative in making this actually happen. For example, we believe that significantly increasing energy bills for those already struggling to pay, in order to fund emission reductions in other areas, would be unacceptable. That's why as a first step we are calling on the Scottish Government to double spending on energy efficiency in the upcoming Scottish Budget. There are three principle reasons for this - it'll help reduce emissions from homes, it'll make homes easier to heat and see bills fall for some, and it will lay the foundations for the big changes we need to see to reduce emissions from domestic heating. In the meantime, we will do our bit by continuing to ensure that consumers have the advice and the support they need to cut their emissions and their bills. Our Big Energy Saving Week campaign, co-designed with communities across Scotland, targets four at-risk consumer groups: people with electric-only heating, those in hard-to-heat homes, those in fuel debt and those unable to access online tariffs and support. Having given advice to fuel poverty households for years, these were the four groups we identify as facing significant challenges in the energy market, and they will continue to need support during a transition to a zero-carbon emissions economy. All across Scotland this week, Citizens Advice Bureaux has been reaching out in their local communities to ensure people are getting advice and support on energy. And that support will of course continue throughout the year. The imagery of Davos on our TV screens may seem like a different world, but in fact we all share the same one. We need to ensure policymakers keep their decisions rooted in what's best for our communities. Dr Jamie Stewart is head of the Fair Markets policy team at Citizens Advice Scotland \</doc>

Swedish climate-change activist Greta Thunberg has been named Time's Person of the Year. The 16-year-old has "succeeded in turning vague anxieties about the planet into a worldwide movement calling for global change", the magazine wrote in its announcement yesterday. In an extended feature, it added: "She is an ordinary teenage girl who, in summoning the courage to speak truth to power, became the icon of a generation." Greta set off a wave of protests in opposition to man-made climate change with her Friday school strikes. The Time accolade was announced as she accused world leaders of seeking to burnish their images, rather than taking strong action to curb global warming. Speaking at the UN's COP25 climate-change summit in Madrid, she said: "The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR. "It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition." Politicians at the conference are hashing out the implementation of 2015's Paris Agreement, which is designed to limit warming. On Wednesday, negotiators in Madrid had one eye on Brussels, where the EU announced the European Green Deal - a new plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions. Svenja Schulze, Germany's environment minister, said she hoped the deal would "give the discussions here [in Madrid] a boost". Additional reporting by agencies \</doc>

IF there's anything that makes you feel bad about your environmental choices, it's sharing your home for a week with a Swede. This, incidentally, is all perception on my part, rather than anything the Swede said or did. But my friend from Malm\'f6 came to stay for a week and, in my mind, she merged with Greta Thunberg to be a much better version of humanity than I am. Last year I counted up the number of flights I had taken and came to the appalled realisation that I had been on 31 flights in 2019. That's unacceptable. Two of them were to Malm\'f6 and back and I was glad that Miss Thunberg was travelling by sea at the time because I didn't want to bump into her and have to explain myself to the teenage environmental campaigner. I couldn't explain myself - I had no good excuses. At the end of the wax wrap's lifespan it is fully compostable. And I felt virtuous having these in the house as my Swedish friend also has them in her home. The thing that really struck me, though, was how often my friends and I use our cars. Six of us got together in Finnieston one evening and five of the six drove there in our personal cars - the sixth was my guest. For every festive event, a flurry of text messages went back and forth asking who was driving and who wanted to carpool. In Sweden, none of my friend's friends have cars and this really preyed on my mind. All the wax wraps in the world are not going to balance out my car use. COP26, the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference , is coming to the city later this year and it cannot be over-emphasised how important the event is for the city. All eyes will be on Glasgow. It's a time, also, for residents to think about how they live and what impact their choices have on the environment. The SNP-led administration is very much trying to push us in the right direction by making changes to how we can use our cars in the city centre. Introducing a low emissions zone is part of this. So is bringing in Sunday parking. Tackling car use requires two things, though - for people to buy in to it and for the alternatives to be there so that they do. I talk a big game about car use. I cycle to work and to the city centre if I'm coming in for any reason other than shopping. But am I in denial about my car use? Probably. Or I'll drive to Glasgow Fort where I can park for free rather than pay to park in town, thus damaging the environment and the local high street. Being environmentally conscious has become fashionable and it has become important to businesses to be seen to be caring about their carbon footprint. But, because this is capitalism and capitalism rarely really cares about anything but cash, an industry has sprung up to help us consume more stuff in the name of helping the planet. Just at the time when it's vital we live lightly and have fewer things, "caring consumerism" is giving us carte blanche to buy more things and pretending we're on the side of right. So, you can replace your plastic lunch box with a bamboo lunchbox. Or you can buy a water container made of metal and plastics recycled from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Buy, buy, buy and still feel good about yourself in the morning. Except, you'd be better keeping your original plastic lunch box and making sure you actually use it. Or reusing your initial water bottle until it becomes absolutely necessary to buy a new one. We need to be smarter, make sure we are well informed about our choices and not get sucked in by the promise of shiny new things. Unless you're Donald Trump - and if you are, hiya! - you know that climate change is a global emergency. Australia, where I was born and grew up, is literally on fire. The disaster is happening now. It seems ludicrous when people are being killed, homes destroyed and wildlife on the brink of extinction to worry about losing the convenience of driving to the shops. It is time for everyone to make big changes - and to put pressure on the politicians and corporations that can make vital structural changes. COP26 is an opportunity for Glasgow we should all use. \</doc>

Key View Real economic activity in Chile will contract in Q419 and remain weak through H120 due to widespread protests against inequality and the cost of living that have caused severe economic disruptions. Despite significant monetary and fiscal stimulus, uncertainty will weigh on investment and higher unemployment will drag down private consumption. At Fitch Solutions, we have revised down our real GDP forecast for 2019 and 2020 to 1.0% y-o-y and 1.1% respectively, from 2.1% y-o-y and 2.9% previously. Real GDP growth will likely contract in Q419, with an increased probability that Chile enters a technical recession as economic disruptions and uncertainty persist through H120 . The largest protests in Chile since it transitioned to democracy in 1990 have caused significant destruction of transport infrastructure, curtailed the hours of operation for businesses and generated significant property damage. Over the coming months, we expect the disurptions caused by the protests will lead to a sharp decline in economic acitivty. The contraction has been concentrated in retail and service sectors, with retail sales falling 12.1% y-o-y in October and the hotel industry suffering from the cancellation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leader's summit and the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Social Upheaval Significantly Weakens Growth Outlook {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - PP Contribution To Real GDP Growth, y-o-y {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell f = Fitch Solutions forecast. Source: BCC, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell The protests have reversed the economic rebound of Q319, with monthly economic activity falling from 3.0% y-o-y in September to -3.4% in October. October's print was the worst since Chile's 2009 recession and underscores the severe impact that the 'social outburst', which began on October 18, has had on economic activity. Protests Will Drag Down Confidence {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - Business And Consumer Confidence {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Source: BCC, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell . Business and consumer confidence have weakened since the outbreak of political unrest, which will undermine consumption and investment over the coming quarters. Unemployment will also drag down consumption. We expect unemployment will rise from 7.0% in October to over 10.0% in H120, approaching highs not seen since the global financial crisis. Economic Disruptions Of Unrest Will Continue Through H120 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - Monthly Economic Activity, % y-o-y {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Source: BCC, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Uncertainty surrounding political stability and Chile's economic outlook will also lead to a contraction in investment. In a survey conducted by the BCC after the demonstrations began, a majority of businesses that had planned on making investments in 2020 are now re-evaluating their plans. We expect the substantial depreciation of the Chilean peso (CLP) will further deter investment, as the weaker peso will drive up the cost of capital inputs. However, we expect low interest rates and strong investment in the mining sector, which has been less affected by the social unrest, will limit the contraction in investment. Monetary and fiscal stimulus will limit the slowdown in 2020 . On December 2, Finance Minister Ignacio Briones announced a USD5.5bn stimulus that will boost public investment and provide support for small- and medium-sized enterprises. We expect the stimulus to pass before end-2019 given the widespread political consensus surrounding the need to address protestors' demands and reboot the economy after the social outburst. In addition, on December 3 President Sebastian Pinera unveiled a USD160mn transfer to low income families to bolster consumption in the coming month. Overall, we project government expenditures to increase 10.0% y-o-y in 2020. Loose Financial Conditions Will Limit Slowdown {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - Average Nominal Lending Rate & Monetary Policy Rate {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Source: BCC, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell The BCC has cut its benchmark monetary policy rate by 125 basis points (bps) during 2019 to support growth after an H119 slowdown. Given our forecast that the BCC will carry out an additional 25bps of easing in 2020, we expect financial conditions will remain loose throughout 2020. However, the BCC held monetary policy steady at its December 4 meeting to prevent a further weakening of the CLP. The BCC's hold underscores to the rising importance of fiscal policy in the effort to limit the economic slowdown caused by the recent social upheaval. Sustained protests and slowing growth in China pose downside risks to growth in Chile in 2020 and 2021 . At Fitch Solutions, our core view is that the agreement between opposition leaders and the government to hold a plebiscite on reforming the constitution will quell much of the political unrest. However, if politicians fail to deliver on the rest of protestors' demands, including reforms to the pension, health care and police system, Chile may see significant demonstrations resume, driving more uncertainty and weakening consumption. In addition, elevated trade tensions between the US and China increase the probability for a more pronounced slowdown in Chinese economic activity in 2020. Should Chinese growth slow dramatically, the ability of Chilean exports to mitigate weakening economic activity would be greatly reduced. \</doc>

The Grand Tour has come under fire many times before, with presenters Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May receiving their fair share of backlash after some of their jokes in the show were deemed offensive. Will Young slammed the show earlier this year as being "homophobic" and "bigoted", even prompting Jeremy Clarkson to offer an apology. However, Richard Hammond has now claimed the trio have nothing to apologise for.

The UK Government has added its voice to the widespread disappointment over the United Nations discussions on the climate crisis which ended in compromise and frustration. Lengthy talks in Madrid ended on Sunday with polluters resisting calls to increase efforts to minimise global heating and negotiators delaying debate about rules for international carbon markets for another year. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ``disappointed'' by the final declaration, which cited an ``urgent need'' to cut greenhouses gases in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. But the outcome fell short of explicitly demanding countries to propose bolder emissions plans next year, in accordance with environmentalists and developing countries' demands. The UK thanked Chile's efforts in the Cop25 talks but expressed its frustration at the result. ``Tackling climate change is one of the most urgent issues we face and we are extremely grateful for the tireless efforts of the Chilean Cop presidency to reach an agreement, in challenging circumstances in Madrid,'' a UK Government spokesman said. ``It is disappointing talks did not move as far or as fast at the UK had hoped. ``There is still much more to do and we are determined to increase the momentum and drive even more ambitious climate action at next year's talks in Glasgow.'' \</doc>

With reference to your https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks report on the COP25 climate talks in Madrid (13 December), we have just returned from Madrid, where we displayed a large banner saying "War causes climate change and climate change causes war". Thousands of passing delegates expressed a great interest in, and approval of, the message. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks Scientists for Global Responsibility Perhaps this absence can be explained by the fact that military-related emissions have been excluded by some of the largest polluters from the global north whose delegates, as government officials, will naturally avoid jeopardising lucrative arms and military aid contracts, and whose people do not suffer the catastrophic wars and climatic devastation that directly affect the global south. Evidently we cannot rely on government negotiators to address the subject of war and militarism. We have to stop believing that war is inevitable and accept that international climate finance offers better value in both resolving conflict and sustaining the environment than the equivalent spent on military operations. Hilary EvansMovement for the Abolition of WarDavid CollinsVeterans for Peace UK I was delighted to see Greta Thunberg announced as Time magazine's person of the year ( HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks Report , 12 December). For me, after so many years of campaigning on environmental issues, it has been a huge relief that now, in 2019, the future of the planet has finally entered the political mainstream - and not a moment too soon. This is thanks, in no small part, to the vision and actions of Greta herself, but also to those many others whom she has inspired to take up the fight. The world is realising the scale of the threat posed by every aspect of our destructive exploitation of our lovely planet. Now we need to see some real political leadership so that the leading nations of the world, our own included, can ensure a real revolution in practice, to match the fiery ambitions that have been lit up in our hearts by this inspirational Swedish teenager. Catherine RowettGreenparty MEP, East of England I'm writing in reference to your use of the term "global heating". I understand the motivation is probably to draw attention to the fact that we are actively changing the climate, a laudable goal. However, the term should be used correctly. In an article about the disappointing results of the COP25 climate negotiations ( HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks Discord at climate talks branded a betrayal , 16 December) it was noted that: "Experts say more ambitious emissions cuts are needed globally if the Paris pledge to hold global heating to no more than 2C is to be met." However, heating involves a change in energy and is measured in joules. Warming, on the other hand, is a change in temperature and is measured in degrees celsius. So "global warming" would have been more apt here. I know that climate change deniers, some of whom have some knowledge of physics, keep a lookout for inconsistencies like this. Better not to give them any extra ammunition. Keep up the good environmental reporting - I'm a fan.

Key View At Fitch Solutions we maintain our view that declining exports and weak private consumption will weigh on Chile's economic rebound over the coming quarters. However, we have downwardly revised our 2019 forecast from 2.8% y-o-y to 2.1%, and our 2020 forecast from 3.1% to 2.9%, given our expectation that recent unrest in Chile will weaken investment, private consumption and exports. Continued protests and an escalation in the US-China trade dispute pose downside risks to Chile's economic outlook. Nationwide protests in October have led us to downwardly revise our 2019 and 2020 real GDP growth forecasts for Chile . Previously, we had expected that despite sluggish exports and private consumption, solid investment growth would strengthen economic activity in H219, after real GDP growth grew by just 1.8% in H119. However, a massive bout of social unrest, which began on October 18 in response to a hike in subway fares in Santiago, has cost businesses an estimated USD1.4bn, sparked a number of strikes and severely damaged Santiago's public transit system. We expect the protests to weigh on real GDP growth for several quarters due to deteriorating investor sentiment. Political Unrest To Weigh On H219 Rebound {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Chile - Monthly Economic Activity, % y-o-y {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Source: BCC, Fitch Solutions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell At Fitch Solutions, we expect the protests to continue for several more weeks, and, while not our core view, we have noted the rising possibility of significant structural changes to the Chilean economy. Although our core view is that business-friendly economic policies will persist, we expect investors to remain on the sidelines until after the political unrest subsides. In addition, President Sebastian Pinera has abandoned a proposed tax reform that would have supported investment by allowing investors to deduct corporate taxes from their personal income taxes. Gross fixed capital formation grew by 4.0% y-o-y in H119, but will likely slow significantly in Q419 and Q120.

We expect sporadic work stoppages at Chilean mines will undermine copper export growth, which we already expected to slow due to weak prices. In the year through August, copper production had declined by 0.4% y-o-y, while copper exports have fallen by 1.7%. In addition, Pinera's cancellation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings on November 16 and 17 and the United Nations Climate Change Conference from December 2 to December 13 will undercut services exports as the hotel industry will miss out on significant revenues.We also expect private consumption to be damaged by the protests. A number of regions in Chile were under a curfew for nearly two weeks, and many supermarkets were closed to prevent looting. Before the protests, unemployment had risen to 7.0% in September, up from 6.7% in December 2018, while consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in Q319 since Q209. In the medium term, we expect the protests will dissipate given the ample room to increase social spending and diffuse nature of the protests . While hardline protestors will likely endure for months, Chile's middle class, who have been critical to the mass demonstrations, will likely stop protesting if adequate increase increases in social spending are put forward. Given that Chile has substantial fiscal space and Pinera relies on centre-left opposition parties to pass legislation, we expect the social agenda he proposed on October 22 will be considerably expanded in the coming weeks. Furthermore, we believe the lack of cohesion between the protestors and the opposition parties will prevent protests from putting sustained pressure on the government in the medium term.However, we note significant risks to this view. In particular, we can see a scenario in which political polarization in Chile prevents Pinera from satisfying protestors' demands. Notably, demonstrators have called for expanding the pension system, reducing the tax burden on the poor and improving healthcare and education for low and middle-income individuals. These demands, which centre-right parties have historically been opposed to, will require the kind of compromises on major policy initiatives that Chile's Congress has failed to reach in recent years. Should protestors view the government's response as insufficient, the peaceful demonstrations seen in the past week could relapse into violence, undercutting economic activity.At the same time, Chilean growth remains exposed to an escalation in the US-China trade dispute. If the two sides fail to compromise, or even increase tariff levels, then we would expect growth in China, which received nearly a third of Chile's exports in 2018, to slow even further. Weaker growth in China would drag down Chilean exports, which would likely weigh on private consumption through increased unemployment and lead to a decline in investment. \</doc>

31st Jan 2020 - 9:53am EQ Investors signs up to climate-change investing pact Submitted 31/01/2020 - 9:53am Wealth manager EQ Investors (EQ) has joined Climate Action 100+, the world's largest group of investors by assets pressuring companies to act on climate change. The initiative is aimed at pushing the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change. \~ Launched in 2017, Climate Action 100+ is a group of more than 370 institutional investors that represents around USD41 trillion in assets. The group pressures fossil fuel producers and other companies responsible for two-thirds of annual global industrial emissions to show how they will reduce carbon dioxide pollution. It has successfully pressured oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP to set targets to reduce emissions and disclose more data. \~ EQ's Head of Impact Investing, Damien Lardoux, says: \€  Joining Climate Action 100+ is a natural progression of the work we have done as a company. Evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we'd encourage more companies to develop climate strategies in line with the 2016 Paris Agreement.\€ \~ The EQ Positive Impact Portfolios invest in companies with lower operational carbon footprints and those that are leaders in the global green transition. \~ In a further move to lead on climate change. EQ has also committed to accelerate the reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2030, 20 years ahead of the targets set in the Paris Agreement. More than 500 B Corps made the commitment at the annual UN climate conference, COP25 , held in Madrid in December. Tags \</doc>

Some climate campaigners are already sailing to Chile to take part in the United Nations' 25th Conference of the Parties, so the summit's cancellation due to unrest in the country is a big problem - and not just for them, writes Dr Richard Dixon. Last week we had the shock news that the Chilean government was no longer willing to host the UN climate conference in the capital Santiago in early December. The mass civil unrest, protesting against the growing inequalities being driven by President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era's policies, made the country too unstable to safely hold a huge international conference. This is the second country to drop out of hosting the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ). Brazil bid for and won the right to host the two-week event but when President Jair Bolsonaro came to power, he seemed more interested in burning the Amazon to make way for loggers, soy farmers and cattle ranchers, and so refused to organise the COP. Big changes of plan have happened before. At the end of 2000, COP6 in the Hague failed to reach a conclusion and everyone had to come back together in Bonn in the summer of 2001 for COP6.5', with the normal annual COP7 in Marrakech at the end of the year. READ MORE: Climate change: Five billion people at risk within 30 years, experts warn READ MORE: Champagne under threat as climate change begins to take hold But there has never had to be a complete rethink just five weeks before the conference is due to start. Within a few days, the Spanish government had stepped in to say they would host the summit in Madrid on the same dates, an offer the UN was very pleased to accept. Imagine you suddenly found you had to organise a conference for 30,000 official delegates, including 200 world leaders and many hundreds of media people from around the world, plus all the other people who will come to town because there is a COP on, in less than five weeks. Campaigners unable to attend It is great that Spain has volunteered. But for many, this is a disaster. There are already people sailing to Chile, making a point about the huge carbon emissions of flying en route. There is a full People's Summit in Chile, which would have heard from scientists and activists coming from the COP who will now not be there. There are many logistical complications, including tens of thousands of pounds in hotel deposits that many never be returned. For those coming from all over the world from groups like Friends of the Earth, these events are always attended on a shoestring, usually booking travel with no refund options because it is the cheapest. For our colleagues from outside the EU, there is the immediate problem of getting a visa to enter Spain in such a short time, despite offers of help from the UN organisers. And if you were clever enough to book your accommodation months in advance in cheap Santiago, you won't be getting the same kind of deal in expensive Madrid. There will be many people representing communities and campaign groups who will now not make it to COP25 . It is great that the COP will still go ahead, but civil society, particularly those from Latin America, will be much less well represented than usual so some elements of the negotiations will be less developed, and this will mean there will be more work to do in Glasgow.

AS world leaders and climate ambassadors continue to discuss the need for urgent climate action at COP25 , the National Farmers' Union is calling for the next government to develop climate policy that empowers British farmers to reach their ambition of net zero agriculture by 2040. In its General Election manifesto, the NFU emphasises the crucial role the future government has to play in creating a policy environment that incentivises farm businesses to reduce their impact on our climate and collectively work towards net zero agriculture. NFU president Minette Batters, pictured, said: "British farmers are already producing some of the most sustainable food in the world and we want to do even more. But we cannot achieve net zero without government investment. "Any measures farmers take towards net zero will require investment and significant changes, and we need the future government to create policy which ensures these steps are not only right for the environment, but right for our businesses too. "With the appropriate research and a range of incentives to help farmers improve productive efficiency, increase carbon capture and boost renewable energy, we can build on our work producing high quality, sustainable food for the nation. "British farmers are part of the solution to the climate crisis. "We have a huge opportunity in this country to be pioneers in climate-friendly food production. "We have the ambition - we just need the right policy to support us." \</doc>

Torch Vichet, the head ranger, rides pillion on the lead bike with a rifle balanced on one hip. About halfway to the station, he calls for a halt: a few paces from the track, a dipterocarp tree, nearly a metre in diameter, has been felled. Its base is sheared cleanly, the upper reaches half-buried in the undergrowth. The midsection has been cut into rings and dragged away. As the patrol stops to examine the scene, Torch Vichet is visibly shocked. Most of the station\' s rangers had been out of the forest the previous night, attending a colleague\' s wedding in the provincial capital of Stung Treng. In the few hours they were away, loggers had entered the protected area with chain saws and brazenly harvested the tree. One of south-east Asia\' s last remaining evergreen woodlands, Prey Lang\' s 430,000 hectares sprawl across four Cambodian provinces. The ecosystem has been under threat for decades, but the country\' s economic lurch forward has accelerated the destruction, as roads reached deeper into the reserve and foreign markets  mainly China and Vietnam  opened up, hungry for cash crops and timber.  People just think this is an economic opportunity, and if you\' re far from the rangers, the land is cheap, says Naven Hon, a researcher with the US environment organisation Conservation International, who has worked for years in Prey Lang. Huge areas of land have been illegally claimed. The rangers tasked with stopping the encroachment often lack equipment, training, transportation  and, with wages as low as $50 per month, motivation. But for the rangers at Spong and elsewhere in Stung Treng Province, that is finally changing. Since 2018, their wages have shot up ninefold. They have motorbikes and the fuel to power them, training, GPS devices and new outposts. They can measure the success of their efforts by the mouldering piles of confiscated chain saws, snares, nets and rifles that fill the storerooms of their stations and the environment ministry.  It is happening slowly, Torch Vichet says.  But we are winning. Remarkably, the rangers\' equipment upgrades and their jump in pay have mostly been bankrolled by a private company, the giant Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co. The three-year project, overseen by Conservation International, is not philanthropic. It is an investment. If it succeeds in slowing the destruction of Prey Lang, it will generate carbon credits, which Mitsui will then be able to sell on the Japanese market. Mitsui\' s funding is the tip of an iceberg. Billions of dollars are poised to flow into carbon offset over the next few years, as growing recognition of a global failure to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, despite the threat of catastrophic climate change, drives a renaissance in the market. All across south-east Asia, the Nikkei Asian Review spoke to conservation organisations that have been offered funding from companies ranging from oil majors to automakers, tech companies to theme park operators. All are looking to gain access to carbon credits, whether to meet their own climate change pledges, to absolve themselves in the eyes of their customers, or to get ahead of the emissions regulations that many believe are inevitable. And forests are the best way to generate credits, fast.  Forest carbon is where the volume is, says Jim Procanik, co-founder of InfiniteEarth, which operates the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve in Indonesia.  If market-based conservation is proven to work, the amount of money that could be unleashed into the market is huge. . .We\' re seeing people coming to the market looking to lock up millions and millions of tons. Bacchanalia The carbon market has had a false dawn before. In the toppy, pre-financial crisis years of 2007 and 2008, markets and industry became convinced that cap-and-trade rules on carbon emissions were imminent. Analysts  experts in a market that, until that point, had barely existed  breathlessly predicted surging prices and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of credits changing hands. Hedge funds and other speculators bought in. Projects, some legitimate, some less so, proliferated.  There was some bacchanalia stuff going on back then. Cargill was setting up a trading desk. Shell was forming their trading desk. Deutsche Bank had a trading desk. It was going huge, says Gabriel Eickhoff, chief executive of Lestari Capital, a Singapore-based company that links companies to conservation projects.  You could buy carbon credits from anybody off the street, it seemed like. No matter who you ran into in a hotel lobby, someone was doing carbon credits. It didn\' t last. The market was new, poorly understood, poorly regulated and lacked the proper frameworks to validate, price and trade offsets. Negotiators at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit could not reach a new agreement on carbon markets. The credit crisis, and subsequent global recession  incidentally, the only time this century that greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen year on year  put an end to the fervour. As negotiators met last week for the United Nations\' climate conference in Madrid, many of those problems had still not been solved. The Paris Agreement, the landmark 2015 treaty that committed countries to cutting their emissions and keeping global heating to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, does include a pledge  Article 6  to establish an international carbon market. Four years on, however, the actual mechanism has not been negotiated, and there is still very little consensus on how it should work. On a broader scale, though, what has changed is that nothing has changed. Continued inaction on carbon emissions is pushing the planet ever closer to crisis, say multiple high-level organisations, and has made mitigating the worst effects of climate change considerably more costly. The planet is already halfway to the 2C threshold  above which scientists predict catastrophic impacts  while emissions have continued to rise at an average of 1.5 per cent a year this decade. To prevent 2C of heating, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that global net carbon emissions have to fall to 80 per cent of 2010 levels by 2035, and all the way to zero by 2075. At current levels, the UN says, global emissions now need to be reduced by 7.6 per cent per year from now until 2030.  The lack of progress on climate change 10 years ago now means that we need to act twice as fast, and cut emissions twice as fast, says Leo Roberts, senior research officer at London-based think tank Overseas Development Institute. Faced with rising public anger about this failure to act, several countries, including G-20 nations France, Germany, Italy and the UK, have passed, or are in the process of passing, laws mandating that they must achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Japan has committed to an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 and carbon neutrality at the  earliest opportunity thereafter. And although the US is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, six states and territories, including California, its wealthiest state, are aiming for net-zero by 2050. Carbon pricing and carbon markets are included in most national strategies as a way to compel companies to act. Forty-six countries now have pricing or trading schemes in operation or scheduled to begin, covering around 20 per cent of global emissions. Companies  even entire industries  are setting their own targets. In September, We Mean Business, a group of major international companies with a combined market capitalisation of more than $2.3tn, including Nestle, L\' Oreal, Danone, Ikea and Nokia, committed to reaching net-zero emissions no later than 2050. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the UN agency for civil aviation, agreed to cap the sector\' s net emissions at 2020 levels. The scheme, Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or Corsia, means that all future growth in the industry  whose passenger numbers are expected to almost double to 8.2bn by 2037  will need to happen without generating any additional net greenhouse gases. Commercial air travel is responsible for 2 per cent of all global carbon emissions. Reaching net-zero through emissions cuts would mean fundamental shifts in business models and technology for many businesses, particularly in heavy industry, transportation and energy. As the emissions data shows, those transitions have barely begun, meaning that, to achieve net-zero, companies need to focus on the other side of the carbon equation: offsets. The scale of this could be staggering. Analysts estimate that Corsia alone will require offsets equivalent to 2.6bn tons of carbon between 2021 and 2035. In 2016, the total amount of carbon traded on voluntary markets worldwide was less than 65m tons, according to Ecosystem Marketplace.  I haven\' t seen the level of interest and engagement in the carbon space since 2008. But it\' s more sober now, Lestari\' s Mr Eickhoff says. Much of that excitement is directed at forests.  When you look at the cost of abatement curve, the cheapest, highest-impact [offsets] come from the forestry sector in tropical areas. Keeping forests standing, restoring and replanting them is the most effective way to sequester carbon at scale. Forests and other natural landscapes sequester  draw down from the atmosphere  more than 11 gigatons of CO2 per year, nearly twice the total carbon emissions of the US. Projects such as Prey Lang can generate credits under a UN mechanism called  reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+. The amount of credits is calculated using the differential between the national rate of deforestation and the rate in the conservation area. The more the project beats the spread, the more credits it generates. Private sector interest in REDD+ projects is spiking. InfiniteEarth\' s Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, spanning some 65,000 hectares of peatland rainforest in central Kalimantan, has sold carbon credits to Microsoft, insurance giants Allianz and Zurich, and to State Street Bank and Trust. Since this summer, demand has spiked fourfold, according to Mr Procanik. US technology company Salesforce.com has bought  blue carbon from Worldview International Foundation\' s mangrove restoration projects in Myanmar; in Cambodia, the Wildlife Conservation Society has sold credits generated from a project in the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary to multinational companies. Lestari, which runs a platform that allows palm oil companies to buy into reforestation projects, is now working on a similar one to aggregate demand for carbon, with interest from the oil and gas industry. And the market\' s long slump means that demand far outstrips supply. Currently, only around $100m per year goes into  nature-based carbon projects via the voluntary markets. Just one company, the oil major Shell, has said that it will invest $300m into forest carbon in the next three years. It was this desire for scale that drew Mitsui  whose core business revolves around trading in energy and minerals  to Prey Lang. Daiki Sato, general manager of Mitsui\' s NexGen Energy department, which made the investment, told Nikkei that the  co-benefits  the social and biodiversity outcomes from the project  and the opportunity to buy carbon at volume outweighed its relatively complex economics.  There could be more moving parts than in a typical project, but right now, the amount of carbon offsets that could potentially be generated from what we are doing in Prey Lang is fairly sizable, he said. Mitsui is looking for other, similar projects, in the knowledge that Japanese companies may well struggle to meet their emissions ambitions and will have to turn to offsets.  When you go near 2030 or maybe mid-2020s, there could be some limitations in reducing more greenhouse gases, Mr Sato says.  And Mitsui would like to be one of the solution providers in those situations. Devil\' s bargain On the trunk roads running south from Stung Treng toward Cambodia\' s capital of Phnom Penh, sawn timber is hauled on trucks and on trailers hooked to motorbikes. Tipper trucks are piled with cassava. Wherever the roads touch the forest, cash crops have sprung up, with ordered lines of cashew, mango and rubber trees replacing the natural chaos. Here, the boundaries between legal and illegal trade are murky. Timber taken from protected areas is laundered into international supply chains; mining companies have been granted exploration licenses within the nature reserve. The temptation to take quick and easy money is everywhere.  I think the biggest challenge is having a long-term viewpoint. What we\' re trying to do takes a long time, says Srabani Roy, Conservation International\' s regional director for the Greater Mekong.  It\' s not like mining or infrastructure development, where you sign a contract and you get an immediate payout right there. Many within the conservation movement acknowledge the irony of allowing market forces, which have often driven deforestation, to fund the fightback, and of relying on the budding altruism of some of the world\' s largest polluters. There is also the question of whether a market structure, which could be volatile and driven by speculation, can really provide the kind of funding that complex and sensitive conservation projects need.  From a conceptual, theoretical, academic point of view? No, they can\' t, says Peter Kanowski, professor of forestry at the Australian National University\' s Fenner School of Environment and Society.  But I guess that\' s not the world we\' re living in. A century of extraction of short-term economic value has pushed global forests into a sustained crisis. The World Resources Institute, which tracks forest loss, estimates that 30 per cent of the world\' s forest cover has now been completely cleared, and a further 20 per cent degraded. Of the remaining half, most is fragmented and vulnerable; just 15 per cent is functionally intact. In 2018, 12m hectares of tropical forests were lost; in 2019 the figure could be higher, after devastating fires across the Amazon and the Indonesian archipelago. A 2014 report prepared by McKinsey & Co, Credit Suisse and the World Wildlife Fund estimated that between $300bn and $400bn is needed to fund conservation and ecosystem restoration each year, but that only $52bn in funding is available. Just 2 per cent of all climate finance goes to forest conservation and rehabilitation. That deficiency is replicated at a national level. In Cambodia, the environment ministry struggles to manage 40 per cent of the country\' s land area with under 0.5 per cent of the national budget. Cambodia lost 2.2m hectares of forest between 2001 and 2018, a quarter of its tree cover, according to WRI. More than 90 per cent of deforestation was  commodity-driven, WRI found. Conservation projects have to either compete economically with farmers and other groups who covet the land, or fight a constant  and probably doomed  rearguard action against destruction. At Vuth Kith station, on the banks of the Mekong River, an eight-strong squad of rangers patrol a huge area by small boat, on foot and on the ubiquitous Honda bikes. Here and there, areas of trees have been chopped or burned down. In one patch, cleared a year before, mango seedlings have recently been planted. The biggest obstacle to the rangers\' work is, in fact, the opposition they face from local communities. Locals monitor the squad\' s movements and inform on them, so that perpetrators can avoid the patrols. Once, when the rangers confiscated a tractor used to illegally clear land, villagers set up a roadblock and demanded its return. On the patrol routes, signs warning of the penalty for illegal clearance or harvesting have been defaced or obscured.  We need the communities on our side 100 per cent, said Mr Hon at Conservation International.  But they understand the short term better than the long term... They have to pay for education, for medical expenses. They owe money to loan sharks. Conservation International has invested in a programme that helps villagers grow higher-value organic rice, aimed at increasing incomes without requiring additional land, but it is limited to around 200 households. When the proceeds from Mitsui\' s carbon sales come through, CI hopes they will have more money to spread around, though the organisation is yet to decide exactly how to divide the pot. Similar projects, such as InfiniteEarth\' s Rimba Raya project, have used their capital as a kind of venture fund to invest in small businesses and services. Others have experimented with direct cash payments. The eventual shape of the Prey Lang programme  and its success  rests on whether there will be enough money coming back down to the ground to make the case for conservation.  And that all depends on the market in Japan, basically, Mr Roy says. The price of carbon currently varies wildly around the world, from a floor of $3 in Tokyo to $17 in New Zealand and $25 in the European Union. However, most markets do not yet admit credits generated overseas. The Tokyo market does, but only via certain bilateral agreements between the Japanese government and developing nations.  The truth of it is that all of us have been in the wilderness on pricing since Copenhagen failed, said Todd Stevens, executive director for the Wildlife Conservation Society\' s Conservation Science and Solutions programme. Mr Stevens said bulk buyers in the market were currently paying $1-$3 per ton, while  more enlightened companies were offering $4-$8. Echoing other project developers, he judges that $10 a ton would be  the type of money where you would begin to overcome the opportunity costs at scale  in other words, that the income would be competitive with clearing the land for agriculture. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the price of carbon needs to be in the range of $40-$80 per ton by 2020, rising to $50-$100 per ton by 2030, for market-based mechanisms to deliver the emissions reductions necessary to prevent global heating of 2C. Even a few dollars extra per ton could drive real change on the ground. CI\' s Mr Roy, who used to work in the development sector, compares the challenge to the long struggle to try to convince Afghan opium farmers to give up their crops.  Nobody could figure out what would be more profitable for the farmers than producing opium, she says.  It\' s kind of similar. What is the price point at which this is going to be economically viable, that you\' re not going to do other things, not going to chop down the tree? Because, sadly, now, the climate argument alone is not winning.

FOR the past couple of weeks, all eyes in the UK have been on the General Election and its very short campaign, jam-packed with many televised debates, manifesto promises, investment pledges and, of course, Brexit plans. However, Europe's focus was on Madrid, where talks about the climate crisis are reaching a crunch point. The United Nation's 25th climate conference, called COP25 , is underway and well into its second week of negotiations. You may find the abbreviation familiar - it's the same conference that four years ago led to the Paris Agreement, a landmark event unprecedented in the field of climate change negotiations. For the first time, almost every country in the world agreed that the climate is changing due to human activity, and that they are obliged to act in order to mitigate it. Yet, its non-binding nature and the fact that countries are allowed to set their own goals means the Paris Agreement, while crucial, remains flawed. Hobbled by the speed of climate change around us. The messages echoing across the world from Madrid are 'not enough' and 'too little too late'. The UN's General Secretary opened talks by saying the Paris Agreement goals are "utterly inadequate" and that our planet is reaching a "point of no return". We heard of activist Greta Thunberg's dismay at how school strikes over climate change had achieved nothing. Even Sir David Attenborough, whose optimism on our ability as a species to be resourceful and tackle climate change had been keeping many of us positive about the future, believes it's now too late to reverse the damage done: "the best that we can hope is that we will slow it down". It is a sad state of affairs that puts our future and that of many generations to come in jeopardy. Now, more than ever before, international cooperation that allows no space for climate deniers is absolutely vital. At EU level, the new Commission brings hope through its Green New Deal plan. Yesterday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Vice-President Frans Timmermans made the EU's first climate-neutral commitment in Brussels, which includes big environmental objectives in areas such as transport, energy, pollution, agriculture, circular economy and biodiversity. Calling it "Europe's man on the moon moment", the new Commission unveiled plans for a climate law which will commit the bloc to slash emissions to net zero by 2050. The EU Green Deal is comprised of a total of 49 policy measures, with some expected as soon as January. Change is coming fast and the climate crisis - and how we tackle it - is clearly top of the agenda in the EU, with all institutions prioritising it in their work. Which brings me back to the UK elections. At national level we have also seen environmental issues take centre stage like never before, as they have been given greater priority in this election than in any past ones. Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations in 74 countries, ranked the Labour Party manifesto at the top of its climate and nature league table for having a wide-range of significant policies to respond to the climate and ecological crisis, closely followed by the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Conservative Party on the other hand was ranked bottom of the main parties' league table as their manifesto was judged to be "missing significant commitments in numerous areas, inadequate policies in others, and actively damaging policies in transport". Not only is it shocking and shameful for the government of one of the biggest world economies to be described as such, it's also HYPERLINK matter what your views are on investment, tax rates, Brexit, trade, immigration... we surely must all stand united in the face of our home getting destroyed by our own actions. When it comes to the health of our planet, recklessness, irresponsibility and complacency should not be accepted, nor forgiven. I hope you cast your vote today with the future of our next generations in mind. \£6 Jude Kirton-Darling is a Labour MEP for the North East. \</doc>

Climate change is 'probably the greatest business disruption humankind has ever faced,' BBVA Group executive chairman Carlos Torres Vila said at the Madrid Climate Change Conference. That's why 'sustainability is a core part of our strategy. The future of finance lies in financing the future,' he stressed. Listen to audio Leer en espanol 'At BBVA, we have taken a comprehensive approach to sustainability challenges by including not only climate change, but also other environmental and social challenges in our strategy,' explained Carlos Torres Vila. The bank's Pledge 2025 is part of this strategy, and is based on three pillars: 1) mobilizing resources in green financing, sustainable infrastructure, social entrepreneurship and financial inclusion; 2) managing environmental and social risks in order to minimize the bank's potential negative impacts, both direct and indirect; and 3) engaging with all stakeholder groups to collectively promote greater contribution to sustainable development from the financial industry. 'At BBVA, we have taken a comprehensive approach to sustainability challenges by including not only climate change, but also other environmental and social challenges in our strategy' Pledge 2025 includes the goal of mobilizing EUR100 billion in sustainable finance between 2018 and 2025. BBVA's Group executive chairman stressed that the bank is advancing at a faster than expected pace - by nearly 20 percent. He therefore opened to door to updating this target. At COP24, BBVA was also one of the first five banks in the world (along with BNP Paribas, ING, Societe Generale and Standard Chartered) to announce in Katowice (COP24) its commitment to progressively align its lending business with the Paris Agreement. BBVA-Carlos-Torres-Vila- COP25 BBVA's Group executive chairman Carlos Torres Vila during his participation at COP25 in Madrid. BBVA puts an internal price on CO2 emissions BBVA's Group executive chairman announced that from now on, the bank will put an internal price on its CO2 emissions, thus incorporating this factor into its decision-making processes. This 'incentivizes each area' to plan for the CO2 cost of each of their actions, and encourages lower emissions. All of this will contribute to the goal of being carbon neutral in 2020, which he also announced today. In February 2018, the bank committed to ensure than 70 percent of the energy consumed by the group around the world will come from renewable sources by 2025, and reach 100 percent in 2030, while reducing CO2 emissions by 68 percent in 10 years. These steps will help attain the emission reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement, which BBVA has committed to meet. These initiatives are also in line with the European Commission's Green Deal, which foresees a 'climate neutral' European Union in 2050. The bank aims to be carbon neutral in 2020, Carlos Torres Vila announced In line with its purpose - to bring the age of opportunity to everyone - BBVA's Group executive chairman underscored that a fundamental part of its strategy includes 'providing clients advice to improve their financial health, and helping them in their transition to a more sustainable economy.' This includes offering a unique range products, and in this regard, the bank plans to offer a sustainable alternative for all of its products in Spain in 2020. Carlos Torres Vila also emphasized the importance of ensuring global coordination between the public and private sectors on a global level, as well as developing a common taxonomy that defines what is considered a sustainable activity. In this respect, he indicated that the lack of definitions 'should not be an excuse to start action now. Financial institutions are catalysts for this change', and 'we need to move forward quickly.' Also participating in the event were Nadia Calvino, the Acting Minister of the Economy and Business; Margarita Delgado, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain; Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of UNEP; and Santander CEO, Jose Antonio Alvarez.

MEAT PROCESSOR Dunbia has committed to delivering a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from its own facilities and from the generation of the energy it purchases, by 2030. The commitment comes in the wake of COP25 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid where political, business and NGO leaders sought to coordinate a collective response to global warming. In May this year, the Dawn Meats Group, which includes Dunbia in the UK, signed up to the Science Based Targets initiative, becoming the first European beef and lamb processor to make such a commitment. Dunbia CEO Niall Browne stated: "We have been working for more than 10 years to reduce emissions internally and more widely across our supply chain and we recognise the urgency to adopt even more aggressive measures to reduce emissions. "We are working with stakeholders in collaborative projects to accelerate progress in this critical area. Achieving reductions of up to 30% in our greenhouse gas emissions poses a considerable challenge, but it is vital that Dawn accelerates the rate of change in the environmental footprint of its business." Group head of sustainability Gill Higgins commented: "Dawn Meats Group recognises that any sustainable targets and solutions to global warming must be grounded in science. The approval of our targets by SBTi is a significant first step towards a smaller emissions footprint and we will continue to stretch our ambition in the years to come." \</doc>

Ministers have postponed the UN climate change conference in Glasgow later this year due to coronavirus. The Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, who is also president of the COP26 conference, held talks with organisers last night to discuss rearranging the summit for next spring. The conference was scheduled for November, but the pandemic had already disrupted preliminary meetings and, given that the Government is focused elsewhere, the summit was seen as unsustainable. Environmental campaigners described the decision as "inevitable" but warned that focus must be maintained on the threat of climate change. Even before coronavirus the Government had its work cut out making COP26 a success. Countries left the COP25 last year locked in disputes over carbon trading, and UK diplomats will need to broker an agreement on that to move the talks forward. UN officials were also keen to see countries ramp up their carbon cutting plans ahead of COP26, to bring them closer to the Paris treaty's aim of limiting warming to under two degrees. Currently, national pledges added together come nowhere near. But pre-coronavirus, there was little evidence key countries such as China and Japan were co-operating, leaving it up to ministers and Foreign Office officials to drum up momentum for tougher goals. Many in the climate movement believe pushing the meeting back will give British diplomats time to build international consensus for tougher action. But the hiatus could embolden polluting nations to prioritise a high carbon recovery from the pandemic. Greenpeace's UK executive director, John Sauven, said: "The Government stimulus packages will hold the key to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency." \</doc>

The world's most polluting companies could be sued for their contributions to global warming, a major human rights inquiry has found in what has been described as a "landmark victory for climate justice". The head of a Philippines Commission on Human Rights panel, which has been investigating climate change for three years, revealed its conclusions on Monday that major fossil fuel firms may be held legally responsible for the impacts of their carbon emissions. The announcement was made by commissioner Roberto Cadiz during COP25 HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greta-thunberg-climate-conference-madrid-chile-samoa-brianna-fruean-a9236676.html international climate talks Its final report, which has yet to be published, will say that these companies have clear legal and moral responsibilities to act, which includes shifting away from fossil fuels and investing in cleaner energy sources. He noted that a growing number of cases related to climate change are now being filed in courts across the world "and with the conclusion of this investigation, we believe many more communities will take a stand against fossil fuel companies that are putting profit before people". ExxonMobil, for example, one of the world's largest oil and gas firms, has faced multiple legal challenges from US states and shareholders who claim it misled investors and the public over the real risks of climate change. And in Germany, utility firm RWE is being sued by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Sa\'fal Luciano Lliuya whose home is at risk from a melting glacier. The human rights implications of climate change cannot be avoided during the ongoing talks in Madrid, but observers fear that attempts to include human rights protections in the HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greta-thunberg-climate-conference-madrid-chile-samoa-brianna-fruean-a9236676.html finer details of the Paris Agreement are failing .

They had already lodged a HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greta-thunberg-climate-conference-madrid-chile-samoa-brianna-fruean-a9236676.html petition with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in September, saying Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey are perpetuating the climate crisis by failing to curb emissions and promoting fossil fuels. During her first official appearance at the talks, Thunberg also sought to draw attention to the plight of Indigenous Peoples and other vulnerable groups by handing the microphone over to a diverse panel of young people. Activists from Indigenous backgrounds and developing nations, who are disproportionately at risk from climate change despite contributing little to global carbon emissions, feel their stories have been sidelined in political discussions and the wider media. Angela Valenzuela, an activist from Chile, which was originally due to host the talks, said she had found it "outrageous" that her government had tried to clean up its image in Madrid "while committing human rights violations every day". "While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments the world is literally burning out," she said. "But we are courageous. We continue to flood the streets, even if we are risking our lives." \</doc>

TEACHERS fear pupils will empty classrooms in a mass walkout during the crunch UN climate summit. Thousands of pupils inspired by Swedish eco activist Greta Thunberg, 17, could go on strike as world leaders gather in Glasgow for COP26. An exodus is expected midway through the event on Friday, November 13 - after previous walkouts sparked by the teen figurehead's Fridays for Future crusade. One source said: "We've been told there could be empty classrooms on the day. "I agree with the pupils and their right to protest but a lot of other teachers and parents don't. And there are issues around knowing where your child is during school time." Scottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer MSP said: "I fully expect November 13 to be the biggest-ever school strike in Scotland and the UK. "Young people are watching their future being stolen, so it's no surprise they're rebelling and demanding action." Ms Thunberg spoke at COP25 in Madrid, Spain, last year, claiming 500,000 turned up at her rally. Nicola Sturgeon and then-PM Theresa May clashed over climate strikes, with the First Minister backing pupils and Mrs May insisting they wasted valuable lesson time. COP26 will be attended by 200 world leaders, 90,000 delegates and potentially thousands of protestors. A Scottish Government spokeswoman hailed pupils for engaging with the issue but added: "Student absence is a matter for individual schools and local authorities."

Greta Thunberg addressed audience at the COP25 talks in Madrid, Spain today She said at current rate of emissions world will quickly use up 'carbon budget'   Governments under pressure to take ambitious action to cut greenhouse gases Activist Greta Thunberg today accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at the UN climate talks. COP25 talks in Madrid, Spain, the teenager also criticised governments for avoiding taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 'not behaving as if we are in an emergency'. Greta, who inspired the school strikes for the climate movement, said: 'The biggest danger is not inaction; the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.' She said the science showed that, at the current rate of emissions, the world is set to use up the whole 'carbon budget' - the amount of pollution that can be put into the atmosphere and still keep global warming to 1.5C - in eight years. Countries previously committed to curbing global warming at 'well below' 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement secured in 2015. Governments meeting at the talks are now under pressure to take more ambitious action to cut greenhouse gases, which continue to rise, to avoid the worst effects of climate change. She said: 'Finding holistic solutions is what the COP should be all about, but instead it seems to have turned some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition. 'Countries are finding clever ways around having to take real action, like double-counting emissions reductions, and moving emissions overseas, and walking back on their promises to increase ambitions, or refusing to pay for solutions or loss and damage. This has to stop.' Greta, who sailed across the Atlantic to attend the talks in Chile, before having to sail back again because they were moved to Spain due to civil unrest in the South American country, has made a series of hard-hitting speeches at international events in the past year. In her latest talk, she focused on the science and the 'misleading' behaviour of politicians and big business. She said countries which had committed to reducing their emissions to zero by a certain date, as the UK has done with its legally binding pledge for net-zero by 2050, appeared impressive at first glance. But 'this is not leading, this is misleading', she said, warning that the targets did not include aviation and shipping, or the emissions created by goods made in other countries and imported - and did include 'offsetting' emissions. 'Zero by 2050 means nothing if high emissions continue for even a few years. Then the remaining budget will be gone.' She said real, drastic emissions cuts were needed, and carbon had to stay in the ground to keep temperature rises below 1.5C. She finished her speech on a more hopeful note, telling delegates: 'In just three weeks we will enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future. 'Right now we are desperate for any sign of hope. 'There is hope - I've seen it - but it does not come from the governments or corporations, it comes from the people. The people who have been unaware are now starting to wake up.' 'Every great change in history comes from the people. We can start the change right now, we the people,' the teenager added. \</doc>

THE UN climate change summit in Madrid drew to a belated and acrimonious end yesterday as a number of large states resisted pressure to boost efforts to combat global warming. Activists and delegates from smaller nations were critical of countries such as the US, China, Australia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, who were said to have blocked bolder action. In its closing draft, the conference only endorsed a modest declaration on the "urgent need" to reduce the gap between nations' existing greenhouse gas pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. The summit also failed to come to a decision on global carbon markets, which had been earmarked as a flagship issue for the conference. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres took to Twitter to vent his feelings. He said: "I am disappointed with the results of COP25 . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up." An earlier draft of the conference's concluding text attracted widespread anger, with campaigners arguing that its wording was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the Paris Agreement. The talks, which finished nearly two days late, stalled amid disputes over the rules for international carbon trading, with Brazil and Australia among the main holdouts. A representative from Tuvalu, the Pacific Island nation at risk of catastrophic damage from rising sea levels, told Reuters: "There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change." "Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity," they added. \</doc>

"The reality is much more boring": not Finkelstein's everyday attire. Photo: PA What was your highlight of 2019? Being given the opportunity to lead the Defra Group as permanent secretary must rank as one of the highlights of my year. The responsibilities of Defra are so wide-ranging, so to learn more I kicked off a campaign called Defra Group in 100 Objects, asking people throughout the group to identify items that shape our work - the finger bone of a blue whale, a drone to measure river flow, our rainbow lanyard proudly displaying our diversity. These items and the skills and commitment of the people who chose them are another highlight. What has been the most significant change in your organisation this year? Defra has changed in size and shape as we have made preparations for leaving the European Union. Colleagues from other departments have joined our teams following a call for volunteers across the civil service. We have become expert at bringing new people into our teams, welcoming them and training them up. We have learned so much about moving at pace while looking after each other, boosted by our grassroots "be kind" campaign. "We will continue to make changes so that we can leave the environment in a better place than we found it" What will be the biggest challenge of 2020 - and how are you preparing to meet it? UN conference on climate change hosted by the UK in Glasgow at the end of the year. Tell us a favourite festive memory from your youth... Some years ago, I worked in a team that put on an annual Christmas panto with a script brilliantly written by a team member, including topical references to ministers and political events. I was given the role of Prince Charming and decided to invest in a hired costume, which was a pink velvet brocade suit with white stockings and gold cocked hat. I decided to take my three-year-old daughter along. She was terrified and started crying, so I had to complete my performance with her in my arms. A few months later we were talking about my work and she said: "I know what you do, you are Prince Charming in the panto."

Measured, circumspect, cautious, these were unlikely men to be at the heart of a global storm of controversy and invective. Although in a sense, global storms were their m\'e9tier. 10 years ago, the scientists of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia were accused of withholding and manipulating data after more than a thousand emails were hacked in a malicious attempt to deny their findings on climate change. Police investigating the breach classed it as a Category A crime, as serious as terrorism: the perpetrator was attempting to sway the decisions of nations on an issue of global concern. The hacker was never caught, but this documentary rounds up other key players to lay out the instructive tale of  Climategate . It did indeed derail the 15th UN conference on climate change in Copenhagen, convening just a fortnight after the leak. Even more significantly, it sowed doubt in the minds of the public about the reality of global warming. And it all began with a simple, elegant image. Michael Mann, a professor at Penn State University, using data provided by the CRU, produced a graph to illustrate the gravity of rising global temperatures, its straightish line with dramatic upwards curve dubbed  the hockey stick . This caught the eye of Steve McIntyre, a Canadian who had spent his working life in metal mining (it is hard to divorce opinions from professional affiliations in this story). Thinking that analysing the data himself would be a good recreational use of his mathematical skills, he began a blog and opened up a vigorous correspondence with the scientists of the CRU. Climate data comes in two forms, that of the  instrumental period since measuring devices were invented, and  climate proxies culled from natural archives such as tree growth rings and ice cores. The latter help push the record back from about 300 years to a thousand. But the CRU\' s data came from several sources; it wasn\' t theirs to give away, they thought, when McIntyre and his blog followers came calling. Before long the CRU was being bombarded with freedom of information requests. Then came the hack, revealing a mass of emails between the CRU and other prominent climate change scientists, and out of them a handful of phrases that seemed to hint at a sinister collusion. Three independent inquiries subsequently absolved the scientists of misconduct, but were they perhaps a touch arrogant, a little too high-handed in their interface with the general public?  We weren\' t 100 per cent transparent at that time, one admits. There\' s an extraordinary coda to this tale, almost a happy ending. For the vindication of science, that is, not for the planet.      \' Climategate: Science of a Scandal\' airs November 14 on BBC4 Follow HYPERLINK @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

Chile: Country outlook FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT POLITICAL STABILITY: The centre-right Chile Vamos government led by the president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era, faces severe political and governability challenges. It remains beleaguered by widespread civilian protests, which began in early October. Public discontent remains severe and protesters are demanding Mr Pi\'f1era's resignation. However, as he was democratically elected in free and fair polls, and has taken measures to address protesters' demands for constitutional reform and greater social spending, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president to complete his term, albeit amid serious challenges to governability and complexities in policymaking. ELECTION WATCH: We do not currently believe that Mr Pi\'f1era will resign or be forced out of office; nor do we expect, at this point, that redrafting of the constitution will pave the way for early elections. Regional and municipal elections will take place in October 2020. Traditionally, the coalition that wins those polls has gone on to win the presidential and legislative elections in the following year; these are due in November 2021, with a run-off in the presidential poll, if necessary, in December. Consecutive presidential re-election is prohibited; it is too early to determine who the candidates will be at the next presidential election. It is true that there has been alternation between left-leaning and right-leaning governments since 2010, but recent political upheaval has the potential to create a much more polarised race with the potential to spring surprises, and to produce a government much further from the political centre than has been the case for several decades. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: In view of the ongoing social crisis and civil unrest, matters relating to foreign policy--such as regional and global integration efforts--will take a back seat, as the government will be forced to redirect its focus towards policies aimed at restoring domestic stability. For example, the government decided to withdraw as the host of both the APEC summit of 21 Asia-Pacific economies, scheduled to be held in Santiago on November 16th-17th, and the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (known as COP25 ), scheduled for December 2nd-13th, also in Santiago. The APEC summit was cancelled; COP25 was moved to the Spanish capital, Madrid. The decision to pull out of hosting COP25 will undermine Mr Pi\'f1era's efforts to raise Chile's profile by advancing environmental campaigns; it represents a major setback to the country's international standing and it hints at the perceived longevity of the protests. Allegations of abuse and human rights violations by the police have been made, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights--who happens to be the former president, Michele Bachelet (2006-10; 2014-18)--is sending a team to investigate. This further endangers the Pi\'f1era government's reputation among global leaders. POLICY TRENDS: Under continued pressure from wide-scale protests, the immediate focus of the Pi\'f1era government is to embark on policies designed to reduce income inequality, raise wages, and address high electricity and energy costs. An emphasis on business-friendly reforms will be replaced by one on social reform policies such as improving the quality of healthcare and education, social security, and pensions and wages. Mr Pi\'f1era's response to the eruption of unrest so far amounts to US$6.7bn (around 2.3% of GDP) in new commitments, including increases in minimum wage and state pensions, reductions in electricity tariffs, and introduction of insurance coverage for medicines. The most recent concessions came in the form of a US$5.5bn economic recovery plan aimed at creating 100,000 new jobs in 2020 by ramping up public spending on infrastructure amounting to US$3.025bn, support for about 20,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) at risk of bankruptcy (amounting to US$1.95bn) and US$525m for other initiatives; despite such schemes, we expect the unemployment rate to rise during the year. The package implies a 9.8% rise in public spending in 2020, compared with 2019. We expect the president to make further economic concessions until the unrest subsides. These reforms imply a much looser fiscal policy and a break with decades of consensus on the need for orthodox fiscal management to ensure macroeconomic stability. ECONOMIC GROWTH: We estimate real GDP growth in 2019 at 1.5% (down from 1.8% previously) and forecast a further deceleration in 2020 to 1.3%, owing to the ongoing social crisis and the accompanying strikes by workers. Although we expect economic recovery to take place once the protests subside, some lingering effects of the current turmoil could hamper the pace of the upturn. Chile's exposure to global developments (changes in commodity prices and demand) and heavy dependence on imported oil pose also risks to our forecasts. INFLATION: We expect inflation to converge during the forecast period to the middle of the 2-4% target range set by the Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank). The annual inflation rate in November rose to 2.7% (from 2.5% in October), driven in part by the depreciation of the peso during the month, amid heightened civil unrest. This sharp depreciation is likely to pass through to higher local prices. In the short term, we expect a small inflationary spike, with inflation ending the year at 3.3%. However, strong confidence in the inflation-targeting regime means that inflationary pressures are likely to prove temporary. Furthermore, the BCCh's announcement of a US$20bn foreign-exchange injection to curb the peso's fall in value could curtail this inflationary pressure. Additional risks to our forecast include the magnitude and pace of the recovery, and the impact on confidence, as these factors will determine the necessity of any additional rate cuts. EXCHANGE RATES: Following a sharp depreciation of the peso since protests began in October, we expect the depreciating trend to continue in the remainder of 2019, reflecting dented investor confidence. We expect the peso to end 2019 at Ps764.7:US$1. However, the extent of the decline will be contained by the central bank's announcement in end-November of a US$20bn foreign-exchange intervention, which is to continue over a six-month period. As a result, we expect the peso to end 2020 at Ps695.9:US$1. The intervention, which amounts to nearly half of the country's foreign-exchange reserves, will result in an appreciation of the peso as investor confidence is restored after the current protests end. The appreciation will begin in 2020 and will gain momentum from 2021 before the currency begins to stabilise at about Ps645:US$1 in 2023-24. Moderately high and rising copper prices will support the peso over the forecast period, as will firmer external demand for Chile's exports. Perpetual risks to our forecast include unexpected volatility in copper prices or global risk sentiment, along with deeper domestic political instability than we currently project. EXTERNAL SECTOR: We expect the current-account deficit to remain stable in 2020 at 2.9% of GDP. It will widen slightly in 2021 to 3% of GDP, on the back of a larger primary income deficit--entrenched by rising debt-service obligations, following an increase in external debt to finance higher public spending during the ongoing unrest--as well as profit repatriation by multinational firms based in Chile. We expect the current-account deficit to then narrow gradually to 2.5% of GDP by 2024, as the government repays its debt obligations. The narrowing of the deficit will be further cushioned by a recovery in economic activity and a pick-up in global copper prices, which will result in a widening of the trade surplus from an estimated 1.4% of GDP in 2019 to 3% of GDP in 2024. \</doc>

Last week, I wrote about how baffled I was that middle-aged men get so extraordinarily furious at Greta Thunberg's articulate pleas to save the planet. Could there be a gender agenda? In response, I received a climate-related tsunami of rage from middleaged (and older) men aimed at me, which rather proved my point. Thunberg has just been named Time magazine's Person of the Year. Not bad for an "annoying little girl in pigtails who got radicalised by watching Ice Age 2", and who needs to "work on her anger management, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill, Greta, chill!" Call me a Green Party Marxist stooge (I was labelled a communist when I dissed Deliveroo, so I'll add this new epithet to my CV of shame), but why not get angry with that stupid, old Hoesung Lee, who chairs the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? How about the OECD's Climate Change Expert Group? What do they know? Greta is on the milder end of the austic spectrum, which supposedly makes her "mentally ill" and not worthy of regard. Ditto Bill Gates, Sir Isaac Newton, Mozart and Steve Jobs, I presume? I am nobody's mouthpiece, as regular readers of this column will be aware. But shutting down a young woman and mocking her is the sign of an argument that has been lost. My own retort to the peevish and dismissive is the Voltairian (although not a direct quote): "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." Let Greta speak. \</doc>

During my maiden speech in the House of Commons last month, I emphasised that, as Britain leaves the European Union, the government should remain committed to expanding our global horizons and reinforcing our national mission as a force for good in the world. One issue of mounting concern to the British public is the environment, and I am proud that the UK is leading the way on global action to address HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change climate change . In November we are scheduled to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. Leading by example with our strong record of HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change reducing our emissions at home, we will encourage other countries to submit ambitious climate action plans, in order to honour the goals in the Paris Agreement. This is a critical opportunity to avert dangerous levels of climate change and, in turn, to try to avoid devastating consequences. Our changing climate is closely linked to the declining health of our HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change oceans . This is an issue close to my heart. Oceans play a vital climatic role by absorbing carbon. As carbon dioxide levels rise in the earth's atmosphere, our oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, which poses a threat to delicate ecosystems such as coral reefs that support precious marine species. HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change Rising sea levels and more extreme weather events linked to climate change may drive millions from their homes by the end of the century. The government recognises this risk and, through its Blue Forests Programme, is helping other countries adapt and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. UK Aid's initiative to protect 20,000 hectares of mangrove forest has been rolled out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. This programme also helps countries protect their marine environments from other threats such as plastic pollution, overfishing and habitat loss. Unchecked industrial fishing can have a detrimental impact on fish and shark populations, while plastic pollution is contaminating our oceans, choking whales, turtles and other marine species. I have seen first-hand the scale of the challenge of tackling plastic pollution both at home and abroad. When I visited Kissy Dump in Sierra Leone, local campaigners spoke about the challenges of trying to build waste management and recycling systems in developing countries. I saw rubbish being burnt in the street and thrown into the river or sea, and heard stories about flooding and health problems. In 2018 the government pledged \£366.4 million to boost global research and help countries across the Commonwealth stop plastic waste from entering the oceans. Britain has played a world-leading role in tackling HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change plastic pollution , but we must not rest on our laurels. It is vital that we keep pressing to combat this problem across the globe. Last year, as head of the Coalition for Global Prosperity, I hosted Sir David Attenborough at an event where we explored how Britain can take a leading role in the fight against plastic pollution. Sir David cited the harrowing statistic that of the 400 million tonnes of plastic produced globally each year, 10 million tonnes ends up in our oceans. Plastic pollution has been found in every corner of the planet. In our oceans, marine life such as seabirds, dolphins, whales and turtles become entangled in plastic. Last month a Greenpeace report, Turtles Under Threat, estimated that more than 50 per cent of all sea turtles may have ingested pieces of plastic, mistaking it for food. Here in the UK we have taken steps to ban certain HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/climate-change microplastics , but more needs to be done to end our reliance on single-use plastics and shift towards reusable, refillable and packaging-free solutions. It could not be clearer that our oceans face an increasing range of threats. Bold measures are needed across the world to place our most precious marine ecosystems off-limits to human exploitation, through marine sanctuaries, to allow them to recover and thrive. I am delighted by the prime minister's recent announcement of a significant expansion of the Blue Belt of protected areas around important marine habitats in the British Isles and around our overseas territories. The government has also pushed for 30 per cent of the world's oceans to be safeguarded by 2030. But in order for this "30by30" vision to be delivered, greater political leadership is urgently required at the UN level. A strong Global Ocean Treaty needs to be established to provide a framework for countries to come together and designate and enforce ocean sanctuaries in international waters. At present less than 10 per cent of the global oceans are properly protected, and the latest draft treaty leaves many critical decisions still up for negotiation. This is an opportunity for global Britain to step up and lead. The UK has forged the way in establishing a Global Ocean Alliance of countries that back 30by30. Our strong diplomatic network must encourage more countries to join, and then harness the power of the alliance to push for the strongest possible treaty. Lord Goldsmith of Richmond, the environment minister, has pledged "to press for an ambitious global network of marine protected areas which will be critically important in reversing the loss of biodiversity and mitigating the impacts of climate change". At the final round of UN negotiations in New York, the UK has a chance to spur collective action and unlock this government's ambition. The 2020s will be critical for action to protect our oceans and climate. We must be bold and unrelenting in pushing for the strongest possible outcomes in the global negotiations ahead. Britain is in the perfect position to leave a positive mark on the world by protecting the environment for future generations. Theo Clarke is the Conservative MP for Stafford \</doc>

The Morrison government will on Friday signal plans to shift investment from wind and solar to hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium and advanced livestock feed supplements, as part of a "bottom up" strategy to reduce emissions by 2050. Angus Taylor will use a speech to an economic thinktank to put some flesh on the bones of the Coalition's much-vaunted technology roadmap. The emissions reduction minister will also declare Australia will take a technology-based long-term emissions reduction "strategy" to the United Nations-led climate talks in Glasgow at the end of this year. While not ruling out adopting a specific emissions reduction target, Taylor will contend the "top down" approach of countries proposing emissions reduction targets in the global climate framework has "failed" because countries are not delivering on their commitments. According to a speech extract circulated in advance, Taylor will say the government intends to roll out "a series of detailed pieces of work" between now and the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, HYPERLINK known at COP26, in November. As well as the roadmap, the government is HYPERLINK reviewing its much-criticised emissions reduction fund and the operation \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/call-for-new-committee-to-get-cop26-talks-back-on-track of the safeguard mechanism HYPERLINK were a "war on the weekend" Taylor will say the looming technology investment roadmap will form the cornerstone of the government's 2050 emissions reduction strategy, providing guidance to the public and the private sector on "what future energy and emissions-reduction technologies the government will prioritise". He will say the government has already invested $10.4bn into clean technology projects with a value of $35bn, but declare "we are coming to an end of the value of these investments". "Wind and solar are economic as a source of pure energy at least, and the government should not crowd out private sector investment," the minister will say. "We must move our investments to the next challenges - hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium and advanced livestock feed supplements to name a few". Taylor will say the roadmap will include "measurable economic goals for technology that will allow us to assess the cost curve for technologies and to give a clear signal for when a technology is commercial". "To be successful from both a portfolio and from a technology perspective we must track how much private sector and other investment in R and D and early deployment follows our own investment," Taylor will say. "To measure the success of the overall portfolio I think we should be aiming for a four or five time multiplier. That is for every dollar invested I want to see four or five dollars from the private sector following over the course of our investments." It is unclear from the speech extract what policy mechanism will drive the new investments and who will administer the research and development, and it does not address why the government is looking at technology such as carbon capture and storage, or CCS. Most low emissions scenarios for the future consider CCS a potentially important technology if the world is to keep global heating to 1.5C about pre-industrial levels, but only when used with biomass, not fossil fuels. The technology has not proved commercially viable with fossil fuel power generation despite being promised billions in taxpayer support through HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/call-for-new-committee-to-get-cop26-talks-back-on-track initiatives such as the CCS flagships program .

But it is not definitive. On Thursday, the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman HYPERLINK continued his call for the leadership to embrace net zero . "I think it is a target we need to look at," the member for North Sydney told the ABC. "We have a good target for 2030 but we need to look beyond that as we head into Glasgow." Taylor will say on Friday: "If I could stand up today - announce a target and see the CO2 reduce - then I would. "If setting a target today would lower emissions - then today would be a short speech. I wouldn't have to outline our plan and I wouldn't have to outline all the work that has led to today." Guardian Australia HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/call-for-new-committee-to-get-cop26-talks-back-on-track revealed on Thursday new analysis by ClimateWorks Australia suggesting Australia can achieve a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 with known technologies, but the deployment of low emissions options will need to be accelerated significantly. \</doc>

Rishi Sunak appointed Chancellor as Sajid Javid walks out Javid claims 'no self-respecting minister' would have accepted PM's demands   Treasury could be first to fall in Dominic Cummings' land grab Matthew Lynn: From baffling tax plans to rogue behaviour, Sajid Javid had to go Subscribe to The Telegraph, free for 30 days A barrister who has said that the courts should stay out of politics has been appointed as the Government's most senior lawyer amid Boris Johnson's growing battle with the judiciary. Suella Braverman, a former leader of backbench Tory Eurosceptics, replaced Geoffrey Cox, as Attorney General in a Cabinet reshuffle in which the Prime Minister rewarded loyalists and sacked those who defied him. Other promotions included Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden, promoted to Culture secretary and Defence minister and Johnson ally Anne-Marie Trevelyan who took over as International Development secretary. Alok Sharma, the former Dfid secretary, was given the plum role of organising the preparations for November's COP26 United Nations Climate Change conference in November as well as Business secretary. The appointment of Cambridge law graduate Mrs Braverman will set off alarm bells for judges after she said Parliament must "retrace power ceded to the courts" in an article last month. She wrote: "Repatriated powers from the EU will mean precious little if our courts continue to act as political decision-maker, pronouncing on what the law ought to be and supplanting Parliament. "Traditionally, Parliament made the law and judges applied it. But today, our courts exercise a form of political power." She also said that while the Human Rights Act was "noble in its intentions", "the concept of 'fundamental' human rights has been stretched beyond recognition". Overall Mr Johnson cut the number of Cabinet ministers from 31 to 26, by slashing the number of junior ministers who can attend the weekly meetings from nine to holders of just four positions-Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Leader of the House of Commons, Chief Whip and Attorney General. Other ministers representing Housing, Northern Powerhouse, Business and Environment as well as the Paymaster General lost their right to attend. The reshuffle fell short of the long predicted merger of the Foreign Office and International Development departments although four ministers appointed to roles in both departments-James Cleverly, the former party chairman Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park, Baroness Sugg and Nigel Adams, the former Culture minister. Lord Goldsmith-who as former Tory MP Zac Goldsmith edited the Ecologist magazine-was given a third role as minister in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Ministers who clashed with Mr Johnson or defied him were fired in a move which one Tory source showed Mr Johnson was "a jealous god". Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith was sacked amid claims that he had left Mr Johnson blindsided over a risk of more prosecutions to veterans, and clashes over Brexit. He was replaced by Home Office minister Brandon Lewis, who as party chairman launched an inquiry into Mr Johnson after he suggest women wearing the burqa looked like letter boxes or bank robbers. Andrea Leadsom, the veteran Cabinet minister who once challenged Theresa May for the party leadership, was sacked days after warning the Prime Minister not to fire female ministers. It is a similar story in the Education department, which last night was awaiting its sixth Universities Minister in two years following the departure of Chris Skidmore. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Ben Wallace, the Defence secretary, held onto his job despite overnight reports that he could be sacked by Mr Johnson after it emerged that he was not attending this weekend's security conference in Munich. Number 10 had briefed on Wednesday that Mr Wallace was being replaced by Andrew Murrison, a Foreign Office minister. However Mr Murrison was then sacked in a 8.30am phone call by Mr Johnson yesterday. At the Department for Transport, Grant Shapps stayed on as Secretary of State but lost two of his junior ministers George Freeman and Nusrat Ghani, who had been tipped to be new HS2 minister. There was a return to the Government for new Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt, who was not reappointed as Defence secretary by Mr Johnson last summer. Mark Spencer who had been pushing to be made Environment secretary remained as Government's chief whip. James Brokenshire returned to Government as a minister of state in the Home Office while Jeremy Quin was made a minister of state in the Ministry of Defence. Helen Whately has been made minister of state in the Department of Health and Social Care and Chloe Smith is prompted to minister of state in the Cabinet Office. \</doc>

My new favourite horror-hobby is watching videos of enormous planes trying to land in the middle of Storm Dennis. The best was of an Etihad A380 arriving at Heathrow. It came in slow, almost hovering, and the mad, age-of-extreme-weather winds turned it 90 degrees. Gazing from their windows, passengers over the wing would have been able to look clean down the runway. Then, feet from the ground, the pilot somehow swung it back. On the one hand, how heartening to know such pilots exist. On the other, I may never fly again. Of course, I probably shouldn't anyway. There have, of late, been a lot of storms. We've all noticed, right? Back in November, Boris Johnson nipped up to Matlock in Derbyshire to be filmed swishing a mop around. He's bored with storms now, though, even though the papers are full of families in dinghies and sad swans swimming past pubs. This weekend it was left to our new environment secretary, George Eustice, to don some wellies and head to York. "The fact is," he said grimly, "these extreme weather events are becoming more common." There will be some who wish to debate that fact, perhaps by emailing me pictures of sad swans in floods gone past. I have no intention of getting in the way of their fun, just like I have no intention of reading their emails. More interesting, however, is the dissonance between this message and the government that's delivering it. A government that intends to decarbonise the British economy within 30 years, and which is to host the 26th United Nations climate change conference in November where, Johnson says, "we have a responsibility to lead the way". And yet which is also a government chock full of people like him. He's not the worst, Eustice. Especially when you consider that he stood as an EU parliamentary candidate for Ukip in 1999, alongside Nigel Farage, who at that point called climate change "the new witchcraft". Skip forward a decade and a bit, and he was even a climate change adviser to David Cameron. This sounds promising until you read his advice about onshore wind turbines, which was basically "stop them now". You can still find an entry on his blog from this time, in which he complains about seeing them in Cornwall. "Some turbines are tall, some short," he writes indignantly. "Some have two blades, some three. Some are black, some are white. And they are everywhere." Are those the words of somebody who is totally getting the big picture? At around the same time, 106 Tory MPs wrote to Cameron to insist that he scrap subsidies for onshore wind. Ten of them wrote last year to Johnson insisting that he reintroduce them, which I suppose just shows how strong the wind can be. Of the first lot, though, no fewer than five - Matt Hancock, Stephen Barclay, Brandon Lewis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg - are now senior ministers. It gets worse. The man he has put in charge of the UN summit is Alok Sharma, the new business secretary. His climate longtail seems pretty clear, possibly because until recently nobody knew who he was. There he will be in November, though, standing alongside a foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who spent the Cameron government arguing against "inflating consumer energy bills by gambling on existing inefficient and expensive renewable technologies". Or perhaps he'll be introducing all those climate scientists and policymakers to our new chancellor Rishi Sunak, whose own blog (honestly, why do these people always forget about their blogs?) features a column he wrote for The Yorkshire Post four years ago in which he enthused that Britain could get another 24 billion barrels of oil out of the North Sea. So what does he think about the prime minister declaring that "a catastrophic addiction to fossil fuels is cloaking the planet like a tea-cosy"? For context, 24 billion barrels is roughly half as much as we've got out of it since the 1970s. Which is an uncomfortable ambition, let's just say, for the guy who is going to be setting the budgets that will supposedly neutralise our carbon footprint within a generation. It's counterintuitive enough to have Johnson himself talking the green talk, given his own track record of openly crankish climate change scepticism but at least we're used to him expediently saying things he doesn't mean. One look at his cabinet, though, suggests that the problem is institutional. There have been Conservative climate successes but not thanks to this lot. These are the footsoldiers of the great Euroscepticism/climate scepticism crossover, and have less in common with Cameron in his green days than they do with Lord Lawson of Blaby. And yet here they are, promising to ban combustion cars, and gas boilers, and heavy industry. Even if the rest of the world doesn't follow our lead. Whatever the cost. Are we supposed to believe that they have changed their minds? That they deeply regret everything they thought and said until five minutes ago? Did Sunak see a single David Attenborough documentary, weep at a penguin, and go off the oil thing? Or what? Either way, I struggle to believe that this government has the stomach or conviction for the fights ahead with the car makers, with motorists, with energy companies, with consumers, with manufacturers, with everybody. We are, right now, on that plane, blowing sideways. But look who is flying the thing. Adopt the crash position now. \</doc>

Swedish climate-change activist HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greta-thunberg Greta Thunberg has been named Time'sPerson of the Year. The 16-year-old has "succeeded in turning vague anxieties about the planet into a worldwide movement calling for global change", the magazine wrote in its announcement on Wednesday. In an extended feature, it added: "She is an ordinary teenage girl who, in summoning the courage to speak truth to power, became the icon of a generation." The Swede set off a wave of protests in opposition to man-made climate change with her Friday school strikes. The Time accolade was announced as Greta accused world leaders of seeking to burnish their images, rather than taking strong action to curb global warming. Speaking at the UN's COP25 climate-change summit in Madrid, she said: "The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR. "It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition." Politicians at the conference are hashing out the implementation of 2015's Paris Agreement, which is designed to limit warming. On Wednesday, negotiators in Madrid had one eye on Brussels, where the EU announced the European Green Deal - a new plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions. Svenja Schulze, Germany's environment minister, said she hoped the deal would "give the discussions here a boost". Additional reporting by agencies \</doc>

WHERE is our outrage? Why are our politicians standing by and watching one of their number being bullied by a politician whose party hasn't been voted for in any numbers in Scotland for more than 50 years? A politician who could in Scotland convene a meeting of his supporters in a telephone box. READ MORE:\~Nicola Sturgeon requests role for Scotland in COP summit planning Boris Johnson's machinations to exclude the First Minister of Scotland from attending the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow in November is an insult to ALL Scottish politicians of every persuasion. Have Scottish politicians sunk to such a low level of tribalism that they don't even have the integrity shown by journalists when Downing Street tried to only select the journalists that they perhaps thought would present their governance in a favourable light? To our journalists' eternal credit they stood in solidarity with each other and in defence of a free press. But what of our Scottish politicians? Boris Johnson acts as if he were some British Viceroy of Scotland and Carlaw, Leonard and Rennie's silence condone his behaviour. Thomas Brotherston THE COP26 - green conference - is coming to Glasgow but our First Minister is barred from attending. World leaders will be at this event and listening to Boris talking nonsense and claiming any credit for green policies enacted by the SNP in Scotland. Maybe there's a role here for All Under One Banner to call as many independence supporters as possible to demonstrate outside the conference venue, bringing Saltires and banners proclaiming our independence. Even the BBC will have problems denying this happened if we can get enough people to demonstrate. While the eyes of the world are looking at Scotland for COP26, let them get the message, loud and clear, that Scotland wants its independence. Cllr Kenny MacLaren Paisley A VERY interesting article in The National yesterday by Kevin McKenna (Who are we to tell English Brexiteers that they are all stupid and wrong?, February 5). It does help to explain why decades of neglect and apathy shown to the people of the regions of England have made them feel alienated and disaffected enough to kick back at the elite and vote for Brexit. However, the abiding mystery remains. What on earth makes them believe that Boris Johnson's right-wing cabal have the slightest inclination to do anything to make their lives better? Douglas Turner Edinburgh THE point is not that Joe Bloggs can't name a single tangible benefit of Brexit when interviewed but that neither can Johnson, Farage, Gove or anyone of the Brexiteer elite. The response to years of austerity by the Tories is to give the Tories more power. Labour have been absolutely useless in protecting their voters but still, if voting Leave wasn't stupid, it sure as hell wasn't smart. Markus Mattila via thenational.scot I'VE always imagined the BBC's Glenn Campbell to be a fair and impartial observer of Scottish constitutional affairs, however I was surprised when I read his pearly words of wisdom in yesterday's online piece titled "Scottish independence: How Brexit has changed the debate over EU membership". In an otherwise fair piece he couldn't help himself when listing the "hurdles" Scotland would have to overcome, saying: "the EU requires new members to sign up to joining the euro, although Sweden offers a masterclass in how to avoid actually adopting the currency." What is missing from that statement is precisely why Scotland should be suspicious of BBC political commentators. He should have said that the EU requires new members to sign up to joining the euro, in principle. The cunning Swedes are not on their own - there are eight countries including Sweden within the EU that do not use the euro, simply because they are not compelled to do so. They are Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Mike Herd Highland FROM reading the letters page recently, one would think that we are living in a Stalinist state where no criticism of the supreme leader can be brooked. Independence is a many-splendoured thing and is not limited to any single person or any one party. Many of your readers seem to think that it is acceptable to criticise a 71-year-old lady for expressing her feelings and opinion honestly, but not the elected leader of a political party who should be open to public scrutiny? I can't help but feel I was conned into voting for the SNP in the General Election and I won't be making that mistake again. Solomon Steinbett Glasgow WE need to get out of Westminster as it is patently obvious that their definition of democracy is to ignore Scotland and the SNP. Our SNP MPs blocked from voting in a bid to secure an extra \£34bn for Scotland's NHS, and Labour leader hopeful Lisa Nandy suggesting that the SNP be barred from any TV debates etc. Don't they all just hate the success of the SNP? Lisa hen, you keep on spouting your anti-democratic tosh as you are doing a good job for our independence! Anne Smart Milton of Campsie SO Lisa Nandy thinks the SNP should be excluded from Question Time etc. Is that because everyone can then see how knowledgeable they are and how much good sense they speak, showing up the rest of them?

French environmental activists brandished stolen portraits of President Emmanuel Macron at a protest yesterday near the Eiffel Tower to try to push the government to do more to fight climate change. The protest is part of an unusual climate movement that has taken root around France in which activists have stolen more than 130 portraits of Macron from town halls. They feel the business-friendly Macron is not doing enough to reduce emissions, even though he portrays himself on the global stage as Mr Climate. The activists carried the portraits upside down to show what they consider Mr Macron\'e2(EURO)(TM)s hypocrisy - to call for bolder government action at the UN COP25 climate talks under way in Madrid. Pauline Boyer from climate group ANV COP21, said the demonstration was to show "that Emmanuel Macron uses doublespeak, by presenting himself as a climate champion while he is not enforcing a true policy in France that could tackle the environment challenge\'e2(EURO). Activists are notably angry that France has lagged on its international commitments to increase use of solar and wind energy and reduce emissions. Mr Macron has stood up to US President Donald Trump on the need for countries and business to co-operate to cut emissions. However, he backed down on a fuel tax last year meant to help wean France off fossil fuels, because the tax triggered a protest movement against economic injustice. The activists at Sunday\'e2(EURO)(TM)s protest held 100 portraits, to mark 100 days until France\'e2(EURO)(TM)s mayoral elections. They want to urge future mayors to take local climate action. \</doc>

HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu http://www.europarl.europa.eu On Tuesday morning, MEPs discussed their priorities for the upcoming December Summit with the Finnish Council Presidency's Tytti Tuppurainen and Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans. Political group leaders representing a broad majority called for immediate progress on the negotiations for the next long-term EU investment budget (Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027).They highlighted the need for appropriate funding and policies to ensure EU citizens' economic prosperity and global leadership on climate change, innovation (especially in "green" technology) and just transition policies. Many speakers also warned that any further delay would disrupt EU-funded programmes, which would disproportionately harm citizens, regions, cities, farmers, researchers, students, NGOs and businesses. Read more about Parliament's position. MEPs highlighted that the European Council discussion on an EU long-term climate strategy and on how to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 will take place only a few days after the 2019 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ). Stressing that climate change is an absolute priority, MEPs called for immediate, concrete action to be taken. Most speakers commented on the climate neutrality objectives set for 2050, with many urging for even more ambitious targets to be set. Other topics raised include the accession of North Macedonia and Albania, cohesion and agriculture policies, defence and security, migration, global instability, and the protection of European common values, including the rule of law.

One of Papua New Guinea's largest companies and investors, Oil Search, has teamed up with Swedish energy, industry and infrastructure design and consulting company AFRY and the Climate Change and Development Authority of Papua New Guinea for a new project combining biomass and solar power. The PNG Biomass project is an integrated renewable energy project combining a 30MW biomass plant and a solar PV farm. On 6 December the companies signed a memorandum of understanding at the 25 th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain. Ninning Jal, health, safety and environment supervisor for PNG Biomass, said: "PNG Biomass is the first proposed utility-scale renewable biomass and solar power generation project in Papua New Guinea. "We believe PNG Biomass will substantially enhance Papua New Guinea's reputation in demonstrating climate action and help transition the country to a fully renewable energy sector." Michael Henson, project director at PNG Biomass, added that the project is also unique because it relies on the participation and support of landowners and communities. He said: "At the core of our project is the objective to power Papua New Guinea with affordable, domestic low-emission renewable energy through an inclusive economic growth model that empowers local communities. We are powering Papua New Guinea and empowering communities." Richard Pinnock, head of AFRY's Energy division said: "AFRY's mission is to create sustainable engineering and design solutions with a clear focus to support our clients to accelerate their energy transition towards a sustainable future. We are very proud to be part of the brave leadership of all parties associated with making the PNG Biomass project a reality." \</doc>

Ursula von der Leyen | Photo credit: European Parliament Audiovisual The details of the Commission's European Green Deal were revealed amid great fanfare on Wednesday, receiving widespread approval from MEPs. Speaking ahead of her European Parliament debate with MEPs, Ursula von der Leyen said, "This is a very special day. This morning the College of Commissioners agreed on the European Green Deal. The European Green Deal is, on the one hand, our vision for a climate-neutral continent in 2050, and on the other hand a very dedicated roadmap whose goal is 50 actions for 2050." "Our goal is to reconcile the economy with our planet, to reconcile the way we produce, the way we consume, with our planet and to make it work for our people. The European Green Deal is on the one hand about cutting emissions, but on the other hand about creating jobs and boosting innovation." RELATED CONTENT EU policymakers gear up to underscore urgency of climate action at COP25 Climate change 'did not originate' in the Arctic, conference hears MEPs to press Commission to declare "state of climate emergency" in Europe COP25 COP25 'critical' in ensuring 2015 Paris Agreement put in place, says senior MEP Environmental campaigners question EU's 'level of ambition' in tackling climate change Von der Leyen said she was convinced that the old growth model based on fossil fuels and pollution is "out of date and out of touch with our planet," adding "the European Green Deal is our new growth strategy that gives more back than it takes away." "This is Europe's man on the moon moment. The European Green Deal is very ambitious, but it will be very careful in assessing the impact of every single step we're taking," von der Leyen added. The deal, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, is a roadmap for making the EU's economy sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities across all policy areas and making the transition "just and inclusive for all." It covers all sectors of the economy, most notably transport, energy, agriculture, buildings, and industries such as steel, cement, ICT, textiles and chemicals. "Our goal is to reconcile the economy with our planet, to reconcile the way we produce, the way we consume, with our planet and to make it work for our people" Ursula von der Leyen The Commission said that meeting the objectives of the European Green Deal will require "significant investment" and that achieving the current 2030 climate and energy targets will require an estimated (EURO)260bn of additional annual investment, representing about 1.5 percent of 2018 GDP. It added that at least 25 percent of the EU's long-term budget should be dedicated to climate action, and that the European Investment Bank, Europe's "climate bank", will provide further support. Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans, who is responsible for the European Green Deal, said, 'We are in a climate and environmental emergency. The European Green Deal is an opportunity to improve the health and well-being of our people by transforming our economic model." He added, "Our plan sets out how to cut emissions, restore the health of our natural environment, protect our wildlife, create new economic opportunities, and improve the quality of life of our citizens. We all have an important part to play and every industry and country will be part of this transformation." After a two-hour plenary debate on the European Green Deal, in which both von der Leyen and Timmermans laid out the finer points of the plans and listened to MEP interventions, deputies appeared on the whole to be impressed with the executive's drive to tackle climate change. The S&D Group said afterwards: "Eleven days into the new EU Commission, thanks to Frans Timmermans, we have a model to transform the EU into a more just and prosperous society to take on the challenge of climate change." Renew Europe said it was "fully on board to make the EU Green Deal a success," adding, "a binding commitment to net-zero emissions at the latest by 2050 will be a powerful tool to mobilise the necessary political, economic and technological forces for this all-round transition." "This is Europe's man on the moon moment. The European Green Deal is very ambitious, but it will be very careful in assessing the impact of every single step we're taking" Ursula von der Leyen EPP Chairman Manfred Weber said that with the European Green Deal Europe is "showing that we Europeans are taking the fight against climate change seriously." "We don't want fossil-free shock therapy of stop signs and taxes, we want to fight climate change through innovation and modern technology. If we want to deliver on our ambition, we need to make sure that climate policy is one that leaves no-one behind," he added. The Greens said "the Commission's EU Green Deal is a necessary step, but now we need to see real climate action. We hope this deal works to: help limit global warming to 1.5C, reduce social inequalities, replace a neo-liberal model with a sustainable model and put finance at service of people." GUE/NGL co-President Manon Aubry was even less impressed with the Commission's plans, saying, "The objectives of the EU Green Deal are not serious. The Green New Deal must enshrine in law a binding priority objective: a 70 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030." "Any climate initiative will be in vain if it does not tackle the cause of the problem: an economic system that drives both the destruction of our ecosystem and the explosion of inequalities." She added, "This plan ignores the human & social dimension of the ecological transition even though precarious workers are the first victims of this crisis. The ridiculously small transition fund won't be a game changer." The thorny issue of Brexit also reared its head in the reactions to the European Green Deal, with some UK MEPs lamenting the fact that the UK will soon no longer be able to take part in this European plan to tackle climate change. "Our plan sets out how to cut emissions, restore the health of our natural environment, protect our wildlife, create new economic opportunities, and improve the quality of life of our citizens" Frans Timmermans \</doc>

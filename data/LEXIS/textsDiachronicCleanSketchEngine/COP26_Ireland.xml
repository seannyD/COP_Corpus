Extinction Rebellion climate activists have conducted a funeral ceremony for Cop26 in Glasgow over its "failure and stupidity". Protesters calling themselves red and blue rebels led a procession across Church Lane Bridge, known locally as The Bridge of Sighs, to Glasgow Necropolis on Saturday. The activists laid down next to rows of individual "headstones" while others walked between them and performed grief poses. \~ The blue rebels carried a person cloaked in a black robe labelled " Cop26 ", who was lowered to the ground while a piper played laments, including Flowers Of The Forest. An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said that Cop26 is the culmination of a failed process. An XR member from the Isle of Barra identified only as Karen said: "We are here grieving for a planet that has been sacrificed by the failure and stupidity of Cop26 . Cop26 were commitments to leaving oil in the ground and an immediate halt to fossil fuel funding. "Anything less than that is idiocy. "As intelligent life on this planet we are already extinct. We know exactly what we need to do and we're not doing it."

Sir, - I read with dismay the following phrase from your report at the Cop26 conference: "Taoiseach stresses pledge is global and not national." If global methane emissions are to be reduced by 30 per cent, wealthy nations will need to reduce their individual outputs by at least that amount. And Ireland is most certainly a wealthy nation within the global context. The Taoiseach's comments display a total lack of solidarity with the climate pledge, and prepare the ground for Ireland to fall far short in our attempt to meet this target. A 30 per cent global target requires a 30 per cent national target. Anything less means we are expecting other nations to do the work for us. Ireland is a small country. But this is not simply a matter of scale; it is one of responsibility. Last year we had the EU's second highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, behind only Luxembourg. Let's hope the others adopt a more proactive attitude. - Yours, etc, JAMES BROWNE, Phibsborough, Dublin 7. Sir, - In his interview at Cop26 yesterday the Taoiseach accepted that Ireland's emissions would increase in the short term. He makes the basic error of assuming it's purely a Government responsibility. In contrast David Attenborough appealed to everyone to rise to the challenge. I suggest Miche\'e1l Martin shows leadership and asks everyone in the country to make simple changes to show we are listening. Simple changes such as drive 20 per cent less, cycle, walk, use the bus or train. Turn the heating thermostat down two degrees. Wear warmer clothes. Reduce meat and dairy consumption. Reduce the number of flights you take, grow your own vegetables. We have done so well as a nation in the pandemic, let's keep showing what we can achieve as a nation when we have a common goal. - Yours, etc, DAVID SPROTT, Ballincollig, Cork. Sir, - At a time when massive industries all over the globe are pumping out trillions of metric tonnes of carbon in order to manufacture countless unnecessary luxuries for our delectation, and while a substantial number of people in the world are starving, I find it curious that a primary focus of the Cop26 should be to reduce the production of food? I suggest a recalibration of values might be in order. - Yours, etc, TOM FANTHOM, Newcastle, Wicklow. Sir, - Kevin O'Sullivan reports that "China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has failed to increase its commitments to address the climate crisis as demanded by other countries at the Cop26 climate summit." (News, November 2nd). Many Cop26 - Yours, etc, EILEEN McDERMOTT, Harold's Cross, Dublin 6W. \</doc>

As COP26 comes to a close this weekend, we spoke to some people both inside and outside the conference after two weeks of the climate change conference, and asked them to sum it up in one word. Liliane Viola Pollmann, Germany One word to describe COP26 : Demanding "I chose the word demanding in both terms; on one hand it's very obvious we\' re demanding climate justice and demanding ambitious climate action in several actions and protests also in this venue, but also on a very personal level and on a mental level. "it\' s demanding, trying to follow the negotiations, trying to get into plenaries, to events, trying to somehow organise ourselves, our delegations and not losing our minds during all this." Sandy Boyd, Scotland One word to describe COP26 : Joke "Not to trivialise it, but it has been a shambles from day one. Souleymane Ouedraogo, Burkina Faso One word to describe COP26 : Funding "I choose the word funding, because the global north needs to fund the global south, because right now when you look at global south countries, most people are suffering due to climate change and they need this funding. Janmejai Tiwari, India One word to describe COP26 : Accessibility "For me, there is a difficulty that we have to face specifically for the youth activists and people who are coming from the global south, not just inside COP or just being here, because there are lots of delegations coming from the global south. "We had to face several issues just to get VISAS. It's hard for the voice of the global south to be heard. "Then you come inside the COP and the accessibility for the youth, it\' s very difficult, we saw in the first week at the World Leaders Summit there were hardly tickets for youth organisations. Snigdha Tiwari, India One word to describe COP26 : Insufficient "I think it is very insufficient, in terms of delivering what we want today. The COP process is a very long process and they are pledging goals that they will achieve in 2030, 2040, 2050 and 2070 for some countries, but the crisis that we are facing is today, so COP for me is insufficient because it is not delivering on sufficient measures for the crisis or the loss and damage countries like mine are facing." Coll McCail, Scotland One word to describe COP26 : Sham "It's a complete mess. You\' ve got people from the global south excluded due to vaccine apartheid." "You have got activists on the outside, who also desperately need to be on the inside if we want to deliver the radical solutions that the urgency of our crisis so desperately requires." Fabiana Zanutti, Argentina COP26 Responsibility "We demand in the COP26 that the global north take responsibility for the global south, because our countries are the countries that are suffering from the political practices of the global north. "We suffer the consequences of climate change and we need support from the global north." \</doc>

An estimated 30,000 people will descend on Glasgow this weekend for the COP26 climate change summit. There is a lot riding on it, with many seeing it as the last chance to curtail the growing climate crisis. What is COP26 ? COP26 is the next UN climate change conference that is taking place in Glasgow from Sunday, October 31, 2021 - Friday, November 12, 2021. What does COP26 stand for? COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and will be attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1994. The 2021 meeting in Glasgow is the 26th conference held, which is why 26 is in the name. The Paris Conference in 2015 was called the COP21. Where is it being held? Who is going to be at COP26 ? Delegates from more than 190 countries will be attending the conference. This also includes thousands of negotiators, interpreters, journalists and observer organisations. UK politicians such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnston will be present. US politicians John Kerry and President Joe Biden will also attend, this is significant after the former administration pulled out of the Paris Agreement. The US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry is set to be a major part of discussions, and President Joe Biden will be at the event too. High profile guests also include climate activists Greta Thunberg, broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough and Pope Francis. However, there has been some hesitancy on travelling during Covid, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stating he may not attend as he is focussing on reopening his country. The UK has said it will be "very disappointed" if Prime Minister Morrison does not attend as Australia is the second largest coal exporter in the world. The Queen set to miss COP26 The Queen will not be attending the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, after her medical team advised her to rest. Why is the COP26 The COP26 It will also examine how well countries have honoured their commitments under the Paris Agreement in 2015 to limit global warming to well below 2 . What about Covid? The conference was meant to be scheduled for November 2020 but because of rising Covid cases it was delayed. The Scottish government, the UN and the UK\' s national government have all been working together to ensure precautions are taken. The event was decided to be held in person, instead of digitally to help countries work together and make progress on climate change. There was a concern that if the conference was done online that it may be hard getting countries to commit to change. People travelling from red list countries, will still be required to quarantine and delegates who have not been able to get the vaccine yet will be able to do so, at the UK's expense. \</doc>

The Cop26 conference has driven up the sales of Irish Christmas trees by ten per cent. Christmas tree growers are having a bumper year thanks to the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Scotland over a two-week period last month. Former chairman of the Irish Christmas Trees Growers Christy Kavanagh said that the message of "sustainability" from the international conference has driven sales to buy real and local trees. "There's no doubt about it sales have boomed since Cop26 which is really positive for everyone working in the industry and for the country as a whole. "The public has really listened to the Cop26 message. They are also listening to the fact that Irish Christmas trees have a disease free status which many other countries don't have," explained Mr Kavanagh. AdvertisementMr Kavanagh, along with three generations of his family met with President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina last week at \'c1ras an Uachtar\'e1in to present him with a Christmas tree as he was awarded the prize winner of the National Christmas Tree Competition in 2021. He was the first-time prize winner in all three categories of tree types and also supreme champion by the Association. This has been the first time any grower has had all three categories, winning best Noble Fir, Nordmann Fir and Korean Fir. Nationwide sales Nationwide sales, according to Mr Kavanagh, have also increased on last year by (EURO)2.3 million to (EURO)25.3 million. More than 600,000 trees have been sold on the Irish market, conservatively by up to 55,000 on last year. More than 200,000 trees were exported to European markets, such as Germany and France and in the UK, which is a continued yearly increase. More than 200,000 trees were exported to European markets, such as Germany and France and in the UK, which is a continued yearly increase. Mr Kavanagh added: "We have had to bring more trees to the market even this past week due to demand being greater than the ready supply. 'Agri-tainment' "Agri-tainment which is huge in the US seems to be catching on here, and it looks like it will continue to grow hugely. By agritainment I mean visiting the farm, having the growing process explained to them and all that incorporates." The Association which runs Operation Hurdle in cooperation with the garda\'ed since 2011 said the special seasonal operation designed to prevent the theft of Christmas trees in the Wicklow and Dublin areas has not encountered any thefts again this year. According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Operation Hurdle which has been running since 2011 has dramatically driven down tree thefts. Prior to Operation Hurdle criminal gangs had successfully plundered numerous farms across the country, snatching more than 2,000 festive trees annually costing growers more than (EURO)100,000. "Advancements in technology has helped to deter thefts due to ease of tracking them and their movements," added Mr Kavanagh. \</doc>

COP26 'S first week heard promises to end deforestation, phase out coal and mobilise trillions for green investment but there is a huge gulf between proclamations and the emissions cuts required. The conference aimed to implement the Paris Agreement and press releases suggest all is well with the much hyped "climate crisis" under control but outside the PR bubble the "coal, cars, cash and trees" mantra remains a remote objective. There is a glaring disconnect between inflated, rejigged pledges and genuine progress. Declarations melt in the light of day with finance the crunch issue. Developing nations demand the West make good on decade-old promises to give $100 billion a year. Mark Carney says lenders will contribute but they only need to allocate a tiny percentage of capital to green projects to qualify as net-zero lenders and can still invest in fossil fuels. The UK is trailing 1.8C as a Cop26 achievement but it is based on vague net-zero plans with virtually no short-term emissions targets. Most of the net-zero pledges are void of content with emissions going in the wrong direction. All Cop26 DR JOHN CAMERON, St Andrews \</doc>

An Israeli government minister has received an apology from organisers of Cop26 and Boris Johnson after she could not attend the summit on Monday due to a lack of wheelchair accessibility. Karine Elharrar, minister of energy, criticised organisers of the global conference on Twitter after failing to get access to the campus on its opening day. She wrote: "To Cop26 I came to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a joint fight against the climate crisis. "It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not take care of accessibility at its events. "I hope that the lessons required to be learned tomorrow to promote green energies, remove barriers and energy efficiency will be the things I deal with." The minister told Israel's Channel 12 that she was given the option of walking on foot for several hundred yards or to board a shuttle which was not wheelchair accessible.

The Conference of Parties COP26 climate talks have agreed to get countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting targets for 2030 by the end of next year in a bid to limit dangerous warming. Ministers and negotiators at the UN summit in Glasgow have also sent a signal on the shift away from the world's dirtiest fuel, with a deal calling for efforts to escalate the "phase down" of unabated coal, as well as the phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The Glasgow Pact was watered down at the last minute - following a push by India and China - from escalating the "phase out" of unabated coal, to "phase down", prompting angry responses from European and vulnerable countries. But it is the first explicit mentions of fossil fuels in a UN climate agreement that was the result of two weeks of tortuous negotiations that had to be extended for an extra day. The deal HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/news/newslens/2021/1113/1259768-cop26-deal-climate-change/ aims to keep limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels "alive" or within reach, in the face of a huge gap between the action countries are taking and what is needed to meet the goal. In the wake of the agreement being gavelled through - more than 24 hours after the official finishing time of the conference, there were warnings that the 1.5C goal was "on life support". As the final deal was clinched, a tearful Alok Sharma, Britain's president of the COP26 summit, said: "I apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry," before banging down his gavel. Later, he told reporters that he wished he had been able to preserve the originally agreed language on phasing out coal power in the Glasgow climate deal. "Nevertheless, we do have language on coal, on phase down, and I don't think anyone at the start of this process would have necessarily expected that would have been retained." Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said that while the HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2021/1113/1259703-ireland-cop26-climate/ deal "gives us a chance of keeping 1.5 degrees alive", the last minute agreement on coal as "deeply disappointing". Agreement has been reached at HYPERLINK # COP26 in Glasgow. It gives us a chance of keeping 1.5 degrees alive. The last minute deal on coal was deeply disappointing but we had to agree a deal.

Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the UN, said the outcome of COP26 was a "compromise" that reflected the interests, contradictions and state of political will in the world today. "It's an important step, but it's not enough. It's time to go into emergency mode. The climate battle is the fight of our lives and that fight must be won."

We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe." The President of the EU Commission has described COP26 as "a step in the right direction". Ursula von der Leyen added: "1.5 degrees Celsius remains within reach; but the work is far from done." EU Executive vice president Frans Timmermans said he was "disappointed" that the language on coal had been diluted. "It is no secret to this gathering that the European Union would have wanted to go even further than the initial text in the cover agreement on coal," he admitted. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted about the "serious breakthroughs" made at Cop26 in Glasgow. He said: "We've made serious breakthroughs @ COP26 . We've kept 1.5 alive and made huge progress on coal, cars, cash and trees. "And while there is still so much that needs to be done to save our planet, we'll look back at COP26 as the moment humanity finally got real about climate change." Amanda Mukwashi, chief executive of Christian Aid, said: "We were told that COP26 was the last best chance to keep 1.5C alive, but it's been placed on life support. "Rich nations have kicked the can down the road and with it the promise of the urgent climate action people on the front line of this crisis need." Alok Sharma had earlier told the delegates from nearly 200 countries faced a "moment of truth for our planet, for our children and our grandchildren. So much rests on decisions taken collectively". Much-threatened island states including Fiji, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu all signalled their support, despite pushing for much more financial support as they risk being swallowed by rising seas. India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav earlier told delegates that developing countries had the "right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels". "The US has to support the most vulnerable on the issue of loss and damage. They cannot avoid this issue any longer. Nor can the European Union," she added. "I would call on President (Joe) Biden to do what's right, and support the most vulnerable in helping them deal with their losses." Although host Britain said it wanted COP26 to keep the 1.5C temperature cap in reach, a UN scientific assessment last week said countries' latest climate plans put Earth on course to heat 2.7C. Today's text noted "with deep regret" that wealthy nations had also failed to stump up a separate annual sum of $100 billion they promised over a decade ago. It urged countries to pay up "urgently and through 2025". But developing nations said it was unfair for the summit to produce an unbalanced agreement heavily weighted toward "mitigation" - how economies can ditch fossil fuels and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They wanted specific instruction on how they can meet the bill of decarbonising while also adapting to the natural disasters supercharged by global warming. The two weeks in Glasgow saw a number of high-profile announcements from world leaders, such as a commitment to slash methane emissions by 30% by 2030. It also witnessed mass protests against what activists said was a dangerous lack of urgency. Additional reporting: Conor Macauley \</doc>

World leaders must deliver on their promises to curb dangerous climate change at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow, the conference's president has warned. Alok Sharma is calling for leaders to honour the Paris Agreement in 2015, which committed countries to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the most dangerous climate impacts will be felt. COP26 president will say the latest round of UN climate talks in less than three weeks must secure agreement to accelerate climate action this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive. The Paris Agreement, signed by countries at UN talks six years ago, commits countries to keeping temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit them to 1.5C. But current action and pledges leave the world well off track to meeting the goal and avoiding the most dangerous heat waves, floods, damage to natural systems, rising sea levels and spread of diseases that higher temperatures will bring. COP26 is the deadline by which countries are expected to bring forward more ambitious plans, under a five-year cycle, to get the world on track to meet the Paris goals and is being seen as the most significant since the talks in the French capital. For COP26 Concrete action is needed to deliver the plans, including agreements on reducing coal, boosting electric cars, protecting trees and cutting emissions of methane, a powerful but short-lived greenhouse gas. And countries must deliver on their promise - made at a UN summit more than a decade ago - to provide $100 billion a year in finance to help developing nations cope with climate change and develop cleanly.

There must also be new commitments on finance to support the countries most vulnerable to climate change and progress on helping communities adapt to the crisis, accounting for the loss and damage it can cause. COP26 is not a photo op or a talking shop. "It must be the forum where we put the world on track to deliver on climate. "And that is down to leaders. It is leaders who made a promise to the world in this great city six years ago. And it is leaders that must honour it. "Responsibility rests with each and every country. And we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed or fail as one." He will say that efforts have been made to make COP26 the most inclusive that has been held despite the challenges of holding it during a pandemic, with measures including provision of vaccines, daily testing and social distancing in the venue. Mr Sharma will warn it is an "extraordinary COP in extraordinary times" and urge countries to pull together to make it work "because we have no choice but to deliver". "Each country must step up.

The Green Party leader and Minister for the Climate Eamon Ryan has tested positive for Covid-19 and has had to cancel his plans to travel to the COP26 conference in Glasgow. Minister Ryan is not experiencing symptoms of the virus and discovered he was positive after taking a precautionary PCR test yesterday before attending COP26 on the advice of the conference organisers. He is now self-isolating and had advised the HSE of his close contacts, including those he encountered 24 hours before the test. The Taoiseach, who was not officially deemed a close contact of Minister Ryan, has tested negative for Covid-19, following an antigen test this evening. Miche\'e1l Martin also tested negative earlier this week after taking a PCR test on return from COP26 . A spokesperson for Mr Varadkar said he has been "advised that he does not need to restrict his movements and can continue working as normal, in line with public health advice". It's understood the wider cabinet are not deemed close contacts of Minister Ryan. The rest of the delegation due to attend the conference will continue with their travel plans. \</doc>

Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan is to travel to Cop26 as a follow-up test indicated he does not have Covid-19. After his initial positive test on Saturday, Mr Ryan received notification from the HSE that a second test was recommended. "This result of this test showed Covid-19 was not detected. The public health advice in this instance is that the case is denotified," a spokesman for Mr Ryan said. He now plans to travel to Glasgow today and will lead the Irish delegation at the summit. Mr Ryan had not been symptomatic and underwent the initial test as a precautionary measure as recommended by Cop26 organisers. Meanwhile, British prime minister Boris Johnson has underlined the need for greater progress as ministers return to Glasgow and join negotiators in attempting to forge agreement on the most contentious issues at Cop26 . Talks will centre mostly around what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Contentious parts of the 2015 Paris Agreement also need finalising, including markets for trading carbon emissions and transparency on what countries are doing. Discussions are continuing on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate. Cop26 chair Alok Sharma insisted on Saturday that progress so far is significant with 90 per cent of the world economies committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. He predicted more than $500 million would be secured for developing countries under climate finance between 2021-2025, which he acknowledged was "totemic and a matter of trust". \</doc>

Reactions to the climate deal agreed at the COP26 conference in Scotland last night. Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson " COP26 has made some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty. "Leaders have extended by a year this window of opportunity to avert the worst of the climate crisis. The world urgently needs them to step up more decisively next year." UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions." COP26 President Alok Sharma "I think today we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5 (degrees Celsius) within reach. But its pulse is weak, and we will only survive if we keep our promises. (...) History has been made here in Glasgow." Climate activist Greta Thunberg "The # COP26 is over," she tweeted. "Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah. "But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever." Green Party leader Eamon Ryan "Agreement has been reached at # COP26 in Glasgow. It gives us a chance of keeping 1.5 degrees alive. The last minute deal on coal was deeply disappointing but we had to agree a deal. We can no longer delay. It brings momentum at home & has to deliver climate justice for the world." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson "We asked nations to come together for our planet at COP26 , and they have answered that call. I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal." Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan "They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending. If you're a coal company executive this COP saw a bad outcome." WWF Global Lead on Climate Manuel Pulgar-Vidal Marshall Islands Climate Envoy Tina Stege "This package is not perfect. The coal change and a weak outcome on loss and damage are blows. But it is real progress and elements of the Glasgow Package are a lifeline for my country. We must not discount the crucial wins covered in this package" Costa Rice Environment and Energy Minister Andrea Meza "Of course, we wanted to see more in loss and damage. Of course, we wanted to see more in the adaptation finance package, but I think that it was a shift in certain ways. I think that for the first time, at least in some rooms, we have space to really have more frank conversations." \</doc>

BY any measure, the Glasgow climate pact signed at Cop26 is a historic agreement. It was the result of two years of marathon work, and a two-week sprint of negotiations, but we achieved what we wanted. We can credibly say that we kept the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in reach. And besides that, in it we have won historic commitments from countries to act on coal, cars, cash, and trees. These are valuable agreements that begin to fill in the details of how we will navigate this immense, worldwide challenge. Cop26 was the biggest political gathering of any kind ever held in Britain. Glasgow hosted representatives from 194 countries, and 120 world leaders, with 38,000 accredited delegates attending. From the outside, the negotiations may have appeared incredibly technocratic. But they were so much more than that. They were ultimately about protecting the lives and livelihoods of those on the frontline of the climate crisis. And protecting future generations who, if we fail, will be condemned to live in a dangerous, uncertain and depleted world. Science tells us that the world is already on average 1.1C warmer than in pre-industrial times, and many millions of people are already suffering from the acute effects of a changing climate. Extreme weather is on the rise across the world and climate change does not recognise national borders. Ultimately, the Glasgow climate pact is an outcome of which all parties can be proud. The co-operation we have seen in this process should give the world hope. In a world of fractured global politics, countries have shown a unity of purpose on the issue of climate. Yes, there were difficulties with these negotiations, particularly in the final hours when an agreement looked in real jeopardy. But overall, we saw a willingness from countries to compromise. There was growth in trust between nations, and a genuine determination to reach agreement. Driven by the latest science, our pact recognises the gulf between where countries are on emissions reductions and where we need to be. It emphasises the urgent need for faster action. It commits countries to revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions reductions targets and develop mid-century net-zero strategies in 2022. The pact makes progress on adaptation, finance, and loss and damage resulting from the climate crisis. And, for the first time, it commits to a plan to move away from coal power and inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies. Cop26 Outside the negotiating halls, we welcomed commitments that speed up the move to clean power and clean cars, that put the brakes on deforestation, and that increase the finance flowing to climate action. We can count:  An $8.5bn ((EURO)7.5bn) Just Energy Transition Partnership with South Africa;  Manufacturers representing around a third of the global car market committing to ending the sale of polluting vehicles;  A pledge from countries home to more than 90% of the world's forests to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation;  The highest single mobilisation to the Adaptation Fund, which supports climate- vulnerable communities. I could go on. With so many positive announcements, it could be tempting to become complacent. But this would be a mistake. The 1.5C limit lives. We brought it back from the brink. But its pulse remains weak. We must steer it to safety by ensuring countries deliver on the promises they have made, and on the expectations set out in this pact to increase climate ambition to 2030 and beyond. And this is why work as the Cop26 presidency is really only just beginning. Over the course of the next year, we will work with countries, urging them to take action and honour their promises. There is no formal policing process in the UN framework convention on climate change system, and so we must keep up the constructive pressure, and build on the trust and goodwill generated through Cop26 . And markets are falling into line, with the value of shares in coal firms around the world dropping since we sent a signal that coal is no longer king. We must grasp this moment. We know what we need to do. The world must now step up and take the fight forwards on finance, on adaptation, and on 1.5C. At the outset of the conference, the activist Brianna Fruean of Samoa told us: "2C could mean the end. 1.5C could mean a fighting chance." So many others like Brianna came to Cop to tell world leaders what climate change means for them. We owe it to all of them to deliver what we agreed in Glasgow.

Companies that stumped up millions of pounds to sponsor the Cop26 climate summit have condemned it as "mismanaged" and "very last minute" as next month's Glasgow event draws near. The sponsors, which include some of Britain's biggest companies, have raised formal complaints, blaming "very inexperienced" civil servants for delayed decisions, poor communication, and a breakdown in relations between the organisers and firms in the run up to the landmark talks. According to The Guardian , a letter to the organisers, written by broadcaster Sky and co-signed by senior leaders from other Cop26 The UK is running its Cop26 presidency from within the Cabinet Office, under the leadership of former business secretary Alok Sharma, who is Cop26 president, and businessman Nigel Topping, who was appointed as the UK government's high-level climate action champion last year. Sponsorship is expected to help defray a policing bill estimated to reach up to \£3250m ( 295m). Alongside Sky, the summit has 10 other major sponsors, including energy giants Hitachi, National Grid, Scottish Power, and SSE; US tech titan Microsoft; and FTSE companies GSK, NatWest, Reckitt, Sainsbury's, and Unilever. Unilever has denied signing the letter penned by Sky. Lower-tier "partners" include Jaguar Land Rover and Ikea. One source, employed by a Cop26 sponsor, said "the biggest frustration" was the lack of information about how the event will run and the role of its key backers, because important questions have gone unanswered and planning decisions have been delayed. "They had an extra year to prepare for Cop due to Covid, but it doesn't feel like this time was used to make better progress. Everything feels very last minute," the source said. The upcoming climate talks have already been thrown into turmoil by suggestions that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will skip the event, threatening the chances of a global pact with the world's biggest carbon dioxide emitter. In multiple emails and official letters, the companies have complained to organisers about unmet expectations and deepening concerns over delays to the green zone plans. Other sources have described the "shifting goal posts" and "inertia" plaguing the Cop26 planning as "deeply frustrating". One source blamed the "very young, very inexperienced" civil servants tasked with planning the event for taking a "top-down public sector approach" that has raised sponsors' hackles. "It's clear that many of them have very little experience managing relationships in the private sector, or even experience attending a Cop event," the source said. - The Guardian \</doc>

The UN Cop26 climate change event in Scotland has been dubbed a "failure" and the "most exclusionary ever" by one of the most recognisable climate justice activists, Greta Thunberg . The 18-year-old Swede told thousands of protesters on the streets of Glasgow yesterday that the event, which brought world leaders, business executives, academics, and media together for a two-week summit, was a "global north greenwash festival" . Greenwashing is the term used to describe firms and organisations embellishing their environmental credentials through slick marketing, scant evidence, or out-of-context claims. Ms Thunberg was part of a protest that saw people come from all over the world, including Ireland, to demand climate change action. More protests take place worldwide this weekend, including in Dublin and Cork . One of many young activists addressing thousands of protesters kept away from the Cop26 attendees in the Scottish Event Campus, Ms Thunberg said: "It is not a secret that Cop26 is a failure. It should be obvious that this crisis cannot be solved with the same methods that got us into it in the first place." Leaders are "actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system", Ms Thunberg said. "This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature, and the destruction of future and present living conditions, to take place." Fellow climate activist Vanessa Nakate said: "We need to continue holding leaders accountable for their actions. We cannot keep quiet about climate injustice." News: 12 \</doc>

Day five of COP26 will focus on Youth and Public Empowerment. Young climate leaders around the world will take to the stage. Ineza Umuhoza Grace from the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition says negotiators are still not hearing concerns from those in the most affected areas. "We have more than enough of saying and demanding without having a response," says Ineza Umuhoza Grace from Rwanda, she says she needs to return from COP26 with something tangible for her community. Ineza is co-director of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, she is speaking on behalf of people from Rwanda who have witnessed impacts of climate change through floods and soil erosion, she says people are facing food insecurity, and many of those most affected are the farmers who are women and children who are particularly vulnerable. The Eco Feminist is privy to some of the negotiations at COP26 , and says that so far they are not going well, she says their message is not being heard. "In regards, negotiations and the blocking of languages or they are not listening to our partners in the negotiation room, it's still present because they have not changed their tactics, they don\' t want to listen and most importantly the least developed countries are making their demands quite clear but no one is there is understand." She says it\' s only the end of week one and hopes there will be more positive news at the end of next week. From the perspective of Rwanda, Ineza says they have done less to cause the climate crisis, "but yet our community is at the frontline, so we experience the loss and damage in terms of flooding, erosion and landslide." She says in 2020, Rwanda lost more than 4,000 hectares of land due to soil erosion and flooding. "We at all in the red zone, it will only be possible for me and my children and my family and the older generation also to have a future unless the COP26 delivers, by delivering I mean quit the fake promises, give us some real tangible hope on the ground." The inevitable consequences of human-caused climate change are known as loss and damage, it is the third pillar of international climate policy after mitigation and adaptation. It refers to what has been lost that cannot be replaced due to climate change like human lives. Monday is the day dedicated to Loss and Damage at COP26 . \</doc>

The G20, a club of the world's wealthiest and most powerful countries, who together are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions, has the political and financial clout to set a course to avoiding catastrophic climate change impacts. Their gathering in Rome just before Cop26 was an opportunity to provide early momentum for the UN climate summit. The outcome has undoubtedly come up short, but analysts insist this should not be interpreted as an indication that Cop26 will not deliver what is urgently required to tackle the crisis. The G20 made significant progress, according to some observers, with a pledge to reach net-zero emissions by or around the middle of the century and take action this decade to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees. However, poorer countries say the group's promises were not accompanied by clear plans. G20 leaders also recognised that reducing methane is one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost effective means to limit climate impacts, but they could not agree on a deal to phase out coal use. This all leaves Cop26 with the uphill task of setting out what strengthened ambition should look like in this decade. UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said the G20 outcome fell far short of delivering real leadership on the crisis, and that he left Rome "with my hopes unfulfilled . . . but not buried". British prime minister and Cop26 host Boris Johnson struck a more pessimistic tone, saying "words and promises are starting to sound, frankly, hollow". 'Lacking ambition' Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International, said that "if the G20 was a dress rehearsal for Cop26 , then world leaders fluffed their lines". She described the communiqu\'e9 issued as "weak" and "lacking both ambition and vision". The G20 did agree limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees will require "meaningful and effective actions" and co-operation by all countries, through finance and technology sharing. They committed to accelerated action this decade "in line with the latest scientific developments and national circumstances" and to update/enhance "where necessary" 2030 climate plans. They agreed to global net-zero emissions "by or around mid-century", with China and Russia sticking to the date of 2060. It failed to signal the end of coal power in the face of push back from Australia, China, India and Russia. The leaders did agree to "put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021". G20 co-operation to deploy clean technologies instead of coal is tied into a significant commitment to mobilise international public and private finance to support sustainable energy development. It committed to reach a balance between adaptation and mitigation finance to encourage multilateral development banks to step up efforts to align with the Paris accord and support a transition to clean energy in emerging markets and developing countries. 'An important signal' Alden Meyer, of the E3G think tank, said the agreement to do more in the 2020s was "an important signal" but much hard work remains on climate finance if Cop26 is to bridge the gap in ambition needed to hold the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees this century. "Leaders must instruct their ministers and negotiators to turn this rhetoric into reality over the next two weeks if Glasgow is to truly represent a turning point," he added. Developing countries, however, are unhappy. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, who is chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States, which is representing 39 countries at risk from environmental catastrophe at Cop26 , said: "From what I've seen it appears we are going to overshoot 1.5 degrees. We are very concerned about that. This is a matter of survival for us". He blamed the influence of powerful private-sector interests for the G20's failure to come up with better plans, which meant developed countries would also suffer the consequences of climate breakdown. "We are here to save the planet, not to protect profits," he said. "There are very powerful multinational firms and lobbies . . . who benefit from fossil fuel subsidies." Former Irish president Mary Robinson, who chairs The Elders group, which advocates for human rights, declared in advance of Cop26 that "now is the moment for decisive action, not obfuscation or half measures". The G20 outcome has too many half measures, but Cop26 can still turns things around with many of the same players having an opportunity to deliver more by converting political promises into an agreed roadmap to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the planet. \</doc>

Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said he is "looking forward" to travelling to COP26 , after a follow-up test indicated he does not have Covid-19. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/news/2021/1106/1258327-eamon-ryan-covid/ Last night it was announced that Mr Ryan had tested positive for Covid-19 and had cancelled his plans to travel to the climate conference in Glasgow. However, in a statement this afternoon, the minister's department said that Mr Ryan had received notification from the Health Service Executive that a second test was recommended. The result of this test showed that Covid-19 was not detected. The department said: "The public health advice in this instance is that the case is de-notified, close contacts are informed and the person can continue about their business. Minister Ryan now plans to travel to Glasgow for COP26 tomorrow." Mr Ryan, in a post on Twitter, said he was "looking forward" to bringing Ireland's Climate Action Plan to COP26 this week. It added: "Minister Ryan has not been symptomatic at any point. He underwent the initial test as a precautionary measure as recommended by the organisers of COP26 . "Minister Ryan has updated the Taoiseach, T\'e1naiste and the Secretary to the Government with this information." The Health Service Executive has said that repeat Covid tests may be recommended for individuals in certain instances. This takes in to account a number of factors, such as the lab result itself including viral targets detected, the reason for the test and the condition of the person having the test performed. It is typically based on a discussion between the testing laboratory and the person requesting the test, the HSE said in a statement. "In these cases a repeat test may be scheduled through the HSE Testing and Trace programme and a review of the results will inform the public health guidance," it said. Minister Ryan, speaking to youth website spunout.ie, said one of Ireland's priorities at COP26 is to help provide climate finance and resources to poorer countries. He said Ireland emits the equivalent in emissions to 400 million of the poorest people on the planet. "They are the ones who will be first and worst affected by climate change." Mr Ryan said that "what we have to do in this decade is beyond compare - to halve emissions ... I think we can do it." The minister said one of the biggest challenges would be public-buy-in. "It's not without difficulty." \</doc>

The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised for suggesting that failure to act at Cop26 could be graver than leaders who ignored warnings about the Nazis in the 1930s. Justin Welby addressed his earlier comments made during a BBC interview in a tweet where he apologised for the offence his words may have caused to Jewish people. The Church of England's most senior leader said: "I unequivocally apologise for the words I used when trying to emphasise the gravity of the situation facing us at Cop26 . Mr Welby had told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg at the Glasgow summit on Monday that world leaders "will be cursed if they don't get this right". He added that "people will speak of them in far stronger terms than we speak today of the politicians of the 30s, of the politicians who ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany because this will kill people all around the world for generations, and we have will have no means of averting it". Mr Welby went on to say: "It will allow a genocide on an infinitely greater scale. "I'm not sure there's grades of genocide, but there's width of genocide, and this will be genocide indirectly, by negligence, recklessness, that will in the end come back to us or to our children and grandchildren." The archbishop previously said he was attending Cop26 to listen to countries which are most affected by climate change, and to encourage those who are making progress. \</doc>

Greta Thunberg will speak to tens thousands of climate campaigners at a rally in Glasgow as the city hosts Cop26 . Cop26 Coalition's Global Day for Climate Justice rally. \~ The coalition wants governments to commit to cutting emissions and implementing globally just solutions that limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees - including calling for zero carbon, not just net-zero. Organisers expect simultaneous mobilisations in more than 50 places across 75 countries worldwide. Sarah Fleming of the Cop26 Coalition said: "Amongst all the rhetoric and empty promises, it is clear that justice won't be handed to us by world leaders or delivered by corporations. Advertisement"Only we can imagine and build the future that works for all of us. "The solutions that we desperately need to survive the climate crisis, and in doing so build a more just and fair world, can only be brought about through making our voices heard together." She added: "That's why we're bringing together everyone from Glasgow communities to indigenous peoples, from farmers to health workers to families, to take to the streets across the world and demand climate justice at Cop26 ." Organisers hope striking council workers will join the marchers as they head from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green. The demonstrators will gather at 11.30am in Kelvingrove Park.\~ Representatives from Black Lives Matter Scotland, the Stop Cambo campaign - calling for an end to further oil prospecting 125 miles north-west of Shetland in Scotland, and the Anti-Fracking Lancashire Nanas will speak from the Fire Brigade Union's fire engine. AdvertisementA series of campaign groups including activists from Extinction Rebellion, Climate Justice, Not False Solutions and Workers and Trade Unions will form the backbone of the demonstration, which is expected to leave the park at midday. The march will be met by smaller marches from Glasgow Southside and groups of cyclists from across Scotland ahead of the rally at Glasgow Green from 3pm. The Cop26 Coalition said that public health and safety during the ongoing pandemic were a primary concern, and they are "fighting for climate justice at Cop against the backdrop of global vaccine inequality" and a need to keep everyone in our communities - both in Glasgow and abroad - safe. More than 10,000 police officers a day are expected to be on the streets during Cop26 . Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said detailed planning has been under way for more than a year and Police Scotland is well-prepared for the unique challenges presented by Cop26 . \</doc>

Climate protests have got under way across Ireland and Britain to urge action at crucial Cop26 international talks taking place in Glasgow. Protesters braved pouring rain and winds to march through the Scottish city where the UN climate conference is being held, while other marches are taking place in Irish and British cities. In Glasgow, thousands of climate activists, trade unionists, politicians and other groups were part of thousands of marchers massed in and around Kelvingrove Park ahead of the procession through the city to Glasgow Green,\~amid a significant police presence and despite forecasts of heavy rain for most of Saturday. A fire engine, women covered in moss and Poseidon on stilts have all turned out for the protest in Glasgow, while a group of children guided a display featuring what appeared to be a large snake wearing glasses through Kelvingrove Park.

The second goal of COP26 is "adapt to protect communities and natural habitats", with this aim coming second only to the tagline of "keep 1.5 degrees alive". Today was a day dedicated to Adaptation, Loss and Damage. Adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic events and their effects or impacts. Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan announced at the conference that Ireland will commit \€ 10m in the next year to the international adaption fund. This will join the $232m (\€ 200m) that has been committed to the fund by other countries - and according to COP26 it\' s the highest single addition to the fund. On the other end of the money and announcements are communities who need the funding to deal with the climate impacts at their door.

She has come to COP26 to tell those making decisions here what is happening on the ground for the communities she works with in her home country. "In Malawi there are a lot of things happening due to climate change, firstly we are facing problems like floods, dry spells and disease outbreaks, and many more." She says because of these destabilising events, there are so many impacts on the ground for communities that she works with. "This ranges from food insecurity, water scarcity, infrastructure loss, loss of property, disease outbreaks, and loss of life." She says there are also social impacts like early marriages, with girls marrying young because of the problems the household is facing. "We want more climate financing, and it should be done now, not later, because it\' s an immediate need", she said. "We want action, a lot has been written and we have had COPs before but what we are lacking is action, and most importantly climate financing." She says she can\' t go home without results for her communities, it\' s not an option. Tapiwa says she feels privileged to be able to come to Glasgow for the conference to bring her communities' concerns to the world stage. Vanessa Nakate, a young climate activist from Uganda, was joined by other young climate activists from the Most Affected People and Areas (MAPA) in the action zone today - they held signs saying \' Show us the money\' Her view? "A delay here, a delay there, a broken promise here, a broken promise there, a commitment here, a commitment there and then you sit back- do you know what comes next? Loss and damage." At the protests at the weekend, Vanessa spoke about the lives being lost in her home country Uganda, she said children are dropping out of school and farms are being destroyed. She echoed the evidence from Tapiwa, that girls were getting married early in their lives due to economic pressures. Girls Not Brides, an international nonprofit working to end child marriage, says 12 million underage girls get married every year. \</doc>

GREEN Party leader Eamon Ryan was given the Covid-19 all-clear yesterday - despite originally testing positive. The Environment Minister will now travel to the COP26 conference in Glasgow after initially cancelling the trip because of his positive test result. However, a second test was recommended by the HSE which did not detect Covid-19. 'The public health advice, in this instance, is the case is de-notified, close contacts are informed and the person can continue about their business,' the Environment Department statement said. Mr Ryan was not experiencing any symptoms, and underwent the initial test as a precautionary measure as recommended by the organisers of COP26 . He received the positive result on Saturday, and followed all HSE protocols, including self-isolation. A department spokesman said: 'Minister Ryan advised the HSE of his close contacts, including those he encountered in the 24 hours before the test. 'This is the requirement for those who have a positive result, but who are not experiencing symptoms.' Mr Ryan, pictured right, told the Taoiseach and T\'e1naiste and the spokesman added: 'The National Climate Delegation will continue its efforts to secure meaningful progress at COP26 through membership of the EU, and as a new signatory to the High Ambition Coalition, which works to ensure the delivery of ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions.' The Government published a plan last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by the end of 2030.

Day three of COP26 will be focused on finance, and in particular how developing countries or those most affected by climate change will be supported financially. In Copenhagen, at COP15 in 2009, countries came together there and said that they would provide $100bn per year and they would reach that target by 2020. They did not meet the target. It's estimated they were short by at least $20bn. "You can see it here in Glasgow," said Conor O\' Neill from Christian Aid Ireland. "People from developing countries are angry that this figure has not been delivered but also that it\' s not sufficient." COP26 President of Alok Sharma recommitted to delivering on that $100bn as one of the key aims of this summit. "In many ways the success of this COP will depend on the issue of financial support," Mr O\' Neill said. Money money money, must be funny, in a rich countries world.

The Taoiseach committed Ireland to at least doubling that amount, with at least \€ 225m coming from Ireland by 2025. However, Christian Aid Ireland said this figure was not enough for four years\' time or now. "It\' s a really significant welcome announcement but it is still short of the scale of the task at hand," Mr O\' Neill said. "Research that we have done takes a look at Ireland\' s past emissions, current emissions and relative wealth compared to other countries best estimates show we should be contributing \€ 500m per year in climate finance and that should be happening today not pushed out to 2025." Mr O\' Neill said they can see the impact of climate change in their work around the world. "It\' s a profoundly unequal process" he said, as the countries most affected were not the ones with major emissions. While the aid organisation was critical of the quantity being provided, it said the quality of aid packages provided by Ireland was excellent. Mr O\' Neill said they hoped that Irish negotiators would champion that fact and share their methods with others. World leaders have vacated the stage, leaving negotiators the task of figuring out the nuts and bolts of the plan, and in particular how they are going to deliver much needed funds to most affected areas. \</doc>

EFFORTS to strike agreement on climate action have continued at the Cop26 talks, as the Glasgow summit went into overtime. At an afternoon plenary, countries set out their views on the latest drafts of the agreements that could be secured at the UN conference, which had been published earlier in the day. Many developing countries called for more finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and adapt to the changing climate, and for support for the loss and damage they are facing from rising seas and more extreme weather. Boris Johnson appeared to back their calls when he said the developing world "needs to see the cash on the table" at the talks to secure a deal. A range of countries called for stronger action on phasing out fossil fuels after language on accelerating a phase-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels was weakened in the latest draft of the overarching "cover decision" that could be secured at the talks. And there were warnings that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C was a "matter of life and death". While visiting a vaccination centre in Sidcup, south-east London, the Prime Minister said the UK hosts of Cop26 were moving "heaven and earth" to get everyone to see the vital importance of agreement at the talks, to keep the prospect of limiting warming to 1.5C alive. He said: "We do need to see the cash on the table to help the developing world to make the necessary changes." The talks were expected to go well into the night. \</doc>

You know it's a thriving climate conference when the attendants sound like Marie Antoinette complaining about a wine stain on her prized chaise longue as she continues to pour the bottle downwards. "Something must be done," our leaders say as the dark red circle spreads. "The crisis will mount until we act," they say. "We're nearing the point of no return." Again and again, they notice the stain, tell us they'd prefer no stain, and are outraged that the stain is still there. Haven't we heard it needs to go? The UN-brokered COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has sold itself as humanity's last chance to avert climate catastrophe. Perhaps in the belief that a national pride based on having endured the Blitz might be nearing its expiry date, the UK is keen to lead the way. According to the UK, that is. COP26 certainly lives up to Britain's proud tradition of claiming to know poorer countries' interests better than they do, including countries that are poorer specifically because Britain plundered them. Compared to previous climate conferences, COP26 has only hosted around one-third of the usual number of Global South representatives. Pandemic restrictions, affordability and other access barriers have locked out those on the very frontline of climate impacts. The conference sidelined civil society groups and NGO observers to a separate room where they observed the main plenary sessions online, and there's been poor wheelchair access and a lack of sign language interpreters on the COP26 stage. Better yet, the UK rolled out the Queen. If you have ever visited a married couple who insist on having their child play the recorder for you, then you know how it feels to be a non-British person landed with the Queen. COP26 , her majesty said we need to rise above "politics". Of course she did. What mysterious force gave the Queen the microphone while protesters outside dodged police, if not politics? Why is the Queen a queen, if not politics? The Windsor family's lavish existence depends on a very particular politics, one that is leading us to the collapse of civilisation. Elizabeth can keep her pep talks - if there's enough space for them wherever she stores her former colonies' jewels. You can tell it's all theoretical to her, or to those who write her speeches, from her apparent belief that climate change isn't here yet. "But we are [pursuing climate action] not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps," she said. Royal business can be ever so taxing, and perhaps she missed the memorandum that people are dying now. The precious children her majesty spoke of were in fact most vocal at COP26 during Friday's protest, where they demanded that the participants call their luxury hotel getaway what it is and spare us the crocodile tears. Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate spoke to a thousands-strong crowd of the horrors her country is witnessing here and now. Ineza Umuhoza Grace, an environmental advocate from Rwanda, said she encountered climate change aged five or six when floods struck her house. These speakers are in their 20s and have never known a world free from ecological chaos, while British royals are still, by their own admission, generations away from being affected. Negatively affected, that is - since their wealth is also the direct result of fossil fuel extraction. None of COP26 Shifts in public sentiment can be tricky to gauge. Sometimes it's about tone, rhetoric, mood, and good luck measuring any of that with callipers. But when it comes to climate, general sentiment can be tracked to a decimal point. More of us are accepting that limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius is not enough to Britain's Queen Elizabeth prevent mass human tragedy. Hyping up 2 degrees as a target is beginning to make one sound clueless. Now 1.5 degrees of warming is the maximum espoused by anyone at all serious about saving lives, but this ceiling requires changes that leaders find disagreeable. Hence 1.8C. " COP26 promises could limit global warming to 1.8C," BBC News reported on Thursday - adding: "if fully kept". This is not the BBC's first rodeo. If any good comes of COP26 , we should regard it as a bonus. That's ultimately more optimistic than relying on useless leaders and letting their incompetence dispirit us. Should politicians be facing the climate emergency? Yes, obviously. But that's not happening, so "nothing happening" is the baseline. The protesters are marching right against that line. They know it won't move until it has to. \</doc>

It is too early to declare the United Nations (UN) climate change Cop26 summit a failure; there have already been real signs of progress, according to one of the world's foremost climate scientists. Prof Michael E Mann, a climatologist, geophysicist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, called for perspective, tweeting that negotiations at Cop26 are barely underway. "It is way too early to assess what was and wasn't accomplished. We'll only know that in a week, but there is already some very real progress," he said. Environmental activists locked out of the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow last week lamented the fact that the fossil fuel companies had a wide range of delegates in attendance at the 25,000-strong summit, which heard a number of pledges from world leaders on robust action to tackle climate change. Despite the pledges, activists have largely dismissed the words of global leaders, claiming the event is high-level "greenwashing". Greenwashing refers to firms and organisations embellishing their green credentials through slick marketing, scant evidence, and out-of-context claims. Prof Mann tweeted: "Beware of the slippery slope from cynicism to nihilism. It leads to the same place as denialism: inaction. Which is precisely what polluters and those doing their bidding want." Prof Mann has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed and edited publications, and is considered to be one of the outstanding scientists in the climate change realm. Inside Cop26 are opportunities for academics, researchers, and business leaders to network at a level that is unreachable outside of such a setting, University College Cork (UCC) professor Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said. The director of the Cork-based Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine (MaREI) and professor of energy engineering at UCC said that Cop26 has given a golden opportunity for future partnerships to spring up as delegates from around the world meet in person. "It is a unique opportunity. We all have our conferences and workshops that we attend, but to have this on our doorstep, so close to Cork, is why UCC sent a delegation. The value of the networking, the value of having access to the latest information and the politicians and the policymakers from around the world, it's unique in that regard. "If you look at it on an annual basis, there is no other topic in the world that countries come together to discuss and listen to the science, to work out what the next steps should be. There is a bit of theatre surrounding the world leaders, but in fact, the ambitions they express puts it up to the negotiators to push further. "World leaders will talk about 1.5C but it's only through negotiations over the two weeks that we'll really know how that is progressing." The fashion industry is the latest to signal its intent to reduce emissions at Cop26 , with updated targets under the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. It pledged to halve emissions by 2030, with a pledge to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050 - considerably higher than the previous target set of 30% aggregate greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030. \</doc>

Fresh analysis indicates that containing global temperatures to within 1.8 degrees is achievable if the latest pledges by countries at the Cop26 conference are delivered in full. However, US climate envoy John Kerry has insisted that while this is tangible progress, it does not mean "job done". At the UN summit in Glasgow, many countries, including some major emitters such as India, promised to increase their "national determined contributions" required under the Paris climate agreement in the form of revised emission reduction targets, with a view to achieving net-zero emissions. Up to now, climate projections predicted the world was facing a 2.7-degree rise driven by rising carbon emissions, which would make vast areas of the planet uninhabitable. The main target of the Paris agreement is containing global temperature averages to 1.5 degrees this century, while the UK government - as Cop26 host - has "keeping 1.5 degrees alive" a key priority at the summit. Speaking yesterday about progress so far at the two-week long Cop26 , Mr Kerry said while the latest modelling indicating the world was on a trajectory to limit temperature rise to below 2 degrees for the first time was welcome, humanity was facing a race to reduce warming. "Let me emphasise as strongly as I can: job not done. The first part of the job of codifying the urgency will hopefully be done. But that's just the beginning. This is a decade-long race," he said. "We do know that we could have a critical mass of countries moving in a way that keeps [1.5 degrees] alive. This was never going to be done in one week." Three separate analyses this week - most notably by the International Energy Agency - indicate if these revised ambitions are realised, global warming will be limited to below 2 degrees, and possibly to as low as 1.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels. "This is a global first and a significant win arising from Cop26 ," UCC energy expert Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir told The Irish Times. Analysis previewed by the Energy Transition Commission suggests, if delivered in full, commitments made by the close of the first week could deliver 9 gigatonnes of the further 22 gigatonne reduction in emissions required to achieve 1.5 degrees. Meanwhile, coinciding with the day's youth climate theme, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg led more than 25,000 mostly young people - including many from Ireland - through the streets of Glasgow. She told a rally in George's Square: "The leaders are not doing nothing, they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system." Young climate leaders At Cop26 itself, views of more than 40,000 young climate leaders were presented to ministers, negotiators and officials including a call for their voices to be heard and demanding "action to prevent catastrophic climate change in our lifetimes". The week has also secured tangible progress on climate finance with the long-awaited $100 billion (EUR 86.46 billion) a year promised by rich nations to poor nations set to be delivered in 2022, a year earlier than previously thought. Delivery of the money to fund emission cuts in developing countries is considered a critical test of Cop26 in building trust between wealthy and poor nations. It is to assist collaboration in addressing the climate emergency and transitioning developing countries from using fossil fuels to use of renewable energy. On Thursday evening Mr Kerry said Japan's promise to pay $2 billion a year would unlock another $8 billion a year of private sector money. \</doc>

Ireland's Environment Minister has cancelled a planned trip to Cop26 after testing positive for Covid-19. Eamon Ryan, the leader of Ireland's Green Party, had been due to travel to Glasgow on Sunday. Mr Ryan, who is now self isolating, is not experiencing symptoms. He received the positive result on Saturday after taking a precautionary PCR test on Friday in line with the recommendations of the Cop26 organisers. A statement from the minister's department said: ``Minister Ryan has advised the HSE (Health Service Executive) of his close contacts, including those encountered in the 24 hours before the test. ``This is the requirement for those who have a positive result, but who are not experiencing symptoms.'' The statement said Mr Ryan had informed Irish premier Micheal Martin and deputy premier Leo Varadkar. The statement added: ``The National Climate Delegation will continue its efforts to secure meaningful progress at Cop26 through membership of the EU and as a new signatory to the High Ambition Coalition, which works to ensure the delivery of ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).'' Earlier this week, the Irish Government published a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by the end of the decade. The 125 billion euro plan is set to transform how people travel around the country, heat their homes, use public transport as well as the production of food. end \</doc>

After a fortnight which has seen world leaders jet in, the British prime minister make a brief train trip to urge ambition and protests, marches and debate, Cop26 is entering the endgame. Here's what happened on the last official day of the UN climate talks. - A new day, a new text HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlLmFzc2V0cy5wcmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0aW9uLmlvXFxcL3YyXFxcL2ltYWdlXFxcL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb25cXFwvZDY3Mjc2NjM0N2ZhYzY0MDE1YmI2YWUzYTcyNDM2MGFZMjl1ZEdWdWRITmxZWEpqYUdGd2FTd3hOak0yT0RJeU5qWTRcXFwvMi42MzY4NDU5OC5qcGc_dz02NDBcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6bnVsbCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYwMCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6e1wib3V0cHV0XCI6XCJ3ZWJwXCJ9fSIsImhhc2giOiIyOWRiM2U5ODQ4ODc1ZjAwNjdhYzUwYmFmMTVhMzEyNmFhNGUwYzcwIn0=/new-texts-and-more-protests-what-has-happened-on-the-last-day-of-cop26.jpg?w=640 Link to Image Delegates in the Cairn Gorm plenary room during the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow (Jane Barlow/PA) The new draft of the "cover decision", the main deal that could come out of Glasgow was published this morning. Immediately obvious was some weaker language on accelerating a phase-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but they were still in there. Whether the references survive into the final text remains to be seen, but plenty of countries in the afternoon's plenary supported action on fossil fuels being in the decision. - An urge or a request?\~ HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NvbnRlbnQuYXNzZXRzLnByZXNzYXNzb2NpYXRpb24uaW9cXFwvMjAyMVxcXC8xMVxcXC8xMjE2NTYxNFxcXC9jNmM4NWU3Zi00YTEyLTQzYmMtOWFmMC1mZjNlZDQyYzE3NjEuanBlZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjpudWxsLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjAwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjp7XCJvdXRwdXRcIjpcIndlYnBcIn19IiwiaGFzaCI6IjIwZTI3M2I4NGZlNGE3ZWVlYmU2YzhlYmYwYTgwZGY4MGU5NzYzYWYifQ==/new-texts-and-more-protests-what-has-happened-on-the-last-day-of-cop26.jpeg Link to Image Words in UNFCCC texts The curse of the single word reared its head again. Back in Paris in 2015, the whole deal nearly fell over on a dispute over "shall" or "should". In Glasgow, the debate was less dramatic - over whether a change in the new draft from "urging" countries to come back with stronger action plans by next year to "requesting" was a strengthening of the text or a weakening. The answer? Request is a directive whereas urging is just a strong form of encouraging. A UN Climate Change document on "Choosing verbs" puts requests above urges in terms of strength, and the Paris Agreement used "request". So that is that settled. - Walking out and climbing in https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlLmFzc2V0cy5wcmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0aW9uLmlvXFxcL3YyXFxcL2ltYWdlXFxcL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb25cXFwvMGQzMzAzNTFiZWI4MDk0Yzk1NGVlZWYyZTYyYjgxMDZZMjl1ZEdWdWRITmxZWEpqYUdGd2FTd3hOak0yT0RFNU9ERTVcXFwvMi42MzY4NTMwNy5qcGc_dz02NDBcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6bnVsbCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYwMCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6e1wib3V0cHV0XCI6XCJ3ZWJwXCJ9fSIsImhhc2giOiJlNTIwMmY2ZGUxYTI2M2I0NTg5NWY2YzNhMDc5OGFiOTljYzlhOWE5In0=/new-texts-and-more-protests-what-has-happened-on-the-last-day-of-cop26.jpg?w=640 Link to Image A protester tries to climb over the fence into Cop26 (Andrew Milligan/PA) As the clock ticks down on the climate talks, protests continue, with hundreds of activists marching out of a gathering in one of the main halls, singing and chanting and led by indigenous people, to join a protest outside Cop26 .

You do not go to a climate change conference for the laughs, so I was pleased to come across a global warming joke just a few days into the Cop26 summit here in Glasgow. It was told at a gathering of financiers on the Cop sidelines by Sir Martin Smith, the investment banker whose family founded the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at Oxford university. One day, he said, planet Earth was wandering about the universe when it came across another planet who asked how things were going. Not so well, said Earth, who had been feeling poorly. "Do you know what the problem is?" asked the other planet. "Well," said Earth. "I've had quite a bad case of homo sapiens." "Oh don't worry about that," said the other planet. "They don't last long." As Smith said, the story sounded funnier when he first heard it many years ago. At Cop26 , the idea that Earth could heat to levels that make human life unsupportable is all too imaginable. The world is already about 1.09 degrees warmer than it was before fossil fuel burning took off in earnest and this conference is supposed to make sure it does not exceed 1.5 degrees. Or as one is constantly told inside the vast Cop venue overlooking the River Clyde, we must "keep 1.5 alive!" As the week has worn on, there have been times when I have been more concerned about keeping myself alive. Like thousands of others, I did not count on a fallen tree cancelling my train from London to Glasgow on Sunday, or the bracing seven-hour drive on a rainy motorway that followed, after kind fellow strandees offered a lift in their hurriedly rented car. The horror grew the next day with the discovery that, to enter the Cop venue, one needed to join huge queues in suboptimal Glaswegian temperatures and little chance of serious social distancing. "No pictures!" barked a female security guard, pointlessly, as hapless victims began tweeting photos of the crowds. Precious funds This is my sixth C op and I have never seen such organisational mayhem. Then again, it is the only Cop whose organisers have had to grapple with a pandemic that became all too real on day five, when I did the rapid Covid test required to gain entry to the venue each day. It was positive. So was one taken by Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, and an unspecified number of other attendees, some of whom had doubtless flown more than a day and spent precious funds to be present at a conference that is literally supposed to save the world. Confined to my Airbnb quarters, I logged on to a press conference inside the venue where organisers were being asked how many Cop26 Covid cases there actually were. "A few," said a man from the UN, adding the number was not being made public. Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, but numbers were lower than in the rest of Scotland and "at this point, we're comfortable where we are". Media management I would feel more reassured if it were not for the striking degree of media management surrounding this event. This is the first Cop to be held in an English-speaking G7 country since Canada had one 16 years ago, and its British hosts are no slouches when it comes to massaging messages. "Leaders representing over 85 per cent of the world's forests will commit to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030," Downing Street declared in one of a number of news releases with a late night embargo that left journalists scrambling to work out what the news actually amounted to. The strategy brought helpful morning headlines but looked less clever by the end of the week as more details emerged. Indonesia, one of the forestry pledge's most important signatories, turned out not to be ready to completely end deforestation by 2030. Poland, which had signed another deal to "consign coal to history", later said it would not be phasing the fossil fuel out until the 2040s, which is what it had already said it would do. The "sapiens" in homo sapiens means wise. Cop26 could use as much of that wisdom as possible before its end next week. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021 \</doc>

The relationship between police and protesters has been "non-contentious" in the first week of Cop26 , a senior police officer has said. Fewer than 50 arrests have been made since the Glasgow summit started last weekend, including during marches on Friday and Saturday which attracted 25,000 and 100,000 people respectively, according to organisers. Some 21 arrests were made during the Saturday rally, which also saw a group of protesters blocked in a "kettle" operation in the city centre. "For such a highly significant event, to reach the end of the first week with fewer than 50 arrests being made is testament to the fact the relationship between protesters and the police has been largely non-contentious," Mr Ritchie said. "Despite today being a rest day at the conference, Police Scotland has, once again, engaged positively with protest organisers and attendees at a number of events across Glasgow, with minimum disruption to the wider community. "As you'll no doubt know, Police Scotland has spent more than 18 months preparing for Cop26 , and a great deal of effort has gone into ensuring our policing plan is robust but reactive, but also welcoming, while balancing the right to protest with the rights of our communities." Officers from across the country have been sent to Glasgow to police the event, which brought more than 100 world leaders to Scotland's biggest city last week. Mr Ritchie added: "All of our work is underpinned by human rights and a great deal of effort has been taken to ensure our response to Cop26 -related incidents and events is necessary and proportionate, and that our ethos and values of integrity, fairness and respect is shared by both our own officers and our mutual aid colleagues who have travelled to Scotland from across the UK to support us. Advertisement"This event has already provided us with some unique challenges, but our officers and staff have risen to face them, and the broadly good nature of the members of the public we are interacting with has made this a widely positive experience. "I very much hope this atmosphere continues into the second week ahead of Cop26 coming to its conclusion next weekend." \</doc>

A GREEN council leader from Northern Ireland has described his flight from Gatwick to Glasgow to protest against climate change at Cop26 as a "major failure of judgment". Councillor Phelim Mac Cafferty, the leader of Brighton and Hove City Council's Green group, apologised for taking the 80-minute flight after flying on the same day he slammed the Government for a lack of action over climate change. After completing the 460- mile journey, Mr Mac Cafferty, who is originally from Londonderry, made a speech on cutting carbon emissions and appeared at a protest march, led by Greta Thunberg, calling for world leaders to stop temperatures rising. The politician, who co-chairs his council's carbon-neutral working group, yesterday admitted the blunder. Mr Mac Cafferty unreservedly apologised, saying he had been worried his train might be cancelled. He said: "In the Friday evening just gone, I took a flight from London to Glasgow to attend Cop26 where I had been invited to represent the city at a presentation of the Glasgow declaration on Saturday morning. "This decision to fly was a major failure of my judgment which goes against my political group's pledges and principles and I unreservedly apologise." The admission comes just days after Mr Mac Cafferty claimed Brighton and Hove was leading the way on climate and social action. He said he had been concerned about the reliability of the rail network which left people struggling to get to Cop26 . At the end of last month, operators from the east and west coast mainlines advised against people travelling from London to Glasgow amid stormy weather across the UK. Mr Mac Cafferty added: "I reluctantly took this very difficult decision because I was concerned about the unreliability of the rail network following the well-publicised difficulties experienced by many people wanting to travel by train to Glasgow the week before, when trains were cancelled. I was concerned that this would happen again and I felt it was important not to miss the opportunity to attend the important presentation on behalf of the city, lobby world leaders and share with others the innovative work taking place in Brighton and Hove. "Transport contributes a large portion of carbon emissions, all significant journeys we make have an effect on our climate. I will be offsetting the carbon cost of my journey. I will be taking my return journey on train." \£9 The Independent \</doc>

The climate activist Vanessa Nakate has warned that the planet is "on the verge of the abyss" as she challenged world leaders to prove wrong those who doubt that Cop26 can be a success. The Ugandan activist told the conference that thousands of activists and people living in countries affected by climate change "do not see the success that is being applauded" at the summit. Ms Nakate, 24, said: "We are - as United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres recently said - on the verge of the abyss. "As the IPCC report said, the science is now unequivocal. "The latest available science tells us that, in order to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, we must reduce global Co2 emissions by somewhere between 7% and 11% this year and next year, and every year until we get to zero." Advertisement \~ She argued that "only immediate and drastic action will pull us back from the abyss", but said she was sceptical of the promises made by world leaders, businesses and the financial sector. Ms Nakate continued: "There have been 25 Cops before this one and every time leaders come to these climate negotiations with an array of new pledges, commitments and promises. "And as it comes and goes, emissions continue to rise. "This year will be no different. CO2 emissions are forecast to jump in 2021 by the second-biggest annual rise in history. Addressing world and business leaders, Ms Nakate said: "I am here to beg you to prove us wrong. "We see them making fancy speeches, we hear about new pledges and promises, but we are drowning in promises. "Promises will not stop the suffering of the people, pledges will not stop the planet from warming." She added: "The truth is that the atmosphere doesn't care about commitments. It only cares about what we put into it or stop putting into it. Advertisement"Humanity will not be saved by promises. It's hard to believe business and finance leaders when they haven't delivered before. They have not been faithful in their promises. They have not been honest in fulfilling their commitments."

The global climate conference COP26 gets under way in Glasgow later today. Tens of thousands of delegates have also been accredited to the event taking place in Glasgow's Scottish Event Campus. Scientists have warned it is the last best chance to prevent catastrophic climate change. The leaders are bringing new commitments on cutting their country's greenhouse gas emissions out to 2030. But already there have been warnings that what is on the table will not be enough and they will have to go much further. The aim of the conference is to keep warming as close as possible to the 1.5C target set in the Paris Agreement in 2015. There will be a focus on major economies like the G20 group of countries, including the United States, the EU and China, which are responsible for the bulk of global emissions. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will represent Ireland, and other government ministers will attend during the two-week event. Mr Martin is expected to speak at the conference on Tuesday. There will be an opening ceremony around lunchtime today, but the real work will start on Monday when world leaders including, US President Joe Biden, arrive for a two-day high-level summit. They will return close to the end of the two-week conference to see whether officials have been able to reach an agreement they can sign up to. Some big names are not coming to the conference in person, including President Xi Jinping of China, though it has been reported he may appear by videolink. Russia's Vladamir Putin is also not expected. A considerable number of people from Irish environmental organisations and faith-based groups will also be in attendance. They will be making the case for more urgent action and much fairer treatment of developing countries which are at the sharp end of climate change. That includes demands that developed countries follow through on a prior commitment to provide $100bn (\€ 86.4bn) a year for at risk countries to help with adaptation. So far only around three quarters of that money is making its way through.

COP26 will be the world's moment of truth." "The question everyone is asking is whether we seize this moment or let it slip away. "I hope world leaders will hear them and come to Glasgow ready to answer them with decisive action. "Together, we can mark the beginning of the end of climate change - and end the uncertainty once and for all." The Conservative Party leader has not struck an optimistic tone in the lead-up to the conference, repeating in interviews while in the Italian capital that he still rated the chances of success in Scotland as no more than six out of 10. His Labour rival accused the prime minister of "lowering expectations" in the run-up to the crucial negotiations with such comments, potentially putting Cop's environmental targets at "risk". Keir Starmer told the Sunday Telegraph: "The Prime Minister is turning into a commentator rather than a leader in relation to Cop26 , lowering expectations by a commentary instead of (showing) leadership on the global stage."The summit timetable will see Mr Johnson host an opening ceremony attended by dignitaries including the Prince of Wales, before giving a speech on Monday. David Attenborough, the Cop26 People's Advocate, will also be among those to also address world leaders as British environmental advocates. Tomorrow evening, Boris Johnson will host a reception to welcome world leaders to Glasgow, alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.

AS THE ink has barely dried on the Cop26 agreement and citizens are poring over the entrails to see if anything significant has been achieved, one thing is certain: The planet remains in mortal danger and actions now need to match, or indeed far exceed, words. Despite extreme weather events and the threat to life posed by greenhouse gas emissions, governments, especially those of rich countries, are woefully reluctant to take the necessary steps to seriously address this issue. And a huge elephant in the room at Cop26 was the failure to even consider tackling the war industry's part in this crisis. This industry is powered by fossil fuels and is among the biggest polluters on the planet. For example, the US defence department has a larger carbon footprint than most countries - in fact, if it were a country it would register as the 55th biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Some readers may be feeling a sense of relief in the belief that the Republic of Ireland, at least, is not making a contribution to this aspect of planetary peril. However, they would be wrong in that assumption. Although, traditionally, before our neutrality was steadily and stealthily eroded, we had a limited involvement in the arms industry, all that has changed and is set to change more drastically in the coming years. The event, which will be officially opened by Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, proudly proclaims itself as a high-level seminar and networking event, on the new EU funding and technology supports for the defence and security research, innovation, development, and manufacturing ecosystem in Ireland. The use of the term "ecosystem" is especially offensive when one considers the environmental damage done to the ecosystem by the military/war machine. The promotion for the event goes on to say that, "The seminar will provide significant networking opportunities with senior officials from the EU Commission, the European Defence Agency, Enterprise Ireland, and European Defence Industry who will present on the European Defence Fund, defence tech engagement, and Horizon Europe opportunities over the next EU budgetary cycle, 2021-2027." Is this not extraordinary and disturbing in equal measure? We, in Ireland, know better than most the damage that weapons can do to people and our environment. The issue of decommissioning weapons following the Good Friday Agreement which was happily achieved, to a greater or lesser extent - dominated our media and public discourse for many years. Yet we are now deliberately getting ever more deeply involved in the business of building weapons systems for profit, the consequences of which will inevitably be death, suffering, and forced migration of people whom we do not know and against whom we have no gripe or grudge. The world is already awash with weapons that are killing, maiming, and driving people from their homes. And we don't need more! The global arms industry racked up an almost incomprehensible bill of $ 1,900bn in 2019, a vast multiple of the pledges to save the planet made at Cop26 . What is official Ireland's response? A decision, under the watch of the Green Party, I might add, to participate in building more weapons, costing - literally - the earth. I'm sure those who will attend this conference will be highly qualified, politely spoken, and neatly dressed, but the business they will be promoting is the business of blood and of ecological devastation. For the welfare of the planet and its people, Mr Coveney and the Department of Defence should reflect on the millions of victims of war around the world and call off this grotesque event.

The Cop26 summit in Glasgow is being billed as the biggest UN climate conference since countries secured the Paris Agreement in 2015. However, there is no big new deal like the Paris Agreement to hammer out at Cop26 - instead, Glasgow has to deliver on the promises made six years ago and, alongside the formal UN negotiations, drive action to tackle the worsening climate crisis. Keeping 1.5C within reach Glasgow has been billed as the last best chance to limit global warming to 1.5C in the long term. Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed to curbing temperature rises to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C - beyond which worsening impacts of climate change will be felt. But back in 2015, it was clear that the emissions cuts countries had signed up to left the world far off track to meet the global temperature goals. So under the Paris deal, countries were due to bring forward more ambitious post-2020 national plans ahead of Cop26 . Cash The key to success at Cop26 is delivering on a long-promised (EURO)100bn a year for 2020 to 2025 for poorer countries to develop cleanly and cope with the impacts of climate change. It is seen as a matter of trust between developing and developed nations for donor countries to deliver on the promised private and public climate finance, and conversations will also begin on unlocking further funds after 2025. There is pressure for finance to be split equally bet emissions and to adapt to climate change. Coal Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and polluting coal plants need to be phased out in the next two decades to meet climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. Cars Road transport accounts for a 10th of global emissions, so countries are being urged to commit to ensuring all new car and van sales are zero-emission vehicles by 2035 or 2040 and put in place policies to boost uptake. Vehicle manufacturers are also being urged to commit to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 or earlier. Trees Healthy and restored forests can absorb and lock up vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. Protecting trees - along with other carbon-storing natural habitats such as peatlands - is seen as key to cutting emissions and helping communities and wildlife cope with climate change. The pressure is on countries to take steps to halt and reverse deforestation, switch to sustainable agriculture, and support efforts to protect or conserve 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030. While the most significant greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, methane is a powerful, but short-lived, climate-warming gas. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a key way to curb warming in the short term. A US and EUled "global methane pledge" which commits countries to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 has already garnered a number of signatures ahead of its formal launch at Cop26 . Back in the negotiations, there are still some outstanding issues about how parts of the Paris Agreement are going to work, and they need to be resolved to make it operational and effective.

The angry desperation in countries most vulnerable to climate change following the final Cop26 agreement in Glasgow is tragically well founded in their experience of international failure to deal with this crisis to date. "You might as well bomb us," one Pacific islands leader said bluntly. Conversely, the hubris of the countries that systematically unpicked the strongest clauses in the agreement's early drafts lacks any experiential, scientific - or ethical - rationale . There were certainly chronic flaws in the Cop26 process. There were 500 fossil fuel lobbyists present, when many suffering the lethal consequences of their industries were excluded. Would we countenance a global conference on lung cancer with a similar lobby from the tobacco industry? The final declaration was blatantly redacted by massive fossil fuel polluters. An initial intention to "phase out" coal power, and the current massive subsidies for fossil fuel production, was neutered to a "phasing down" of coal power, and "accelerating efforts" on the phasing out of "inefficient" subsidies. This wording implies that coal power will be maintained well into the future, and that it is somehow possible to "efficiently" subsidise industries that are bringing us ever faster towards catastrophic levels of global heating. Nevertheless, optimists can point to some wins at the Glasgow conference, just enough to keep hope alive that the international community may yet make an effective commitment to mitigating, if not reversing, the crisis. Those wins included the US-China agreement to co-operate on this issue; heightened commitments on deforestation; global endorsement of the EU-US agreement to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Ireland can take some comfort in Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan's imaginative move to revive stalled plans to create an effective "loss and damage" fund for poor countries. He also argues that this Cop gives "legal certainties" to implementing the 2015 Paris Cop deal. For climate Cop veterans, the mere mention of fossil fuels in the declaration for the first time is a significant advance. But this is also an indication of just how successfully world leaders have avoided heeding the science in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports up to now. The fact all parties to the agreement are being asked to increase their commitments at the Cop in Egypt next year is just enough to sustain a belief we could yet keep temperature rises within the (barely) safe limit of 1.5 degrees. Perhaps the best hope now is that public opinion has shifted massively on this question in many countries. If our children are to enjoy a habitable world, politicians across the globe must respond by making greater advances, much faster. \</doc>

"I worry for our younger generations, for children yet to be born, what kind of planet they will be born into if there are very severe weather events, such as droughts and floods," he added. AdvertisementThe Taoiseach said Cop26 must be a "seminal event" in the fight against climate change, adding: "Fundamentally, it's about translating rhetoric into action." While Mr Martin conceded that some commitments "may fall short of what people want", he believes there will be "a very positive momentum coming out of Cop26 ". He added that climate finance will be a significant area of discussion in the coming days, with Ireland doubling its commitment to support developing countries in cutting their carbon emissions and adapting their economies towards environmental sustainability. \</doc>

Two Irish environmentalists are cycling from Dublin to Glasgow for the COP26 climate conference. Friends Gary Tyrrell and Richard Curtin say they are making the journey to "celebrate the joy of cycling" and to raise awareness of the crucial summit. Their route takes them from Dublin to Belfast, where they will take a ferry to Stranraer in Scotland. They hope to reach Glasgow on Tuesday evening. Richard, who works with An Taisce on the Clean Coasts programme, is going to COP26 as a member of the environmental campaign group 'Not Here Not Anywhere'. He said: " COP26 is the best way and the best hope we have for reaching global agreements to reduce our impacts on the environment. It is going to determine whether we can get a pathway to limiting global warming at 1.5C. "That's going to have a massive influence on our livelihoods. Not just our generation, but future generations." Gary works with An Taisce's Climate Ambassadors programme and is attending the COP in that capacity. He said: "We are calling this our 'cycle of hope'. We are going to be cycling, chatting and reflecting as we go on this adventure. We just want to experience the joy of cycling and maybe persuade some people to give it a go, rather than getting in the car all of time. "Once we are over there, we really hope to connect with people. There are so many amazing people from all over the world raising awareness of climate change and we want to learn from them. "We want to share and champion their stories. They give us all hope." \</doc>

Sir, - As Cop26 , probably the most consequential gathering of world leaders in living memory, begins the immediacy of the climate and biodiversity crisis is increasingly pitting people against each other with the active encouragement of corporates. This hasn't been helped by the ongoing propagation of lies being facilitated by social media. Here the publication of the carbon budget has already seen the expected backlash from those local vested interests for whom caps on emissions run counter to their profit motive. Einstein said "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind", which might seem harsh when taken in the context of early 20th-century global politics and the drive to shake off the yoke of imperialism, but seems quite apt now. Global solidarity and an acceptance of scientific fact will be critically important in the coming weeks if humanity is to have any chance of maintaining a sustainable future on this planet. We cannot continue to push for a business as usual growth model, with deluded hopes in yet-to-be invented technologies. We are now in the middle of the climate and biodiversity emergency, politicians need to stop only looking at their next election and pandering to parochial and national self-interest. We all have a collective responsibility to contribute to the global cause of humanity; no more excuses. - Yours, etc, BARRY WALSH, Blackrock, Cork. \</doc>

Look out for pledges on issues such as switching to electric vehicles on transport day, which is Wednesday, while other days focus on adaptation and loss and damage, gender, science and innovation and cities and regions.

AdvertisementIt remains to be seen whether prime minister Boris Johnson will come back at the end of the two-week summit in a bid to get the negotiations over the line, or to welcome any deal that is secured. The Covid Cop There is likely to be ongoing scrutiny on how the Cop26 conference has been managed in the pandemic, and whether the UN and UK organisers have done enough to make it accessible and inclusive. The first week saw big crowds and long queues trying to get through security - not exactly keeping with the social distancing requirements organisers have attempted to impose inside, with limits on the number of people that can be in negotiating rooms and events coming in for criticism. Despite everyone required to do daily lateral flow requests, mask wearing and the social distancing, people have still been falling ill or testing positive - though it is not clear how many. \</doc>

Making a final assessment of the progress achieved over the two weeks of the Cop26 talks in Glasgow will be complex. Unlike past climate summits, the event won't deliver a new treaty or one big "win". Rather, it will attempt to produce a myriad of smaller victories - from the formal UN negotiations on the Paris Agreement, and from the new climate pledges that countries, companies and investors announce during the conference. Its success will be judged on whether all those can together keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal alive. The gap is huge. Scientists say capping warming at 1.5 degrees would require global emissions to plummet 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, and reach net-zero by 2050. Countries' current pledges would see emissions soar by 16 per cent by 2030. Cop26 will use three levers to attempt to steer the world towards 1.5 degrees. Ambition AdvertisementFirst, it will devise a plan for how countries will accelerate their emissions reduction pledges in future years. Cop26 will almost certainly not deliver enough pledges to put the world firmly on course for 1.5 degrees. But a credible deal to ramp up ambition more frequently in the coming years could at least keep it alive. Denmark and Grenada have been put in charge of drawing up options for this, and Britain is considering a proposal that would require countries to come back with new, more ambitious pledges as early as 2023. The conference's British hosts are also lining up a set of side-deals on phasing out coal, clean vehicles and deforestation. Those could help inch towards the Paris Agreement goals, in the absence of new commitments from the world's biggest polluters. Finance The second lever is money. Wealthy countries confirmed last week they failed to meet a 2009 promise to deliver $100 billion ((EURO)86 billion) annually by 2020 in climate finance to help poorer nations cut their own emissions and build resilient systems to weather worsening storms, floods and other climate impacts. That has stoked anger and mistrust among developing countries, and undermined rich nations' requests that the developing world cut emissions faster - which would require huge investments to decarbonise everything from power plants, to factories, to transport and farming. AdvertisementCop26 will need to produce a plan to make sure the $100 billion arrives. It will also start negotiations on a new climate finance goal for 2025 - and the rules to make sure rich countries cannot avoid delivering the money. A bloc of the world's most climate vulnerable countries are also demanding that Glasgow starts talks on financing for so-called "loss and damage" - money to compensate them for the spiralling costs of climate change, from crop failures to rising seas. Cop26 host Britain has also beckoned in the private sector, and is lining up pledges from banks and investors to push billions into clean investments and plug the gap left by wealthy countries' lagging donations. Analysts at Bernstein estimate that $2-4 trillion must be invested in low-carbon industries each year for the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Compare that with the $79.6 billion that rich countries offered poor countries in climate finance in 2019. Economists increasingly agree that cost of doing nothing - and letting climate change unfold unchecked - would be far higher. Rulebook The third priority for Cop26 is for negotiators from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to finish the rules to implement the accord. That includes thorny discussions on carbon markets, how countries will set climate targets in future, and finance. "Paris was the engagement party, but now we're at the wedding, waiting to see if the key countries and corporations are ready to say 'I do'," said Greenpeace head Jennifer Morgan. \</doc>

Protesters gathered on the streets of Glasgow in large numbers and called for world leaders to do more to tackle climate change as the Cop26 gathering continued. Last weekend saw the arrival of world leaders in the Scottish city for the opening of the event, which is intended to build on the work of previous summits to forge a consensus on how to tackle the problem and meet targets. However, campaigners were determined to make sure that the departure of the top politicians did not allow the summit to be forgotten. Protesters, many in costumes, made their voices heard as they marched through the streets and urged the delegations to forge a deal.

A GIFTED young artist from Londonderry has been recognised for her talent at home, Downing Street and now in the presence of world leaders at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Foyle College student Alex Patterson creates paintings of social significance that explore themes including mental health, climate change and food poverty. During the pandemic, the Year 11 student raised thousands of pounds for the NHS through an 18-hour sponsored paint in two nursing homes and at Altnagelvin Hospital. Her Mother Earth painting beat more than 6,000 other entries to take top prize at the Cop26 conference's Creative Earth contest. She was recently invited to Downing Street by Boris Johnson to showcase her winning work at a special reception. Alex told the Belfast Telegraph: "The experience of 10 Downing Street was quite overwhelming [and] I was delighted to be part of the Cop26 . "The arts showcase was breathtaking and both the song and dance were inspiring, emphasising the importance of our global shared responsibility through uniting all of our continents to protect our only and most fragile planet for future generations. I would like to thank Foyle College for all its amazing support." The judges said they were impressed by Alex's entry because of the way she brought the continents together to look after mother nature, with her piece depicting animals that need to be protected and the technologies that will enable this. Spice Girl Geri Horner was so impressed with the Eglinton artist's piece that she decided to put it on display in her collection at her countryside home. In recognition of Alex's success, former Derry City and Strabane District Council Mayor Brian Tierney invited her to a special reception in the Guildhall. Last month, Alex attended the launch of The Boat of Hope campaign in London. Her piece was featured within a 42ft mural by artist Justin Eagleton called Hope. The mural, which shows the journey a person goes through when suffering with depression, is central to the campaign, which focuses on starting conversations about mental health. \</doc>

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Glasgow to demand success at the Cop26 climate summit being staged in the city.

US president Joe Biden will travel to Glasgow for crucial Cop26 climate talks, the White House has confirmed. Mr Biden will be one of around 120 leaders set to attend the world leaders' summit at the start of the two-week conference, which aims to drive action to curb global warming and avoid its most dangerous impacts. Advertisement The US charge d£ffaires, Philip Reeker, said in a tweet: "It's official - President Biden will travel to Scotland for Cop26 . Ahead of the talks, Cop26 president Alok Sharma has urged world leaders to honour the Paris Agreement in 2015, which committed countries to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the most dangerous climate impacts will be felt. But current action and pledges leave the world well off track to meeting the goal and avoiding the most dangerous heat waves, floods, damage to natural systems, rising sea levels and spread of diseases that higher temperatures will bring. The UN climate talks in less than three weeks must secure agreement to accelerate climate action this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive, Mr Sharma has warned. Countries are expected to bring forward more ambitious plans before Cop26 , under a five-year cycle, to get the world on track to meet the Paris goals and the summit is being seen as the most significant since the talks in the French capital. All G7 nations, including the UK and US, have put forward new, more ambitious plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement - for cutting emissions ahead of the talks. AdvertisementBut other major economies in the G20 group - including China, the world's largest polluter - have yet to submit new versions of their plans, with time running out to honour their promise to do so before Cop26 - making the G20 summit in Rome a potentially critical moment for climate action. \</doc>

The RMT union has issued its final demand to avert ScotRail train staff striking during Cop26 , ahead of the Scottish government's deadline. The trade union has set out its final negotiating position, calling for a 2.5 per cent pay rise backdated to April and a " Cop26 payment" for all staff. World leaders and thousands of delegates are set to arrive in Glasgow for the United Nations climate summit, but the 13-day event has been threatened with disruption caused by rail strikes. The Scottish government and ScotRail imposed a deadline of 5pm on Wednesday for a resolution to the dispute over pay and conditions. A Transport Scotland spokesman said the letter from RMT general secretary Mike Lynch had been received before the deadline but no decision had been reached. \~ Setting out the demands to avoid RMT members striking for the duration of the climate summit, Mr Lynch also asked for three hours booking-on allowance and a new pay and conditions review by April 1st 2022. AdvertisementMr Lynch said: "We are making this offer in good faith with the sole intention of breaking the current deadlock and allowing us to make progress as the clock ticks down to Cop26 . Other unions have accepted the deal on the table, but Scotland's transport minister, Graeme Dey, had warned he was "not optimistic" that a resolution would be reached with the RMT before the deadline set for 5pm on Wednesday.

Nearly 200 nations came together yesterday on a global deal to combat climate change after two weeks of painful negotiation, but fell short of what science says is needed to contain dangerous temperature rises. Rich countries stood accused of failing at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to deliver much-needed finance to vulnerable states at risk of drought, rising seas, fire and storms. Britain's COP26 president Alok Sharma rounded up the marathon negotiations telling delegates: "It is now decision time. And the choices you are set to make are vitally important." But China and India insisted that language on fossil fuels be weakened in the final summit decision text. As the final deal was clinched, a tearful Sharma said "I apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry," before banging down his gavel. Delegates entered the talks charged with keeping the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5-2C degrees within reach. They were also tasked with finding the funding for nations most at risk of climate-related droughts, floods and storms supercharged by rising seas. Observers said the agreement fell far short of what is needed to avert dangerous warming and help countries adapt or recoup damages from the disasters already unfurling globally. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the deal, but stressed it was "not enough". "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe." Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said the talks had achieved nothing but "blah, blah, blah", echoing earlier comments. Laurence Tubiana, the architect of the Paris deal, told AFP that "COP has failed to provide immediate assistance for people suffering now." But a statement from the European Commission said the deal had "kept the Paris targets alive". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government hosted the talks, insisted the deal was a "big step forward" even if much more work needed to be done. Survival The final text urged nations to accelerate efforts to "phase down" unfiltered coal and "phase out" inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Large emitters China and India had opposed the mention of the polluting fuels, and the language in the final text was significantly more nuanced than earlier drafts. The deal also called on all countries to accelerate their emissions cuts by submitting new national plans by 2022, three years earlier than agreed in Paris. But after resistance from rich nations led by the United States and EU, the text omitted any reference to a specific finance facility for the loss and damage climate change has already caused in the developing world. "For some loss and damage may be the beginning of conversation and dialogue," said Shauna Aminath, the Maldives environment minister. "But for us this is a matter of survival." Although host Britain said it wanted COP26 to keep the 1.5C temperature cap in reach, a UN scientific assessment last week said countries' latest climate plans put Earth on course to heat 2.7C. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories The text noted "with deep regret" that wealthy nations had also failed to stump up a separate annual sum of $100 billion they promised over a decade ago. It urged countries to pay up "urgently and through 2025". It also promised to double finance to help developing countries adapt to rising temperatures by the same date. 1.5C on life support But developing nations said it was unfair for the summit to produce an unbalanced agreement heavily weighted toward "mitigation" - how economies can ditch fossil fuels and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They wanted specific instruction on how they can meet the bill of decarbonising while also adapting to the natural disasters supercharged by global warming. "We were told that COP26 was the last best chance to keep 1.5C alive but it's been placed on life support," Amanda Mukwashi, CEO of Christian Aid. "Rich nations have kicked the can down the road and with it the promise of the urgent climate action people on the frontline of this crisis need." The two weeks in Glasgow saw a number of high-profile announcements from world leaders, such as a commitment to slash methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. It also witnessed mass protests against what activists said was a dangerous lack of urgency. Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International, said COP26 was "an insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis." \</doc>

AS the 26th UN Climate Change Conference - more commonly known as Cop26 - gets underway in Glasgow, countries are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century. Of particular interest and concern to Ireland will be any changes in policies to ramp up targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and transport. These two sectors combined account for over half of emissions in Ireland, well above the global average. Both sectors are pivotal to our export industry, but they are also two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. The vast majority of our agricultural and manufactured goods get to their market destinations by road and sea freight, with road being the fastest growing greenhouse gas emitter. Transport is one of the main sectors responsible for climate change. It accounts for close to one quarter of energy-related emissions. And unlike other sectors, it has not yet succeeded in reducing its carbon intensity. The difficulty for the transport industry is that this will offset any expected reductions they will get from new technology trucks. This will lead to an increase in emissions by 2050, not a reduction. But cost-effective alternatives are still lacking. Diesel-powered heavy goods vehicles offers a level of flexibility and accessibility. To reach climate targets, zero-emissions fuels for trucks would need to be in general use well in advance of 2050. Given the current state of research and commercial deployment, none of the known zero-emissions truck fuels will see widespread use in the short to medium term. Airlines, key for Ireland's international businesses, are promoting various alternative fuels, including biofuels. Some biofuels show promise, but without strict standards, may be counterproductive, and make global warming worse. The shipping industry, a much smaller greenhouse gas emitter, has also explored alternative fuels to diesel. Natural gas (LNG) tops the poll, and other new technology fuels such as dimethyl ether (DME) have also been explored, but are not yet produced at large scale. The OECD's International Transport Forum last October warned that climate change cannot be stopped without decarbonising transport. It went on to emphasise that the Paris Climate Agreement requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet their targets. It is expected that Cop26 will recommend stricter targets, with penalties imposed. Rapid economic growth in Ireland combined with the legacy of Covid that has increased demand for home deliveries, as well as international traffic re-routing because of Brexit, will lead to an increase in traffic. Much will depend on future breakthroughs in advanced biofuels, synthetic renewable fuels, and battery technology. The transport and export industry will be watching with mixed feelings the Cop26 gathering, hoping it can deliver policies on zero emission fuels for trucks, ships, and aeroplanes.

US television network CNN has been mocked for inaccurately suggesting the Cop26 summit is happening in Edinburgh rather than Glasgow. The broadcaster's anchor, Wolf Blitzer, tweeted a photo of a temporary studio set up in the Scottish capital with the city's famous castle serving as the backdrop. Social media users teased the journalist after he appeared to suggest the event was taking place in the wrong location. Blitzer wrote: "I'm now reporting from Edinburgh in Scotland where 20,000 world leaders and delegates have gathered for the COP26 Climate Summit. Advertisement"COP, by the way, stands for "Conference of the Parties". "It's the 26th time they have gathered to discuss and take action on this critical issue." The journalist was mocked on social media after sharing the image. Referencing an area in Glasgow, SNP MP David Linden joked: "Pictured in front\~ of Castlemilk." Former MP George Galloway added: "Er, it's in Glasgow." Optician chain Specsavers was among the responses poking fun at the apparent geographical mix-up. They quoted the tag line from their adverts but changed the slogan to write: "Should've gone to Glasgow". The Cop26 Blitzer joined CNN in 1990 and is the anchor of The Situation Room. According to CNN the programme provides viewers with "in-depth reports about the political, international and breaking news stories of the day". \</doc>

World leaders and national negotiators are set to meet over a two-week period in Glasgow to discuss the fightback against climate change. It comes as scientists say there is only a narrow window of opportunity for countries to cut global emissions to "net zero" by 2050, which could bring warming back to under 1.5C in the second half of the 21st century. COP26 : What is COP26 The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) is being held in Scotland from 31 October to 12 November. It is billed as a chance for humanity to save itself from climate catastrophe. It is the latest and most urgent summit in a protracted diplomatic process entering its fourth decade. In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which set ground rules and expectations for global co-operation on combating climate change. The "parties" are the 196 countries that ratified the treaty, plus the European Union. The United Kingdom, partnering with Italy, is hosting COP26 in Glasgow. It was due to take place last year but was postponed because of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Who will be there? The summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UN says that more than 190 world leaders will participate, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens for 12 days of talks. Some leaders have said they will not be attending, namely Russia\' s Vladimir Putin and the leader of the world's most populous country, President Xi Jinping of China, is not expected to be there in person. Pope Francis is not expected to attend. A Vatican source said there was a possibility that the Pope would address the conference by video - or that Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin would read a message on his behalf. Iranian President Ebraham Raisi will not attend COP26 after reports in the British media that local politicians were calling for a criminal investigation if he set foot in Scotland. Brazil\' s President Jair Bolsonaro and Vice President Hamilton Mourao, sometimes the point man for environment, are not going. However, new Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has said he is considering how he will participate, possibly taking part online. The daily Yomiuri reported that Kishida was making arrangements to try to attend in person. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend, his Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said. India is the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States. US President Joe Biden, along with climate envoy John Kerry will attend. The White House says 10 other cabinet officials will also be present. The European Union's representatives will include European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans, and the bloc's energy and financial services policy heads. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin and Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan are among the Irish delegates attending the conference. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed he will attend. While many global nations have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Australia has refused to strengthen its targets. David Attenborough, the world's most influential wildlife broadcaster, will exhort leaders to put climate and the protection of nature at the top of their agenda as the COP26 People\' s Advocate. Climate activists, including Extinction Rebellion, will gather in Glasgow to keep up the pressure, while Greta Thunberg confirmed she would join a 5 November march for "climate justice" in the city. Why is it important? In 1992 the UNFCCC set ground rules and expectations for global co-operation on combating climate change. It was the first time the majority of nations formally recognised the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, which causes the global warming that drives climate change. That treaty has since been updated, including in 2015 when nations signed the Paris climate agreement. That agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F), and preferably to 1.5C (2.7F), to avoid catastrophic climate change. If countries can cut global emissions to "net zero" by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5C in the second half of the 21st century. The COP is a complex process that can be hard to make sense of from the outside, but it\' s how international law and institutions help solve problems that no single country can fix on its own. Can anything be achieved from this meeting? The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\' s latest report, released in August 2021, warns in its strongest terms yet that human activities have unequivocally warmed the planet, and that climate change is now widespread, rapid and intensifying. The IPCC\' s scientists explain how climate change has been fueling extreme weather events and flooding, severe heat waves and droughts, loss and extinction of species, and the melting of ice sheets and rising of sea levels. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the report a "code red for humanity". Enough greenhouse gas emissions are already in the atmosphere, and they stay there long enough, that even under the most ambitious scenario of countries quickly reducing their emissions, the world will experience rising temperatures through at least mid-century. However, there remains a narrow window of opportunity. If countries can cut global emissions to "net zero" by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5C in the second half of the 21st century. How to get closer to that course is what leaders and negotiators are discussing. What happens at COP? During the first days of the conference, around 120 heads of state and their representatives will gather to demonstrate their political commitment to slowing climate change. Once the heads of state depart, country delegations, often led by ministers of environment, engage in days of negotiations, events and exchanges to adopt their positions, make new pledges and join new initiatives. These interactions are based on months of prior discussions, policy papers and proposals prepared by groups of states, UN staff and other experts. Nongovernmental organisations and business leaders also attend the conference, and COP26 has a public side with sessions focused on topics such as the impact of climate change on small island states, forests or agriculture, as well as exhibitions and other events. The meeting ends with an outcome text that all countries agree to. What are the aims of COP26 ? Ant\'f3nio Guterres publicly expressed disappointment with the COP25 outcome, and there are signs of trouble heading into COP26 . COP26 . This year, they\' re expected to have ambitious targets through 2030. These are known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs. The Paris Agreement requires countries to report their NDCs, but it allows them leeway in determining how they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The initial set of emission reduction targets in 2015 was far too weak to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One key goal of COP26 is to ratchet up these targets to reach net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century. Another aim of COP26 is to increase climate finance to help poorer countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change. This is an important issue of justice for many developing countries whose people bear the largest burden from climate change but have contributed least to it. Wealthy countries promised in 2009 to contribute $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations, a goal that has not been reached. The US, UK and EU, among the largest historic greenhouse emitters, are increasing their financial commitments, and banks, businesses, insurers and private investors are being asked to do more. Other objectives include phasing out coal use and generating solutions that preserve, restore or regenerate natural carbon sinks, such as forests. What other challenges face COP26 ? Another challenge that has derailed past COPs is agreeing on implementing a carbon trading system outlined in the Paris Agreement. The UN warned in September 2021 that countries\' revised targets were too weak and would leave the world on pace to warm 2.7C (4.9F) by the end of the century. However, governments are also facing another challenge this autumn that could affect how they respond: Energy supply shortages have left Europe and China with price spikes for natural gas, coal and oil. China \- the world\' s largest emitter \- has not yet submitted its NDC. Major fossil fuel producers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia seem unwilling to strengthen their commitments. India \- a critical player as the second-largest consumer, producer and importer of coal globally \- has also not yet committed. Other developing nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa and Mexico are important. So is Brazil, which, under Javier Bolsonaro\' s watch, has increased deforestation of the Amazon \- the world\' s largest rainforest and crucial for biodiversity and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Many insiders believe that COP26 won\' t reach its goal of having strong enough commitments from countries to cut global greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030. That means the world won\' t be on a smooth course for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and the goal of keeping warming under 1.5C. But organisers maintain that keeping warming under 1.5C is still possible. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been leading the US negotiations, remains hopeful that enough countries will create momentum for others to strengthen their reduction targets by 2025. What\' s at stake? Since the last UN conference in 2019, record-shattering wildfires have scorched across Australia, Western Europe and the United States; North America has sizzled in a once-in-a-thousand-year heatwave; and extreme rainfall has caused massive flooding in Asia, Africa, the US and Europe. Experts warn that only transformative action will help stave off far more devastating climate impacts, not just for humanity but most life on Earth. The cost of failure is astronomical. Studies have shown that the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius can mean the submersion of small island states, the death of coral reefs, extreme heat waves, flooding and wildfires, and pervasive crop failure. That translates into many premature deaths, more mass migration, major economic losses, large swaths of unlivable land and violent conflict over resources and food - what the UN secretary-general has called "a hellish future". Organisers have already warned the negotiations may fail to reach their objectives. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously summed up his hopes for Glasgow as "coal, cars, cash and trees" - meaning deals for global phaseouts of coal power and internal combustion engines, funding for climate-vulnerable nations and tree planting. Other tasks are less clear cut, including governing the carbon markets and finalising a "rulebook" for the Paris Agreement that specifies how goals are to be reached and progress measured. But experts warn that the stakes could not be higher. That point was underscored with dark humour this week in a video released by the UN Development Programme, which shows a dinosaur striding into a UN meeting and declaring: "I know a thing or two about extinction."

As world leaders gather in Glasgow next month for the UN Convention of Parties (COP) on Climate Change, RT\'c9 will be there to bring you a wide range of content across all platforms. Here's your guide for what to look out for and how we plan to cover what has been described as our 'last best chance' to combat global warming.  What is COP26  For the first two weeks in November a summit of world leaders, scientists, activists and policy makers will be gathered in Glasgow, Scotland to form the UN Convention of Parties (COP) on Climate Change. This meeting, COP26, is aimed to reach agreement about what needs to be done to make sure the rise in global temperature is kept to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.   Why do I need to know about COP26 ? This comes at a crucial point after the recent IPCC - the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report written by scientists from all around the world, which declared £ red alert for humanity' and said that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying. The IPCC made it clear that human activity was driving this.   Delegates from more than 190 countries are tasked with finding solutions to the crisis that will bring down harmful emissions. This requires increased efforts and climate actions by all nations. They also aim to resolve issues around climate finance including how to help less well-off nations to adapt to climate change. UN Climate Conference President Alok Sharma called COP26 our "last best chance" to combat global warming.  How can I find out about what is happening at COP26 and Climate Change issues? As the world looks to unite to tackle the issue of climate change at the global UN COP26 event next month, RT\'c9 will bring audiences to the heart of November\' s summit with special news & current affairs programming and easily accessed expansive digital content as part of its continued coverage of climate change. As the World Leaders Summit begins in Glasgow, Scotland on 1 November, RT\'c9 Radio 1's Morning Ireland and RT\'c9's Six One News will broadcast live from the conference.

The Cop26 summit kicked off in Glasgow on Sunday. Here's what happened on day one - UK politician Alok Sharma officially assumed the role of Cop26 President, taking over the gavel and presiding duties from Chile's Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar, with a warning that the conference was the last best chance to keep global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. He said the world would succeed or fail as one, as he urged countries to make Glasgow the conference that delivers on the commitments to curb warming made in the global Paris climate accord, agreed in the French capital in 2015.

AdvertisementThis year is likely to have been the fifth to seventh hottest year on record, due to a "La Nina" weather phenomenon in the Pacific - which has a cooling affect on global temperatures, but it still averaged 1.09C above pre-industrial levels. - The conference, delayed by a year by the pandemic, is a Cop like no other, due to the ongoing threat of Covid-19. Delegates have to wear masks, observe social distancing and take daily lateral flow tests before attending, while there are also room capacity limits and potentially access to the overall venue may be limited at busy times. Holding the conference while the pandemic continues has raised concerns from some quarters about access and transparency, but Mr Sharma has said it is important to hold face-to-face negotiations among countries.

A draft text at the COP26 climate summit urged countries to revisit their emissions cutting goals by 2022, three years ahead of schedule, after data showed current plans were far from limiting heating to 1.5C. After ten days of technical discussions among delegates from nearly 200 nations in Glasgow on how the world can implement the Paris Agreement temperature goals, the text called for nations to "revisit and strengthen" their decarbonisation plans by next year. The draft, which will change as ministers work towards the summit's conclusion, said that limiting heating to 1.5C "requires meaningful and effective action by all Parties in this critical decade". It said "rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions" were needed to avert the worst impacts of heating, which has already seen countries worldwide slammed by fiercer floods, droughts and storms. COP26 was billed by host Britain as an opportunity to "keep 1.5C" alive after a year-long delay due to Covid-19. However, countries' latest decarbonisation plans are likely to see Earth warm 2.7C this century, according to a United Nations assessment of the pledges. Negotiators are also trying to hammer out agreement on technical parts of the global climate treaty, the Paris Agreement, including common timeframes for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed ways for countries to report on their progress, to help turn pledges into action. There are also negotiations on providing finance for developing countries to cope with climate change and address the issue of loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure caused by global warming in poorer nations. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged countries to "pull out all the stops" in the final days of COP26 . Countries are positioning themselves for the final days of negotiations, with Nick Mabey from climate think tank E3G suggesting "a high ambition outcome is still on the table" and momentum is with those countries pushing for ambition. A "High Ambition Coalition" of vulnerable countries and others including the US and Europe countries is calling for nations to submit action plans in line with limiting temperatures to 1.5C in the next year and long term plans to meet the target by 2023, though there is pushback from other countries. Finance for developing countries is also key to the talks. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is also due to travel to Glasgow. He is expected to speak at an event in support of small island developing states, one of the groups of countries already dealing with the consequences of global warming. \</doc>

Efforts to strike a global agreement on climate action went into overtime last night at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow amid anger that a new draft deal had watered down the push to reduce fossil fuels. Many developing countries have called for more finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and adapt to the changing climate, and for support for the loss and damage they are facing from rising seas and more extreme weather. A range of countries have called for stronger action on phasing out fossil fuels after language on accelerating a phaseout of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels was weakened in a new draft of the overarching "cover decision" that could be secured at the talks. There were also warnings that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, was a "matter of life and death". In the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries committed to limit temperature rises to "well below" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C to avoid the most dangerous impacts of storms, droughts, crop failures, floods, and disease. Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century. However, despite countries being required to update their action plans (known as nationally determined contributions) for emissions cuts up to 2030 in the run-up to Cop26 , the latest pledges leave the world off-track to meet the goal. Therefore, countries are under pressure to come up with a deal in Glasgow that will see them rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal from slipping out of reach. The new version of the cover decision "requests" countries to revisit and strengthen their plans for 2030 within the next year in line with the Paris temperature goal - seen as stronger language than the first draft which "urges" countries to do so. The latest version has weakened language on fossil fuels, but the historic reference - a first for a climate decision of this type - is still there, despite scepticism it will survive to the final draft. The first draft of the "cover decision" called for countries "to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". In a new draft produced yesterday, that changed to "accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels". There are also drafts to finalise the "Paris rulebook", including on creating carbon markets and delivering transparency to help assess what countries are doing, to make the Paris accord operational and effective. EU executive vice president Frans Timmermans said: "1.5C is about avoiding a future for our children and grandchildren that is unliveable". China indicated it would be willing to support a Cop26 agreement, but expressed disappointment about a lack of details on how to achieve the $ 100bn-a-year climate finance pledge for poorer nations. The talks were expected to go well into the night at the least, with new versions of texts set to be published. Forum: 14 \</doc>

Negotiators at Cop26 were last night closing in on an agreement to tackle climate change amid warnings that scaling back their ambitions too much would fail to keep alive the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. The summit continued beyond its scheduled conclusion of 6pm and negotiators were expected to work through the night on a final text. Language on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsides has been weakened from the initial draft but some observers insist undertakings under these headings are significant, even with absence of clear time lines. Saudi Arabia and Russia want no references to fossil fuels, according to negotiators. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said he believed the text remained ambitious and that although the commitments made in Glasgow were not enough to reach 1.5 degrees, the goal remained realistic. 'The negotiations' "My sense of the negotiations is they're not in a bad place because the ambition is not being scaled back. Certain things are slightly weakened, but it's not fundamentally been weakened," he said. \</doc>

A group of young climate activists from around the world say they feel "betrayed" by leaders at Cop26 , as they gathered at a demonstration opposite the summit in Glasgow. The group held up illuminated letters saying "end climate betrayal" during the protest on the opposite bank of the Clyde. The event was organised by the Avaaz campaign organisation, which has drafted an open letter calling for climate action with more than one million signatures. One of those who gave a speech at the demonstration on Tuesday evening was Txai Surui, an Amazonian indigenous activist of the Paiter Surui people. Earlier, she took part in the opening day of Cop26 , urging world leaders to listen to indigenous people. The 24-year-old told the PA news agency: "We're having people invading our lands - such as loggers - and destroying our forests. "My friend was murdered because he protected our home. She said she felt this Cop meeting was more open to the voices of indigenous people than previous conferences, but there were still more to be heard. After her speech on the opening day of Cop26 , she said, a member of the Brazilian party approached her and told her to stop criticising the country. She said: "He was not happy about my whole speech, because I said we were on the front lines of defending the forest and we are dying for that." \~ Dominika Lasota, a Polish member of the Fridays For Future movement founded by Greta Thunberg, said she first got involved in climate activism at the start of the pandemic. Despite gatherings being hindered by coronavirus, the 19-year-old said the movement had not died down.

"I think the most distressing thing to see is Boris Johnson and Joe Biden not coming forward with adequate action. They are betraying us." \</doc>

BORIS JOHNSON'S private jet flight from Glasgow to attend dinner at a London club is likely to have produced at least 980kg more carbon emissions per passenger than if he had taken the train. Mr Johnson opted to take the highest-carbon form of transport when travelling from the pivotal COP26 Had he taken the train, the 644km journey from Scotland would have emitted just 20kg of CO2 (per passenger), according to the Campaign for Better Transport. However, he instead travelled by private charter plane. Research by Transport and Environment (T&E) found that private jets are 50 times more polluting than trains. A No 10 spokesman told the Mirror: "All travel decisions are made with consideration for security and time restraints. The prime minister travelled on one of the most carbon-efficient planes of its size in the world." Glasgow-London flights take around an hour and a half, while the train journey takes from four hours and 28 minutes. A scheduled commercial flight would have been quicker than the train but five to 14 times less polluting than a private jet. A government spokesperson said: "We use a specific type of fuel which is a blend of 35pc sustainable aviation fuel and 65pc normal fuel - which is the maximum amount allowed - and, obviously, emissions will be offset."

Bin collectors and street cleaners have walked out on strike as Glasgow hosts world leaders for the Cop26 summit, amid a row between a union and the city council. GMB members walked out at one minute past midnight on Monday following the collapse of last-ditch talks between the union and Glasgow City Council on Sunday evening. More than 100 world leaders are expected to arrive in Glasgow on Monday as the first day of the two-day world leaders' summit takes place at the Cop26 UN climate conference. The planned strike action was previously called off on Friday after a new pay offer from council umbrella body Cosla, and the GMB said it would suspend the strike for two weeks to consult with members. However, following talks on Sunday, the GMB said strike action would go ahead. GMB Scotland secretary Louise Gilmour said: "We met the council in good faith, offering a clear set of proposals to reset industrial relations and avoid strikes. The council rejected these proposals." She added: "Regrettably, the council refused this massive opportunity to move forward, and strike action across the cleansing service will now begin, during which time our members will be balloted on the Cosla pay offer." The union said workers will take strike action throughout the first full week of the Cop26 summit. The GMB was calling for a \£32,000 ((EURO)2,363) pay rise and previously turned down an offer of an \£3850-a-year increase for staff earning up to \£325,000. The Cosla proposal tabled on Friday is for a one-year, 5.89 per cent increase for the lowest paid council staff, as part of a \£31,062 rise for all staff earning below \£325,000. The Scottish government gave \£330 million to support the offer.

Was it just two weeks of handshakes and photo ops or will something positive come from Cop26 ? Global leaders and their negotiating teams recently rode into Glasgow with the very serious mandate to take meaningful action immediately to reduce the impact of climate change. However, past Conference of the Parties (Cop) meetings have promised much and unfortunately delivered very little beyond unmet self-policed targets. So will the follow-on from Cop26 be any different? There are some positives - renewing commitment to the Paris agreement targets, halting de-forestation, tackling methane emissions, additional countries signing up, and co-operation agreements. On our turf, Ireland has signed up to most, if not all the commitments of the Cop26 agreements and had already started the journey by adopting the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill earlier this year, along with announcing the new Climate Action Plan. So now it's up to us to make good on our promises and commitments. If we are to achieve the goals set at Cop26 , then we must start with the first step - meet the Irish target of achieving 51 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. That means slashing emissions by half in eight years. If that sounds too difficult as a first step, it's only because we have failed to make any significant changes to meet much smaller goals in the past, and it will only get more difficult, if not impossible, if we don't take serious action now. For that to happen, Cop26 must be a turning point for the biggest contributor - the building sector, which is responsible for 40 per cent of global CO2 emissions. How we see it Our best advice for building owners and developers is simple. The path to achieving these goals is to work now on anticipating the imminent regulations and producing an action plan to deliver the required targets. Apart from the obvious need to mitigate climate impacts, failure to take action will inevitably lead to a reduction in overall building value and lettability. The Irish market is not without shortfalls. We have seen inadequate implementation of technology, less than optimal operation of buildings, poor maintenance of systems and meagre engagement with tenants, especially in the older building stock. A shortage of specialised technicians, architects and engineers is also a factor. Regardless of what motivates you, Ireland has enough to keep us hopeful. There is access to technology and equipment, available renewable resources and free cooling, stringent energy code, supportive government and financial incentives, demanding corporate clients and an equally rewarding market return, and an abundance of colleges and technical schools . How we do it When I meet clients for a coffee, their first question is "How do we start?". The answer is to find out where you need to be in 2030 to meet the targets, and then cast back to where you should be today, and every day, for the next eight years to succeed. Then devise the plan to keep you on track to achieve that. These comprehensive action plans must have ambitious targets and an end goal to deliver on-the-ground change to reduce carbon emissions and waste, lower pollution, boost biodiversity and ultimately make buildings and cities more sustainable and resilient. Commitments alone are not enough - delivering on these targets must be a key measure of the business success. The recent news that the US and Chinese governments have agreed to work together on climate change targets highlights a vital perspective. We must seek out all potential allies to succeed in this journey, up and down the supply chain: governments, NGOs, communities, clients and even competitors. Ultimately, it is up to each one of us if something positive is to come from Cop26 . If there is one thing we have learned during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that our ability to change and adapt drastically in the face of existential threats is far beyond what we thought it would be. There is no greater existential threat than climate change. Let's find the cure, and we must start now. Rami Nassar is head of sustainability with JLL \</doc>

World leaders meeting in Glasgow for the UN COP26 summit are under pressure to take action on climate change, but what exactly is it they are talking about? Here are some of the commonly used climate terms and what they mean. Greenhouse gases These are gases that trap some of the heat from the sun in the atmosphere and keep the planet warm enough for life to thrive. Concentrations of these gases, which include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have increased at a rapid rate in recent years. Greenhouse gas or carbon emissions This is the release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels - coal, gas and oil - in things such as power stations, vehicle engines and boilers for heating buildings. Livestock and changes to how we use land, including cutting down or burning forests and draining peatland, industrial processes, such as cement making and refrigerants, are among other sources of greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. Global warming Because of emissions from human activity, the overall level or concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased. The higher the concentrations in the atmosphere, the more they trap heat and warm the Earth, pushing up temperatures across the land and oceans, which is known as global warming. In 2020, global temperatures were around 1.2C above what they were in the 19th century, before most of the industrial activity driving emissions got going. Climate change This encompasses the rapid changes we are seeing to weather conditions and the natural world, driven by global warming and the human activities that cause it. Impacts we are already seeing include more frequent and extreme heatwaves and wildfires, increased rainfall and storms which can cause floods, melting ice and rising sea levels, changes to crop yields and loss of wildlife. As temperatures continue to rise, the impacts of climate change are projected to worsen, and the situation is increasingly being referred to as a climate crisis or emergency. Net zero Cutting greenhouse gas emissions from human activity to zero overall, which is needed to halt the global temperature rises driven by the increase in levels of gases in the atmosphere. Just as you need to turn off a tap completely to stop the level of water in a bath from continuing to rise, we need to cut emissions to zero to stop the greenhouse gas levels - and therefore temperatures - rising. So emissions have to be cut as much as possible, and any remaining pollution, from hard-to-tackle sectors such as aviation, needs to be "offset" by action that absorbs carbon to have the net effect of cutting emissions to zero. Decarbonisation The process of removing the emissions associated with activities or sectors, for example decarbonising electricity generation by phasing out coal and gas plants that put out pollution, and building renewables, such as offshore wind farms. Paris Agreement The world's first comprehensive treaty on climate change, agreed under the United Nations in the French capital in December 2015. Under the deal, all countries commit to action to limit temperature rises to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) National plans for climate action submitted by countries under the Paris Agreement, which outline post-2020 action to tackle climate change, with many plans running to 2030. COP26 is the deadline for new, more ambitious NDCs under a five-year process established by the Paris deal, with current policies and plans leaving the world way off track to meet the 2C or 1.5C goals. COP26 This is the latest global climate summit held under the UN's climate change convention, which is being hosted by the UK and taking place in Glasgow. COP26 , delayed from last year by the pandemic, is seen as the most important international climate meeting since Paris 2015, because it is the NDC deadline and has been described as the last best chance to keep 1.5C in reach. There will also be negotiations to agree the final parts of the "rulebook" for implementing the Paris Agreement, and talks focusing on finance to help countries cope with the impacts of climate change. COP stands for "conference of the parties", and this is the 26th one held under the convention, usually annually since 1995. AOSIS, LULUCF, YOUNGO and more... These are just some of acronyms and jargon that surrounds the UN convention, which is known as the United Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC. \</doc>

The third day of the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow saw big announcements of action - and a Hollywood star act. Here are some of the takeaways from day three. Some big news on saving and restoring forests on day three of the world leaders' summit at Cop26 , as 110 nations - home to 85 per cent of the world's forests - signed a declaration to halt and reverse the destruction of forests and land. Tackling climate change cannot be done without ending the loss of forests which are the lungs of the planet, according to British prime minister Boris Johnson. Advertisement"Let's end this great chainsaw massacre," he urged leaders. Amazon delivers Also stepping in to help the natural world was Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who announced $2 billion ((EURO)1.72 billion) for restoring land in Africa. The billionaire announced the funding as he told Cop26 his flight to space in July had made him realise how fragile the planet was. The amount of cash appeared to have doubled overnight, after an event with the Prince of Wales on Monday where Mr Bezos indicated the investment would be $1 billion - but that is the advantage of being one of the world's richest men. Leaders pledge to cut the gas The announcements of positive action continued with news that scores of countries - it was not entirely clear how many, but somewhere over 80 and close to 100 - had signed a pledge to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. The announcement fronted by the EU's Ursula von der Leyen and US president Joe Biden was delayed as they turned up late. AdvertisementThat left special climate envoy John Kerry to fill the time with some off-the-cuff remarks to assembled dignitaries, including possible good news out of Japan that means the $100 billion dollar ((EURO)86 billion) climate finance goal may be met next year.

Youth activists are taking to the streets of Glasgow to demand action on climate change from leaders and politicians as the COP26 talks continue. Campaigner Greta Thunberg, fellow activist Vanessa Nakate and other young campaigners, as well as local trade unionists will speak to crowds at the end of the march through the city. The climate strike is organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, with participants marching at 11am from Kelvingrove Park to George Square. It comes as the summit features events highlighting the voice of young people and education in climate action. But Ms Thunberg has been highly critical of the two-week conference, claiming it is the most "excluding COP ever" and labelling it a "two week celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah". A group of mothers from around the world, including Rosamund Adoo Kissi Debrah, whose daughter Ella died from an asthma attack as a result of severe air pollution, will be handing in a letter calling for an end to new fossil fuel financing for the sake of their children's health and future. They will then join the youth strikers marching through Glasgow. Britain's Prince of Wales has been invited to join the youth march, but said taking part would be "difficult". He sympathised with the "frustration" of the younger generation in a speech to COP26 negotiators, and he told them the "weight of history" is resting on their shoulders. Today's protest comes ahead of marches tomorrow where tens of thousands of people are expected in Glasgow, with other marches in London and cities around the UK, as well as across the world. The protests come at the end of the first week of the conference, where countries are under pressure to increase ambition on cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, to avoid the worst impacts of warming, and to ensure finance for poor countries to tackle the crisis. Earlier in the week around 120 world leaders gathered at the summit to set out the action they were taking to tackle the climate crisis. There have also been announcements on curbing deforestation, phasing out coal and boosting finance flows towards transforming economies to be green. \</doc>

A first draft of a pact that could be agreed at Cop26 urges countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting plans for the 2020s in the next year. A draft "cover decision" published on Wednesday morning also urges them to set out long-term strategies by the end of next year to reach net-zero emissions by around mid-century, to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. Cop26 presidency around six hours later than expected, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. It says meeting the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees - which countries pledged to try to pursue under the Paris climate accord - needs meaningful and effective action in "this critical decade". HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlLmFzc2V0cy5wcmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0aW9uLmlvXFxcL3YyXFxcL2ltYWdlXFxcL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb25cXFwvZTQ3MDEyMzZlMWEwYzliY2E3NzVjZDIzM2NiNGIyNDJZMjl1ZEdWdWRITmxZWEpqYUdGd2FTd3hOak0yTmpFMk16Y3dcXFwvMi42MzUxNDM3OC5qcGc_dz02NDBcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6bnVsbCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYwMCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6e1wib3V0cHV0XCI6XCJ3ZWJwXCJ9fSIsImhhc2giOiI4ZGE2NDRhYWZhZDJkZjI5MDAwNjE5N2M0Y2RjM2M4YzE5YTQxNTc3In0=/draft-cop26-outcome-calls-for-countries-to-strengthen-climate-action-in-2022.jpg?w=640 Link to Image (PA Graphics) Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, requires global emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century - but country plans for this decade leave the world well off track for the goal. AdvertisementThe document calls for countries to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels, and for developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change, as part of scaling money for poorer nations to tackle the crisis. Delegations are expected to be in contact with their leaders and capitals to discuss what their position on it will be - particularly in those countries whose leaders did not attend the world leaders' summit, such as China and Russia. British prime minister Boris Johnson has urged countries to "pull out all the stops" to agree climate action ahead of returning to the Glasgow summit as it enters its final days. Negotiators are also trying to hammer out agreement on technical parts of the global climate treaty, the Paris Agreement, including common timeframes for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed ways for countries to report on their progress, to help turn pledges into action. There are also negotiations on providing finance for developing countries to cope with climate change and address the issue of loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure caused by global warming in poorer nations. Advertisement Campaigners were quick to criticise the draft deal as not strong enough. Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said the draft deal was "not a plan to solve the climate crisis". "It's a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year," she said. It comes as analysis shows the world is on track for 2.4 degrees of warming based on current pledges of action up to 2030. Ms Morgan said: "The job of this conference was always to get that number down to 1.5 degrees, but with this text world leaders are punting it to next year. "If this is the best they can come up with then it's no wonder kids today are furious at them," she said, adding it needed to be much stronger on finance and adaptation for developing countries. Mr Johnson said: "Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of Cop26 to turn promises into action on climate change. Advertisement"There's still much to do. Today I'll be meeting with ministers and negotiators\~to hear about where progress has been made and where the gaps must be bridged. \~ "This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people. "We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5 degrees within our grasp." Alongside the negotiations, the Cop26 conference is marking "transport day", with a number of aims drawn up. Thirty countries have agreed to work together to make zero emissions vehicles the new normal, and plans for "green shipping corridors" will be unveiled - facilitating a shift to zero emissions vessels. Also, 14 states, collectively making up for more than 40 per cent of global aviation emissions, have put their names to a commitment to a new decarbonisation target. \</doc>

Britain's Queen Elizabeth has pulled out of hosting a major reception for world leaders at the Cop26 climate change summit, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. The 95-year-old monarch was due to travel to Scotland for the high-profile engagement on Monday, but will now record a speech later this week that will be played in a video message to delegates. It is understood the Queen very much wants Cop26 to be a success and result in meaningful action from the participating nations. It is hoped no world leaders will use the head of state's absence as a reason not to attend the global summit in Glasgow. A palace spokesman said: "Following advice to rest, the Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle. "Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of Cop26 on Monday, 1st November. "Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message."

World leaders have gathered at the crunch climate summit in Glasgow amid warnings that they must take urgent action to limit dangerous global warming. Taoiseach Micheal Martin, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and Canadian leader Justin Trudeau were among some 120 leaders due to attend. The issue for Cop26 on climate change is "matching the HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/climate/cop26-action-not-rhetoric-needed-to-tackle-existential-crisis-of-climate-change-warns-martin-1207373.html rhetoric with action "There's no alternative facing the world but to deal very quickly and urgently with the climate change challenge," he said. Meanwhile, delegates arriving at the conference faced long queues to get into the Scottish Event Campus venue on Monday for the opening ceremony. British prime minister Boris Johnson, who was welcoming leaders to Glasgow for the talks alongside UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, will tell them that humanity has "long since run down the clock on climate change" and must act now to tackle the crisis. Advertisement Prince Charles, who will address leaders alongside Mr Johnson, is expected to stress the urgency of action - calling for the world to be on a "war-like footing". Around 120 heads of state and government are set to attend the world leaders' summit at the start of the Cop26 talks, where countries are under pressure to increase action in the next decade to tackle dangerous warming. US president Joe Biden, European leaders and India's Narendra Modi are among those attending the talks, although the heads of key major economies including China's Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be there. The conference in Glasgow is seen as the moment when countries must deliver on pledges made in the accord agreed in Paris six years ago, to limit temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to curb warming to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts will be felt. There is also pressure on developed countries to deliver a long-promised $100 billion a year in climate finance for poorer countries least responsible for and most vulnerable to climate change, and address loss and damage caused by the impacts of global warming. And there will be efforts to drive action by countries, regions, and businesses to curb emissions in sectors such as power with efforts to phase out coal, as well as finalise parts of the Paris climate accord agreed in 2015 to make it effective and operational. AdvertisementCountries' plans for cutting emissions in the next decade - key to limiting long-term temperature rises - leave the world well off track to meet the climate goals and put the planet on course for a dangerous 2.7 C of warming.

The talks are scheduled to finish at 6pm on Friday, but could overrun as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, calls for accelerating the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and coal, and the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s. A new version of the overarching deal that could be agreed at the summit in Glasgow is expected overnight into Friday. The first draft of the "cover decision" urges countries to "revisit and strengthen" targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans, to align them by the end of 2022 with the Paris goal of keeping temperature rises to "well below 2C" or\~to 1.5C. AdvertisementThe document published on Wednesday includes a call for developed countries to at least double their collective provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change, as part of scaling up funding for poorer nations to tackle the crisis and address loss and damage. Some of the most vulnerable nations have raised concerns about the lack of detail.

As the talks entered the final stretch, Cop26 president Alok Sharma warned: "We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome that we can all be proud of. "Because ultimately, this outcome, whatever it is, will belong to all of us." \</doc>

There has been a mixed reaction here to the final agreement at COP26 in Glasgow. Minister for Transport, Climate, Environment and Communications Eamon Ryan represented Ireland at the negotiations. Speaking this afternoon, he said it was "gut-wrenching" in the room at the end of the negotiations, when there was a change to the wording on the phasing-out of coal. "But that shouldn't distract from the fact that there was huge progress in Glasgow, that will help us to take more rapid, more urgent climate action and stich climate justice into what we do, so it was a good outcome," he added. The Green Party Leader said COP26 will see decarbonisation of all sectors in Ireland accelerate, adding: "If you're in business and you're not taking climate change seriously then you won't be in business in ten-years' time." On the agreement on methane which Ireland signed in Glasgow, Mr Ryan said the 30% target for cuts in global methane emissions does apply to Ireland. "Yes it will require changes in Irish agriculture, to be honest though the first big switch though will be in the fossil fuel methane which is much more easily and much more quickly dealt with, but in Irish agriculture, it too will be part of this change," he said, adding "we have to do it in a way that's good for Irish farming." The Irish Farmers' Association was represented in Glasgow by President Tim Cullinan. It says the outcome of COP26 compounds the sense of unfairness felt by Irish farmers. IFA Environment Chairman Paul O'Brien said farmers in Ireland are "very conscious" of the climate challenge, and the need for farmers to play their part. "But it needs to be fair," he said. "What is fair about adding targets and increased costs on Irish farm families, but allowing huge global coal producers to shirk their responsibilities?" On the methane agreement, he said the world\' s biggest methane emitters - China, Russia and India - which contribute 35% of methane emissions, refused to sign up for it. "This is not fair to Irish farmers, who are being asked to do more and more for less," he added. Activists have expressed some disappointment at the outcome at COP26 . Dr Aideen O\' Dochartaigh is an Assistant Professor of Accounting at the School of Business in Dublin City University and a member of "Not Here, Not Anywhere" - a group campaigning to end fossil fuel exploration and the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure in Ireland. She said it is significant that fossil fuels are included in the text of a COP agreement for the first time. However, she said it was very concerning that the text is so weak, adding that it is "a testament to the work of the fossil fuel industry and the industry lobby groups." Dr O\' Dochartaigh welcomed the fact that Ireland joined a new Beyond Gas & Oil Alliance, adding that she wants to see this matched by domestic policies, including a ban on a Liquified Natural Gas terminal and managing energy demand from new data centres. Sadhbh O'Neill, also an Assistant Professor at DCU at the School of Law, says people need to fight any sense of depair following the summit. Speaking on RT\'c9\' s This Week programme, she said the danger is people "forget to work on what was achieved." She said the references to near time action were significant and may lead to countries having to submit annual updates on their climate action policies. On the text around the "phasing down" of coal, she said that last-minute watering-down was a disappointment, but that "there is a lot there we can work with it". She quoted one activist who said: "We need to ram that phrase down the throat of every investor, every insurer, every pension fund and the financial markets, so that these assets in gas, oil or in coal are about to become toxic and we shift the financial system away". \</doc>

WE can see progress at COP26 , perhaps the most important international gathering in human history. That is good news. Out of curiosity, I checked the Fox News website on Tuesday to see what kind of coverage the summit was receiving. The only reporting that touched on COP26 were a few unashamedly politically motivated articles on US President Joe Biden appearing to fall asleep during the HYPERLINK http://www.summit.No www.summit.No mention of climate change in any HYPERLINK http://www.headlines.No www.headlines.No mention of existential HYPERLINK http://www.threat.No www.threat.No mention of humans being HYPERLINK http://www.responsible.No www.responsible.No mention of 1.5 degrees HYPERLINK http://www.Celsius.No www.Celsius.No mention of 2030, or HYPERLINK http://www.2050.No www.2050.No mention of extreme weather events, mass extinction or biodiversity loss. Most of the news coverage on the website was geared toward the Virginia governorship election, which the Republican candidate won. Fox News once again comfortably topped the recently-published cable viewership ratings in the US, with an average prime time audience of 2.372 million viewers. Even at this early stage, it can be said that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for 2024. This is a man who withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, who claimed "the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing more competitive", who promoted the use of "beautiful, clean coal", who said in relation to wind turbines that "they say the noise causes cancer", who dismissed a landmark scientific report on climate change by the US government's own scientists and whose administration rolled back numerous key climate regulations. COP26 may turn out to be a qualified success, but if Donald Trump, with the wind of Fox News in his sails, is elected US president for a second term in 2024, one worries what it would mean for the commitments made at the summit, particularly in the run-up to the key deadline of 2030.

Securing a global climate deal in Glasgow will be "really tough", Cop26 president Alok Sharma has warned. He said sealing any agreement to reduce emissions will be harder "on lots of levels" than signing the Paris Agreement of 2015. Countries are under pressure to increase their greenhouse gas emission cuts as the world is far off track to meet globally agreed targets to limit temperature rises and curb dangerous warming. The Cop26 Mr Sharma told The Guardian: "What we're trying to do here in Glasgow is actually really tough. "It was brilliant, what they did in Paris, it was a framework agreement, (but) a lot of the detailed rules were left for the future. "It's like we've got to the end of the exam paper and the most difficult questions are left and you're running out of time, the exam's over in half an hour and you go, 'how are we going to answer this one?"' He said "this is definitely harder than Paris on lots of levels" but added: "What we have going for us is that there is an understanding that we need to deal with this (climate crisis)." Testing and quarantine arrangements have been put in place for the summit, which was delayed due to the pandemic, with at least 25,000 delegates and more than 120 world leaders set to attend. Key polluters including China and India have yet to submit new plans for the next decade, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The Paris Agreement committed countries to curbing long-term global warming to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the worst climate impacts will be felt. The key target for Cop26 is set to be keeping the 1.5C goal within reach. He told the newspaper: "The question is whether or not countries are willing in Glasgow to go forward and commit to consensus on keeping 1.5C alive, that's where the challenge will be. "What we're potentially saying to countries is that if your NDC isn't good enough, you're going to have to come back to the table." Mr Sharma said he believes no one will want to be pointed out as the country that damages the chances of reaching the 1.5C aim. \</doc>

THE first electric public transport double-decker buses  on the island of Ireland were unveiled by Translink yesterday to coincide with UN Cop26 Climate Change Summit\' s theme on \' energy\' . The new Translink fleet will see 80 of the buses on Northern Ireland\' s transport network by the spring and sees double-deckers reintroduced to the region for the first time in 30 years. The Department of Infrastructure has made a \£374 million investment for 100 zero emission buses, which also include 20 hydrogen-fuelled buses and programme of `associated works\' . Minister Nichola Mallon has made a commitment to decarbonising Northern Ireland\' s public transport.  Cleaner, greener, sustainable transport is key to protecting our environment and fighting the climate crisis, she said.  ... I am delighted to see this investment now translate into delivery on the ground with the arrival of the first electric double decker buses for public transport on the island of Ireland today.  When all the buses arrive and are in service Translink will have the fourth largest fleet across these islands of zero emission buses \- demonstrating my commitment to ensuring Northern Ireland is building a cleaner, greener society. She said  the hard work here in Northern Ireland is paying off and we are transitioning our public transport system now and for the future .  I believe COP26 represents a critical time and opportunity for decision makers across the world. This is the world\' s best and last chance to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Chris Conway of Translink described it as  another significant milestone in our journey to reduce our carbon emissions and attract more people to cleaner public transport choices for the benefit of everyone .  These new zero emission buses will make up around one third of the Translink Metro fleet helping improve air quality in Belfast, he said.  They will also offer the latest standards in comfort, quality and accessibility with in-seat USB chargers, WiFi and new accessibility features. He said the company is already seeing more people turn to public transport as Northern Ireland  starts to slowly recover . Translink will be the first operator of the Wrightbus Electroliner passenger service -  the fastest charging of its kind on the market , according to the manufacturer. The public can see the bus next Wednesday as part of RE[act] Festival at Custom House Square between 11am and 3pm. \</doc>

World leaders meeting at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow will today issue a multibillion-dollar pledge to end deforestation by 2030. However, that date is too distant for campaigners, who want action sooner to save the planet's lungs. According to summit hosts, the UK government, the pledge is backed by almost $20 billion in public and private funding and is endorsed by more than 100 leaders representing over 85% of the world's forests, including the Amazon rainforest, Canada's northern boreal forest and the Congo Basin rainforest. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the agreement on deforestation was pivotal to the overarching ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. "These great teeming ecosystems - these cathedrals of nature - are the lungs of our planet," he is expected to say in Glasgow, according to Downing Street. "Forests support communities, livelihoods and food supply, and absorb the carbon we pump into the atmosphere. They are essential to our very survival. "With today's unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity's long history as nature's conqueror, and instead become its custodian." The signatories include Brazil and Russia, which have been singled out for accelerating deforestation in their territories, as well as the United States, China, Australia and France. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/cop26/ Latest COP26 news The government of Brazil, much criticised for its environmental policies, announced yesterday at the summit that it would cut 2005-level greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 - up from a previous pledge of 43%. "We are presenting a new, more ambitious climate goal," Environment Minister Joaquim Leite announced in a message transmitted from Brasilia to Glasgow. Mr Leite also said Brazil would aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. India targets net-zero 2070 For his part, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a target of net-zero emissions by 2070. India's commitment was eagerly awaited, as the South Asian giant is the fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China, the United States and the European Union. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg urged the leaders gathered for COP26 to act and stop their "blah blah blah" during a demonstration in Glasgow. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate news Almost a quarter of all man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can be attributed to land use activity such as logging, deforestation and farming. President Joko Widodo of resource-rich Indonesia said his own archipelago's rainforests, mangroves, seas and peatlands were key to restricting climate change. "We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations," he said in a UK government statement. Ten more years The summit pledge to "halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030" encompasses promises to secure the rights of indigenous peoples, and recognise "their role as forest guardians". While Mr Johnson described the pledge as "unprecedented", a UN climate gathering in New York in 2014 issued a similar declaration to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030. However, trees continue to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Humans have already cut down half of Earth's forests, a practice doubly harmful for the climate when CO2-sucking trees are replaced with livestock or monoculture crops. Greenpeace criticised the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to "another decade of deforestation". "Indigenous peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed," said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali. "The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal," she said. Many studies have shown that the best way of protecting forests worldwide is to keep them under the management of locals with generations of preservation knowledge. The commitment comes a day after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres harangued the gathered leaders to act to save humanity. "It's time to say: enough," he said. "Enough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves." Mr Johnson warned of the "uncontainable" anger of the younger generations if the leaders failed to act decisively on climate change. The UN COP26 conference will continue for another two weeks to try to craft national plans to forestall the most devastating impacts of global warming. \</doc>

POPE FRANCIS has called on political leaders heading to the COP26 environmental summit in Glasgow to urgently tackle the climate crisis to give 'concrete hope to future generations'. He said 'radical decisions' are needed as the world faces a 'succession of crises' in healthcare, the environment, food supplies and the economy. In a special message for BBC Radio 4's Today show, Francis warned against countries taking an isolationist approach and called for a 'renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world'. His comments come as world leaders prepare for the crucial COP26 summit, which starts tomorrow, as countries come under pressure to increase their ambition to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. Action already pledged by nations to curb emissions in the next decade leave the world well off track to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, beyond which increasingly severe impacts will be felt. Green Party leader and Environment Minister Eamon Ryan backed the Pope's message for 'radical action' last night. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Ryan called for real action at the COP26 summit and said wealthier countries should pay to help poorer countries adapt. He said big polluters such as China must do more and called on it and others to invest in renewable energy systems. Earlier, the Pope told Today: 'We have lost our sense of security and are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and loss of control over our lives.' He said the crises being faced 'forecast a perfect storm' but also provide opportunities. Francis added: 'These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities. Opportunities that we must not waste. The political decisionmakers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations. 'And it is worth repeating that each of us - whoever and wherever we may be - can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change and the degradation of our common home.' The two-week climate conference is being seen as key to increasing action on cutting emissions to deliver on the pledges in the global Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to 'well below' 2C and try for the safer 1.5C goal. Leaders of major economies will go to Scotland from a G20 meeting in Rome where climate is set to dominate the agenda, although key heads of state, including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, will miss both summits. Countries - in particular major emitters - are facing calls from across society to increase action to keep the 1.5C goal in reach and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. There will also be pushes to phase out coal power, boost electric vehicles and protect forests, while developed countries also need to deliver finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and cope with the already inevitable impacts of a warming world. In an interview on BBC Radio 4, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger said everyone has to work together to tackle the issue. He said: 'It's very important we have a positive attitude, that we can see it and we all work together because not one person can deal with it themselves. It's a huge undertaking.'

Speakers at the United Nations COP26 conference in Glasgow will today focus on efforts to boost women's equality and the campaign to improve the climate. Those contributing to the debate today include Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. In public sessions, the COP summit will today look at how science and technology might help deliver climate solutions. It will also consider gender equality and the full and meaningful participation of women and girls in climate action. In private, the work to deliver a deal goes on as the clock ticks down towards Friday's formal deadline. It is widely expected to slip as negotiations around emissions reductions and climate finance narrow to their more controversial aspects.

DENIS STAUNTON The Cop26 summit is facing into tortuous final hours as negotiators attempt to strengthen a declaration and add greater urgency in the global response to the climate crisis - with most pressure on the EU to get it across the line. UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres attempted to push negotiators to a more ambitious outcome, while Cop26 president Alok Sharma warned time was running out, adding "the window on keeping 1.5 [degrees] within reach is closing". Cop26 venue, at its periphery and throughout the city. Activists deflated the tyres of about 60 4X4s in the city's west end in protest at the cars' high levels of emissions. Announcements made in Glasgow "on forests, methane, clean technology and more" were encouraging, Mr Guterres said. Coal plants "But they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world. Promises ring hollow when the fossil-fuels industry still receives trillions as measured by the IMF," he added, "or when countries are still building coal plants. Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition - we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator." If the EU does not lead and build the high-ambition coalition needed, no one else will, independent European climate think tank E3G said last night. "There is an immediate opportunity for the EU to leverage the political momentum from week one and the US-China statement to build the confidence that the trillions will be mobilised for developing and vulnerable countries for the net-zero and climate-resilient transformation we need." Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia were reported to be resisting efforts to strengthen emission-reduction requirements, while vulnerable countries were seeking more robust commitments on adaptation, loss and damage, and climate finance and going beyond the issue of delivering on $100 billion a year to include "mobilising the trillions through the whole global financial architecture", it added. Bad signal European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said removing a text reference on phasing out coal and fossil-fuel subsidies would be an extremely bad signal - a view strongly echoed by Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan. "If you remove it from the text, what is the message you are sending there? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible," Mr Timmermans added. He said the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement could be completed at Cop26 . Agreeing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of the summit. "It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone." Mr Ryan said the climate finance issue might be the last item to get across the line, with expectation that Cop26 will run into the weekend. He confirmed Mr Guterres attended an EU co-ordination meeting and underlined "when you are close to the abyss, your next step is important". \</doc>

COP26 organisers have defended the presence of fossil fuel firms at the event, saying they were working to encourage all sectors to commit to climate action. Registered participants for the climate summit include representatives of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, oil corporations from Ghana, Kuwait, Nigeria and Qatar, British Petroleum, Chevron, Lukoil, Shell and Equinor. It also includes the International Emissions Trading Association, an industry-led organisation keen to develop a global market for carbon credits. COP26 president Alok Sharma said he did not know how many fossil fuel representatives there were. Asked if he had a view on their role at the event, he said: "We have theme days and you see the events. It's pretty transparent, in terms of events taking place, who is involved and you can make your own judgment and analysis on that." The COP26 "We are working to encourage the innovation and commitment of everyone - people, business, countries, cities and regions - as we move the global economy to net zero emissions. This includes a wide range of energy companies," it said. A query to the UNFCCC went unanswered. The presence of fossil fuel companies, and delegations from large industry in general, has been criticised by environmental and human rights groups, whose own delegates have had difficulty accessing events. Kevin Keane, environmental advocacy officer with An Taisce, said NGOs had a tiny number of access badges. "They are like gold dust. It means there is no meaningful influence or interaction with any of the negotiators or decision-makers by grassroots activists or civil society," he said. "It's very frustrating. It undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the conference." He likened the 'green zone', an area of public events to which many NGO representatives are confined, to a "wedding fair in the RDS". "It's corporate sponsors and companies trying to sell their 'solutions' to climate change," he said. Mr Sharma said Covid-19 had placed restrictions on numbers. "The issue is not the number of people - it's the proportion that are coming from sponsorship and corporate backgrounds," said Mr Keane. "People wearing suits are no more immune to Covid than people carrying placards." \</doc>

Political leaders must give "concrete hope" to future generations that they are taking the radical steps needed to tackle climate change when they meet at COP26 , Pope Francis said in a message released ahead of the summit. The United Nation's COP26 summit runs from 31 October to 12 November in Glasgow, Scotland. The pontiff called on world leaders attending the event for a "renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world" to spur action. "It is essential that each of us be committed to this urgent change of direction," he said on BBC Radio. "The political decision makers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the summit is unbelievably important, but the outcome is in the balance as talks will be difficult. Pope Francis said the summit would be tough, but also represents an opportunity. "These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy," he said. "At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities, opportunities that we must not waste." The Vatican is sending a delegation to the summit, but the 84-year-old pope will not be going following surgery earlier this year. Pope Francis warned against the danger of isolationism and protectionism in dealing with the climate crisis. "We can confront these crises by retreating into isolationism, protectionism and exploitation. Or we can see in them a real chance for change, a genuine moment of conversion, and not simply in a spiritual sense," he said. "This last approach alone can guide us towards a brighter horizon." In a draft communique seen by Reuters leaders of the world's richest countries will commit this weekend at the G20 gathering to tackling the existential threat of climate change, paving the way for more detailed action at COP26 . HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/news/2021/1029/1256566-g20-covid/ which gathers for talks on Saturday and Sunday in Rome , will pledge to take urgent steps to reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, according to the draft. They will then head to Glasgow, Scotland for the crucial United Nations gathering of almost 200 countries. The landmark 2015 Paris agreement committed signatories to keeping global warming to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5C. Since then, as extreme weather episodes have intensified and carbon levels in the atmosphere have grown, climate scientists have increasingly emphasised the importance of a 1.5C cap to limit the risk of environmental catastrophe. "Responding to the call of the scientific community, noting the alarming reports of the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and mindful of our leadership role, we commit to tackle the existential challenge of climate change," the draft, which might still be changed, said. "We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5C are much lower than at 2C and that immediate action must be taken to keep 1.5C within reach," the G20 said. "We acknowledge the key relevance of achieving global net zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by 2050," the statement said, referring to a recommendation by UN climate experts who say the mid-century deadline is crucial to meet the 1.5C warming limit. However, the 2050 date appears in the draft in brackets, indicating it is still subject to negotiation. Some of the world's biggest polluters say they cannot reach the 2050 target date, with China, by far the largest carbon emitter, aiming for 2060. The G20 bloc, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the United States, accounts for more than 80% of the world's gross domestic product, 60% of its population and an estimated 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The G20 reaffirmed a commitment to "phase out and rationalise" fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and to curb coal power, considered a principal culprit of global warming. The leaders said they will "do their utmost" to avoid building new unabated coal plants, adding the phrase "taking national circumstances into account," which is commonly used to avoid firm commitments. The leaders said they would end public finance for overseas coal plants by the end of this year and aim for a "largely decarbonised" power system in the 2030s, according to the draft. They also pledged to cut their collective emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas which is much more potent but less long-lasting than carbon dioxide, "substantially" by 2030. This deadline is also in brackets. The willingness of developed countries to help finance the ecological transition of poorer ones, known as "climate financing", is likely to be crucial to the success of the G20 and the Glasgow summit. "We stress the importance of fulfilling the joint commitment of developed countries to mobilise $100 billion annually from public and private sources through to 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation," the draft said. Richer countries agreed in 2009 to establish a $100 billion per year fund to help transfer technologies and minimise climate risks in the developing world, but progress has been slow. Alok Sharma, President of the COP26 conference, said this week he hoped the fund would be made available in 2023, three years later than planned, and many developing nations are reluctant to commit to accelerating their emissions reductions until rich ones meet their pledges. A Chinese environment official said on Wednesday this was "the biggest obstacle" to progress in the climate talks. The G20 draft calls in brackets for "additional climate financing", suggesting there is plenty of negotiating still to be done on this issue. \</doc>

The Prince of Wales has told Cop26 the world has had enough of talking and "we need to put our words and commitments into practice". In a speech to delegates about steps needed to safeguard the world's forests and land, he said nations needed to "honour" the rights of indigenous people who were "experienced custodians" of their habitats. Charles said: "I cannot believe how many times I've ended speeches like this all over the world during the past 40 years - and to no avail. "But I can only pray that this time, this session will provide us with a real sense of the seriously urgent systemic shifts that need to happen to deliver on our vision. And urge you all to take all the work we've discussed today with implacable resolve and determination to make things happen on the ground." AdvertisementHe added: "Frankly, we have all had enough talking so we need to put our words and commitments into practice." Charles joined the session after speeches by US president Joe Biden and British prime minister Boris Johnson, who had earlier hailed a pledge by more than 100 international leaders to end the "great chainsaw massacre" of the world's forests. On the second day of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, 110 nations - covering 85 per cent of the world's forests - signed a declaration to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030. The prince walked into the auditorium with a delegation of indigenous people from the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests, and wore a colourful necklace presented by an Ecuadorian member of the group.

Boris Johnson reportedly flew out of the Cop26 climate summit on a private jet to attend a dinner with former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore. The Daily Mirror says the British prime minister left the conference in Glasgow at 6.20pm and arrived at London Stansted at 7.16pm, before heading to the private men-only Garrick Club for a dinner for former Telegraph journalists. The fashion of Mr Johnson's exit was criticised as "staggering hypocrisy" by Labour chair Anneliese Dodds, after Mr Johnson opened the summit by imploring delegates to stop "quilting the Earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2". Ms Dodds said: "This is staggering hypocrisy from the prime minister. After warning world leaders it's one minute to midnight to prevent climate catastrophe, Boris Johnson clocked off from Cop26 , jumped in his private jet and flew down to London for dinner at a gentleman's club with a self-confessed climate change sceptic. Advertisement"It seems that when it comes to taking action to tackle the climate crisis, there's one rule for the Conservatives and another rule for the rest of the world." A Downing Street source said Mr Johnson had always been due to leave Glasgow on Tuesday evening, as the element of the summit involving world leaders drew to a close. Mr Johnson's flight out of Glasgow was confirmed by the prime minister's official spokesman on Monday. Pressed on why Mr Johnson could not go by train for a journey within the UK, the spokesman said it was important he was able to travel round the country while facing "significant time constraints". \</doc>

Former President Mary Robinson has said people under the age of 60 are likely to face a world that is "less liveable", with terrible floods, fires, and droughts . Ms Robinson said millions of people will be forced to leave their homes because of climate change . She said some progress was made at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, but criticised the watering-down of a number of commitments, including the agreement to "phase down" the use of fossil fuels . Ms Robinson said political leaders do not have a crisis mindset, and that the global agreement was a "shameful dereliction of duty" . "That relates to the lack of ambition, especially of important big emitters, the G20 countries," the former UN commissioner told RT\'c9's Morning Ireland . "I kept naming them: Australia, Brazil, China, Mexico, and Russia. There is also a lack of ambition on the financial side of the EU and the US, blocking a proper facility for loss and damage . "The climate action tracker announced during the Cop, that having added up where we were, we were heading for a 2.4C world "That's when I had my emotional moment, because I know what that means . "It means that anybody under 60 in our world is likely to have a world that is less liveable in, which you're facing terrible fires, terrible floods, terrible droughts, and millions of people having to leave their homes and anybody under 30 is sure to live in that world . "That's what we're talking about. The fact that we haven't got that mindset in the leaders is the key to why we didn't have a good Cop." She said that the leaders of small islands returned home "in despair" over the deal reached by 197 countries . Ms Robinson also criticised the structure of the climate summit, saying it is based on consent. She added, however, that some progress was made on areas, including finance to help poorer countries adapt to the shocks of climate change . "There were a lot of voluntary side deals, which will make a difference," she said. "There were also agreements on oil and gas, and a number of countries, including Ireland, are going to phase out oil and gas . "There was a reversing of deforestation, which seemed more robust than the previous commitments, which was made as long ago as in New York in 2014 . "There were a number of agreements of that kind, and you need the voices of the most vulnerable at the Cop to impress those who don't have a mindset that is needed - a crisis mindset . "The world is in more crisis mode, and that was felt." \</doc>

THE Queen has pulled out of hosting a major reception for world leaders at the Cop26 climate change summit. The 95-year-old was due to travel to Scotland for the engagement on Monday but will now record a speech later this week, which will played in a video message to delegates. It is understood the Queen very much wants Cop26 to be a success and result in meaningful action from the participating nations. But with the head of state missing from the global event, it is hoped no world leaders will use her absence as a reason not to attend the Glasgow summit. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "Following advice to rest, the Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle. "Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of Cop26 on Monday, 1st November. "Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message." She faced preliminary tests in hospital on October 20 during her first overnight stay at a medical facility in eight years. She has been resting following medical advice to cancel her two-day trip to Northern Ireland last week. But she returned to work yesterday, carrying out virtual audiences from Windsor Castle, her first official engagements in seven days since she was ordered to rest by doctors. The Queen is following previous advice of undertaking rest and light duties and remains in good spirits. Following on from her virtual audiences with Gunn Kim, ambassador from the Republic of Korea, and the Swiss ambassador Markus Leitner, the Queen is expecting a call from the Chancellor last evening. Rishi Sunak will speak to her on the eve of his Budget, a tradition dating back some years. The monarch is also expected to carry out light engagements in the coming days. Concern for her will be at peak levels, given her age, and the monarch is being looked after by her Medical Household, her expert team of physicians. The Queen was due to attend events in Glasgow as part of a flurry of Cop26 engagements by the monarch, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge between November 1 and 5. On the royal family's website, the Queen was listed attending a reception on November 1 as part of the climate change conference. Since returning from Balmoral the Queen's schedule has been busy throughout October and her first hospital stay was kept a secret and only confirmed by the Palace when it was revealed by The Sun newspaper. \</doc>

Ireland, Denmark, Costa Rica, the Marshall Islands and five other countries have urged the world's biggest economies to hike their climate pledges, warning that their actions would set the tone for the upcoming Cop26 summit in Scotland. Extreme weather events and increasingly urgent calls from scientists to curb global warming are cranking up pressure on lawmakers who will meet in Glasgow later this month to discuss action to reduce their carbon emissions. "The window for taking decisive climate action is rapidly closing," said the letter, seen by Reuters, which was sent to prime minister Mario Draghi of Italy, the current president of the G20 club of rich nations. AdvertisementThe meeting will "set the tone" for COP26 , which starts on October 31st, the letter said. The signatories also include Grenada, which like the Marshall Islands is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts such as storms and rising seas, along with Sweden, Latvia, Belgium, and Estonia. "Our message is very clear, that we need the G20 to step up and to raise their ambitions before we meet in Glasgow," Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen said. Climate envoys from Britain, the EU and United States are making a last-minute diplomatic push to clinch more ambitious pledges in time for the summit. But consensus looks a long way off. Sources said on Wednesday that with days to go before the G20 meets, countries are still split over committing to phase out coal. Climate finance Meanwhile, a group of like-minded developing countries this week released a statement slamming developed countries for expecting poorer nations to commit to tougher emissions targets when rich countries have broken their own promises to cut CO2. The group, which includes China, India and Saudi Arabia, also said richer nations had failed to deliver on promises of $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries battle climate change. Their letter called on the G20 to hike climate finance pledges, which some members, including the United States, Canada and Germany, did earlier this year. The EU attends meetings of the G20. France, Germany and Italy are members of both. EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday to discuss issues including preparation for COP26 , just as a sharp rise in gas prices has exposed disagreements between countries over the bloc's shared plans to tackle climate change. \</doc>

Pledges made at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow could help limit global warming to 1.8C above pre-industrial levels, the boss of the International Energy Agency has said. Fatih Birol called progress at the talks "extremely encouraging", and said that if countries live up to their promises they could help limit the damage to the planet. He told an audience at Cop26 on Thursday: "In the last few days we have heard several pledges and commitments from countries, in terms of their net-zero emissions by 2050 - some of them are a bit longer term. "We also heard that more than 100 countries have pledged to reduce their methane emissions. "Yesterday night I asked my colleagues... to run our models once again. What would it mean if all the pledges announced as of yesterday night were to be implemented, where are we in terms of temperature increases? "The result is extremely encouraging. If all the pledges on carbon neutrality and methane pledges were to be fully implemented we would have a temperature increase trajectory which is 1.8C. This is excellent." "They are not only driven by the climate concerns, they are driven by the economics, technological advancements, and they are going very strong," he said. At the same event on the side-lines of the climate conference, Lord Deben, chair of the UK's Climate Change Committee, warned against complacency. "We're doing well enough not to be so disheartened that we should eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die," he said. "I always say to myself: Look back 10 years and think: Would you have believed that we could have got where we got now 10 years ago? And the answer is no. Advertisement"I think we have done enormously better than I would have thought. But, having said that, I think we should be saying to ourselves that unless we do get what we need, we are certainly moving for something above two degrees. "That's why what happens here is crucial. And more importantly that people actually do do what they say they are going to do." \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Boris Johnson has defended Britain's handling of Cop26 after the Glasgow climate pact agreed at the weekend drew criticism from environmentalists, climate activists and vulnerable countries. The pact targets a reduction in fossil fuel use and increased funding for developing countries, but critics say it is not ambitious enough in aims to cut emissions to ensure that global warming can be kept below 1.5 degrees. Mr Johnson hailed the summit as a historic success that had dealt the death knell to coal despite a last-minute change demanded by China and India so that the pact promises to "phase down" coal power rather than phasing it out. "Those for whom climate change is already a matter of life and death, who can only stand by as their islands are submerged, their farm land turned to desert, their homes battered by storms, they demanded a high level of ambition from this summit," he said. "While many of us were willing to go there, that wasn't true of everybody. Sadly that's the nature of diplomacy. We can lobby, we can cajole, we can encourage, but we cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do." Cop26 president Alok Sharma, who was close to tears as he apologised for the way the last-minute change to the text was made, said the fate of the entire pact had been in the balance. "I can tell you there was that one hour where I really felt there was a chance there we were not going to get this deal over the line," he said. China and India Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said China and India would face a lot of pressure over what phasing down coal actually amounted to. He said it was better to accept "that really gutting last-minute compromise" rather than lose the whole agreement. "Not doing that would have risked losing the whole thing and that would not have served anyone. We can't delay, we're in a crisis. There's so much good in this, it gives structure and depth to the Paris climate agreement. We'll have to continue to put pressure on and ensure that we do phase out coal," he said. The Cop26 \</doc>

The latest climate report from the UN has been described as "an atlas of human suffering". Here are answers to some key questions about the report.  What is the report? >> It is the second part of a global assessment of climate science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and is the sixth such assessment the UN body has conducted, with the most recent one released back in 2013/14. This second report looks at the impacts of and vulnerabilities to climate change, and adaptation to global warming. The first part, labelled a "code red for humanity" when it was published last August, examined the physical basis of climate change, and a third part, to be published later this year, will set out solutions to the crisis.  What is the IPCC? >> It is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established in 1988 to provide political leaders with scientific assessments on climate change, to help them make policy. Some 195 countries are members of the IPCC.  There always seems to be another climate report coming out. What is different about this one? This latest study references more than 34,000 published papers and involved 270 authors from around the world who received tens of thousands of comments on earlier drafts from scientists and governments. Most importantly, the 35-page summary of the report has been subject to a line-byline approval process involving scientists and representatives of the 195 governments before it was published. This process took place online over the last two weeks. That means that governments have signed off on the findings.  What does the report say? >> It says climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health, with around 3.3bn-3.6bn people living in situations where they are highly vulnerable to global warming. Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events, has had widespread adverse impacts on people and nature, including death, affecting physical and mental health, and damage to livelihoods, infrastructure, and habitats. Some of these impacts are irreversible, as humans and nature are pushed beyond their ability to adapt, with glaciers melting, permafrost thawing, and species going extinct. There will be "unavoidable increases" in many climate hazards in the next two decades. Keeping temperature rises to close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will substantially reduce the losses and damage caused by climate change compared to higher temperatures, but does not eliminate all dangers. What impact will it have? >> While the first part of the assessment came out in the run-up to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, which aimed - and just about managed - to keep limiting global warming to 1.5C within reach, this one lands just over 100 days after those talks concluded. It might be hoped the new findings keep up the pressure on governments to fulfill the terms of the Glasgow Pact, which they signed up to at Cop26 . Governments agreed to take more action this year to cut emissions, increase climate finance, and focus on helping countries adapt to the crisis. Cop26 president Alok Sharma has said there was hope, with a window of opportunity in the crucial next decade to "cut emissions, adapt to a more dangerous climate and build for a secure and clean future, which turns the commitments made at Cop26 into transformative action". However, the report has landed just days after the world was plunged into a geopolitical crisis with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This had an immediate impact for the IPCC's approval process, as the Ukrainian team warned on Thursday morning that they might not be able to continue as they were not sure they would have electricity, internet, and safety. On an international scale, there is a danger that governments are once again, as with Covid-19, focused on a crisis other than climate change and unable to work in concert to fix a problem that requires action from everyone, together. - Emily Beament \</doc>

Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said a decision at Cop26 to water down commitments on the phasing out of fossil fuels is "gut wrenching" but urged people to look at the "bigger picture". The Minister for the Environment said the move was "disappointing" but necessary to secure the agreement. \~ "We shouldn't let that gut-wrenching amendment at the very last minute to distract from that bigger picture," he said. "It wasn't in the actual legal structures.\~That political wording can be changed. "But what was significant in Glasgow, coming out of it, was effectively it has taken us six years, which is too long, this is too slow, but it does actually put legal bones on the Paris Climate Agreement. Advertisement"It does actually give us real strong confidence that the whole economic system, the finance system, is going to have to switch to this decarbonised direction." Mr Ryan said the compromise was necessary in a deal that 197 countries worldwide had signed up to. He told RT\'c9's This Week: "There isn't another way, it does require that seeking of consensus. "That won't stop and the search for greater ambition won't stop. "But I think what we should do now is deliver on what was committed and deliver it here at home. This does give real momentum." Mr Ryan denied he was trying to out a positive spin on developments. "If I just came here and said - which I don't believe to be true - that it's all bad, that there's no hope, I think people would give up hope and might give up taking some of the actions," he said. Speaking in Enniskillen on Sunday, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin echoed Mr Ryan's comments. He said: "I would share the disappointment in terms of that particular language, but in the overall context I think we've made good progress internationally. "I think the big change has been the American input, through [US] President Biden's commitment to climate change, the Paris Accords, partnership with the European Union and indeed the agreement with China to engage with climate change. "We should be very clear that one conference isn't going to resolve the climate change issue. We have to make significant steps forward. "I think progress has been made, but a lot more progress needs to be done. "The key challenge for us as a country, and the key challenge for other countries in the world, is to deliver on the commitments and the pledges that have been made at Cop26 . "It's not enough to just make the pledges. It's really time for action." \</doc>

THE world's governments were struggling last night to agree their response to a report on the rapid action scientists say must be taken to avoid further worsening of the climate crisis. The report from the United Nations' science panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is due for publication today after five years of preparation. The full report - which runs to thousands of pages - has been with the 195 participating governments for months but their task of approving a final summary document with agreed key messages began a fortnight ago. They were due to finish last Friday. While previous sessions for associated reports have run into an extra day, the failure to reach agreement by yesterday is an indication of the challenge this report presents for energy policies. It is understood that the hundreds of scientists who worked on the report have concluded that only rapid deployment of renewable energies in place of oil, gas and coal can hope to reduce carbon emissions sufficiently to slow global warming. While new and evolving technologies - such as carbon capture from fossils fuels - may have their place in the future, it is believed the report warns they can not be developed at the scale and speed or with the certainty of success that is urgently required. The implication of such a conclusion is that fossil fuels must be eliminated without delay, with previous phase-out timelines no longer realistic. That would have posed enormous challenges for governments even before the current energy crisis erupted. With the prospect of disruption to gas supplies from Russia, shortages worldwide and spiralling prices leading to huge public discontent, some governments are discussing a return to coal for heating and electricity generation. Coal is the most carbon-intensive of fossil fuels and scientists fear even a temporary increase in its use would dangerously set back the limited progress the world has made towards curbing energy-related emissions. Cop26 which was held in Glasgow last November, saw much focus on methane, a by-product of the livestock and gas industries. Methane is a relatively shortlived gas so it has previously received less attention than long-lasting carbon dioxide, but while it is in the atmosphere, its potency as a warming gas is multiples of that of carbon-dioxide. More than 100 countries signed a global methane pledge launched at Cop26 , agreeing to cut methane emissions by at least 30pc by 2030. This report may put them under increased pressure to live up to that ambition, but that would have major implications for farming and meat production. This is the third of three reports by the IPCC since last August. All of them were guided by the premise that global warming must be kept as much below 2C, and ideally to 1.5C, for the worst impacts of climate change to be avoided. Current trends in energy use and emissions have temperature rise on course to hit 1.5C within a decade and 3C within 80 years. Some consider return to coal amid energy crisis Load-Date: \~April 4, 2022 \</doc>

A mass singalong uniting choirs from across the UK will help keep "pressure" on the government ahead of Cop26 , a co-founder has said. More than 500 vocalists will perform a new version of What A Wonderful World, arranged by celebrity vocal coach Mark De-Lisser, in London, Liverpool and Glasgow on Saturday. It follows the release of a studio version of the Louis Armstrong track, which features the voices of The Kingdom Choir - who performed at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and young singers from the Brit School in London. HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQFzV0trGDU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQFzV0trGDU The mass singing events, called Sing The Change, have been organised by Music Declares Emergency (MDE) to encourage governments attending the Cop26 summit in Glasgow to act over climate change. The group was founded partly in response to the Extinction Rebellion protests and brings together artists, music industry professionals and other organisations. AdvertisementSingers will gather at midday at the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral steps, London's Russell Square and George Square in Glasgow. Peter Quicke, chair of record label Ninja Tune - which features Bicep, Kae Tempest, Thundercat and Young Fathers on its roster, is a co-founder of MDE. He told the PA news agency the music industry had a responsibility to act because it has a "voice that is larger than its turnover". He said: "It is important to remain hopeful because you have to remain motivated and focused on the issue. One of the common responses to the climate emergency is to say, 'We are f and I can't do anything' or 'I don't want to think about it - I am not going to do anything'. "It is important to have hopeful responses to it. Singing and choirs are another constituency and a generally very positive and open-minded constituency. So it is enabling choirs to speak about the climate emergency and to do something.

It is important to keep acting and to keep the issue at the top of people's agendas. That's what it is all about." Mr Quicke said there was no "last chance" to stop climate change, but Cop26 signalled the final opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. He said: "There's never a last chance, but it is just a question of how much devastation we want to visit on the world and what risks come with that. "Each Cop that rolls around, and we haven't started reducing the world's emissions radically, then the higher the temperature of the world will get. "In a way it is the last chance saloon if you want to stay under 1.5 degrees, and even then there is quite a lot of margin for error." Those unable to attend Sing The Change are encouraged to host their own gatherings at home or in nearby community spaces. \</doc>

Boris Johnson has called on world leaders to show more ambition as the Cop26 climate summit enters its final days, suggesting that the meeting could go into "extra time" beyond tomorrow. The UK prime minister said there had been a "surge of really positive game-changing announcements" in areas such as finance and forests in the first week of the talks, but warned the negotiations were now entering a difficult phase. The Cop26 conference "is not going to fix" climate change in one go, Mr Johnson warned, but it could come away with "the first genuine roadmap for a solution to anthropogenic climate change that I can think of in my lifetime". He said that after the positive announcements last week, the negotiations had now entered their most difficult phase. "The negotiations are getting tough and with just a few days left there is still a huge amount to do. We've made a difference, we hope, for our planet and for our people. "We've moved the ball a long way down the pitch, but we're now stuck in a rolling maul, to mix my football and my rugby metaphors," he told a press conference in Glasgow. "The line is in sight but if we're going to get there, we need a determined push to get us over the line. We need to be more ambitious, we need more credible plans for implementation. We have to bridge the gap between where we are and where we need to be if we're going to cut emissions in half by 2030." Mr Johnson was speaking at the end of a brief visit to the conference after the first draft of an agreement called on world governments to improve on their climate action plans over the next year. He said it would be "an absolute disaster" if Cop26 failed to agree an ambitious plan that kept alive the goal of limiting global warming to 1\'bd degrees. He said it was frustrating to see countries that had signed up to ambitious goals in Paris in 2015 now edging towards default on their promises. "The world knows the mess our planet is in. The world has heard leaders from every country, every continent stand here and acknowledge the need for action. And the world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that. The backlash from our people will be immense and it will be long-lasting. And frankly we will deserve their criticism and opprobrium because we know what needs to be done. We agree on what needs to be done.We just need the courage to get on and do it," he said. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, who was also in Glasgow yesterday, said the prime minister should stay at the conference to put pressure on countries to do more. "We are in the territory of doing everything in our power in the time that we've got left to salvage what we can from this, because it's not an overstatement to say that future generations depend on this," he said. \</doc>

On the surface, the Cop26 climate summit and the protests outside it look like two completely different worlds, but they're intrinsically connected. Unlike the man at the gates shouting into a loudhailer that "the global elite doesn't care about you, why are you going in?", few of the protesters think that what happens at Cop is a complete waste of time. Most people, inside and out, are headed in the same direction, just with infuriatingly different senses of pace and urgency. There are about 30,000 people in the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, and the place is vast and overwhelming. At one end of it, Zone F, where all the political negotiations happen, the clothes are more formal and the pace is brisker. This is where powerful people travel in huddles of functionaries, orbited by photographers. Things have been achieved here already, though the details still need to be negotiated by hardworking civil servants and scientific advisers. The net-zero pledges announced by world leaders in the first few days, coupled with the Global Methane Pledge, will keep temperature rises within 1.8 degrees (according to analysis from the International Energy Agency). That's still short of the 1.5 degrees aspired to at Paris but it's a big step. They also worked to bridge the shortfall in the Green Climate Fund designed to help poorer countries adapt, so it should now reach the $100 billion a year promised in the Paris Agreement. Yes, they're just promises, but as UCC professor of energy engineering Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir reminds me, change starts with promises. He's cautiously optimistic. I spend lots of time in the delegate pavilions where countries, agencies and NGOs compete for attention with talks, announcements and, sometimes, free food and coffee. It's a lively place. I encounter some scamps from Nuclear for Climate cadging coffee from the barista at the Global Wind Energy Council. "Obviously, we welcome everyone," says Rebecca Williams, director of this pavilion. Nuclear for Climate's David Watson turns around with expert timing to reveal the words "Together is better" on the back of his T-shirt. Williams's organisation has, when I arrive, just signed a "memorandum of understanding" with the Global Solar Council, and she introduces me to their chief executive, Gianni Chianetta. Significant meetings are happening all over the place here - collaborative partnerships, announcements, rounds of applause. Gummy bear Nuclear power is a harder sell due to the historical antipathy with which it is viewed by environmentalists. One of the Nuclear for Climate pitches is that a gummy bear-sized piece of plutonium creates the same amount of energy as a ton of coal, so they have a huge inflatable gummy bear at their stall. They also have someone called Eric who sings opera arias with the lyrics changed to reflect benefits of nuclear power. "Nuclear Power is the key to universal prosperity, it is nuclear energy, we must embrace for the human raaaace." Yes, in some ways, Cop26 can feel like a trade fair. But then you meet activists from all over the world who cared about the planet well before there was political capital in it, or representatives from poorer countries that are already suffering the sharper edges of ecological collapse. The disconnect between the different versions of Cop26 can be jarring. There seems to be no natural overlap between Leonardo DiCaprio, who barrels through the delegate pavilions on Tuesday, and Vedant Kulkarni, an 18-year-old Indian activist, whose stay was made possible by a free room with a local family thanks to the Human Hotel's Cop26 Homestay Network. He's an observer with the Youth Constituency of the UNFCCC and he sees the effects of climate change back home. "The crisis is changing our lives daily in terms of the water that we get access to, the heatwaves we face." There isn't a clean line separating the delegates here and the protestors outside. One day as I'm leaving to join an Extinction Rebellion protest, I meet Emily Marsay and members of the UK Youth Climate Coalition inside the Blue Zone holding a hand-printed banner that reads, "$how us the Money". They're protesting against Rishi Sunak's plans to make Britain a net-zero finance centre. "When they're actually cutting their UK aid budget, they need to lead by example and give money not just relying on private finance to solve the climate crisis." Marsay feels that a lot of voices are missing from the summit, because of Covid and the price of travel and accommodation. Every day she and others liaise with the People's Summit, held at various locations in Glasgow, through which activists with accreditation feed information to and from those who couldn't attend. "It's the most exclusionary Cop yet. You've got a lot of people sleeping on sofas, sleeping in vans, camping." When I leave Marsay and exit the summit, there's a small protest against carbon trading wrapping up outside the gates. "Carbon offsetting is a false climate solution that's destroying indigenous communities," says Eriel Deranger a delegate from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and the executive director of Indigenous Climate Action. "It gives polluters an excuse to keep polluting, and it needs to stop now. [They're] just creating forms of neo-colonialism [where] corporations and big polluting governments cook their books and allow heavy oil and gas projects to continue to proliferate, offset by purchasing conservation zones in other parts of the world." Like Marsay, she has her foot both inside and outside of the summit. "[ Cop26 ] is necessary in the sense that we need climate action," she says. "The problem is the talks have become primarily [about] how to reconcile and stabilise the economy and then save the planet." Favourite place Cop26 Cop26 is a necessity. They don't want governments to stop engaging, they just want them to do more and do it more equitably. It's a huge disservice to the environmentalists whose activism has led the way, to conclude that it's all pointless just because Boris Johnson went home in a jet. My favourite place at Cop26 is the Co-creative Reflection and Dialogue Space in a corner of the delegates pavilion. It's run by the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies partly as an attempt to bridge all the conflicting energies I've described. "Because climate change is abstract and complex, it triggers the head and we lose the heart part," says Carolin Fraude who helps facilitate the space with Malika Virah-Sawmy. "In the protest movement they are expressing their frustration, their anger, their despair," says Virah-Sawmy. She contrasts that with the atmosphere of optimistic busyness at Cop26 . What goes unexpressed, she says, is everyone's "feelings of frustration and fear and also a lot of shame and guilt. The culture doesn't allow us to express feelings". So in this corner of the SEC they encourage people to talk about all that. They want to reconcile the head and the heart. They don't get too many negotiators here, but people do stop out of curiosity, says Fraude. "Because the moment people really engage in a meaningful or deep way you can see it has the quality of real conversation." \</doc>

The Cop26 Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN summit in Glasgow, though some welcomed gains on climate finance for poorer countries and increased funding for "adaptation" to help make climate-vulnerable states more resilient in face of inevitable impacts from global warming. "Glasgow was a staging post not a finishing line," said FoE director Ois\'edn Coghlan. He said what was clear now was that formal negotiations through this UN process "may never produce an outcome that reflects the urgency of the science and the imperative of justice. Not when the final text is effectively subject to a veto from any polluting country with a brass neck." Mr Coghlan added: "The two-steps forward, one-step back nature of the annual climate talks is deeply frustrating but we must pocket any modest gains from Glasgow - the first mention of phasing out of fossil fuels and the renewed commitment to adaptation finance for example - and ratchet up our demands for the next time. "Collectively our governments have not met the moment but our international movement emerges from Glasgow stronger than ever." Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of international figures founded by Nelson Mandela, pushed repeatedly for greater ambition during the two-week long negotiations. She said it had made some progress, "but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. "While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty". Climate activist Dr Lorna Gold, chairwoman of the Laudato Si Movement, said the outcome was a huge disappointment. "The only thing worse than this would have been no outcome. That would have spelt disaster. The outcome shows that the majority of leaders still do not yet fully accept the reality of the situation." Critical language Last-minute watering down of critical language on phasing out coal deepened mistrust and did not bode well for the road ahead, she added. "That said, this Cop was not just about the official outcome. Many key initiatives have been signed - including the agreement on methane and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to which Ireland signed up." Aid agency Tr\'f3caire said the failure of global leaders to include "loss and damage" financing in the final agreement was "deeply disappointing" and a "missed opportunity" by the powerful nations who have contributed most to climate change. It said the deal failed to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities recover and rebuild after climate disasters. Tr\'f3caire's head of policy and advocacy Siobh\'e1n Curran, who attended Cop26 , said: "There were huge expectations that Cop26 \</doc>

POPE Francis will miss this winter\' s UN climate conference in Scotland, the Vatican has said. He had said he hoped to attend COP26 in Glasgow next month but that would depend on  how I feel at the time . He has recently undergone colon surgery. Yesterday, the Vatican said its delegation would be led by Cardinal Parolin, its secretary of state. Pope Francis was expected to be among 120 world leaders due to attend. There, they will lay out plans to cut emissions causing climate change. Organisers have confirmed it will be attended by the Queen. US President Joe Biden has said he is  anxious to be there. In July, the Bishops\' Conference of Scotland said it wrote to the Pope to  assure him of a warm welcome if he attended. Later, the bishops said they were  delighted to hear that he does hope to attend and would be glad to meet with them in Glasgow . His attendance was never confirmed by the Vatican.  In principle, the program is that I go. It all depends on how I feel at the time. But in fact, my speech is already being prepared, and the plan is to be there. In the run-up to the summit, he has said it is time to  change course on the environment. The last papal visit to Scotland was in 2010 when Pope Benedict celebrated Mass in Glasgow\' s Bellahouston Park. \</doc>

The Taoiseach has told the D\'e1il that the European Council will call for "an ambitious global response to climate change" at COP26 in Glasgow next month. Miche\'e1l Martin will attend the European Council meeting in Brussels tomorrow and Friday. World leaders will gather in Glasgow next month for the United Nations Convention of Parties (COP) on Climate Change. The aim of the meeting is to reach agreement about what needs to be done to make sure the rise in global temperature is kept to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.   "The EU has taken a strong position and will lead by example", he said during a debate ahead of the Brussels meeting. He said that the council will discuss Covid-19 vaccination rates, in the context of rising infections rates, and also discuss tackling disinformation. "Well over 800m doses have been administered" across the European Union, Mr Martin added, and thanked the people of Ireland for their efforts. Also on the table at the council will be how best to mitigate volatile energy prices, especially for the most vulnerable. The council will examine digital transformation, including growing cyber threats. At an informal meeting of the council on 5 October in Solvenia , Mr Martin said, it was agreed that the EU "needs to leverage its economic power more effectively, and strengthen its capacity to act". Putin will not attend COP 26 climate summit - Kremlin Russian President Vladimir Putin will not go to next month's UN climate summit in Glasgow, the Kremlin has said, as the UK stressed the importance of national leaders' presence. The COP26 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that "unfortunately Putin will not fly to Glasgow", while stressing that climate change was "one of our foreign policy's most important priorities". Russia is currently the fourth-highest carbon emitter, and critics say the country is doing far from enough to tackle the environmental crisis. Mr Peskov said the Russian side would be represented at the summit but details would be released at a later date. President Putin's withdrawal comes with major question marks over the attendance of Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Neither have so far said they will be present. China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and India the third. \</doc>

HERE's nothing more crippling to ambition than a preoccupation with missed opportunities. T At last, COP26 has restored a sense of empowerment and an affirmation of hope in combating climate change. Defeatism had become something of a habit concerning global warming - exhausting negativity sabotaging our efforts before we even start. Such unproductive attitudes made tasks even more daunting than they already were. However, in Glasgow, 80 countries have signed up to a global methane pledge, agreeing to cut emissions by 30pc. A global plan to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 was also approved. What's more, Brazil - where huge stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories to the forest pledge. The alacrity with which the world has moved to tackle methane emissions also gives real hope that the world is finally waking up to the massive threat posed by warming gases. The thrust is to cut emissions by 30pc by 2030. The main focus in the short-term will be the fossil fuel industry. Most of the curbs can be achieved at little or no cost. The potential benefits are huge - scientists believe it could help the world avoid 0.3C of warming by 2040. At a time when every fraction of a degree matters, that is a major saving that could help keep the golden goal of a 1.5C threshold in view. Undeniably, the fact that major emitters such as Russia, China and India are not party to the commitment is regrettable. Nonetheless, a sense of agency has been restored and the paralysis broken. Momentum must be maintained. A previous deal in 2014 unforgivably failed to slow deforestation at all. Felling trees drives warming because forests absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. Another milestone was arrived at with an initiative to boost the uptake of clean technologies. More than 40 leaders promised to work to scale up clean solutions, with new worldwide standards. This would offer certainty to investors that global markets will be created for low-carbon technologies. Speaking in Glasgow, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin was anxious to strike a more hopeful note, saying:"It's not too late to turn the tide." But we must also act. "Climate change will catch up with us. It will catch up with our farming, with our agriculture, if we don't take action," he added. Understandably, inability to agree more rapid reductions in the use of fossil fuels - the main cause of man-made warming - has upset the poorer countries likely to be hit hardest. One can only concur with Costa Rican president Carlos Alvarado Quesada's view. He said: "If the world was a private company, and the leaders of the world were to be different CEOs of the corporations - today we would all be fired." Clearly, we must think again. COP26 can show the way. Instead of regarding obligations as onerous or burdensome, we must embrace them as the only remaining bridge to a better future which has not been burned. A previous deal in 2014 unforgivably failed to slow deforestation \</doc>

The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has been billed as the last best chance to keep global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C. Here's why that is important. What is the significance of 1.5C? When the Paris Agreement - the global treaty on climate change - was negotiated in 2015, there was a strong and ultimately successful push by nations such as low-lying islands to include the 1.5C target in the deal because they felt letting temperatures go any higher would threaten their survival. As a result countries pledged to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C over the long-term. Will limiting temperature rises to 1.5C really make a difference? Yes, according to a special report by the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in 2018. It found a 2C rise would lead to more heatwaves, extreme rainstorms, water shortages and drought, greater economic losses and lower crop yields, higher sea levels and greater damage to nature. In one of its most sobering findings, the report said coral reefs would decline by 70-90% with global warming of 1.5C, but would all but vanish in a 2C world. The latest report from the IPCC this summer - described as a "code red for humanity" - also warns that every additional 0.5C temperature rise leads to clear increases in the intensity of heatwaves, rainstorms and flooding, and droughts in some regions. With the world already experiencing more damaging climate extremes at 1.2C of warming, 1.5C is not seen as a safe level, but things get much worse if it goes above that. Is it game over if the world warms by more than 1.5C? No. Scientists say the 1.5C or 2C thresholds are not cliff edges that the world will fall off, but that every bit of warming makes a difference, so it is important to curb temperature rises as much as possible. "Limiting warming to 1.5C clearly needs much more urgent emissions cuts than is currently happening, but if the target is still breached we should not assume all is lost and give up - it will still be worth continuing action on emissions reductions to avoid even more warming." Are we off track to meet a 1.5C limit? Yes, way off track. The 2018 IPCC report said to limit temperature rises to 1.5C the world would have to cut carbon emissions by 45% on 2010 levels by 2030, and to net zero - with any remaining pollution absorbed by measures such as planting trees - by 2050. But the latest assessment from the UN shows the national plans for cutting emissions put forward by countries under the Paris Agreement would lead to a 16% increase in emissions on 2010 levels by the end of the decade. Glasgow is not going to change that, is it? Some countries have still not brought forward more ambitious, updated climate plans as they have promised to do, but even with those, there will still be a gap between the 1.5C goal and the action needed to get there. Cop26 President Alok Sharma has said he wants the summit to keep the 1.5C target within reach - "keeping 1.5 alive". Because of the way that climate-warming emissions build up in the atmosphere, we cannot carry on as we are and think we can do more later, so keeping the 1.5C target within reach is going to take an awful lot of action between now and 2030. The hope is there will be a negotiated outcome - formal agreement by countries - from the talks that sets out how the gap will be closed and spurs further action in the next decade. Cop26 will also be focusing on areas such as ending the use of coal, moving to selling only ultra-low emissions cars, ending net deforestation, and curbing the powerful but short-lived greenhouse gas methane. \</doc>

RMS Titanic is synonymous with many aspects of Ireland, being built of course in Belfast\' s shipyard. But now the doomed ship that sank on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic is going through another incarnation \- signalling the perilous warning of climate change. The SS Planet Titanic duet is belting out Frank Sinatra\' s Come Fly With Me on the streets of central Glasgow.

To  Come fly with me, let\' s fly, let\' s fly away , seagull warns Co2 emissions are killing the planet. You get the drift. The Cop26 Just as many in number are the thousands of delegates and security. All around the city are foreign voices, people in national and ethnic dress, American, European, Irish and English accents. A lot of twenty and thirty-somethings pack out the vegan cafes where even an Australian twang is heard. And it\' s the same for the global media. Reporters \- from the Indian sub-continent, Asia and Europe \- throng the streets and squares talking into cameras and tripod-mounted mobile phones. Like an influx that has come ashore on the latest ship, Glasgow is a city of wheeling suitcases, broadcast tech and phone navigating-visitors making their way to George Square, surrounding streets and the conference arena on the River Clyde where most of the world\' s nations are represented. Everywhere are yellow and black uniformed police, thousands around town \- especially at the closed off roads into Glasgow\' s Scottish Exhibition Campus.

ARE you panicking yet? If not, why not? Prince Charles, who opened the Cop26 summit on climate change, warned that the world is in "the last chance saloon". Boris Johnson said that we are at "one minute to midnight" to prevent catastrophe. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, claimed that if leaders failed to reach a climate change deal, they would be "cursed", seen as worse than even the Nazis, because they would be allowing "genocide on an infinitely greater scale". The Archbishop subsequently apologised for dragging the Nazis into it, but the overall message remained clear - cut CO2 now, or we're stuffed. Finished. The end. Yet the actions of many of these world leaders, royals, billionaires and assorted VIPS do not match their apocalyptic words. In fact, the words and actions are in direct opposition to one another. There is a grotesque irony, not to mention blatant hypocrisy, in flying to a climate change summit on board your own gas-guzzling plane. 400 private jets are expected to arrive in total. Jeff Bezos of Amazon has already zoomed in aboard his \£348m Gulf Stream. It's been reported that the conference will generate about 13,000 tonnes of carbon - which is equivalent to the amount that 1,600 Scottish people produce in a whole year. Why couldn't they get together on Zoom, as the rest of us have been forced to do for the last year and more? Mr Johnson, channelling his inner Greta Thunberg, spoke of the urgent need to eradicate the "suffocating blanket of CO2" which is killing the planet. So how is he getting back to London after this swanky shindig? Private jet. Of course. The filthiest CO2 polluter at Cop26 is Joe Biden, president of the United States. His 85 car convoy, recently deployed for the G20 meeting in Rome, is bad enough. But his flight to Glasgow, in that stinking behemoth, Air Force One - accompanied by four other jets - is calculated to emit 2.16 million pounds of carbon over the five days he's there. I've got to say, Joe Biden didn't look all that worried about the climate emergency. He was pictured having a lovely refreshing snooze during the speeches. For him, "one minute to midnight" seemed to signal that it was time for beddy-byes, not imminent Armageddon. These pompous, pampered politicians are basically telling us - do as I say, not do as I do. You, the proles, must stop eating meat and flying to Lanzarote once a year, in order to save the planet. Meanwhile we, the global elite, will continue to gad about whenever and wherever we like in our exclusive private jets, bloated with beef, and laughing at the little people far below, earnestly sorting their recycling. The super-rich, the Harrys and Meghans - and the VIP delegates at Cop26 . That's why, personally, I couldn't give a monkeys that our own environment minister, Edwin Poots, pootled off to Glasgow via Easyjet or whatever. People like you, me and Edwin Poots are not the problem here. The ultra-privileged and globally powerful are. If there was a chance that Cop26 could translate into real, dynamic measures to fairly and sustainably curtail global emissions, then you could argue that the whole carbon-heavy circus was worth it. But these summits have historically scored high on theatrical rhetoric, low on real-world action. Plus there is a built-in limit to what Cop26 can achieve, because three of the world's main polluters - China, Russia and Brazil - are not even present. Look, nobody sane is denying that gigantic steps must be taken to protect the natural world. And individual responsibility is an important part of that. We all need to feel that we can contribute in meaningful, practical ways to the health of the planet. But you can't expect people to be motivated if they are constantly beaten down with catastrophic talk of doom and destruction, which indicates that the battle is all but lost. That way, they're more likely to shrug their shoulders, have another burger and resign themselves to ultimate extinction. Earlier this week, a Channel 4 reporter posted a video on social media showing the streets around Cop26 Do these very important people think that we are entirely stupid? They should stop exhorting us to make all the sacrifices, stop trying to scare us silly, and step up to the plate themselves. \</doc>

T HE 26th Conference of Parties to the UN Convention on climate change, Cop26 , has achieved almost legendary status even before it opens. One way or another it will be historic. It is taking place during a unique confluence of events which would have been deemed fanciful when the UK formally announced its hosting intentions at the Cop25 in Madrid. Perhaps there were already omens of what was to come, and if you look for omens many can be found. Cop25 itself should have taken place in Santiago in Chile. Due to social unrest it was moved at the last minute to Madrid. The planned run-up to Cop26 in November 2020 would have been one of the shortest ever. The UK was working intensely with its Chilean counterparts on the handover of a very complex process. Then the world changed. The shadow of Covid-19 was already looming over the February 2020 meeting of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That turned out to be the last in-person meeting held by either of the key global science or policy bodies. Postponement to November 2021 meant the run-up to Cop26 has become the longest and perhaps the most intense in history. In August, and after a significant delay, the IPCC completed the first volume of its Sixth Assessment Report, in a virtual setting. A key focus for the Cop is the international climate policy community's response to the latest science. Past experiences in this are mixed. The IPCC was established in 1988, four years before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the first IPCC Assessment Report informing its establishment. In that sense, the IPCC is sometimes referred to as a parent to the UNFCCC. As is the case for many parents, a growing child can be troublesome. All was well at the start, as the IPCC Second Assessment Report informed the adoption of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but then things stalled. That was going to change at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report had just been published. The Nobel Prize was awarded to the IPCC, along with Al Gore. Within the UNFCCC things were not so rosy. Copenhagen would not deliver the expected outcome. Some errors in the IPCC report became a focus of media attention, along with questions about the validity of the global temperature record, in what became known as 'Climategate'. A period of soul-searching around international processes followed the Copenhagen Cop. On the science side, a series of reviews and inquiries found the analysis of the global temperature records was robust, as were the IPCC procedures, but a number of improvements were adopted. At the 2010 Cancun Cop, governments strongly affirmed their support for the international process. They adopted the 2C limit as the long-term global goal for the UNFCCC and a sciencebased process to consider its adequacy in avoiding dangerous climate change. That review was informed by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. It in turn informed the Cop21 Paris Agreement in 2015 and the goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C. The latest IPCC report provides compelling insights on the steps needed to halt human-induced climate change. The message is of urgency and there is a need for swift and effective actions in the period to 2030. These should enable net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century, and also address other greenhouse gases. How will governments respond? Covid19 shows that what might seem a logical and clear response in one country does not always translate across international borders. For climate change, like Covid19, a failure to respond effectively anywhere can have global implications. The prescience of the Paris Agreement is it was designed to take account of such differences. Each country committed to making its own nationally determined contribution, but these contributions should add up to what is needed. The global stocktake is the forum in which the adequacy of our collective ambition will be determined. That first stocktake will take place in 2023. It is effectively being kicked off at Cop26 when governments will, for the first time, have an opportunity to consider their collective ambition. Right now, we know from multiple sources that stated ambition is not enough. A number of key actors have yet to commit while others are still considering revisions. So back to Cop26 in Glasgow and the omens. We have a new IPCC report, another Nobel Prize for climate science, but this is different. We have the agreement, the science is unequivocal, what is needed is the willingness and capacity to take the required actions. Expectations are high for Cop26 . Success may not be apparent for some time. Cop26 should create the momentum and clarity required so that in 2023 we can say we are collectively on a pathway to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. If Glasgow does this, it will be historic for the right reasons. Frank McGovern is chief climate scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency \</doc>

Scores of countries have joined a pledge to cut their methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade as part of efforts to tackle climate change. The global methane pledge, led by the US and EU, has been formally launched at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, where countries are under pressure to increase their emissions cuts to avoid dangerous warming beyond 1.5C. Cutting methane, a powerful but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas which comes from sources including fossil fuel extraction and livestock farming, is seen as making a significant short-term contribution to climate action. Half of the world's top 30 methane emitters, including the US, EU, Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Iraq, Vietnam and Canada, have joined the pledge. \~ Speaking at the summit, US president Joe Biden thanked those who have signed the "game-changing commitment". Advertisement"Together we are committing to collectively reduce our methane by 30 per cent by 2030, and I think we could probably go beyond that," he said. "Today it's approaching 100 countries that are signing on. That's nearly half the global methane emissions... It's going to make a huge difference." Mr Biden said this would not only help fight climate change but also improve health, cut crop losses and reduce pollution. He added: "One of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade to keep 1.5 degrees is reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible. "It's one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is. It amounts to about half the warming we are experiencing today." European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she is "proud and happy and grateful that over 80 countries have signed up". She added: "Methane is 80 times more global warming than CO2. And today, global methane emissions grow faster than at any time in the past. "So cutting back on methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming and keep 1.5C. It is the lowest hanging fruit." \</doc>

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the COP26 climate summit, his office has confirmed, in a major boost for the conference that has already been snubbed by key world leaders. More than 120 world leaders are expected to attend the biggest climate summit since the 2015 Paris talks on 1-2 November, but China's President Xi Jinping and Russia's President Vladimir Putin will be conspicuously absent. Climate envoys from the US, EU and the summit's British organisers have made repeat visits to New Delhi in recent weeks to encourage Mr Modi's government to do more to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Officials have indicated that India, third behind the US and China as an emitter of greenhouse gases, will make a new offer but they have given no details. Mr Modi will go to the climate talks in Glasgow after attending the G20 summit in Rome next weekend where rising temperatures will also be a key issue, his office said in a statement. His office said the climate summit would be a key opportunity for "charting the way forward". According to the International Energy Agency, India now produces the same amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide as the EU, though it is two-thirds lower on a per capita basis. The post-pandemic economic recovery in 2021 is expected to see India's CO2 emissions rise above 2019 levels, according to the agency. India has insisted that rich countries who profited from industrialisation in the past should pay more to help developing nations take climate-boosting measures. \</doc>

President Tayyip Erdogan cancelled plans to attend the global climate conference in Glasgow on Monday because Britain failed to meet Turkey's demands on security arrangements, Turkish media quoted him as saying. Heads of state and government from around the world are attending the COP26 summit. Erdogan had been expected to join them in Scotland after attending the G20 summit in Rome at the weekend, but instead landed back in Turkey shortly after midnight on Monday. Turkish media quoted him as telling reporters on his plane home that Ankara had made demands regarding security protocol standards for the summit in Britain which were not satisfied. "When our demands were not met we decided not to go to Glasgow," Erdogan was quoted as saying. He said that the protocol standards Ankara sought were those always implemented on his international trips. AdvertisementBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially said the problem had been resolved, Erdogan said. "But at the last moment he got back to us and said that the Scottish side was causing difficulties," Turkish media quoted him as saying. 'Dignity of our nation' Erdogan said he subsequently learnt that the measures Turkey had sought were granted as an exception to another country, which he did not name. He said this was unacceptable. "We are obliged to protect the dignity of our nation," he said. A spokesperson for the British government's COP26 office declined to comment on security matters. Scotland police said they do not comment on VIP security. A senior Turkish official earlier told Reuters that British authorities had not met Turkey's requests over security. "The president took such a decision because our demands regarding the number of vehicles for security and some other security-related demands were not fully met," the official said. Erdogan had previously said he would meet US President Joe Biden in Glasgow, but they met in Rome on Sunday. Paris agreement Last month, Turkey's parliament ratified the Paris climate agreement, becoming the last G20 country to do so. Ankara had held off ratification for years, saying Turkey should not be classed as a developed country with reduced access to funding to support emissions cuts under the accord. It also said Turkey is historically responsible for a very small share of carbon emissions. Erdogan said last week Turkey had signed a memorandum of understanding under which it will get loans worth $3.2 billion ((EURO)2.75 billion) to help it meet clean energy goals set out in the Paris accord. Other absentees from the Glasgow meeting include Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country is by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, one of the world's top three oil producers. Xi will address the conference on Monday via a written statement, according to an official schedule. Putin has dropped plans to participate in any talks live by video link, the Kremlin said. - Reuters \</doc>

The president of the farming organisation Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), Pat McCormack has said that farmers were "listening with trepidation" to speeches from Cop26 and did not accept comments by the Taoiseach about stabilisng the national herd. Speaking on RT\'c9 radio's News at One, Mr McCormack denied claims that farmers' heads were in the sand and said that they were "open to change". "There is a lot of investment in science and in the diet of our animals that can bring about reductions in emissions." Mr McCormack called for clarity about the aspirations particularly in the area of food production. Irish agriculture was in a good place from an efficiency point of view, he said. According to Mr McCormack, the Government needed to support the dairy industry to become more climate friendly and efficient. The most recent Budget had not included a level of investment to secure the future of agriculture, he added. AdvertisementIrish agriculture can deliver the changes needed, and the sector was already reducing emissions per kilogramme of production, he explained. Mr McCormack asked was the EU going to go ahead with the Mercosur deal given the actions of Brazil. On the same programme a lecturer in climate policy, Sadhbh O'Neill, said the issue of livestock numbers would have to be addressed to reach the zero emission target. "The actions that are taken on agriculture can secure a future for our rural communities," she said. "We need to follow the science." \</doc>

Negotiators at Cop26 have been told the "world is watching us, willing us to reach an agreement" as they debated a deal for more climate action at the overrunning talks. They are considering the latest draft of the deal that could be struck, published on Saturday morning more than 13 hours after the UN climate summit in Glasgow was due to have finished. There has been a pushback on the draft deal's historic inclusion of language about phasing out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, which has survived into the near-final draft. The draft also requests that countries "revisit and strengthen" their 2030 emissions-cutting targets by the end of 2022, to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement where countries committed to limiting temperature rises to "well below" 2 degrees and trying to limit them to 1.5 degrees.

It also calls for countries to make efforts to accelerate the phase out of unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies - the first time a climate change agreement of this kind specifically mentions coal or fossil fuels. But it also recognises the need for support towards a "just transition",\~seen as important to protect those in countries who might be hit by job losses or higher costs from the shift to clean energy. The deal on the table urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to help developing nations adapt to climate change from 2019 levels by 2025. The "cover decision" also includes efforts on loss and damage to people's homes, livelihoods, land and infrastructure that vulnerable countries face from climate-related rising seas, storms, floods and droughts.

AdvertisementIndia has called for language relating to the phasing out of fossil fuels and their subsidies to be stripped out of the text, while China and several other countries also raised concerns about the passage, although major coal producer Australia said it was happy with the deal. While some of the most vulnerable countries in the world raised concerns about limitations of the deal, particularly on loss and damage, they said they were prepared to accept it in a spirit of compromise. Starting the plenary session of the talks, Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: "We want to conclude this Cop this afternoon friends, the world is watching us, willing us to reach an agreement here for the sake of our planet and for present and future generations. "I believe that the text before you delivers on the expectations and the priorities that you have communicated to my team and to me over the past few years, and they do so in a balanced manner, leaving no issue and no party behind. "So I invite you to join together this afternoon to bring this collective effort to a successful conclusion to demonstrate that unity of purpose that our leaders at the start of this summit and indeed our people across the world demand." Advertisement \~ US climate envoy John Kerry said he believed the deal "raises ambition on a global basis", while the EU's Frans Timmermans urged other countries: "Please embrace this text so that we can bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren. They're waiting for us, they will not forgive us if we fail." The finance minister from Tuvalu in the South Pacific, Seve Paeniu, showed the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow a photo of his three grandchildren as he told those present the conference has "made a promise to secure their future". Telling delegates he had been thinking about what he would tell them on his return to Tuvalu, he said: "I will now be able to tell them that Glasgow has made a promise to secure their future - that will be the best Christmas gift that I will present to them." \</doc>

We are days away from a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change. COP26 , the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, takes place in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November. Amid concerns that the summit might fail to achieve the commitments needed to constrain global warming, we asked several young people to send a message to the world leaders who will gather in Scotland for 12 days of talks. Today, we hear from Theresa Rose Sebastian, a Leaving Certificate student in Mount Mercy College in Cork, who will be attending COP26 . "I will be there to ensure our world leaders know exactly what we think and what justice means," she said. "As a global nation, we are one. When one of us hurts, all of us need to stand in solidarity." Theresa's journey to becoming a climate activist started three years ago, when at the age of 14, she was faced with extreme flooding in India. "I\' d gone home to Kerala where I'm from in India, we were there for my cousin\' s wedding and it started to rain," she recalled. "We're used to rain - it was the monsoon period - but this was a lot worse. The rain never stopped. It increased and got worse and worse to the point we couldn't see outside. Tree trunks were submerged, the carpark was completely under water and cars were floating. "I was 14, I was young and quite na\'efve to how the world worked, and I thought it was as if the world was ending." The flooding was an eye-opening, frightening experience. But when Theresa returned to Ireland, she became frustrated that the disaster wasn't being covered in the media. "No national or global media were discussing the atrocity. We lost 400 lives and had hundreds of camps set up for displaced people, but what global media organisations were covering at that time was Donald Trump's golf trips," she said. "For me, that was really frustrating. We lost lives as a nation, but it was his golf trips that were given more attention. So from there I took the initiative to learn what climate change is, what exactly is happening and how is it happening." Theresa plans to study Law and Social Justice at University College Dublin next year. She sees it as the next step in her fight for climate justice for all. "We have to live in, and construct a world that's built on justice, sustainability and empathy, where each and every one of us is fair to each other and we\' re all equal," Theresa explained. "The one we're in now, the global south nations are suffering at the hands of what the global north have produced. It's always the ones that have nothing to do with the crisis, that are the most impacted. But that isn't to say that the global north will be left alone. "The climate crisis does not have borders, we are one global community but the way we're impacted is different, but the reality is that we will all be impacted by the end of it." Theresa is calling for "huge systematic change" and "the deconstruction of the fossil fuel industry". The latter, she said, must be done in a way that looks after the people working in that industry. She added: "We can't forget the people who work in these industries who have no other means of a livelihood without it; we need to ensure there is a just transition to a more sustainable, equitable and just-oriented future and system that has everyone in mind and has people over profit." Theresa is looking forward to bringing her message to world leaders at COP26 , a conference she said, she "has both hopes and fears for." "One thing I want to say to world leaders is: stop patting your backs and put your backs into it. We've had enough of these adaptation tactics when you continue to aggravate the crisis," she said. "There has never been a shortage of solutions and there has never been a lack of research, all there has been a lack of is justice. "This COP is so crucial because it quite literally defines who survives and who doesn\' t ... The way we're going, we have very little chance of reaching a sustainable world, but it isn't to say we don't have time, we do, but for the little time we have left, we are not doing enough." \</doc>

Climate change and living costs are the main sources of future worry for almost four out of five teenagers in Ireland, while the majority doubt the country will meet its environmental targets over the next two decades. Mirroring what has become one of the pressing issues of recent years for young people all over the world, nearly a quarter of Irish teenagers describe themselves as climate activists, research commissioned by Young Social Innovators (YSI) showed. The non-prof it organisation for young people examined the mental health concerns of so-called 'Generation Z', broadly defined as those born between the late 1990s and the end of the 2000s. Young people have shown how serious they are about climate change with school strikes all over the world led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and others in recent years. Cop26 , the UN climate change summit in Glasgow last November, saw young people from all over the world, including Ireland, descend on the Scottish city as world leaders gathered, demanding real action on climate change, especially in countries bearing the brunt of the crisis through flooding, heatwaves, and drought. The new research on 1,090 Irish teenagers found major scepticism about the Government's intentions in tackling the climate crisis. Of future worries, some 78% cited climate change, just one percentage point below the top issue, the cost of living. Some 51% believe Ireland will not hit its key climate goals within the next 20 years, while nearly nine in 10 believe society and the Government is not doing enough. It is not only political leaders that are failing in the crisis, most teenagers said. More than four in five think companies are failing to play their part, while 45% do not believe individual people are doing enough. When it comes to their own behaviour, some 94% claim they currently recycle, 76% say they are careful about food wastage, 70% use public transport, 53% buy secondhand clothes, and 42% buy food that does not rely on plastic packaging. Four in five claimed they have no intention of owning a car powered by petrol or diesel. \</doc>

POPE FRANCIS joined a growing chorus calling for action at the UN COP26 climate summit, saying the world's political leaders must give future generations "concrete hope" that they are taking the radical steps needed. The 84-year-old , who will not attend the summit, which runs from tomorrow until November 12, following surgery earlier this year, called for a "renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world" to spur action, saying that while talks would be tough, they offered an opportunity. "These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy," he said, adding: "moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities, opportunities that we must not waste". The Pope had an opportunity to raise his climate concerns at a lengthy meeting with US President Joe Biden in Rome. Both the White House and the Vatican were due to issue statements later. Separately, in a draft communique seen ahead of summit, leaders of the 20 richest countries will acknowledge the existential threat of climate change. The Group of 20, whose leaders gather today and tomorrow in Rome before heading to Glasgow for the UN gathering, will pledge to take urgent steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While the 2015 Paris Agreement committed signatories to keeping global warming to "well below" 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5 degrees, carbon levels in the atmosphere have since grown. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has berated politicians for 30 years of "blah, blah, blah" rather than acting to curb global warming, is among those expected to protest on the streets of the City of London, the UK capital's financial heart and home to some of the world's biggest financial firms. Mr Biden will join his counterparts at the G20 meeting after a setback on Thursday when the House of Representatives abandoned plans for a vote on a $1trn ((EURO)800bn) infrastructure bill, which would have represented the biggest investment in climate action in US history. The US president had hoped to reach an agreement before COP26 , where he wants to present a message that the US has resumed the fight against global warming. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the summit, said this week the outcome hangs in the balance. Yesterday Britain moved a step closer to ensuring business aligns with net-zero commitments by becoming the first G20 country to make a set of global voluntary disclosure standards on climate-related risks mandatory for big firms. Mining giant Anglo American said it aims to halve its indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 as it bolsters renewable electricity supply in Latin America and explores ways to better access metals and minerals. COP26 , said political leaders must make carbon markets more effective and that only states can effectively curb fossil fuel demand. The statement from the G20 countries, which are responsible for an estimated 80pc of global greenhouse gas emissions, said members acknowledged "the key relevance of achieving global net zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by 2050". But countries on the climate frontline who are struggling with rising sea levels want steps taken now. "We need concrete action now. We cannot wait until 2050, it is a matter of our survival," Anote Tong, a former president of the Pacific Island nation Kiribati and twice a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize, said. UN climate experts say a 2050 deadline is crucial to meet the 1.5 degree limit, but some of the world's biggest polluters say they cannot reach it, with China, by far the largest carbon emitter, aiming for 2060. In the G20 draft communique, the 2050 date appears in brackets, indicating it is still subject to negotiation. Current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for an average 2.7C temperature rise this century, a UN report said on Tuesday. Mr Tong has predicted his country of 33 atolls and islands that stand just metres above sea level will likely become uninhabitable in 30 to 60 years' time and Pacific Island leaders are demanding immediate action. Countries on the climate frontline 'can't wait until 2050' Summit host Boris Johnson said the outcome hangs in the balance \</doc>

Sir David Attenborough's latest landmark natural history series has premiered in Glasgow, showing viewers the hidden world of plant life. The Green Planet uses groundbreaking filming techniques to show viewers the intricate lives of plants and the ecosystems that flourish around them. The global premiere took place in Glasgow on Sunday evening, as the city hosts the Cop26 summit on tackling climate change. Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams gave a speech introducing the first episode of the series, after meeting Mr Attenborough for the first time as he arrived in Glasgow for the premiere. In his latest television production, the renowned natural historian takes an active role in front of the camera, describing the way plants thrive around the world. \~ Speaking ahead of the showing, he said: "It is quite fitting that The Green Planet will receive its premiere at Cop26 , and I'm pleased that I could be in Glasgow to see it with an audience. Advertisement"For years plant life has been largely ignored when talking about climate change, but as viewers will see from watching the series, the green ecosystem is at the heart of all life on earth and thus it's vital that we tackle biodiversity and climate change together." The production team for The Green Planet used a custom-made type of camera rig to show the life of plants in minute detail. The five-part series from the BBC's Natural History Unit is expected to air early in 2022.

She said: "As humans, we are hardwired to prioritise animals over plants. It is an informally-proposed form of cognitive bias called 'plant blindness'. "But plants are vital for our survival on this planet. The more we distance ourselves from our greatest allies, the more trouble we are in. "I hope that The Green Planet helps change the conversation and makes each of us stop, look, and see the world through a new green lens."

"His films showed me the complex web of our ecosystem - how extraordinary life on earth is, and yet, how fragile. Advertisement"They showed me how our sublime natural world can be cruel and unfair, but not as cruel or unfair as our human impact. "Like many others, it made me resolve that I wanted to help to protect our planet." The Green Planet's executive producer Mike Gunton said the series was Mr Attenborough's "love letter to the green world". He told the PA news agency: "One of the ways of getting people into this world is using the best guide you could possibly have, which is Sir David. Mr Gunton said The Green Planet "rebooted" the on-camera presenting approach Sir David took for other programmes earlier in his career. He said: "He's in his 90s, we were taking him to the deserts, to the Arctic circle, to the middle of the jungle. He loved it, as did we." Mr Gunton said the team used time-lapse photography as a "portal" into the world of plant life, using specially-designed robotic camera rigs. \</doc>

The world's major economies must "stretch to do more" at next month's United Nations climate talks to show they are serious about wanting to tackle global warming, US Climate Envoy John Kerry has said. The COP26 "We now have about 55% of global GDP committed to undertake tracks that will hold the temperature to 1.5 degrees. There are other countries now sharpening their pencils," Mr Kerry said during a pre- COP26 meeting in Milan, Italy. "Well below 2 degrees Celsius means well below ... the common sense meaning of that is not 1.9, 1.8 or 1.7 (degrees)," he added. New energy and funding pledges from the US and China have raised negotiators' hopes, but many G20 countries, including major polluters such as China and India, have yet to announce updates of their short-term climate action plans. Youth climate activists including Sweden's Greta Thunberg, who was in Milan this week, HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2021/0928/1249474-greta-thunberg/ have demanded that policymakers match words with action and stump up billions of dollars to wean the world off fossil fuels They have also called for a transparent climate finance system and more grants to help the people most exposed to the impact of climate change. Wealthy nations that pledged a decade ago to mobilise $100bn (\€ 86.2bn) a year to help vulnerable countries adapt and transition to cleaner energy are still short of their 2020 goal. Mr Kerry said he expected donors to fulfil the pledge, but added that a post-2025 finance plan "with an emphasis not just on billions, but on trillions" would be required. "(The) private sector is needed for this ... We'll be announcing one specific agenda item in conjunction with the World Economic Forum," he said, without giving further details. EU climate commissioner Frans Timmermans echoed Mr Kerry's call for radical and swift action. "We're fighting for the survival of humanity," he told reporters. Asked about coal mining, Mr Timmermans said the industry would gradually disappear even without specific climate action because it would eventually become economically unviable. "I'd be highly surprised if there is still a significant coal mining industry after 2040," he said. China and India, the world's top two coal producers, still rely on coal-fired power stations for a big share of their electricity supply. "We're in a very constructive dialogue with India and China ... there is a wish by both countries to be part of the success," Mr Timmermans added. \</doc>

TAOISEACH Miche\'e1l Martin did not use the government jet to fly to the COP26 summit earlier this week. However, he has refused to say if it will no longer be used where there is an alternative commercial flight available. Mr Martin returned from the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday night and told the D\'e1il yesterday that he and his officials stayed in Edinburgh because of how busy the host city was. "I didn't use the government jet to go and because of the sheer numbers of people there, we stayed in Edinburgh and took the journey down because there's enormous crowds in Glasgow right now,' he told the D\'e1il. While confirming he did not use the jet to fly to the summit, he said it was still necessary for the Learjet 45 to be used by members of government to attend overseas engagements and return to Ireland promptly. The Taoiseach suggested maintenance issues meant the jet could sometimes not be used. The issue of the jet's use was raised by Independent TD Michael McNamara, who said it should not be used in circumstances where alternative commercial flights are available. "Will you confirm that it won't be used any more where there is at least a feasible alternative, where there are commercial flights to the city of destination?" Mr McNamara asked. Speaking to the Irish Independent, Mr McNamara said while he accepted ministers had to be in various places at various times, "if it's a city with scheduled flights like Glasgow then, given the amount of carbon emissions, it is impossible to justify its use". 'The government jet isn't being used that frequently' \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has hailed a pact made by the United States and China at the Cop26 climate summit. The two superpowers, the world's biggest emitters of CO2, pledged to act in a joint declaration made in a surprise announcement in Glasgow on Wednesday. Both nations agreed to "recall their firm commitment to work together" and to close the "significant gap" to achieving the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

He said: "The most important thing that happened in the last year and a bit has been the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States in respect of climate change. Advertisement"That's my view because prior to that we were facing a fairly depressing scenario where you had an administration that was almost in climate denial. "Why is that important? You can see already leading into Cop 26 that the European Union, which is a leader in terms of climate change, is now partnering with the United States and the Biden administration with John Kerry as a special envoy, and driving the global agenda. "Now this morning, we hear about a very good partnership announcement between the US and China. "John Kerry's saying he's had 30 meetings with his counterpart in China and they're reaching agreement. "The Chinese envoy on climate is now saying this is an existential crisis, we're partnering with the world and with the US to deal with this. This is progress." 'We are behind' Mr Martin also said Ireland had much to do on the climate change front. "Speed is everything here and we in this country are behind," he told Dermot and Dave on Today FM. "We need to move, because it's about the generations, it's about my children, the children coming after me. That's what this is about." The Taoiseach said it was important not to "vilify" certain sectors on the issue, but instead work together to find solutions. AdvertisementHe referenced a meeting with 15-year-old climate activist and farmer Liadh Dalton, who spent a day working in the Taoiseach's office this week as part of a Unicef programme. He said: "Her main concern, she's a young farmer from Offaly, is very committed to climate change, but feels that we're not building bridges between communities. "That rather than vilifying, say, the agricultural community, we should be engaging and building bridges with the agricultural community. "Working out projects through research as to what will help them reduce methane, get better practices, technologies. And it was very interesting." He added: "I thought it was a good insight for me. Here's a young person whose future is at stake, who loves the land, is on the land for generations and wants to be a part of the solution. "And she is saying to me: 'Look, stop attacking our community on a constant basis. Work with us to get it done.' "That has to be the spirit that informs how we approach this into the future." \</doc>

Travellers heading to the Cop26 summit have acknowledged the irony of being delayed by extreme weather and said it is both "inconvenient" and a reminder of the impacts of climate change. Many were caught on slow moving or stationary trains, while others were forced to book domestic flights to reach the summit. An announcement just before 2pm revealed all train services had been suspended and the concourse was "exit only" due to overcrowding. Pictures on social media showed the concourse packed with people. Climate change scientist Simon Lewis said he has been stuck on a train for more than three hours as a result of the disruption. Advertisement The 49-year-old professor, from University College London, was on the 11am service from London to Edinburgh but was brought to a halt just 45 minutes later. "We are moving a tiny bit every now and again, but have not made it to Peterborough yet, the first stop," he told the PA News Agency. "This is inconvenient and a reminder that climate change drives extreme weather events and every country needs to adapt. He added: "A stopped train is nothing compared to the two million people displaced by flooding in Shanxi province in China, last month, and those facing famine today in Madagascar." Another passenger, David Johnson, said he and others on his train from London Euston to Glasgow were told to get off the train after half an hour waiting. Mr Johnson is attending Cop26 as chief executive of the Margaret Pyke Trust, a UK-based international NGO focused on removing barriers to family planning as part of climate adaptation efforts.

"The irony of the climate impacting the trains, meaning a flight to the climate change conference is the only way to get there today, is not lost on me," he told PA. The original disruption came as a result of damage to overhead electrical wires between Rugby and Milton Keynes on the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail said its teams are on site near Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, where the damage occurred. The company said it is working to remove the fallen tree before assessing the damage and beginning repairs. Travellers are advised not to go to Euston and instead check for regular updates. \</doc>

The Cop26 climate talks have agreed to get countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting targets for 2030 by the end of next year in a bid to limit dangerous warming. Ministers and negotiators at the UN summit in Glasgow have also sent a signal on the shift away from the world's dirtiest fuel, with a deal calling for efforts to escalate the "phase down" of unabated coal, as well as the phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The Glasgow Pact was watered down at the last minute - following a push by India and China - from escalating the "phase out" of unabated coal, to "phase down", prompting angry responses from European and vulnerable countries. However, it is the first explicit mentions of fossil fuels in a UN climate agreement. Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan, who was in attendance on Saturday, confirmed the deal had been reached, tweeting: "It gives us a chance of keeping 1.5 degrees alive." "The last minute deal on coal was deeply disappointing but we had to agree a deal," Mr Ryan added. "We can no longer delay. It brings momentum at home & has to deliver climate justice for the world." In the wake of the 'Glasgow Pact' being gavelled through - more than 24 hours after the official finishing time of the conference, there were warnings that the 1.5 degrees goal was "on life support". \</doc>

Cop26 is the "last opportunity" for humanity to prevent global temperature rises passing 1.5C, the British prime minister has said. With world leaders preparing to descend on Glasgow for the crucial climate summit, where countries are under pressure to increase their ambition to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, Boris Johnson said the human race had entered the last chance saloon on the environment. He said the focus needed to be on securing agreements for countries to cut their carbon output and stop global warming exceeding the target amount to prevent the worst impacts. Speaking to the i newspaper, Mr Johnson said: "Cop is really the last opportunity for the planet, humanity, to come together and keep alive the hope of restricting growth in temperatures to 1.5 degrees. "We are not going to stop climate change any time soon, and we are certainly not going to stop it at Cop26 . Advertisement"The most we can hope to do, and it is going to be incredibly difficult, is to restrict the growth by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees." He predicted the talks would involve a "massively complicated negotiation of trade-offs between the developing world and richer countries" which could last for "days and days" in the bid to find an agreement at the two-week conference. \~ In separate comments to reporters on his flight to the G20 in Rome, Mr Johnson revealed he had urged China's president Xi Jinping to move faster on reducing his country's carbon emissions. Mr Johnson said he had a lengthy telephone call with Mr Xi ahead of Cop26 - which the Chinese leader is not attending - during which he raised the issue of when China's emissions would peak. "They said before 2030, obviously I pushed a bit on that - '25 would be better than 2030. But then I wouldn't say he committed on that," he said.

He said China depends on coal for... domestic economy and I said the thing you've heard me say so many times about the UK moving away from 80 per cent dependence on coal to 1 per cent today. Advertisement"I said when I came to see you in Beijing in 2008 we were 40 per cent dependent on coal - it shows how fast you can make the transition." Mr Johnson, who read classics at Oxford University, used the example of the Roman Empire to show how swiftly civilisations can collapse as he urged action among G20 leaders on climate change ahead of the UK summit. "When things start to go wrong they can go wrong at extraordinary speed," he said.

What can we make sure that countries follow all the commitments they sign up to at COP26 ? "We know from the way that many of the pledges are couched, that many countries couch their commitments in terms of get out of jail free cards," he said. "This is something that the Paris Agreements permits at the moment and it\' s something that doesn\' t enable implementation to be monitored and verified." He said the Paris Agreement is an international treaty and "countries shouldn\' t be able to welch out of something that they signed up to," but he said one does not need to look further than the host country, the UK to see that countries do not always live up to those agreements. Prof Sweeney said he expects the talks will run overtime as they have done in previous COP climate summits, adding that "to try and get 196 countries to agree on something is no small feat". "One has to start off being a little pessimistic about that, as these countries all have different agendas, and attitudes and to be truthful there are countries here who don\' t want to crack the problem of climate change in a hurry." Prof Sweeney, who is a COP veteran, says the negotiators or country officials are getting into the "nitty-gritty" of the agreement as we approach the second half of the second week. "Generally, decisions are not made until the middle of the second week, when the Ministers (for the Environment) arrive." Prof Sweeney said that last week was very typical "in that nothing earth shattering had been decided." "We\' re all waiting for the big bangs to happen this week, towards the middle and end of this week." He says the pressure is on - "this is a crucial conference, we are running out of time to, and we know we only have a limited carbon budget left to burn." "It\' s essential we get on target to keeping warming to 1.5 degrees this week." \</doc>

The Government's Climate Action Plan is expected to exclude a pledge to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent signed by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin and other world leaders earlier this week at the Cop26 summit. According to HYPERLINK https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/cabinet-s-climate-action-plan-to-bypass-cop26-summit-pledge-on-reducing-methane-1.4717568 The Irish Times , the plan is instead understood to include methane reductions of approximately 10 per cent, however, larger reductions across other greenhouse gases are being targeted in order to meet an overall reduction of 50 per cent by 2030. On Tuesday, HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/cop26-scores-of-countries-pledge-to-cut-methane-emissions-by-30-by-2030-1208108.html half of the world's top 30 methane emitters , including the US, EU, Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Iraq, Vietnam and Canada, joined the pledge to cut methane emissions by almost a third by the end of the decade. The Climate Action Plan, which is expected to be published later this week, will detail measures to be taken over the next decade in various sectors, including agriculture, to tackle climate change. AdvertisementReductions in the agriculture sector are seen as the most contentious, however, it is understood Minister for Argriculture Charlie McConalogue and Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan have agreed to decreases, reportedly in the region of a 22-30 per cent cut on 2018 levels. Much of the reductions are likely to come through carbon capture and storage, but any decrease linked to land use changes and afforestation will not be linked to agriculture targets. It is expected the Climate Action Plan will be signed off at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Wednesday before being brought to a meeting of the full Cabinet on Thursday for final approval, after which it will be published. \</doc>

The Cop26 summit is the "last-chance saloon", Britain's Prince Charles has warned, as he called for words to become actions to tackle the climate change crisis. Charles told world leaders the future of humanity and nature is at stake as he addressed them ahead of the major conference. The future king of England argued that now is the time to put aside differences and grasp what he described as a "unique opportunity" for a so-called green recovery in order to save the planet. Speaking to the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday, he said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Cop26 begins in Glasgow tomorrow. Advertisement"Quite literally, it is the last-chance saloon.\~We must now translate fine words into still finer actions. "As the enormity of the climate challenge dominates people's conversations, from newsrooms to living rooms, and as the future of humanity and nature herself are at stake, it is surely time to set aside our differences and grasp this unique opportunity to launch a substantial green recovery by putting the global economy on a confident, sustainable trajectory and, thus, save our planet." Charles told the politicians that the private sector is "eager" to work with them and "ready to play a hugely significant and game-changing role", saying solutions to major issues "seem possible only if there is a much closer partnership between Government, the main multilateral banks, the private sector and its investors". HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlLmFzc2V0cy5wcmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0aW9uLmlvXFxcL3YyXFxcL2ltYWdlXFxcL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb25cXFwvNGQ5OGY4YzVjNjk5MGRiNzA2MGM2MjIzZDNlYTQyNWRZMjl1ZEdWdWRITmxZWEpqYUdGd2FTd3hOak0xTnpZMk9URTFcXFwvMi42MjU2ODk3Ny5qcGc_dz02NDBcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6bnVsbCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYwMCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6e1wib3V0cHV0XCI6XCJ3ZWJwXCJ9fSIsImhhc2giOiI2N2Y0NTM3Mzc4ZTBiMWE1OTQ5NGMxN2IyMjViMTlmNWJjMTI0N2U5In0=/britain-s-prince-charles-calls-for-action-as-he-warns-cop26-is-last-chance-saloon.jpg?w=640 Link to Image (PA Graphics) The heir to the English throne spoke of the "overwhelming responsibility to generations yet unborn". He added that after almost 50 years of his own efforts in trying to raise awareness of the growing crisis, "I am at last sensing a change in attitudes and the build-up of positive momentum". Charles will also deliver the opening address at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Following his speech to the G20, the royal met with bosses of some of the world's biggest fashion brands to hear about their work to make the sector more sustainable. AdvertisementMembers of Charles' Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) Fashion Taskforce include Burberry, Stella McCartney and Selfridges. He was shown how a new\~digital ID works, using items including a Chloe poncho and Armani jacket which were scanned on a mobile phone to reveal their history, how they were designed, manufactured and transported to the shops. During the event, in the gardens of the British Embassy, he told the fashion chief executives: "I'm so grateful to you all." In a statement, Charles said: "People have the right to know if what they buy is created sustainably and there is a responsibility to tell them if we truly believe in the shared principles of transparency, accountability and enforcement. "Fashion is one of the most polluting sectors in the world but this new digital ID shows how business is committed to meaningful, measurable change: providing customers with the information they need to make cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable choices. It shows that business doesn't just talk about these issues, but has taken action." \</doc>

Young activists attending this week's climate talks in Milan are asking for a seat at the table during the upcoming UN COP26 summit in Glasgow to have a say in how decisions shaping their future are made. Thousands of young campaigners, including Sweden's Greta Thunberg, converged on Milan this week to have their voices heard and put an end to what she described as "30 years of blah blah blah" in the almost three decades of climate talks. "What we really want is that we're part of the decision-making process to be able to write the documents, to be able to have our thoughts channelled there," Eduarda Zoghbi, 28, a delegate from Brazil, told Reuters. COP26 agenda that will be vetted by climate and energy ministers over the next days. Advertisement"Our thoughts definitely have to be shared ... we are the future generations," said 16-year-old Hoor Ahli from the United Arab Emirates. Spiralling Their concern is that much has been promised but little done to tackle global warming. Those fears were exacerbated by a UN report in August which warned the situation was dangerously close to spiralling out of control. "My message to world leaders is that they include youth," Zoghbi said, adding each delegate represented the particular challenges faced by countries as a result of climate change. Among them was Jeremy Raguain, 27, from the Seychelles, who called for more financing for smaller states, and Achana Soreng, 25, a member of the Kharia tribe in Eastern India, who advocated for more rights for indigenous communities in the debate. "We need those views reflected in the main texts, and we need leaders to listen to us," Zoghbi said. - Reuters \</doc>

ooray! We're all saved! H Well, actually, that's not entirely true. The Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow was touted as one of the most important political gatherings of the last 100 years. As the weather continues to fluctuate wildly around the world, we were informed that the hundreds of bigwigs in attendance would put their heads together and formulate a plan that would help us get out of the mess. Instead, we have been treated to bickering, dithering and bloviating. And that's just from the people who bothered to turn up. The absence of the two worst carbon emitters, Russia and China, immediately meant that the two-week borefest in Scotland would be rather pointless. So, as the leaders who did turn up (and I can't shake the great REM song World Leader Pretend from my mind) informed us that we were looking at years of hardship ahead of us in our efforts to get a handle on the situation, China merrily announced that it was increasing its coal production to 11 million tonnes a day. Read that again: 11 millions tonnes a day. They just gave the world a massive two-fingered salute. For the record, I'm not a 'climate denier', which is an obnoxious phrase designed to evoke a subconscious connection with Holocaust denial. But, like many of us, I am extremely sceptical about the methods that have been proposed to cut emissions. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease and the insanely draconian measures g that ordinary people will be expected to take are simply unsustainable. Apart from anything else, I'm baffled by the complete lack of logic from both the politicians in the Glasgow conference and the activists who gathered outside. The protesters, particularly, don't seem to have thought this one through. As St Greta of the Order of the Permanent Scowl rallied her troops outside the venue, one thought immediately struck me and it was this - hang on, they're barracking the very people who are trying to make a difference? What about the countries that are burning fossil fuels like there's no tomorrow? Why aren't they protesting outside the Russian and Chinese embassies? Their actions seem rather, shall we say, logically inconsistent. But then logic and rational debate have never had much place in a religious movements - and that is what the climate movement has become: a modern-day faith for modern-day people. In fact, you only have to look at the messianic zeal of St Greta and the slavish adoration of her flock to realise that we're witnessing the formation of a brand new orthodoxy; an orthodoxy that brooks no dissent and punishes the miscreants. TWO CAMPS But she is not the problem, she's only a convenient symbol. China and Russia refused to attend because they are more concerned with their own economies. Australia did attend but refused to ratify the agreement to reduce coal because... it would be bad for its economy. The world's governments seem to be split into two camps - those that are genuinely freaked by the climate crisis and are prepared to plunge their own citizens into poverty and cold to make a difference and those who realise that you can't bankrupt your nation to appease other countries. The lack of coherent thought is, ironically, best exemplified here in little old Ireland, which according to the last reputable figures contributes 0.1pc of the world's carbon output. In one of the madder ideas ever floated, various activists are now demanding that we reduce the national herd to curb methane emissions. The result? Well, that means we will simply end up buying more beef from Brazil; the same Brazil that is cutting down vast swathes of the rainforest to make room for more cows... to sell to countries like us. That simply flies in the face of reason. As individuals, we should be focussing on sustainability and environmentalism. For example, I've taken one flight in the last 10 years (and that was a work trip to Syria). I don't drive a car, I don't have kids and I only eat locally sourced meat. Yet the people who drive gas-guzzling cars and take multiple flights are telling me I have to get rid of my gas boiler and replace it with an expensive heat pump that may not even work when it gets too cold and you need it the most? There is, as ever, a solution - nuclear power, yet the great and the good who gathered at Cop26 seemed to gloss over that possibility because they have been brainwashed into thinking we'll be glowing in the dark if we go down that route. It is screamingly obvious that we need to have a sensible debate about the future of the planet. It's equally obvious that we didn't get that in Glasgow. That is what the climate movement has become - a modern-day faith for modern-day people \</doc>

THE Cop26 climate summit was dealt a major blow last night as Beijing pushed back against global warming targets - and Joe Biden blasted the leaders of both China and Russia for failing to attend. Puncturing what had appeared to be growing momentum at the talks in Glasgow, China's top climate envoy suggested limiting the temperature rise to 2C could still be the world's goal, not the more ambitious 1.5C. The developments threatened to overshadow Boris Johnson's insistence that he was 'caudemand tiously optimistic' the talks were making a difference. Using a football match analogy, the Prime Minister said the world had 'pulled back a goal or perhaps even two' in the fight against global warming after landmark deals on methane emissions and deforestation. Beijing's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua appeared to undermine hopes of further progress by insisting the higher of two maximum temperature rises agreed by world leaders in 2015 under the Paris Agreement had to remain up for discussion. 'If we only focus on 1.5, we are destroying consensus and many countries would a reopening of the negotiations,' he said. In Paris, countries agreed to limit temperature rises to 'well below' 2C and 'pursue efforts' to restrict them to 1.5C, compared with preindustrial times. Many had hoped Cop26 would lead to further commitments to reach the tougher figure. But the absence of the Russian and Chinese presidents from the talks involving around 120 world leaders has cast major doubts on this. And addressing the summit last night, Mr Biden said: 'I think it's been a big mistake quite frankly, China not showing up. They've lost their ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at Cop.' Mr Johnson earlier spoke of his optimism after agreements on deforestation, limiting methane and pledges to work towards net zero, and tweeted: 'Let's keep 1.5C alive.' In a stark warning, he said: 'If we don't fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe as well as an environmental catastrophe. The only way to fix this is to reduce CO2 and tackle climate change.' He said the British people had a 'great wisdom' and were 'not dumb' and knew it was a problem that needed to be fixed. Mr Johnson was also asked about the absence of Xi and Putin but said they had told him it was because of the pandemic and 'you have got to respect that'. He added: 'That doesn't mean the Chinese are not engaging.' However, a UK source criticised China, saying 'we are not seeing the sort of leadership people want to see' from the world's biggest emitter. And Microsoft bil- lionaire Bill Gates, at the conference to support a US campaign to cut carbon emissions, sounded a pessimistic note over the 1.5C target, saying: 'There's no comparable feat that mankind has ever achieved.' He said the cost of subsidising countries to curb emissions would be too great, so richer nations should focus on cutting the cost of green technology. In an interview with former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt for the Policy Exchange think tank, Mr Gates said: 'What happened with solar panels where they were very expensive, and now they're cheap, or lithium ion batteries - we need to do that for about six other technologies.' 50C 'Lucifer' heatwaves every 3 years EUROPE will see extreme 50C heatwaves every three years if greenhouse gases rise further, the UK's Met Office has warned. Unless the world takes action, Europe can expect 'Lucifer' heatwaves to take place by 2100, it said. Professor Peter Stott told BBC's Panorama: 'The increasing chances of these extreme events continue to rise.' 'No comparable feat ever achieved' 'The world has pulled back a goal or two' \</doc>

PORTABLE kitchen equipment which helped sustain world leaders like US President Joe Biden at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow has now made it back home to Co Antrim. Ballymena's Portable Kitchen company won the contract to supply temporary kitchen fa- cilities to the event at Glasgow's SEC. The deal, worth around \£3300,000, is one of the biggest and highest profile contracts for the business. It also supplied similar facilities to the G8 Summit in Enniskillen in 2010. The COP26 Mark Matthews, commercial director at Portable Kitchens, said: "This was quite a complex build over several locations within the campus. It was a pleasure to partner SEC Food on this venture to deliver quality, sustainable food to world leaders and delegates." The businessman said a team of four delivered the equipment one week before the event via 15 40ft articulated lorries. He added: "We were contracted in early July and had our guys on site for the week leading up to the event. It was a big installation." Engineers stayed onsite during the duration of the event "to ensure full usability of all equipment" he added. The facilities made the journey back home to the company's Kells warehouse last week. As well as a large-scale temporary kitchen provisions, Portable also provided further catering equipment including cold rooms, refrigerators, and freezers as well as ovens, fryers, grills, and a pasta cooker, all spread out across the entire campus. The deal, which was contracted via SEC catering subsidiary Compass, saw Portable Kitchens play a key role in the ramping up of meal provisions for thousands of world leaders, VIPs, delegates, journalists and staff during COP26 , which took place over the first two weeks of November. The event was one of the largest ever COP events, with more than 40.000 registered participants, including 22,274 party delegates, 14.124 observers and 3.886 media representatives. Having operated for 20 years, Portable Kitchens is a leading supplier of modular kitchen facilities and stand-alone catering equipment for hire throughout the island of Ireland and Scotland. It was also behind the kitchen provisions at the Balmoral Show's 150th event. while in the Republic it provided The Qcaf\'e9 Company Ltd with the necessary catering facilities and equipment to provide food services at the Christening of the MV Celine in Dublin Port. Its other partnerships include contracts with healthcare organisations including The University College Hospital Galway (UCHG). The temporary catering facility provided there provided meal preparation for the hospitals patients, staff and visitors. Its work with St Ita's Hospital in Portrane, outside Dublin, saw it provide a large scale temporary kitchen facility to provide over 800 meals per day. Mr Matthews said: "Ninety per cent of our business would be in temporary kitchens, rather than events. "This includes providing facilities where there are refurbs for healthcare settings or providing temporary facilities for places that may have been damaged in fires or floods. Events tend to be short term but high in terms of turnover and pressure." Portable Kitchens will be the supplier for the JP McManus Pro- AM Golf tournament at Adare Manner in Limerick in July next year. \</doc>

IN Glasgow this week, Cop26 delegates will pore over past climate pledges and calculate how they will impact global warming. The answer will be clear: the promises made to date and efforts to meet them have been woefully inadequate. The 2015 Paris climate agreement committed nations to holding global temperature rises well below 2C from pre-industrial levels, while endeavouring to keep that increase nearer to 1.5C. Yet, according the UN, the world is still on course to warm by 2.7C by the end of this century. As secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres put it, this is code red for humanity. Despite the scale of the challenge there remains a chasm between the rhetoric of governments across the globe and reality. The UK is a case in point. Despite the boisterous claims of Boris Johnson's government, it remains a long way off meeting its own climate targets. In Northern Ireland, like on so many issues, we continue to lag behind. Calls for meaningful climate action have long been overshadowed and drowned out by the jingoism of the main parties. We still don't have a stand alone climate change act or NI-specific emissions targets. Nor do we have the long-touted Independent Environmental Protection Agency to hold government accountable. Our biggest enemy is no longer climate denial, but climate delay. The case for acting now is clear. That's why Alliance has set out our Green New Deal: a vision for an urgent and radical overhaul of the policies and practices which have hindered our progress to date. We're proposing the creation of up to 50,000 green jobs across Northern Ireland by 2030, in areas such as manufacturing green technologies, installation of electric vehicle charging points, mass retrofitting of homes, rail network expansion and creation of renewable energy infrastructure amongst others. Cop26 could be our last chance to keep 1.5C alive. We must grasp this chance for change. Our people, planet and future prosperity depend upon it.

It has been 30 years since world leaders gathered in Rio de Janeiro and agreed on a set of measures to start the global mobilisation against human-caused climate change and to meet the imperative of a more sustainable development model. Their Rio Declaration affirmed that "human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature". Today, tens of millions of people who were not even born in 1992 are suffering the worst of the climate crisis. In a world already plagued by economic inequality and social injustice, Covid-19 has exposed and exacerbated the policy failures of the past three decades. Political leaders have not lived up to their previous commitments. To overcome inertia, policy-makers everywhere would do well to listen to those on the front lines of the climate crisis who are demonstrating real leadership and innovation. Among them are Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, the mayor of Freetown in Sierra Leone, and young activists such as Elizabeth Wanjiru Wathuti from Kenya and Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines, with whom I discussed future challenges at Project Syndicate's 'Generation Green' event last month. These intergenerational debates are critical for driving progress and upholding one of the Rio Declaration's central principles: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." One of Rio's strongest legacies is the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UNFCCC has been the key multilateral body in the international community's effort to strengthen the political consensus on climate action through annual Conference of the Parties (Cop) summits. At Cop26 That is why 2022 must be the year of accountability, with all major emitters delivering on the promises of the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact. That declaration maintained a lifeline for limiting global warming to 1.5C, relative to pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the Paris accord. All countries at Cop26 promised to step up their ambitions and revisit their emissions-reduction targets as soon as this year. In concrete terms, those who still have not set Parisaligned 2030 targets should do so by Cop27 in Sharm El-Sheikh this November. While all countries must fast-track implementation of their new commitments, it is particularly important that wealthy G20 economies do so, because they are responsible for most global emissions. Climate finance remains another critical part of the puzzle. It has been over a decade since rich countries pledged, at Cop15 in Copenhagen, to provide $ 100bn annually to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. That target has never been met. In the interests of global trust and goodwill, rich countries must follow through on this commitment this year. Cop27 will be held by an African country, on the shores of the Red Sea. Africa is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, despite African countries' negligible contribution to the problem. In the interest of justice and solidarity, I hope to see Africa speak with one voice to ensure that COP27 advances the region's concerns on adaptation, finance, and loss and damage (L&D) - the acknowledgement that countries are suffering climate effects beyond their ability to adapt. Cop26 left unfinished business on L&D, because the United States, backed by the European Union, postponed the creation of a new financial mechanism to rebuild communities in the aftermath of climate-related disasters. Country representatives nonetheless have committed to holding further discussions on the issue, which means that Cop27 represents a major opportunity to achieve a breakthrough. An effective L&D fund is increasingly important for climate-vulnerable states. At Cop26 , the Scottish government and the Belgian region of Wallonia took the first step by pledging $ 2.7m and $ 1m, respectively, for L&D (with matching funds from philanthropic organizations). But this money currently has nowhere to go. Another encouraging development is the deal concluded by South Africa, the EU, Britain, the US, France, and Germany to support South Africa's "just transition" away from coal. This now needs to be built upon - and emulated elsewhere. The spirit of multilateralism that animated the Rio summit and its outcome remains indispensable today, even though the geopolitical climate is fraught with tensions, mutual suspicion, and weak institutions. As my fellow Elder Ban Kimoon told the 'Generation Green' audience: "We all have a part to play in addressing the climate crisis - especially those with the power needed to bring about change." To honour the legacy of the Rio summit, to meet the needs of those already living with the consequences of the climate crisis, and to limit the repercussions for future generations, we all must strive to go further and faster to protect our shared home. And 2022 must be the turning point.

China and the US are to work together across a wide range of climate issues, a move seen as a major breakthrough in efforts to tackle the crisis. The initiative was confirmed by China's main negotiator Xie Zhenhua at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow and comes despite tensions arising from president Xi Jinping not attending in person, and criticism of China's climate response from US president Joe Biden. Mr Xie said climate change was "a common challenge faced by humanity and was an existential threat". There was "more agreement than divergence between China and US on the climate issue", he said, telling a meeting of leaders and negotiators he hoped this new declaration would help make Cop26 a success. The US and China are to focus on a wide range of actions including "the specifics of enhancing measurement and mitigation of methane" arising from the fossil and waste sectors, "as well as incentives and programmes to reduce methane from the agricultural sector". The two countries welcomed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use and said they intend to engage collaboratively in support of eliminating global illegal deforestation through effectively enforcing respective bans on illegal imports. High-profile commitment Responding to the pact, chief executive of think tank E3G Nick Mabey said: "The big significance of this is geopolitical. US and China have signalled they will end the wars of words that marred the past days. They will now build climate co-operation bilaterally and in multilateral fora. "This high-profile commitment puts pressure on both countries to move their positions to make Cop26 As it moves into its final hours, a first draft text on an agreement has included historic commitments to phasing out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - and calls on countries to strengthen targets in cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022. The document underscores concerns of climate experts and activists that there is a yawning gap between current national pledges and the kinds of emission cuts required to keep the world from avoiding catastrophic climate impacts. While the coal and fossil fuel commitments are a first in a Cop text, according to negotiators, there was no timeline for these actions. Developing states supported by Ireland highlighted weaker elements on climate finance, adaptation and "loss and damage" - critical requirements for poorer countries. Significant revisions The text is undergoing significant revisions as countries fight over the language, but already it reinforces the need to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees . Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said the text formed a basis for negotiations. "It needs to be added to. We need more ambition, on how we reduce emissions, how we provide climate finance, how we protect biodiversity at the same time." He confirmed he had been asked to represent the EU in bilateral discussions on transparency to ensure there was clear indication if emissions reductions were working. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: "I think we will see an increased emphasis trying to ensure particularly wealthy countries make clear commitments on 1.5 degrees. The text is reasonably strong on that." A roadmap was required to ensure temperature rise was kept within that limit this century, he said. "But it's another thing delivering on that. What this week needs to do is create the sense of urgency and, quite frankly, crisis around what's happening." \</doc>

A first draft of a deal for Cop26 calls on countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting plans in the next year in a bid to keep a goal to limit warming to 1.5C within reach. It also calls for faster phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - a first for a UN deal - but there is likely to be strong resistance to this from some countries, and it could be taken out of any final agreement. Developing countries and campaigners have also raised concerns over the provision of finance for poorer nations to cope with the impact of climate change in the draft deal. The draft "cover decision", the final version of which must be agreed by consensus of nearly 200 countries at the Glasgow summit, was published on Wednesday.

(Phil Noble/PA) Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, requires global emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century - but countries' plans for this decade leave the world well off track. The draft is published after analysis warned existing plans for this decade put the world on track for 2.4C of warming - well above the goals internationally agreed in the Paris accord to curb temperature rises to "well below" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C. Cop26 president Alok Sharma has made it clear that there is no attempt to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but the draft document says the impact of climate change will be much lower with 1.5C of warming than 2C. And it "resolves to pursue efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C" which will require more action in this decade. The draft urges countries to "revisit and strengthen" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris temperature goal, which still covers both numbers, by the end of 2022. The document published on Wednesday also urges countries to set out long-term strategies by the end of next year to reach net-zero emissions by about mid-century. It includes a call for developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change, as part of scaling up finance for poorer nations to tackle the crisis. There is also a recognition of the need to do more to address the inevitable loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure in developing countries that more extreme weather will bring. Delegations are expected to be in contact with their leaders and capitals to discuss what their position will be - particularly in those countries whose leaders did not attend the summit, such as China and Russia. Some of the most vulnerable countries have called for more action on finance, and warned that the language in the text is not strong enough to prevent dangerous warming. The Alliance of Small Island States group's chairman, Aubrey Webson, said: "We won't get the ambition on emissions we need for 1.5C if we don't scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long-overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage." Advertisement He said: "Urging, calling, encouraging and inviting is not the decisive language that this moment calls for. "We have limited time left in the Cop to get this right and send a clear message to our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you, and we are taking this crisis seriously." Environmental campaigners criticised the draft deal, with Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan saying it was "not a plan to solve the climate crisis". "It's a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year," she said. Christian Aid's Kat Kramer said it was a "historic moment" with the first outlines of the phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, but said there was lots of work to be done on finance for poorer countries.

Advertisement"We need countries to agree to return every one or two years with more ambitious pledges. We also need stronger evidence of action to deliver the pledges." Alongside the political decision, negotiators are also trying to hammer out agreement on technical parts of the Paris Agreement, including common time frames for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed ways for countries to report on their progress, to help turn pledges into action. There are also negotiations on providing adaptation finance and to address the issue of loss and damage. British prime minister Boris Johnson spoke to Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a country which has been accused of blocking progress at the climate summit, while en route to Cop26 . "They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of Cop26 , including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook." \</doc>

Ireland's Climate Action Plan and Carbon Budget come in the same month that the global community met in Scotland where dozens of nations pledged to do more to protect nature and overhaul farming amid misgivings about past failures. Agriculture, deforestation and other changes in land use account for about a quarter of humanity's planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions, making reforms vital to safeguard nature and feed a rising global population without stoking global warming. "Nature and climate are interlinked, and both our people and our surroundings are facing the very real impacts of rising temperatures," Alok Sharma, the president of the Cop26 UN climate summit at Glasgow said. He added that 70% of tropical corals, which are nurseries for fish, would be lost if temperatures rise 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial times. "If we get to two degrees they are all gone." Temperatures are already up nearly 1.2C and the overriding goal of the Glasgow negotiations is to keep alive hopes of limiting warming to 1.5C, the toughest goal set by almost 200 nations in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Forty-five nations were making pledges to safeguard nature including Ireland, the US, Japan, Germany, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Vietnam, the Philippines, Gabon, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uruguay. Sharma said the pledges included $ 4bn in public sector investment which would help spur innovation such as developing crops resilient to droughts, floods and heatwaves that could benefit "hundreds of millions of farmers". Campaigners said needed shifts to agriculture to curb emissions and protect food security should have a larger share of the global spotlight. The summit has drawn the world's attention with celebrities and public figures joining the world leaders, environmentalists and policymakers. "We need to shine a light on climate justice, and we need to make food and farming sexy," said Idris Elba, a British actor and goodwill ambassador for the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development. Vanessa Nakate, 24, a climate justice advocate from Uganda, warned that in her country, "we're watching farms collapse," with floods, droughts, heatwaves and swarms of locusts making hunger more widespread. Among pledges at Cop26 , Canada said it would allocate about $ 1bn - out of $ 5.3bn previously pledged for climate finance - to "nature-based climate solutions" in developing countries over the next five years. Britain said it would give a $ 500m ((EURO)434 m) boost to protect more than 5m hectares of tropical rainforests across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nations including Peru and Cameroon said they would increase support for small-scale farmers, while Nepal and Madagascar said they would join efforts to protect at least 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030. But other similar past pledges have fallen short. Officials said there was hope the Glasgow pledges would be different. They pointed to plans to track pledges, as well as the promises of cash and innovative technologies, such as high-yielding, drought-resistant crops. Britain said 28 nations that are big consumers of deforestation-linked commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and cocoa had joined a Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) roadmap launched in February this year. FACT says it promotes sustainable land use as a step to unlock investments, create jobs and protect forest livelihoods. "The next challenge is to go from bold statements to real implementation," said Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford. Reuters \</doc>

As she prepares to welcome more than 100 world leaders to Glasgow, the city she represents in the Scottish parliament, first minister Nicola Sturgeon is for the time being putting aside her differences with Boris Johnson. Johnson will be hosting the Cop26 climate summit, and Sturgeon says the governments in Edinburgh and London have been working well together. "I'm not interested in allowing petty political disagreements to stand in the way of our collective efforts to get a good outcome to Cop26 . I want to play whatever part I can in contributing to that good outcome. And I've made that very clear to the prime minister who I know wants to secure that good outcome as well. "So I hope we can put whatever differences we have away for the next couple of weeks and just focus on doing what needs to be done," she told The Irish Times. The meeting in Glasgow aims to keep alive the target of limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees by securing detailed plans from each country for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon acknowledges that the leaders are going into the summit with big questions still unanswered about how to deliver emissions reductions and how to help poorer countries to fund the changes necessary. "I think there is a big, big challenge confronting this summit. But a big responsibility to make sure that it succeeds. It is easy to exaggerate the importance of events like this, but we are literally talking about the future of our planet. We are talking about the sustainability of the future that today's young people will or will not have," she said.\~ "This is the world's best chance but\~it\~might actually be the last real chance the world has to avert climate catastrophe\~and to address the tipping point the world stands at. So there has probably been no more important gathering certainly in my lifetime than the one taking place here over the next couple of weeks." Climate emergency The summit also offers Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party (SNP) governs in coalition with the Greens, a chance to showcase Scotland as a progressive European country committed to tackling the climate emergency.\~ "We would be much more powerful as an independent country. Not least, we'd be sitting around the negotiating table at Cop26 . Directly in our own right, if we were an independent country, we would have more financial wherewithal and clout. "Things that right now are the decisions of UK government around oil and gas licensing, for example, would lie with the Scottish government," she said. Sturgeon won Scotland's parliamentary elections this year promising a second independence referendum by the end of 2023, and she says she is still working to that plan unless the coronavirus pandemic knocks it off course. A binding referendum could require the authorisation of Westminster (although some lawyers believe the Scottish parliament's assent alone would be enough) but Sturgeon says that if she wins a parliamentary majority for an independence vote, Johnson will have to decide if he accepts democracy or not. Democratic choice "Because of Brexit we have lost our freedom of movement across the European Union. We're no longer members of the European Union, all against our democratic choice. And, well, that's the price of not being independent," she said.\~ "We're doing our best to contribute to the global efforts to tackle climate change. But at the Cop26 "And becoming independent, yes of course, as for all independent countries, it brings with it challenges. But I don't know of a single country that is currently independent that would agree to give up its independence. And I think that probably tells a quite powerful story."\~ \</doc>

More than 120 world leaders will meet in Glasgow in a "last, best hope" to tackle the climate crisis and avert a looming global disaster. "It's one minute to midnight and we need to act now," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to tell them, according to extracts from his speech. "If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow." Observers had hoped a weekend meeting in Rome of leaders of the G20 nations, which between them emit nearly 80% of global carbon emissions, would give a strong impetus to the Glasgow COP26 summit, which was postponed for a year due to the pandemic. The G20 major economies committed yesterday to the key goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels - the most ambitious target of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. They also agreed to end funding for new unabated coal plants abroad, those whose emissions have not gone through any filtering process, by the end of 2021. But this did not convince NGOs, the British prime minister or the United Nations. "While I welcome the G20's recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled, but at least they are not buried," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Twitter. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose countries are two of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, have not travelled to the summit. Instead, it has been confirmed that China's leader will address the conference in the form of a written statement. According to the official schedule of speakers, Mr Xi's statement will be published on the official conference website later today. Others, such as US President Joe Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France will attend in person. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will deliver Ireland's National Statement to the conference tomorrow.

We've put ourselves in a reasonable position for COP in Glasgow but it's going to be very difficult in the next few days," Mr Johnson said Sunday, before warning: "If Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails." The Glasgow gathering, which runs until 12 November, comes as an accelerating onslaught of extreme weather events across the world underscores the devastating impacts of climate change from 150 years of burning fossil fuels. The current commitments of the signatories of the Paris agreement - if they were followed - would still lead to a "catastrophic" warming of 2.7 Celsius, according to the UN. COP26 marks the "last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach", summit president Alok Sharma said as he opened the meeting yesterday. "If we act now and we act together, we can protect our precious planet," he said. Climate advocacy groups expressed disappointment at the statement released at the end of the G20 summit. "These so-called leaders need to do better. They have another shot at this: starting tomorrow," said Namrata Chowdhary from the NGO 350.org. While China, by far the world's biggest carbon polluter, has just submitted to the UN its revised climate plan, which repeats a long-standing goal of peaking emissions by 2030, India is now at the centre of expectations. India has yet to submit a revised "nationally determined contribution" but if Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces new efforts to curb emissions in his speech, it could put more pressure on China and others, said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate and energy think tank E3G. "If he feels confident enough that there's going to be financing and technology assistance from Europe, the US, Japan and others, he might signal that India is willing to update its NDC," Mr Meyer said. Another pressing issue is the failure of rich countries to cough up \€ 85bn a year starting in 2020 to help developing nations lower emissions and adapt - a pledge first made in 2009. This goal has been postponed to 2023, exacerbating the crisis of confidence between the North, responsible for global warming, and the South, which is the victim of its effects. "Climate finance is not charity. It is a question of justice," stressed Lia Nicholson, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States vulnerable to climate change, also denouncing the refusal of large economies to abandon coal. Forecasts by the UN climate experts panel (IPCC) that the threshold of a 1.5C increase could be reached 10 years earlier than expected, around 2030, are "terrifying" she said, particularly for those on the front line of the climate crisis who are already suffering the consequences in a world that has heated up by about 1.1C. Despite everything, it seems that some are not afraid, or worse, that they are indifferent, she said. Additional reporting Conor Macauley \</doc>

If you want me to actually do something, give me a deadline. If you ask me to do it "soon" or "whenever", I'll remind myself to do it, tell you I'll do it, apologise for not doing it, do everything besides it and just generally make my own life hell over having to do it without ever getting it done. Glasgow's COP26 The already lukewarm intention to "phase out" coal wound up as "phase down" by the end of negotiations. We apparently need further dialogue on creating a loss and damage fund for those on the front lines of climate change. These conferences have been happening for decades. How much talking can you do? It's hardly surprising when they allowed nearly 500 fossil fuel lobbyists to attend. Let me repeat that: a conference on climate change invited an entire fossil fuel delegation, bigger than that of any country, in the belief they would have something to add. This climate change stuff is all well and good, but have you ever thought about it from the fossil fuel man's perspective? A man much misunderstood. He's not so bad - you just don't know him like I do. The text agrees current national plans are inadequate to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C and that the 2.4C we're headed toward would be disastrous. This would mean something if it were the first time they had acknowledged it. However, climate change denial is largely a red herring nowadays. There are people who think it's not real, just as there are people who think Elvis walks among us and Jesus Christ has imprinted himself on their kitchen towel. For the vast majority, the problem is mistaking acknowledgement for action. The Glasgow deal creates a regulated global carbon trading market where rich countries can pay poorer ones to cut emissions on their behalf. This is a level of creative accounting that would make Al Capone baulk. COP26 's laggard countries had the honesty to say they don't want to cut emissions. Pushing for ambitious targets and then finding ways to "meet" them without changing anything in one's own country is PR nonsense we can't afford. At best, carbon trading stalls progress. The economies that most need to decarbonise are not changing their own infrastructure but someone else's and are not cutting emissions but relying on speculative calculations that enough trees will eventually put things right. At worst, the projects that "offset" emissions are terrible news for indigenous communities. Even if a hydroelectric dam is theoretically good for the environment, if its building violently displaces those who fiercely protect natural resources it's a backward step. While finding plenty of seats for the humble, much-maligned fossil fuel men, COP26 made less space for those whose lives have already been ruined by "offsetting" projects. Politicians will continue to call things "carbon neutral" when they mean "quite a lot of carbon, balanced by the miscellaneous suffering of those who can't vote for me". Then there's the embarrassing semantic faff over temperature rises. The final text pushes for staying "well below" 2C. The amount of post-mortem commentary accompanying this "well" would abash a Leaving Cert student wringing an essay out of one half-remembered line from a poem. Those wishing to paint COP26 as a success are trying to pinpoint a decimal point - 1.7, 1.6? It's subjective, which is why they should have named a target. Anything above 1.5C is choosing to sacrifice untold lives so the rich can stay rich. Each decimal place represents entire species vanishing and more cities sinking into the sea. What's easy to forget is that 1.5C of warming is already a hideous compromise. Even our current 1.1C is. Already we've accepted a world where wildfires and floods are commonplace. We can't get leaders to commit to not destroying the planet any more than we already have, and they are congratulating themselves on nuances of the word "well". The agreement represents progress on past talks. It's the first global text on climate change to directly advocate phasing out fossil fuels. However, these talks progress far more slowly than climate change itself. More has changed in the past decade than a couple of adverbs and the possibility that burning coal might, in fact, be bad. The fossil fuel delegates must have left the conference happy. COP26 has kept their dream alive. \</doc>

Nicola Sturgeon has called on the British prime minister to return to Cop26 to help push the world on to a path "where we avoid climate catastrophe". As the UN climate talks in Glasgow enter their final scheduled day, Scotland's First Minister said Boris Johnson should use his position to "really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them". Talks went on through the night and a new draft deal was produced on Friday morning, however discussions look set to overrun from their scheduled finish time of 6pm. Ms Sturgeon has urged Mr Johnson to return to the talks once again following a brief visit on Wednesday, during which he urged leaders not to sit on their hands as the world asks them to act. Advertisement She told BBC Breakfast: "My message to the prime minister is come back here. Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them. "Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that. "The reason I'm singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we're in the UK - well, it is actually because we're in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK government." Ms Sturgeon said the new draft deal is "slightly better" but it "still has way to go". She added: "On the upside, there's a clear recognition that 1.5C is the goal in terms of limiting global warming. There seems to be movement on adaptation finance, there is wording on loss and damage.

So hopefully we'll see that change.

She later tweeted: "There's still time in the final hours of # COP26 to make the outcome better and give us a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - which for many across the world is the difference between survival and extinction. Let's see the political will and determination to deliver." Meanwhile she told Sky News she would not bet on Friday being the last day of the summit. She said: "I certainly hope that finishing at 6pm tonight, which is the plan, would be possible. "Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow. That's not unusual at Cop, so nobody should read anything particular into that if it does happen." \</doc>

With negotiations at the United Nation's COP26 climate summit moving towards an end game, the focus will once more be on the potential for a deal in Glasgow. The HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2021/1110/1258954-cop26-glasgow/ publication of a draft communique yesterday led to a gear change as parties began shuttle diplomacy around the text. It was described as an ambitious opening offer, one Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said should be built on in a final deal. The momentum was given a boost with news that China and the United States, the two single biggest emitters, had agreed to work hard to tackle climate issues over the next decade. Others saw it as an important statement of intent which could help the negotiations at the global climate summit. The UK, which is hosting the conference, is insisting it will close proceedings tomorrow with a view to reaching a consensus. The negotiations may run over into the weekend, but at some point in the coming days 197 participants will be asked if they are prepared to sign up to an agreement. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories The draft also calls for long term "net zero" plans, as well as action on climate finance, helping poorer countries adapt to the impacts of global warming and to address the loss and damage they will inevitably suffer. And it calls for an acceleration of phasing out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels, a first for such a UN text, although that is likely to be getting major pushback from some quarters as negotiating teams consider the draft, and will likely be lost from the final text. Today, Denmark and Costa Rica are set to announce an alliance focused on phasing out oil and gas. Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century but countries' plans for this decade leave the world well off track. New analysis this week warned existing plans up to 2030 put the world on track for 2.4C of warming, well above the goals internationally agreed in the Paris accord to curb temperature rises to "well below" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C. \</doc>

Twelve days of crunch talks on the climate crisis get under way at COP26 in Glasgow on Sunday. This week we have been hearing from several young people who are sharing their messages to world leaders attending the crucial summit. Today, we hear from 17-year-old Max Fulham from Artane in Dublin. Max is calling on world leaders to "think global but act local" in the fight against climate change. He said: "We saw immense urgency in how we reacted to Covid-19 and we need to bring that urgency to the climate crisis. "We need a global response with steps we can take on a local level. It's the small steps that make a large difference." Max, who is visually impaired, is passionate about the concept of creating 'liveable cities' that benefit the people living in them, and also have positive effects on the environment. He says he often walks into obstacles on the street such as electricity boxes, out of sequence bollards and uneven ground. He is calling for "smarter planning decisions" that would make cities safer for people with disabilities and give him some of his independence back. "A liveable city ties in with the climate crisis in my mind, as a city that is sustainable and provides for the needs of people over a long duration of time," Max said. "If we have a city that's not a congested concrete jungle, it's going to lead to a healthier lifestyle for the people that live in it." "The steps we take to have a more liveable city will have big impact on the climate crisis. The small steps like more affordable, frequent and accessible public transport will have major implications and create less emissions," he explained. A big part of the liveable city concept is creating green spaces and outdoor areas for people to socialise in and use for exercise. Max says this is a win-win for the community and the environment as it will also lead to "increased biodiversity and carbon removal from the environment, which is so important". \</doc>

The Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan, has said there has not been enough progress made at the United Nations COP26 conference as he arrived at the Glasgow event. He was able to travel to Scotland after an initial positive Covid-19 test was overturned by a subsequent result. An initial PCR test, taken on Friday, had returned a positive result, leading to him to cancel his travel plans. However, a follow-up test indicated that he did not have the virus. Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Ryan said he was very glad to be able to attend and hoped Ireland could bring influence to bear through its membership of the European Union negotiating team. Mr Ryan said getting support for developing countries was an important part of the work he hoped to do this week. He said he hoped "momentum" could be built through the week towards a deal. "There hasn't been enough progress to date either here or at the 25 preceding COPs. The non-governmental bodies were right to call that out at the marches at the weekend. So we\' ve got to be impatient for more progress," he said. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Read more climate coverage During the coming week, environment, energy and climate ministers will focus on reaching a conclusive agreement on measures to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C degrees from pre-industrial levels. The political negotiations will also seek to include financial support for poorer countries to cope with climate change. After a rest day yesterday, delegates will be back at the negotiations in Glasgow. When the world leaders left, it fell to national negotiators to try and make progress. Today, the politicians are back in town to assess how it is going. Climate and environment ministers from around the world will travel to give political oversight to the process. The UK, which is hosting this climate summit, is trying to keep the momentum up. It has asked countries to close off as many issues as possible so that an agreement can be reached by the close of the summit on Friday. Observers think that timetable is likely to slip, as 197 parties try to get consensus on several tricky areas around finance and emissions cuts. \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has been accused of a "cop out" on commitments made at Cop26 before "the ink is dry on the agreement". At the climate conference in Glasgow this week, Ireland signed up to a global pledge to limit methane emissions by 30 per cent compared with 2020 levels. But the Government has indicated that the pledge will not be included in Ireland's forthcoming carbon budgets, which will target a 10 per cent cut in methane, as well as larger reductions in other gas emissions. \~ Speaking during Leaders' Questions in the D\'e1il, she said: "The omens are not good, it has to be said. "Yesterday you said Ireland would sign a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent, before hastily adding that this was a global target and not a national one. Advertisement"We hear the climate action plan contains a target of just 10 per cent reduction and the T\'e1naiste also used this 10 per cent figure yesterday. "Can you explain the purpose of publicly signing up to a 30 per cent reduction target, when it seems you have no intention of even even attempting to achieve that?" Ms Shorthall said that if every country took that approach there would be "zero chance" the targets would be met. "Why are you making commitments at Cop that you cop out of as soon as the ink is dry on the agreement?" she asked. Responding, Mr Martin insisted the Cop26 agreement of a 30 per cent reduction in methane is a global target, towards which individual countries will have to contribute. He accused Ms Shorthall of an "abundance of negativity". \~ He said: "You seem to persistently want to seek to undermine what are genuine and transformative decisions by this Government to step-change our response to climate change, which we have done through the climate action legislation, through the establishment of the climate council and the carbon budgeting that will occur. "On the global methane pledge, I think the deputy is being somewhat disingenuous here. "Read the pledge. Read what people have signed up to. It is a global pledge. Advertisement"So globally, collectively, in different ways and through different mechanisms, countries who sign up will contribute to that overall 30 per cent global reduction in methane." Mr Martin said the Government's climate action plan will "deal with every sector", including energy, transport, agriculture, land use and deforestation. Ms Shorthall also asked the Taoiseach for clarity on plans to cull the national herd as part of Ireland's climate goals. She noted that the Green Party has called for a reduction in size, while members of the other coalition parties, Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael, have "mysteriously started to use the phrase "stabilisation". Mr Martin did not respond to the question despite repeated requests from Ms Shorthall. \</doc>

OR two weeks, Cop26 grabbed headlines around the world. As someone who has been to too many of these annual climate summits, I was pleasantly surprised that people were finally interested in what they were about and why I was there. For years, friends and family wondered why I abandoned my family for two weeks at a time to attend Cops around the world, but there was little curiosity about what the event was all about. This is hardly surprising given they are highly technical discussions about gases, risks, and financial flows and there was little media coverage to shine a light on proceedings. From years participating as a climate negotiator and later as an adviser to the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, I had managed expectations of the Glasgow summit. Cop26 was never going to save the world, but it did need to get a lot of technical work done to make the Paris Agreement operational and to step up national pledges to get the world on track to keep global warming to the 1.5C target. It also needed to show the countries, communities, and people least responsible for causing climate change and most impacted by it that world leaders cared about their plight, recognised that it was unfair, and were prepared to provide funding to help them to cope with climate impacts and losses of life, livelihood, and culture. Did we achieve this Only in part. We are not on track for 1.5C - more like 2.4C when the new alliances and pledges are added up - and, as Mary Robinson reminds us, that is bad news for anyone under 60. A planet that is on average 2C warmer than it was before we started burning coal is unliveable for many and unsafe for all. The Glasgow text does recognise that the 1.5C temperature target is safer than the well below 2C also included in the Paris Agreement, and that reaching that goal is so urgent that countries will submit new national pledges next year instead ofwaiting another four to five years to update them. It did finalise the Paris Rulebook - for example, rules on transparency and reporting allow countries to see that other countries are doing what they said they would do on emissions cuts and funding provision. The political text named coal and fossil fuel subsidies as part of the problem for the first time, which shows how much the obvious gets obscured in compromising language designed to keep everyone happy. It is "absolute insanity", as John Kerry stated, that while we lack funds for climate finance, we pay (EURO)9.6m per minute globally subsidising an industry that is killing What is the role of Cop We hold Cops to create international law and a common framework for action on a global scale. This is a slow process due to the need for consensus, and the influence of geopolitics and vested interests. But the real action happens at national level, where the speed of change can be faster. This is where we all come in. Legislators, civil servants, business owners, accountants, teachers, community volunteers, retirees, parents, and students - we all have a role to play between now and the next Cop to show that Ireland can be a leader, that we will deliver our commitment to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030 and provide support to the most vulnerable countries to help them to cope with climate impacts and transform their economies. Living without polluting This will mean lots of change: Old habits broken and new habits formed, hard decisions about household purchases, business decisions that fundamentally change how we work, and learning for everyone on how to live life without causing pollution. The change needed to halt global warming will also make Ireland and our communities better. If done well, it will end homelessness and make houses cosy and cheaper to run, it will make walking and cycling safe, reduce congestion, clean our water and our air. We will be more connected to our neighbours, work less, share and repair instead of shopping and owning, then throwing away. We are the human beings who make daily decisions that do or do not contribute to climate change, but we cannot solve the problem on our own. We also need leadership from the top, from the Government through policies and financial supports and from the corporates that provide the goods and services we need. They have responsibility to provide the leadership and infrastructure we need to be able to change. Sustainable choices must be convenient and affordable. But we will also need the skills, the knowledge, and the motivation to change. People do not care about something they do not understand. This is where communication, public engagement, and participation come in. For people to change, they need to have a voice and a role in decision making. They have to shape the vision of what we aspire to, feel part of, and have ownership for the transformation we are going to make. Make climate action about people This is a people thing. Government policies without citizen support will not work. Corporate policies without engaged employees will not be implemented. For change to happen, we have to bring people with us on this unprecedented endeavour; to make a better Ireland and to lead on the international stage to create a safer and fairer world. Investing from today in people is a key strategy that underpins our ability to meet the targets in the Climate Action Plan. We need to learn from the past and listen, enable two-way communication, and take the time to build understanding and support for a new Ireland - an Ireland with abundant renewable energy, that produces quality food, has an educated and skilled workforce, a great quality of rural and urban life plus one that is renowned worldwide for its spectacular wild places and pristine nature. Who wouldn't want that? Cop26 elevated our national and dinner table conversation on climate change. We have to keep talking about it in order to create the critical mass, the excitement, and the resolve to get it under control. If you love nature, your children, your family, your work, or your mates, then solving the climate crisis is for you. Do not stand on the side lines and wait for someone else to lead. Figure out why it is important to you. Then engage those around you to figure out what you can do at work, in your neighbourhood, or where you volunteer. You are the most powerful influencer of your friends, family, and colleagues. Do not let that power go to waste.  Tara Shine is director of Change by Degrees \</doc>

LAST Thursday, China revealed that its coal miners had achieved an all-time record by digging up 12.4million tonnes in one week. Just two days later, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases reduced COP26 's Alok Sharma to tears, refusing to 'phase out' coal in the final summit agreement. Yesterday, green campaigners hailed some modest successes, such as pledges to reduce methane. But China - whose president, Xi Jinping, did not even turn up - is building coal-fired power stations at a rate of knots and its £greement' with America to 'cooperate' on global warming lacked any substance. An answer for this apparent lack of concern lies in Hidden Hand: How The Chinese Communist Party Is Reshaping The World, by Clive Hamilton and Mareike Ohlberg. This book argues that China has extended its influence over democracies to blind them to Beijing's power drive. China, the book says, seduces politicians, business people, academics and campaigners into supporting China's aims. China, says Hamilton, regards them as 'useful idiots' - unwitting aids in the country's bid to be the world's only superpower. EVIDENCE unearthed by the Mail, working with researchers fluent in Mandarin, shows that Western environmentalists have indeed become a target. The documents suggest they are enmeshed with bodies totally subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and staffed by figures from its most ruthless departments. They include Xie Xenhua, China's chief climate envoy. Until 2012, he was in the Central Commission For Discipline Inspection - and according to Human Rights Watch, this body has been responsible for countless cases of illegal detention, torture and forced confessions. When Xie spoke at COP26 , it might have been sensible to bear this unsavoury fact in mind. I asked Hidden Hand author Hamilton if China's wooing of Western greens explains why its actions have aroused so little protest. He believes it could. Take, for example, Professor Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Centre on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, and British government adviser. Having taught in China since 1998, in 2014, Stern wrote a paper for the World Economic Forum claiming China was 'emerging as a global leader in climate policy'. His co-author was He Jiankun of Beijing's Tsinghua University. The university is Xi Jinping's alma mater, and home to labs conducting research for the People's Liberation Army. Jiankun also serves as 'counsellor' to China's top administrative body, the State Council. Stern was just one of several prominent British environmentalists who joined top CCP officials at September's China Council For International Co-operation On Environment And Development. According to the conference report, the foreigners present praised 'China's new and greater contributions to promoting the construction of a clean and beautiful world'. They included British, European and US environmental crusaders, including representatives of the London-based green legal charity ClientEarth, and the WWF, the president of which is Prince Charles. Another was Kate Hampton, chief executive of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF). HAMPTON told the conference she 'supported Chinese leadership on setting the global path'. In May, she addressed a Beijing investment forum, praising China's 'determination to phase out coal' - the very phrase vetoed by envoy Xie Zhenua at the COP. What's more, Hampton is co-chair of the board of the Belt And Road International Green Development Coalition, which is funded and run by China's environment ministry. This is an offshoot of President Xi Jinping's Belt And Road Initiative, a vast international investment programme which Chinese leaders have said is the means by which China will supplant America. China expert Hamilton remains unconvinced by its attempts to claim green supremacy. He said: 'China's government is cynical and ruthless. Yet Western environmentalists wander around telling us China is building a harmonious and beautiful world for all. Seriously?' \</doc>

Tomorrow, the curtains will rise on the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow. It is neither our last best chance to tackle climate change - as some suggest - nor just another talking shop. It will bring high-level political attention as well as media focus to the climate crisis, but will also make clear the gap between what we need to do and what we have achieved so far. The need to take transformative action to combat the climate crisis has never been clearer. We have seen unprecedented weather extremes across the world this year, from flooding in Germany and China, to forest fires in the US Pacific northwest. For those of us living in the developed world, climate change is no longer a far-away problem in space or time. It is here and now. But this is just a taste of what vulnerable communities on the front lines of climate change in developing countries have been experiencing for years. At the heart of the climate crisis is a deep injustice: those least responsible for causing climate change through greenhouse gas emissions are on the front lines of the impacts of the climate crisis. This tension between rich and poor countries will loom large over the Glasgow conference. The latest scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in August, presented the danger we face in the starkest terms yet. It was described as a code red for humanity by UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Urgent and transformative change is required, and yet global emissions of greenhouse gases have continued to rise inexorably. What should we expect of the Glasgow summit? This is the 26th such gathering - the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Each year, the annual UN climate gathering brings together representatives of governments, business and civil society. In some respects, it is a talking shop. But talking matters. These annual conferences provide a forum for negotiations among representatives of the governments of the world. It provides a context within which countries can make reciprocal pledges of climate action. This is important for a collective action problem like climate change, where countries want to know that they are not going it alone. Attention of world leaders Perhaps more importantly, the annual UN climate conferences draw the attention of world leaders, civil society, business and wider society to the climate crisis. The world's media will descend on Glasgow for the next two weeks and will bring much-needed public attention to climate change. Cop26 will also shine a light on the inadequacy of our action to date and the need to ramp up both ambition but also, crucially, implementation. It provides an opportunity for civil society mobilisation around the need for stronger climate action. The UK presidency has made the goal of "keeping 1.5 degrees alive" central to its agenda for Cop26 . This is a reference to the Paris Agreement's commitment to limit warming to well below 2 degrees, and if possible below 1.5 degrees. Under the terms of the agreement, countries agreed to publicly declare their climate commitments through what are known as "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs). They agreed that, every five years, they would review and update these climate pledges. Last year's deadline for updating these national climate pledges was pushed into this year because of the pandemic. This five-year review is a large part of what gives the Glasgow summit added political significance. Genuinely more ambitious The UN Environment Programme has assessed these new national pledges. Its 2021 Emissions Gap Report, published earlier this week, indicated that if all currently announced climate pledges are implemented effectively, global heating will reach 2.7 degrees by the end of the 21st century - far above even the higher 2 degree goal. Worryingly, it reported that less than half of the updated NDCs submitted in advance of the Glasgow conference are genuinely more ambitious than those submitted first time around. The report identified two gaps: an ambition gap and an implementation gap. Countries are not pledging strong enough targets, but they are also not doing enough to implement the targets they have pledged. This tells us that too few countries consider climate change to be core to their self-interest. In too many countries around the world, climate change has yet to assume the centrality and urgency it warrants in national policymaking. Too often, the debate emphasises the costs of climate action, underplaying or ignoring completely the costs of inaction as well as the benefits of transitioning away from fossil fuels. Against this backdrop, Cop26 provides an opportunity to focus the attention of world leaders on the climate crisis. It gives civil society a focal point to pressure governments to live up to their obligations under the Paris Agreement. But if we frame Cop26 as the last best chance for change, we risk dooming it to failure before it has even commenced. Instead, we should see it as the latest staging post on the journey to a cleaner, more sustainable world. Viewing Cop26 Whatever the outcome of the conference, the real work will begin when Cop26 delegates return home. Lofty targets announced in the glare of the world's media are only as good as the subsequent efforts to implement them. Dr Diarmuid Torney is an associate professor in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University and co-director of the DCU Centre for Climate & Society. \</doc>

DOZENS of world leaders, business chiefs and eco-activists faced allegations of hypocrisy yesterday for taking private jets or domestic flights to Glasgow while telling the rest of the world to cut their carbon footprint. Culprits included billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Hours after telling delegates at Cop26 that the conference 'can and must mark the beginning of the end' of the climate change catastrophe, Mr Johnson admitted he would fly home to London from Glasgow rather than travel by rail. His revelation came after Mr Bezos's (EURO)56.5million Gulf Stream private jet was pictured landing in Glasgow - flying in from Rome where he had discussed the climate crisis with Prince Charles. Pri- vate jets are the world's highest carbonemitting form of transport. Prince Charles himself was among those who travelled by non-commercial plane after attending the G20 summit in Rome. However, a spokesman for Clarence House said the flight made use of 'sustainable aviation fuel'. Critics said the move showed a 'complete lack of preparedness for the wholesale switch away from fossil fuel cars that we require'. Mr Biden addressed the summit claiming the US 'would lead by the power of example' in the fight against climate change - after driving from Edinburgh to Glasgow in a 20-car motorcade. Mr Biden arrived in Edinburgh yesterday on Air Force One, and was accompanied by three other planes and the Marine One helicopter. On landing, an enormous motorcade including 'the Beast' presidential vehicle, a number of Range Rovers and Chevrolet SUVs carried the presidential party to Glasgow's Scottish Event Campus. If all the vehicles are petrol-run, estimates show they will have pumped out 360kg of carbon over the 40-mile journey. It is estimated the entire journey for the President could generate up to 2.2milmercial lion pounds of carbon. Prince Albert of Monaco and representatives from the Bank of America also used private jets to fly to the conference, while the likes of German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron made use of official government aircraft. It was estimated that as many as 400 private jets arrived for the conference. Conservative predictions suggest the fleet would emit 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in total. Many arrived from cities such as London, Stockholm, Rome and Brussels, which are served by com- routes. Last night Labour's environment spokesman Luke Pollard said world leaders should be 'leading by example'. 'People have sympathy for world leaders flying in from the other side of the world but those coming domestically should be coming by train,' he said. 'The idea the Prime Minister will fly home from Cop26 after flying from London to Cornwall for the G7 smacks of being out of touch. 'In terms of Mr Bezos, if you want to have credibility in the debate, you have to not only be decarbonising your company, you should be demonstrating your commitment with your own actions, especially when you are one of the richest people on the planet.' Mr Johnson's official spokesman defended the sight of hundreds of private jets flying in, saying it was important for leaders to meet face to face for such important talks. HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ie news@dailymail.ie Belching out fumes, Biden's 20-vehicle motorcade 1. MERCEDES SPRINTER MINIBUS The convoy includes two, both believed to transport members of the press accompanying US president Joe Biden. They emit around 3.75kg of CO2 per mile and get around 14.5 miles per gallon. The average for cars is around 38mpg, research shows. 2. PRESIDENT'S LIMO, AKA 'THE BEAST' The convoy includes two of these Cadillacs: Mr Biden's vehicle and a decoy. Each one reportedly emits around 4kg of carbon per mile - ten times more than an average car. The Beast can achieve a measly eight miles per gallon. 3. SECRET SERVICE CHEVROLET SUBURBAN Mr Biden's convoy appears to have at least two of the specially made vehicles. Reports suggest it has a 6.2-litre, V-8 engine which is about 420 horsepower. It achieves about 15-21 miles per gallon, depending on conditions. These are likely to carry secret service and security personnel. 4. 2018 JAGUAR With a UK registration, the vehicle is believed to belong to the welcoming British police escorts. The car, thought to be an XJ, emits around 2.75kg of carbon per mile. It has a gas-guzzling three-litre diesel engine. Cleric sorry for Nazi analogy THE Archbishop of Canterbury was forced to apologise yesterday after claiming world leaders who fail to act on climate change could be worse than those who ignored the Nazis. Archbishop Justin Welby, right, suggested politicians who shirked the task of limiting global warming would £llow genocide on an infinitely greater scale' than that committed by Hitler's regime. He later issued an 'unequivocal apology' to Jewish people over the comment, admitting that it was 'not right' to make comparisons with the Nazis. The remark came during an interview with the BBC in which he said that world leaders at the COP26 summit would be 'cursed if they don't get this right'. Asked about his use of the term 'cursed', he said he had 'consciously' used the word, adding: 'People will speak of them in far stronger terms than we speak today of the politicians of the '30s - of the politicians who ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany. 'This will kill people... for generations, and we will have no means of averting it.' He later issued an 'unequivocal apology', saying he had been trying to 'emphasise the gravity of the situation facing us at COP26 '. US TV network CNN was mocked yesterday for suggesting the COP26 summit was happening in Edinburgh, not Glasgow. 'I'm now reporting from Edinburgh in Scotland where 20,000 world leaders and delegates have gathered for the COP26 Climate Summit,' wrote presenter Wolf Blitzer alongside a tweeted photo of a temporary studio in the Scottish capital below its famous castle. Opticians Specsavers joined in the online derision, changing the tag line of an advert to: 'Should've gone to Glasgow.' CNN later clarified that it does have cameras in Glasgow for the summit in addition to its base in Edinburgh, where US president Joe Biden is staying. Greta lets loose with F-word GRETA Thunberg denounced world leaders for failing to act on climate change in a foulmouthed tirade to fellow COP26 protesters yesterday. Repeating her 'blah blah blah' dismissal of politicians made at a youth summit in September, the 18-year-old activist said heads of government were not doing enough to save the planet from disaster. Ms Thunberg, who arrived in Glasgow by train, told a protest: 'No more blah blah blah, no more whatever the f they are doing inside there. This COP26 is so far just like the previous COPs and that led us nowhere. They have led us nowhere. Inside COP, there are just politicians and people in power pretending to take our future seriously, pretending to take the present seriously. Change is not going to come from inside there.' British prime minister Boris Johnson referenced Ms Thunberg at the conference, saying: 'When it comes to tackling climate change, words, blah blah blah, without action, without deeds, are absolutely pointless.' \</doc>

PRINCE Charles, with characteristic frankness, recently expressed his understanding of why radical climate change campaigners like Insulate Britain take to the streets to demand action. Insulate Britain, a breakaway from Extinction Rebellion, has blocked major motorways in England, causing massive traffic hold-ups and widespread anger from frustrated motorists. While he carefully stressed that blocking roads "isn't helpful", the prince understood the frustration of the protesters and insisted they should do things in a way that doesn't alienate people. He said they "should direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive, rather than destructive". Prince Charles colourfully described the forthcoming Cop26 Glasgow climate change summit as "the last-chance saloon" for the international community. He bluntly stated, if serious action wasn't taken, it would be catastrophic. He added: "Nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather." It is refreshing to hear such a passionate warning by a non-politician like Prince Charles on such a critical problem as climate change. His views were well thought out and skilfully expressed. He sensitively reflected on the enormous challenges facing the world and the immediate action required to be taken by governments right across the globe at the Cop26 summit, beginning on Halloween. His timely warning is similar to the intervention by another non-politician, Pope Francis, whose time in office has been marked by his emphasis on what he has termed "an integral ecology". His inspirational encyclical, Laudato Si, published in 2015, highlighted his commitment to dealing with the enormous challenges of environmental degradation and global warming. In that seminal document he emphasised the moral duty of Christians, in particular, to cherish the Earth, which God has given to mankind to look after as his stewards. In Rome two weeks ago, together with several other religious leaders, both Christian and non-Christian, Pope Francis signed a joint appeal to the world's governments to commit to ambitious targets at the Cop26 meeting. The pontiff and the other religious leaders jointly declared: "Care for the environment is a moral imperative to preserve God's creation for future generations." Sombrely, they warned us: "We have inherited a garden. We must not leave a desert to our children." Collectively, the leaders have pressed the need for the developed economies, which in effect have brought about global warming and the subsequent climate emergency, to provide financial support to the most vulnerable economies. But for the ordinary man or woman in the street, though distantly aware of the imminent meeting in Glasgow, the question is: what can be achieved by this much-heralded summit? The simple answer is time is running out, as the window for opportunity for action on climate change is narrowing at an increasing speed. We have all witnessed on our TV screens this year incidents of extreme weather, causing widespread destruction and death across Europe, Asia and America. In August the United Nations published an expert panel report on climate change that concluded there is unequivocal evidence human activity is already changing the world in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described it as "code red for humanity". Therefore, Cop26 is a vital opportunity to make good and build upon the pledges on climate change made at Cop21 in Paris in 2015. Almost 200 nations signed a binding treaty to hold global average temperature rises to well below 2 degrees centigrade, compared to pre-industrial levels, and try to limit rises to 1.5 degrees centigrade. Specific pledges were made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These commitments are acknowledged to be insufficient, therefore it is necessary to revisit them in order to ratchet them upwards. Unfortunately, despite the Paris commitments, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. The primary aim is to plot a way forward to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The UK, EU and the US have all pledged to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030. But other major countries like China, Russia, Australia and India have yet to agree improved reductions. Cop26 are immensely challenging and its success will only be measured by the commitment of states to fulfil their pledges. Meanwhile, the future of the world hangs in the balance. And, as Prince Charles has suggested, we really are in "the last-chance saloon". \</doc>

The Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow has continued, with a markedly more upbeat tone after world leaders issuing stark warnings over the cost of failure for the future of the planet. Among the initiatives hailed by world leaders was a declaration by 100 countries - including Brazil - to halt and reverse deforestation. Meanwhile, protests continued outside the Scottish Event Campus in the city as some of the most powerful people in the world gathered inside.

Billions of dollars to restore the natural world have been promised during the first week of Cop26 , with Alok Sharma describing it as humanity's "first line of defence" against the climate crisis. Day six of the climate summit was all about championing nature as the first phase of the negotiations are finalised. While politicians and diplomats battle to come up with a viable plan to limit global warming to 1.5C, here is a look at the habitats they could be the key to saving us from disaster. Forests An agreement on forests was one of the early breakthroughs of the summit, with 110 countries - including Brazil - signing a declaration to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Trees remove carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis - locking it in their trucks, leaf systems and also in the soil - and the UK is aiming to boast tree cover from 10.1 per cent to 12 per cent by 2050.

But peatland in poor condition can become a major source of greenhouse gasses, research by Bangor University found the 2.6 million hectares of degraded peat in the UK emit 23 million tonnes of carbon a year - or 5 per cent of UK emissions. Sustainable Agriculture Modern agriculture can have a hugely detrimental impact on soil and water quality through use of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides. Farmers are being encouraged to restore hedgerows, plant trees and leave space for wildflowers on their land to boost biodiversity, reduce pollutants leeching into waterways and reduce flood risk.

Seagrass Underwater forests of seagrass draw down huge volumes of carbon dioxide, locking it into the seabed, while simultaneously stabilising sediment, filtering water and providing a vital nursery for young fish. Seagrass accounts for an estimated 15 per cent of the ocean's carbon storage capacity, according to the Wildlife Trust, but huge swathes have been lost to dredging, trawler fishing and pollution. Experts estimate the UK has lost 44 per cent of its seagrasses since the 1930s and there are now several programmes attempting to painstakingly replant this habitat around our coastline. - Saltmarsh Saltmarshes not only store carbon, they also provide mitigation against extreme weather by acting as a huge flood defence. Like peatland, dead saltmarsh plant life does not decompose and instead becomes buried beneath layers of sediment, effectively trapping the carbon in the mud. Advertisement Located along low-lying coastline, they also act as a buffer against tidal surges, reducing the risk of flooding and damage from heavy storms and tidal waves. In the other direction, saltmarshes act as a sponge to filter out herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers from agricultural runoff, reducing the volumes of pollution reaching the ocean. \</doc>

E ARLIER this week at COP26 , former US president Barack Obama urged young people to "stay angry" in the fight against climate change. On the last day of what was billed as our last opportunity to do something meaningful to rescue our planet, the lamentable efforts of global leaders can only have further fuelled their fury. The planet's rising temperatures, sea levels, droughts and threats of famine have said all that needed to be said. Radical action was required. Not the tepid commitments and scaling back from the high-blown hopes. The "real green revolution" needed to halt greenhouse gas emissions, regenerate nature and adapt to the realities of the worsening climate crisis is sadly still awaited. The commitments from governments to stop global average temperatures to rising 1.5C above what they were in the pre-industrial era seem insufficient. Most damning of all, they argued the level of business interests represented at the summit amounted to "corporate capture". The conference, they conclude, was undermined. The softening of resolve to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely was clearly disappointing. Just as the arguments over how much money rich nations owe poorer ones for contaminating Earth's atmosphere were depressing. But haggling over how often to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the UN was downright disgraceful by governments in the last chance saloon as the clock ticks down. Given past experience, expectations of delivering the sweeping deal demanded were arguably too high. Past promises on climate change and declarations should have prepared us for the yawning chasm between intention and implementation. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had set the bar for world leaders to make progress. What must be done, he said, was to find a way to move the world closer to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But such a goal seems highly unlikely. "The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging - but they are far from enough," a deflated Mr Guterres said. If Glasgow will be remembered for anything it may be for the fact the world's two biggest emitters - the United States and China - banded together to declare their joint commitment to reach a deal. Time will tell, After all the lofty talk, the poetry of the prime ministers' and presidents' speeches of the opening days was brought down to earth with a bang in the flat prose of technical groups. The opportunity to do something meaningful was mugged as material self-interests asserted themselves. And what might have been a showcase for the spirit of global solidarity was reduced to another well-intentioned grand pageant. Academics' open letter deemed the much trumpeted Glasgow summit to be a 'failure' \</doc>

Britain will likely run a North Sea offshore oil and gas licensing round for existing discoveries this year, a spokesperson for the country's Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) said. The OGA, which is changing its name to the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), can hold the licensing round as soon as the British government has completed its work on a new climate compatibility framework for oil and gas production, it said. Britain is expected to publish a plan next week on how to boost domestic energy supplies to try to tackle spiralling prices and reduce the amount of imported oil and gas from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. COP26 Britain last awarded oil and gas licences in 2020. The new round would focus on acreage where data has already shown that hydrocarbons exist, the OGA spokesperson said. They added that it was too early to give further details on which blocks might be offered. The UK government is also, reportedly, preparing to step in and temporarily run Russian gas giant Gazprom's British retail supply arm.

The fourth day of the conference hoped to sound the death knell of coal, while experts warned the future is bleak unless we rapidly step up efforts to adapt to climate change. Meanwhile, climate activists said they are getting fed up of being fobbed off with a pat on the head and Pikachu piled pressure on Japan. Coal 'no longer king' More than 40 countries have agreed to end all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally, and transition rapidly to clean energy. Among the nations to sign up the statements are 18 that have never made a similar pledge, including Poland, Vietnam and Chile. Cop26 president Alok Sharma said the agreement was proof "coal is no longer king", adding: "I am pleased to say that coal financing has been well and truly choked off."

Representatives from nearly 200 countries will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, from 31 October to 12 November for COP26 climate talks, which aims to strengthen action to tackle global warming under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Amid extreme weather events around the world and following a United Nations' climate report which warned that global warming was close to spiralling out of control, the actions of governments at this conference will determine whether it is a success. Here are some of the issues which need to be resolved: Emissions cut pledges Six years ago in Paris, countries agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius and, ideally, 1.5C. To do this, emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 and reach net-zero by around mid-century. As the UN conference was postponed last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year is the deadline for countries to make steeper emissions cut pledges (called nationally determined contributions or NDCs). But the available NDCs of all 191 parties of the Paris Agreement combined equate to a 16% increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 compared to 2010, it said. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate news Around 120 countries have so far submitted revised NDCs, but there is a lack of consistency with no common timeframe for realising pledges. There are also a variety of approaches in the NDCs, making comparability difficult. Negotiators also need to agree on common timeframes for future emissions cuts. Major emitters China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - together responsible for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions - have not yet come forward with strengthened NDCs and need to do so at this conference. Finance As far back as 2009, developed countries agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change. However, the most recent data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that in 2019, developed nations' governments raised $79.6 billion for vulnerable countries, up 2% from $78.3 billion in 2018. As rich nations are not meeting the $100 billion a year goal, it can break down trust at the climate talks, experts say. A new finance goal needs to be worked out for 2025 onwards. Loss and damage Governments agreed to address the impact of climate change on developing countries but there is no detail about liability or compensation, a bone of contention for many poorer countries. A platform to enable technical assistance for vulnerable countries was established in 2019, but developing nations want a more robust mechanism to include financing. Fossil Fuels The UK COP26 president, Alok Sharma, has said he wants this conference to be the one where coal power is consigned to history. The UN has called for phasing out coal by 2030 in OECD countries, but environment ministers from the Group of 20 big economies have failed to agree a timeline. Article 6 Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which covers the role of carbon markets, has not been resolved since the pact was struck. Progress on it broke down at the last talks in 2019. The article calls for "robust accounting" to avoid "double counting" of emissions reductions. It also aims to establish a central UN mechanism to trade carbon credits from emissions reductions generated from low-carbon projects. \</doc>

A fleet of electric vehicles will be deployed for world leaders coming to Glasgow, Scotland for crucial UN climate talks in November, the UK government said. The vehicles will be sourced from existing fleets in the UK to help ensure their carbon footprint remains low. Jaguar Land Rover said it is aiming to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036 and net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039 as part of targets in line with meeting international climate goals. Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: "Jaguar Land Rover is an iconic British brand with a proven track record. Advertisement"They are showing climate leadership in their field with award winning electric vehicles, and I am delighted these will be used by world leaders in Glasgow." Thierry Bollore, Jaguar Land Rover chief executive said:\~"We are delighted to partner with Cop26 and provide a fleet of all-electric vehicles, including Jaguar I-Pace performance SUVs, to deliver zero-emission transport at the summit."

But the bigger picture is how countries are doing on their plans to cut emissions to avoid the most dangerous global warming. The UN has warned nations they are way off track to deliver the kind of emissions cuts over the next decade to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, an ambition agreed by countries under the Paris climate accord in 2015. So when scores of world leaders, including US president Joe Biden and British prime minister Boris Johnson, attend the summit, they will be under pressure to ramp up climate ambition in their national action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Scientists warn the world is already experiencing human-driven climate extremes at current levels of 1.2C of warming above pre-industrial levels. If temperatures go above 1.5C we face significantly more heatwaves, rainstorms, water shortages and drought, greater economic losses and lower crop yields, higher sea levels and greater damage to coral reefs. \</doc>

President Joe Biden has acknowledged that the US and other developed nations bear much of the responsibility for climate change, and said actions taken this decade to contain global warming will be decisive in preventing future generations from suffering. "None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come if we fail to seize this moment," Mr Biden declared at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. The president treated the already visible crisis for the planet - flooding, volatile weather, droughts and wildfires - as a unique opportunity to reinvent the global economy. Standing before world leaders gathered at the UN climate summit in Scotland, he sought to portray the enormous costs of limiting carbon emissions as a chance to create jobs by transitioning to renewable energy and electric vehicles.

"Those of us who are responsible for much of the deforestation and all of the problems we have so far," Mr Biden said, have "overwhelming obligations" to the poorer nations that account for few of the emissions yet are paying a price as the planet has grown hotter. As for Mr Trump's action, he said: "I shouldn't apologise, but I do apologise for the fact the United States, the last administration, pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit." The magnitude of the moment is crashing head-first into complicated global and domestic politics. Biden administration officials have scolded China for failing to commit more to curbing carbon emissions, while the president is still trying to nail down his own climate investments with Congress. The summit is often billed as essential to putting into action the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, which Mr Biden rejoined after becoming president this year.

But Mr Biden and his administration face obstacles in prodding the US and other nations to act fast enough on climate, both abroad and at home. In the run-up to the summit, the administration has tried hard to temper expectations that two weeks of talks involving more than 100 world leaders will produce major breakthroughs on cutting climate-damaging emissions. Rather than a quick fix, "Glasgow is the beginning of this decade race, if you will", Mr Biden's climate envoy John Kerry said. As the summit opens, the United States is still struggling to get some of the world's biggest climate polluters - China, Russia and India - to join the US and its allies in stronger pledges to burn far less coal, gas and oil and to move to cleaner energy. Also on Monday, the Biden administration released its strategy for turning talk into reality in transforming the US into an entirely clean energy nation by 2050. The long-term plan, filed in compliance with the Paris agreement, lays out a United States increasingly running on wind, solar and other clean energy, Americans zipping around in electric vehicles and on mass transit, state-of-the-art technology and wide open spaces carefully preserved to soak up carbon dioxide from the air.

That includes persuading many foreign governments to set more ambitious targets for emissions cuts, promoting a global pledge to cut emissions of a potent climate harm, methane, and the promise from leading economies to end funding for coal energy abroad. Neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese President Xi Jinping is attending the Glasgow summit, although they are sending senior officials. Their refusals, and India's, to move substantially faster to cut their reliance on coal and petroleum threaten to frustrate hopes of reaching the target cuts set in the Paris climate accord. China under Mr Xi has firmed up commitments to cut emissions but at a slower pace than the US has encouraged. \</doc>

THE COP26 climate talks enter their final day with vulnerable countries determined not to let negotiations close without agreement on substantial funding from rich nations. Disagreements over finance stalled progress yesterday, with the attitude of the US and Europe both coming in for criticism from the global south. Among the issues in dispute were the fulfilment of a decade-old pledge to guarantee a high level of annual adaptation funding to help countries climate-proof their economies and infrastructure. The fund moved closer to the $100bn-a-year target during these talks, but the text of a draft agreement calls for that to be scaled up urgently. Disagreement over separate funding for 'loss and damage', which would provide emergency relief and rebuilding funds after climate-related disasters, was more entrenched. Dr Saleelmul Huq of the Bangladesh delegation said rich countries would have to be "shamed" into accepting their responsibilities for building their economies on fossil fuels now putting developing nations in peril. "In Bangladesh we have 10 times bigger floods but nothing to pay for loss and damage. In Europe they are paying for their own citizens but not for ours." Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan agreed the loss and damage issue was causing difficulties. However, he said Ireland's position was that while loss and damage should be funded, a separate funding structure would involve unnecessary replication of bureaucracy. He said some ideas in circulation in the negotiations around how funding could be provided included giving poor countries access to 'special drawing rights' from the International Monetary Fund so they did not have to resort to expensive borrowing. Multiple strands of negotiations were continuing last night, with more fresh draft agreement texts due before a meeting of ministers from all nations at 11am this morning. Aside from finance, the inclusion of a commitment to enhanced efforts on mitigation - cutting emissions to stem global temperature rise - was also causing tensions. It emerged that at one point, a group of 22 nations who are part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, which includes China and India, proposed deleting the entire section on mitigation in protest that developing countries were being asked to make the same percentage emissions cuts as rich nations. Talks president Alok Sharma said in his last press conference of the day: "We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us." Another sticking point was the proposed commitment to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies. Large oil, gas and coal producing countries want to keep supplying the fuels while attempting to offset emissions with technology or natural solutions. Mr Ryan, who earlier in the day signed Ireland up to become a founding member of the new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, said the phaseout text needed to stay in. "I think it's vital that we do keep that language in," he said. "How can we be subsidising something that's edging us closer to the abyss? "That language has to remain strong."

TAOISEACH Micheal Martin is likely to face growing levels of domestic political unrest over climate change during his attendance at the World Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. The World Leaders Summit, which runs from today until tomorrow, will kick off two weeks of discussions between 196 countries and the EU, to secure renewed commitment to global action on Climate Change. This afternoon, the Taoiseach will take part in a World Leaders Summit Action and Solidarity Event, a round table event for leaders, hosted by British prime minister Boris Johnson. Tomorrow, Mr Martin will deliver Ireland's National Statement to the summit, setting out how Ireland is contributing to achievement of the Paris Goals on Climate Change. Speaking ahead of his departure for Glasgow, the Taoiseach said: 'I hope that this week at COP26 we will see a real coming together for global action. Climate change is already a reality in all parts of the world. If we are to leave a habitable planet to future generations we must act now. 'The challenge is big, but I have faith in the capacity of humans to work together to overcome it. Science is leading the way. Leaders must put the right policies in place, as we are doing in Ireland. 'I also hope that COP26 will see a real step forward in climate finance, supporting the most vulnerable countries. The transition must deliver climate justice - nobody should be left behind.' US president Joe Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are among the major figures due to take part. But, in a sign of the global divisions on the issue, the leaders of several major polluting nations have turned down invitations. China's president Xi Jinping, Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro are among the big names who will be missing. And a hoped-for deal to phase out the construction of new coal-fired power stations by 2030 fell apart. Major coal users including China, India, Australia and Russia are said to have blocked the deal. As Ireland faces into a further carbon budget on Thursday, the Taoiseach is facing growing internal unease over the reality of the climate change programme as distinct to the promises. In a politically embarrassing development, two former senior ministers have issued scathing denunciations of the Coalition's much-touted Just Transition policy. The Just Transition is a flagship initiative to deal with the closure of the peat and power industries which are believed to have cost over 2,500 jobs in the Midlands. But former constituency foes Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael and Barry Cowen from Fianna F\'e1il have united to sharply criticise the failure to implement any of the grand schemes, with Mr Flanagan claiming significant elements of the scheme are a 'fiction'. The Government claimed more than (EURO)244million would be allocated for projects in the Midlands including a (EURO)108million Bord na M\'f3na peatlands restoration project to facilitate the move from £ brown to green economy', (EURO)77million from the EU Just Transition Fund and (EURO)20million to the Midlands retrofitting programme. An indignant Barry Cowen told the Taoiseach and Environment Minister Eamon Ryan that spending to date was just (EURO)166,000. Mr Cowen told the Taoiseach: 'Not one job has yet been created from the Just Transition fund to assist communities affected by the phasing out of peat for electricity generation.' Mr Cowen said he was furious at 'the ridiculously slow, poorly administered and apparent inept governance' of the programme to date'. Former foreign affairs minister Mr Flanagan said: 'A thousand jobs were initially lost directly from Bord na M\'f3na and the ESB and a further thousand lost indirectly. It is impossible to quantify hundreds of seasonal workers from small farmers.' Mr Flanagan said: 'Frankly, some of the money is a fiction. It is only drawn down if there are matching funds and struggling rural communities don't have those funds.' Unease is also growing over Government claims that climate change targets will be met by a stabilisation of the national herd rather than a cull. Independent TD Michael Healy Rae colourfully dismissed this on the Week in Politics, noting: 'The Government talking about stabilising the national herd is like people talking about reconfiguration of the health service. That means cuts and stabilisation also means cuts.' HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ie news@dailymail.ie 'Nobody should be left behind' 'Some of the money is a fiction' \</doc>

Nicola Sturgeon has accused the Scottish Labour leader of "talking down" Glasgow as the pair clashed over the city's cleanliness and readiness for Cop26 . The Scottish First Minister said she will not "shy away" from problems all cities face. At First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Anas Sarwar said the SNP, which runs Glasgow City Council, has "let down" the city. He said: "Tonnes of waste piling up on our streets, fly-tipping on the rise and over a million rats. \~ "Glasgow deserves better. So while Nicola Sturgeon lectures the world about the global environment, she is turning a blind eye to the environment Glaswegians are living in every single day." He said he will on Friday join cleansing workers in Glasgow who are threatening industrial action during the global climate change summit.

She said: "I don't shy away from the problems and the challenges that cities like Glasgow - Glasgow is not unique here - face in the times that we live through right now. "But nor will I stand here and allow Glasgow, one of the greatest cities in the world, to be talked down for political purposes in the way that Anas Sarwar has disgracefully been doing in recent times."

He also criticised the Scottish government's record on the environment, saying targets for renewable heating and greenhouse gas cuts have not been met. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland has decarbonised faster than any G20 country in recent years and the government is publishing a "catch-up" plan for greenhouse gas cuts. She said: "We decarbonise greater and faster than most other countries in the world. "That's why we lead by example." Scottish Labour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy also raised Glasgow's cleanliness at First Minister's Questions.

Ms Sturgeon told her: "I don't shy away - as a resident of and a representative of the city of Glasgow - I don't shy away from the challenges that the city faces. "But I do think some of the language that Labour is using about Glasgow, some of the ways in which Labour is seeking to characterise the city of Glasgow, is doing a disservice to the city and to people who live there. "And they're doing that for political purposes and not in the interest of the city." The SNP leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, faced questions about the waste situation from a committee of MPs earlier in the week. She denied that bins are overflowing and said she is "not embarrassed" about the condition of the city ahead of Cop26 . \</doc>

V ERY few people can afford a oneway ticket off planet Earth to resettle on another habitable planet. When the predicted, dreaded apocalypse occurs, the vast majority of the human race will have to battle for survival. The time for the haves and have-nots to fight for climate justice is now. While billionaires like Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos can easily pay for space explorations, their interest and investment in other habitable planets needs our close attention. It could be that their gigantic egos of being part of the 'billionaire club' allow them to do so while thousands of their workers struggle to make ends meet, or perhaps they know something we don't. These "space vacations" promoted of late, bring to mind the movie, Don't Look Up. Climate justice used to be viewed as something of an attention-seeking, elitist, opportunistic 'hobby' by a wealthy minority of the world's leaders, countries and corporations. Many of whom were actually drivers of climate change. They would see Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a threat. It is common knowledge that those most devastatingly affected by climate change are from minoritised disadvantaged communities. They also tend to be least responsible for causing the catastrophic change. The harmful effects on minoritised communities renders the fight to stop climate change a matter of life and death. It remains uncertain how it should be stopped and who should take what action to stop it. Just ahead of Earth Day (this Friday), a focus on how international climate justice might be prioritised seems apt. Events like Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth, which devastated Mozambique in 2019 are one example. There have been severe droughts, and floods, and millions of people around the world are suffering. This has left millions of people seeking humanitarian aid even though they had no act nor part in the causes of the extreme changes that devastated their lives. Climate justice means different things to different people, but at its core is the recognition that those who are disproportionately impacted by climate change are not those most responsible for causing it. But it is not only an environmental problem: it intersects with social systems, privilege and embedded injustices, and it affects people of different class, race, gender, geography and generation unequally. The climate solutions proposed by climate justice advocates aim to address long-standing systemic injustices. Since its negotiation in the UN Climate Convention in the 1990s, climate justice has been on the radar of member countries but it was only vaguely mentioned in the Paris Agreement, where it notes "the importance for some of the concept of climate justice". However, climate justice is not just a concept as it is heavily interlinked with historical injustices of slavery and colonialism, which answers the question of who bears responsibility for how climate change should be stopped, and who should take what action to stop it? Climate justice, like all social and racial justice movements, both past and present, will continue to unearth centuries-old injustices. As we have witnessed, justice is attained not only through political discussions at summits, but through awareness, and action, at all levels. It is about more than discussions on who should cut emissions. The powerful global community must accept the bitter and inconvenient truth that poverty in global south countries is due to colonisation. This is because so much of the vital raw materials and natural resources were - and continue to be - taken from these countries by industrialised nations. When the twin cyclones of Idai and Kenneth hit Mozambique in 2019, the country was forced to take a loan from the International Monetary Fund, adding to its already large national debt. Instead, Mozambique should have been allowed to avail of the $100bn ((EURO)92.5bn) - "the grand bargain" of the Paris Agreement - pledged to global south countries a year, from 2020 onwards, to help tackle climate change. Climate justice in this case would take into account the ongoing legacies of colonialism with Portugal and Britain. The two countries would recognise their responsibilities and pay reparations, thus leaving Mozambique debt-free. But invariably, the debate over who should take what action gets bogged down in politics. The UN climate summits aim to make resolutions and find equitable solutions for climate action and justice. But richer countries often refuse to take accountability for their enormous amounts of emissions despite the devastation they cause on less powerful nations. In 2020, the US exited the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The move had been announced by the Trump administration in 2017. At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference summit ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Alok Sharma, the president for COP26 , offered an emotional apology after a last-minute package was agreed, with changes to its wording on coal. A key commitment to "phase out" coal was changed to "phase down" after China and India led opposition to it. Sharma announced how "deeply sorry" he was for the way the negotiations had ended. The longer political leaders shift their positions to collectively hold global warming to "well below" 2C and "pursue efforts" to limit it to 1.5C as per the Paris Agreement, the longer all forms of injustices will persist. There is no single way to define, let alone champion, climate justice. We have to get to a point of recognition that it is in all of our interests and ally ourselves with other social justice movements. Only when we reach a point where every human being lives a life of dignity - recognising we cannot all afford that space shuttle ticket off planet Earth - will we have achieved climate justice. There is no single way to define, let alone champion, climate justice. We have to get to a point of recognition that it is in all of our interests and ally with other social justice efforts \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has told fellow leaders at Cop26 that it is not too late to turn the tide on climate change. As reported in HYPERLINK https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/cop26-taoiseach-says-it-is-not-too-late-to-turn-tide-on-climate-change-1.4717245 The Irish Times , Mr Martin told the summit that Ireland's policies reflect the country's confidence that the aim of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees can be achieved with fairness. The Taoiseach also said that legally binding targets will ensure Ireland will reduce emissions and reach climate neutrality by 2050. Advertisement"We do not believe or accept, as some would have it, that it is too late; that the transition will be too costly; that it is inevitable that we will leave people behind; that someone else should shoulder the load," he said. "We believe in the immense capacity of humans to work together and to achieve great things. If we act decisively now, we will offer humanity the most valuable prize of all - a liveable planet." Mr Martin mentioned how a cooler and more biodiverse world "with healthier air for us to breathe, healthier soil for things to grow in" can be achieved. "A world in which people can live more sustainable lives, handing a healing and enriched planet to future generations. We can create a world in which human impact on all parts of our ecosphere - the land, the sea, the air - is brought back into balance," the Taoiseach said. He also announced Ireland will be doubling its annual contributions of climate finance for poorer countries to (EURO)225 million by 2025. Mr Martin said countries in the developed world have a responsibility to those more challenged by climate change. Existential crisis Speaking to reporters, the Taoiseach said that presentations made by smaller and low income states at Cop26 have brought home the message that climate change is very real for them. "It's not something in the distant future in terms of an existential crisis for their societies and the need in terms of climate finance is to make it more practical in terms of its distribution, its allocation and operationalisation," Mr Martin said. "In other words, there are many hurdles to accessing climate finance for these countries and there really was a plea from the heart at yesterday's afternoon session to really change and improve upon that." Reacting to the speech made by the Taoiseach, Ois\'edn Coghlan, director of Friends of the Earth, said Mr Martin's comments marked a change in political leadership. "I've never heard a Taoiseach speak so convincingly on the need for climate action," Mr Coghlan said. "Of course, these fine words now need to be translated into firm action. The real test will be the Climate Action Plan due to be published later this week. "Fairness must be our watchword. Doing our fair share as a country and every sector doing its fair share. No more and no less. And everyone getting the support we need to leave no one behind in the transition." Mr Coghlan also said the Taoiseach's announcement of increases in Ireland's climate financing to help poorer countries cope with climate change is welcome. However, he commented that (EURO)225 million by 2025 still falls short of Ireland's "fair share". \</doc>

The Government's carbon budgets were passed in the D\'e1il late on Wednesday night. The carbon budgets, which are part of the Government's climate action plan, didn't require a vote as less than 10 TDs opposed the motion. Carbon budgets are the State's new mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are intended to halve annual emissions by 2030. A number of Independent TDs had sought to call a vote in opposition to the measure, including Mattie McGrath, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Collins, Carol Nolan, Richard O'Donoghue, Michael Fitzmaurice and Verona Murphy. Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications Ossian Smyth said the need for "swift, robust climate action is critical". "Last year, at Cop26 in Glasgow, we witnessed the powerful testimonies of many international leaders from climate-vulnerable nations who painted a stark picture of the impact climate change is already having on their nations and communities," he said. Mr Smyth said once the carbon budgets were adopted and come into effect, the Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan and his department would begin preparing the sectoral emissions ceilings. "These ceilings will determine how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the carbon budgets," he said. "It is my intention that the sectoral emissions ceilings will be presented to Government for approval by the end of June. "Preparation of the emissions ceilings will include extensive consultation with all Government ministers and they will be informed by new and existing analysis undertaken by members of the climate action modelling group. As well as this, additional external technical support will be drawn upon." Sinn F\'e9in TD Ruair\'ed \'d3 Murch\'fa said his party supported carbon budgets but had "serious worries about delivery". Ois\'edn Coghlan, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said the vote on Wednesday night was "a vital milestone on the road to sustained climate action". "This was the first time the Oireachtas has adopted binding short-term climate pollution targets. And crucially it was done on an all-party basis," he said. \</doc>

The world "has to step up, and it has to step up now" in response to climate change, former US president Barrack Obama has said in an address to the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow yesterday . As the gathering faces into its final days of hard negotiation on a deal to limit the extent of global heating, Mr Obama said the climate crisis was the one thing that must transcend day-to-day politics and geopolitics. "What is also true, collectively and individually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more," Mr Obama said in a speech to a plenary gathering. At a closed meeting of members of the "high-ambition coalition" (HAC) - which includes Ireland - Mr Obama is understood to have firmly supported developing countries pushing for a climate deal limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. In his speech earlier, Mr Obama acknowledged progress already made by negotiators in Glasgow but warned that gaps needed to be bridged in coming days. The biggest force for facing up to the scale of action needed was among young people, he said. "The reason is simple - they have more at stake in this fight than anyone else... If those older people won't listen, they need to get out of the way." Addressing HAC ministers including Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Mr Obama said: "What you are doing - what the HAC is attempting to accomplish - is vital." Noting the coalition's role in 2015 in ensuring the 1.5-degree target was written into the Paris agreement, he added: "The brutal tempests of the warming climate are making even clearer that we cross that line at our peril. Once again it falls on the HAC to make that case. "You've come together once again to speak to not only the need to get to 1.5 degrees, but also to provide the adaptation funding that's necessary for those who may end up paying the steepest price for actions that they themselves did not take." A draft statement from the HAC circulated yesterday noted "deep concern" over the gap between existing commitments on emissions made at Cop26 and far deeper cuts needed to limit global heating to within 1.5 degrees, "in this decisive decade". Not all countries in the coalition have signed the statement, but 40 current signatories include groups of developing countries: the Alliance of Small Island States, the Least Developed Countries and the African Group. Cop26 as evidence of "diplomatic bullying". He added: "There's been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it's shameful. "Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net-zero narrative, which is completely meaningless. The net-zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gases now, not in 30 years." "Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down," she said. "To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: 'Fossil fuels phase out', and countries must come back next year to close the gap." \</doc>

ONLY one in 10 World Economic Forum (WEF) members surveyed expects the global recovery to accelerate over the next three years, a poll of nearly 1,000 business, government and academic leaders found, with only one in six optimistic about the world outlook. Climate change was seen as the number one danger by respondents in the WEF's annual risks report released yesterday, while erosion of social cohesion, livelihood crises and mental health deterioration were identified as risks which had increased the most since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. "Global leaders must come together and adopt a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach to tackle unrelenting global challenges and build resilience ahead of the next crisis," said WEF managing director Saadia Zahidi. Agreement at the UN COP26 climate conference in November last year was widely applauded for keeping alive prospects of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but many of the nearly 200 nations had wanted to leave the conference in Glasgow with more. Climate change is already seen contributing to more extreme weather patterns. "Failure to act on climate change could shrink global GDP by one-sixth and the commitments taken at COP26 are still not enough to achieve the 1.5 (degrees Celsius) goal," said Peter Giger, group chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance, which helped to compile the report. The report also highlights four areas of emerging risk: cyber security, a disorderly climate transition, migration pressures and competition in space. The prospect of 70,000 satellite launches in coming decades, in addition to space tourism, raises risks of collisions and increasing debris. "Who governs space?" said Carolina Klint, risk management leader for continental Europe at insurance broker Marsh, which also helped produce the report. The report is published each year ahead of the annual WEF meeting in Davos.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi have arrived at Cop26 as part of a Congressional delegation, as the climate change summit focuses on women's equality. The Democratic congresswoman and the US Speaker of the House will join Nicola Sturgeon and others at an event on gender equality on Tuesday. Ms Pelosi is joined by a group of 21 US politicians who have travelled to the conference in Glasgow. Ahead of her arrival, Ms Pelosi said: "The climate crisis is the existential threat of our time, and America must continue to bring our boldest ambitions to the table to meet and beat our climate action goals. She continued: "As the world faces 'Code Red for Humanity' because of the climate crisis, America has the great responsibility and opportunity to meet this moment. "Led by President Biden and the Democratic Congress, we will do just that: advancing clean air and clean water for public health, creating good-paying green jobs and advancing our pre-eminence in green technologies, protecting our national security and leaving our children and grandchildren a healthier planet and a better future." As discussions at the conference turned to issues of gender equality, a giant puppet called Little Amal arrived in the "blue zone". The 3.5m-tall puppet, which represents a young Syrian girl, has walked 8,000km across Europe to raise awareness around the needs of refugee children. It was present as a session on "advancing gender equality in climate action" began at the conference. Advertisement The event was designed to showcase some of the best examples of gender equality in climate action, highlighting the disproportionate impact of climate change on women. On Tuesday, as part of the summit's Gender Day, Cop President Alok Sharma announced UK government funding of \£3165 million ((EURO)193 million) for communities and women's groups to tackle climate change. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the UK minister who is chairing the flagship Gender Day event, said: "It is women, girls and those who are already most marginalised, that will be most severely impacted by climate change. "But they also have a critical role to play to address the climate crisis. "The UK is committed to addressing this dual challenge head on, committing new funding to empower communities and women's groups to take locally-led adaptation action, to build local, national and global resilience." \</doc>

BUSINESSES from across Northern Ireland are being encouraged to sign up for a new climate change initiative in advance of a major international summit later this year. COP26 , the UN Climate Change Conference and one of the biggest global summits ever hosted in the UK, will take place in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12 2021. Ahead of the of the event, responsible business network Business in the Community (BITC) has partnered with Arup, Firmus Energy, Translink and The Irish News, to develop the COP26 NI Business Hub, a one-stop-shop where firms can access events listings, resources and information to inspire and inform businesses to take action on the climate crisis, and be fully involved in the run up to, and during, COP26 . COP26 -related events, toolkits, publications and resources to the platform where they will be to be available for others to download, access and sign up to. Kieran Harding, managing director of BITC said:  The biggest global summit ever hosted in the UK, COP26 is seen as a significant milestone in the UK\' s push towards achieving its target \' net zero\' carbon by 2050 and affords government, businesses, NGOs, lobbyists and individual citizens a unique opportunity to campaign on climate issues.  Northern Ireland must play its part in addressing the climate crisis and business is a key stakeholder, he said.  We need to work together for a sustainable future that creates decent jobs and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth. Engineering, design and consultancy firm Arup is the UK Government\' s sustainability consultant for COP26 and is aiming to deliver a carbon-neutral conference with sustainability at its core. The company\' s Belfast office leader, Diane Emerson, said:  Arup has committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030 and we are working with cities, governments and businesses in their response to the climate emergency.  We\' re proud to partner on the COP26 NI Business Hub, which will provide a bank of information, resources and advice on how others can respond to the challenges, and capitalise on the opportunities, that a shift to a low-carbon economy can bring here in Northern Ireland. Eric Cosgrove from Firmus Energy, said the hub is a great starting point for businesses who have heard about COP26 but aren\' t sure how they can get involved in what\' s happening on a more local scale.  During this climate emergency we need all NI businesses to work together and take steps towards a greener future throughout their daily operations, he said. With a keen interest in sustainability, media partner The Irish News will be profiling the COP26 NI Business Hub in the coming months. The newspaper\' s marketing manager, Annette Small, said:  The Irish News is committed to improving, learning and working with partners to raise awareness of the impact of climate change.  We want to lead the way not only on environmental reporting, but also in our own commitment to sustainability to ensure we live up to the values of our readers and our journalism.

The Cop26 The Glasgow Climate Pact - the central outcome of the conference - provides a framework for countries to strengthen their climate pledges on an annual basis. This is a key change from the Paris Agreement, which required such updating only every five years. The pact includes a reference to coal for the first time, and to fossil fuel subsidies. Both references were progressively weakened over the final days of the conference but the reference to coal is the first such reference in a UN climate agreement and is historically significant. Cop26 also finalised the so-called Paris rule book - the detailed set of rules to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. Other aspects of the negotiations of particular concern to developing countries on the front lines of climate impacts, including climate finance and "loss and damage", failed to satisfy their demands, though some progress was recorded. Was the outcome enough? By any objective measure, the answer must be no. This was illustrated in the plenary on Saturday afternoon, when a range of developing and small island states repeatedly called attention to the inadequacy of the proposed agreement. Some negotiators expressed deep concern for their children and grandchildren and the world that today's leaders are bestowing on them. Challenging global backdrop The progress achieved at C op26 should be assessed against a challenging global backdrop for climate action. While the urgent need to take radical action to tackle the climate crisis has never been clearer, governments around the world have spent much of the past two years battling a different crisis: the Covid-19 pandemic. The geopolitical context was also largely unfavourable, with simmering US-China tensions and concerns over energy shortages this coming winter among a range of distractions. Negotiations were also hampered by the basic fact that the current level of global climate ambition is far below a level consistent with limiting global heating to even the higher 2 degree goal contained in the Paris Agreement, let alone the lower 1.5 degree target. Initial analysis of the set of national climate pledges announced before and during Cop26 suggest that, if fully implemented, they would limit warming to somewhere between 1.8 and 2.4 degrees, depending on the assumptions used. The Glasgow Climate Pact's framework for strengthening national climate pledges is anchored in a strong endorsement for the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the key 1.5 degree temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The need to reduce global emissions of CO2 by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to 2010 levels, and to net zero around mid-century is recognised, as is the need for "deep reductions" in other greenhouse gases such as methane. These are all important elements of the text, because they set the benchmark against which countries' strengthened climate pledges will be measured. Tortuous negotiations The tortuous negotiations over the past two weeks revealed three essential characteristics of international climate negotiations. First, as a consensus-driven process, the pace is often set by the most reluctant countries. This is deeply frustrating given the necessity of urgent and transformational change. But it is an inescapable fact of the global climate regime, where decisions are taken by consensus. A last-minute amendment to language on coal on Saturday illustrates this point. India, supported by China and South Africa, requested to change the language from a "phase out" to a "phase down" of unabated coal. This was in fact the fourth softening of the language on coal and fossil fuel subsidies over the course of last week. Many other countries voiced their deep disappointment in the plenary discussion but had no real choice but to accept it. A second essential characteristic is that equity and fairness considerations profoundly shape the dynamics of global climate negotiations. At the heart of the climate crisis is a deep injustice: those least responsible for causing climate change through greenhouse gas emissions are on the front lines of the impacts of the climate crisis. This plays out in various ways. It was heard in the desperate pleas from vulnerable developing countries and small island states whose very future is at stake. It was also evident in the pushback from India on the language around coal in the final agreement. India complains that an undifferentiated coal phase-out is unfair on developing countries that have historically polluted less and are more reliant on coal. A fairer approach, according to this view, would give developing countries more time to transition away from coal and would also target the fossil fuels most central to industrialised economies, namely oil and gas. Words matter Third, words matter. Negotiators fought hard over the exact language that would be contained in the final agreed texts. Some condemned the C op26 as just another talking shop, but the time and effort diplomats spent negotiating the text illustrates that language does indeed matter. In this context, the language relating to coal and fossil fuel subsidies is important. Despite the fact that the relevant language was weakened in the final version, Cop26 sent a clear message to the global economy about the phase-out of fossil fuels. The language was watered down, but the direction of travel is clear. Of course, commitments announced in the glare of the global media are only meaningful if they are put into action. The focus now shifts to implementation at domestic level. As a rich developed country, Ireland has a particular responsibility. Our emissions per capita are stubbornly high, even by the standards of developed countries. Ireland's national climate law passed earlier this year provides a domestic framework for scaling up climate action and holding Government to account if it fails to do so. The recently-published Climate Action Plan takes initial steps to chart a pathway forward. The need to take transformative action to combat the climate crisis has never been clearer, but the real work of bending the emissions curve downward - in Ireland and globally - is only beginning. Dr Diarmuid Torney is an associate professor in the school of law and government at Dublin City University, and a co-director of the DCU Centre for Climate and Society. \</doc>

A SERIES of protests marked the end of the two-day world leaders' summit in Glasgow as heads of state returned home declaring progress had been made in the critical climate talks. Ireland signed up to two new pacts during the gathering - one pledging to cut global methane emissions by 30pc by 2030, and the other committing to halting and reversing forest loss around the world, also by 2030. He focused on urging financial support for developing countries already struggling with impacts of climate change, and on providing assurances to young people, workers and consumers fearful of climate change and painful climate action measures that their concerns would be addressed. Ireland accepted its obligations and was "ready to play its part", he said. "We do not believe or accept, as some would have it, that it is too late, that the transition will be too costly, that it is inevitable that we will leave people behind, that someone else should shoulder the load. "We believe in the immense capacity of humans to work together and to achieve great things." Friends of the Earth said the speech, and remarks that preceded it over several interviews Mr Martin gave in Glasgow, marked a "step change in political leadership on climate". The group's director, Ois\'edn Coghlan, said: "I've never heard a Taoiseach speak so convincingly on the need for climate action." COP26 host British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrapped up the leaders' segment, declaring "progress has been made". He said the signing of the pledges, backed by billions of euro in financial pledges, along with the verbal commitments to substantial emissions cuts made during the speeches, were grounds for cautious optimism. While the leaders have left, national delegations remain in Glasgow for the 10 days of negotiations needed to put detail on the pledges and commitments. Those negotiations will be taking place against a backdrop of several planned large demonstrations, with smaller and impromptu protests also gaining momentum. As leaders departed yesterday afternoon and evening, a section of an Extinction Rebellion protest, that had earlier held up traffic in the city, managed to get within several hundred metres of the talks venue and stage a sit-down protest. Many other smaller protests seeking to highlight carbon pollution, biodiversity loss, ecosystem destruction and human rights abuses also took place outside the venue and around central Glasgow. Extensive preparations have been made to deal with unrest around the event, with 10,000 police officers on duty in the city each day and road closures and barricades in use on approach routes. The largest protest is planned for Saturday as part of a global day of action on climate which will be replicated around the world. Protests will be taking place in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, with 39 Irish groups pledging participation, including a large number of environmental groups, trade unions, student unions, teachers' organisations, the National Women's Council, political parties and lawyers. The demonstrations are being held to keep the pressure on governments as the COP26 talks continue, with campaigners warning the commitments signalled so far would still not go far enough to prevent runaway global temperature rise. \</doc>

MORE than 140 PSNI officers will support the huge policing operation at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The climate change conference will take place in November. The Queen, Pope Francis and US President Joe Biden are among the high-profile figures expected to attend, and each member of the United Nations has been invited, meaning nearly 120 heads of state are expected to arrive along with about 20,000 accredited delegates. Some 10,000 officers from around the UK will be deployed each day of the event, making it one of the largest policing operations ever in Britain. The PSNI said it would send 145 officers to Glasgow during the November 1-12 summit. Acting Assistant Chief Constable Sam Donaldson said: "The PSNI will provide support to Police Scotland during the period of the COP26 climate conference as part of a mutual aid request - 145 officers will be deployed at varying times during the period of the conference. 'The provision of mutual aid between UK police services is part of the routine business of policing and enables greater efficiency' in the use of valuable resources. All officers being deployed will be required to comply with Covid-related regulations in both jurisdictions. "The PSNI reserves the right to modify or withdraw our resource commitment should operational demand increase unexpectedly." Police Scotland has said it is engaging with protest groups to allow peaceful demonstrations. PSNI officer, told the BBC yesterday: "Success for the United Nations is having as many protesters there as possible, and so it is different to a normal event that you would police where that sort of protective security environment is paramount. "We want to create an environment in Glasgow where people feel safe and protected to come and have their voice heard and exercise their right to protest on an issue that's of significant global importance to every single demographic. "We are going to have 100- plus world leaders, 10,000 cops, potentially 100,000-plus protesters in a very, very busy urban environment, so it is going to be a broader challenge undoubtedly. "But we are absolutely determined that we will create the environment where people feel free to come and have their voices heard and hopefully create a safe and secure environment where politicians can hopefully succeed and come up with an agreement because it's an important issue for us all." Chief Superintendent Louise Skelton said people should expect to see more armed officers around Glasgow. The force is understood to have about 500 armed officers and, while there has been no increase in their numbers for COP26 , a "significant" number of armed police from elsewhere in the UK will assist. Nearly 200 specialist drug-sniffing, gun-detecting, and explosive-finding dogs will also be prowling key locations at the summit. Meanwhile, Mr Biden confirmed he is "anxious" to be in Glasgow in person to attend the HYPERLINK http://www.summit.UK www.summit.UK ministers are keen for the conference to involve face-toface meetings and speeches after the event was delayed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

A new draft of the deal that could be agreed at the Glasgow Cop26 climate talks appears to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuels. The first draft of the "cover decision" for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries "to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". In a new draft produced on Friday morning, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, "including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels". The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.

The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets" in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to "well below" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C. The new version "requests" countries do so,\~ compared to the previous version which "urges" them to do so. Michael Jacobs, former climate adviser to Gordon Brown and veteran of Cop talks, said UK, EU and UNFCCC lawyers were saying that "requests" was stronger language than "urges". He said: "I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5C temperature goal." Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century. But current action plans known as nationally determined contributions for emissions cuts up to 2030 leave the world well off track to meet the goal, and could see warming of 2.4C over the long term. So countries are under pressure to rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal slipping out of reach. There is now a date - missing from the first draft - for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change - by 2025. Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow. \</doc>

Observers say the change leaves the question of what is an "inefficient subsidy" open to interpretation. Abated coal refers to the use of carbon capture and storage technologies alongside power stations in an attempt to cut their emissions. That is still very much an emerging technology. The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.

Prof Sweeney said a conflict between leaders' aspirations and the vested interests on the ground who are exerting control on what is actually agreed is ongoing. \</doc>

UN climate talks, billed as one of the last chances to stave off climate breakdown, will not produce the breakthrough needed to fulfil the aspirations of the Paris agreement, key players in the talks have conceded. The UN, Britain, and other major figures in the talks have privately admitted that the original aim of the Cop26 summit will not be achieved, as the pledges on green-house-gas cuts from major economies will fall short of the halving of global emissions needed this decade to limit global heating to 1.5C. Senior observers of the two-week summit, to take place in Glasgow this November, said campaigners and some countries would be disappointed. However, the UN, Britain, and the US insisted that the broader goal of the conference -- of "keeping 1.5C alive" -- was still in sight, and that world leaders meeting in Glasgow could still set a pathway that would avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos. That pathway, in the form of a "Glasgow pact", would allow for future updates to emissions pledges in the next few years that could be sufficient for the world to stay within scientific advice on carbon levels. A UN official said: "We are not going to get to a 45% reduction, but there must be some level of contributions on the table to show the downward trend of emissions." A British spokesperson said: " Cop26 will not deliver all that we want $(on emissions$)." However, Britain, charged as host with delivering a successful outcome, is hoping progress will be made on other issues, including phasing out of coal, climate finance for poor countries, and the protection of forests. A US official said countries must still aim as high as possible on emissions cuts: "No one in the administration wants to admit defeat before we have made the maximum effort. You should set an ambitious agenda and may have to, in the end, take baby steps, but you should plan for long strides." Climate economist Nicholas Stern said falling short on emissions plans should not be equated with failure. "I agree with $(the UN$) and most observers that we will not close that gap $(between emissions pledges and scientific advice$) completely," he said. "But we should hope for good progress in closing that gap and we should hope for mechanisms and ways forward on how we close that gap further between now and 2025. That's the way we should think about what is a good, or better, or worse result -- a language of success or failure doesn't seem to me to be very helpful." At the Paris climate summit in December 2015, 196 nations agreed to hold global temperature rises to "well below 2C", with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. However, the pledges they brought to Paris did not fulfil either goal, and would have led to heating of at least 3C. For that reason, the French hosts wrote into the agreement a "ratchet mechanism", which would require countries to return to the negotiating table every five years with fresh targets to meet the temperature goals. \</doc>

In a highly significant move at\~ Cop26 \~an alliance of countries has committed to phasing out production of oil and gas - and is to push for an international agreement on setting an end date for the exploration and extraction of the fossil fuels. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which\~Ireland\~has joined, is a first in an international climate process which up to now has focused on limiting carbon emissions from fossil fuels rather than turning off the tap. As The HYPERLINK https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/cop26-ireland-joins-alliance-to-phase-out-oil-and-gas-production-1.4725965 Irish Times reports, the 2015 Paris Agreement did not mention fossil fuels, which generated 91 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions in 2020. The alliance is seeking to curtail new licensing and undertake other measures to phase out oil and gas production in line with the Paris accord. Ireland joined\~Costa Rica;\~Denmark,\~France,\~Greenland, Quebec,\~Sweden,\~Wales,\~California\~and\~New Zealand\~in making the milestone announcement. AdvertisementMinister for\~Climate\~Eamon Ryan\~said: "Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. "The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally." Prohibiting exploration In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, "we are also currently legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale", Mr Ryan confirmed. Founding members "committing to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds, and promoting dialogue on the need for a managed and just phase-out". Mr Ryan added: "By prohibiting offshore oil and gas exploration, not only are we doing what we need to do to address climate change, we are also protecting our biodiversity which is intrinsically linked to climate change. "There are other impacts. For example, scientific research demonstrates that the seismic activity that accompanies exploration and drilling has significant environmental effects." Denmark and Costa Rica led the initiative. Denmark's minister for climate, energy, and utilities\~Dan Jorgensen\~said that it was expensive for his country as it was the largest producer of oil in the EU but "we do it because we believe we need to". "There's no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world," he added. Costa Rica's environment minister\~Andrea Meza\~said the alliance was about early movers showing courage, "backed by concrete actions". \</doc>

IT'S alarming to see a shortage of wind leading to an increase in emissions from electricity in 2021. As we strive to move towards net zero, we should be seeing a decrease in emissions across our electricity system, especially in the year that we hosted Cop26 . Secondly, to incentivise enough investment to enable system decarbonisation by 2035, more long-term contracts for a range of grid services must be made available. Last year we saw numerous green pledges and plenty of rhetoric emerge from Cop26 . We now need to see the tactical steps that are necessary to fulfil renewable energy's considerable potential. The solution is simple. To ensure grid stability, lower energy costs, and reduce the UK's carbon emissions, the government must listen to the organisations with the solutions, providing the legislation and regulation necessary to drive further investment in renewables and storage. Only this will get us to net zero. JAMES BASDEN, Founder of Zenobe, via email \</doc>

"There is no cause for mad optimism" that there will be a good outcome to address the climate crisis at the Cop26 global summit next month, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. However, he told the all-party Committee of Climate Action that the prospects on a meaningful deal at the UN gathering were "not as bleak as a couple of months ago". Mr Ryan he said this was because the US had increased its climate finance contribution to help developing countries; China had committed to no longer invest in overseas coal-fired power plants; and the EU had indicated an intention to cut carbon emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. "Those three large players have reason to double down," he said in response to Fine Gael TD Richard Bruton, who had suggested a lack of conviction in commitments from the non-EU countries involved could be a fault-line. Sticking with the old system meant there was a big risk of missing out on the benefits that would accrue for a decarbonised economy, he added. Mr Ryan insisted Ireland could shake off its climate laggard tag because it had achieved cross-party consensus on climate action and had generated "climate legislation as good as any in the world". He cited an end to fracking and oil and gas exploration and divestment from fossil fuels as examples of doing the right thing, though delivery on emissions reductions had yet to materialise.

THE Government is offering to host a major international forum next year to save Europe's peatlands, Heritage Minister Malcolm Noonan announced on the final day of the COP26 climate talks yesterday. Mr Noonan said the Irish summit would help shape policy for saving peatlands across the continent. Research released by Teagasc, the State's agricultural advice organisation, has said that rewetting Irish boglands could be the single biggest way for us to capture carbon. Ireland's bogs release millions of tons of carbon because they were drained for turf cutting. Other countries across Europe have had the same experience and a joint plan could be a huge carbonsaving move across the EU. COP26 agreement would leave the goal of limiting rising temperatures to 1.5C in 'mortal peril' as negotiators battled over the final text. The summit in Glasgow had been due to end last night, but went into extra time as countries clashed over the wording around fossil fuels and a blame game broke out. A pledge that richer nations will give the poorest countries (EURO)87billion a year to adapt to climate change also appears to have been watered down, with Ireland among those developed countries that were refusing to sign up to the original wording. Scientists say that restricting warming to 1.5C is crucial to avoid devastating climate change which will wreak havoc on the world. But a draft agreement published yesterday evening made little movement towards meeting that goal. Various countries including Saudi Arabia, Australia, China, the US and Russia were blamed for holding back progress on different areas. Angry activists marched through the conference centre yesterday, while island nations painted a bleak picture of what further global warming meant for them. The draft text ran into issues over ending the world's dependence on coal and fossil fuels - mention of which has never made it into a COP document before. While an earlier draft of the text called on countries to £ccelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel', a new version appeared to have been watered down. The new text added that nations accelerate the phase out of 'unabated' coal power and of 'inefficient' subsidies - a far lower bar. While negotiators were applauded for getting a reference to coal and fossil fuel subsidies into the text, fierce pushback is expected and the words may not make it into the final text. Countries are also 'requested' rather than 'urged' to strengthen their 2030 targets by next year, triggering a row over which word was stronger. Another area under negotiation is a bid to force countries to return in a year to toughen their current commitments. At present, they are expected to return in 2025 - a date that campaigners say is not soon enough. However, there is more included in the draft on finance for poorer countries to adapt with climate change and a request for all nations to strengthen their plans for cutting emissions up to 2030 by the end of next year. British prime minister Boris Johnson said the goal of the UN conference was to 'keep 1.5C alive' however, experts have warned that current pledges would mean 2.4C of warming. Mr Johnson warned yesterday.: 'What needs to happen now is that people need to understand that the deal that's on the table - the so-called cover decision - that is the text. 'We either find away of agreeing it or I'm afraid 'We risk blowing it'. That's the reality.' He added that negotiators had been 'shifting heaven and earth' to get an agreement and urged world leaders to find the 'courage' to strike Ad\'e9l. 'What we can't do is stop global warming at Glasgow - we can't, we've got to accept that,' Mr Johnson said . 'What we can do is keep alive the prospect of restraining the increase in the planet's temperatures to 1.5C by the end of the century.' Asked if the draft meets his hopes for Glasgow, climate expert Nicholas Stern said: 'It falls short of what one would hope for in the sense of really driving to 1.5C and tackling clean development.' sean.O' HYPERLINK mailto:Driscoll@dailymail.ie Driscoll@dailymail.ie NZ penguin 'was like toy' A PENGUIN has been found 3,000km away from home on the east coast of New Zealand. The Ad\'e9lie penguin, usually found in the Antarctic, was first spotted by locals just south of Christchurch on Wednesday evening. The New Zealand Department of Conservation said he was underweight and a bit dehydrated. The bird was fed before its release Harry Singh, who found the penguin, said he thought he was a 'soft toy' at first. 'It did not move for one hour... and [looked] exhausted,' Mr Singh told the BBC. COP26 EXPLAINED: WHAT HAS IT ACHIEVED? Q&A What is COP26 's goal? THE 196-nation summit's aim is to 'keep 1.5C alive'- referring to the COP21 conference in Paris six years ago, at which national leaders agreed to 'pursue efforts' to curb global temperature rises to 1.5C by cutting greenhouse gas emissions . What does the deal say? THE current text calls for 'rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions', including reducing CO2 emissions 'by 45% by 2030'. It also calls for the phasing out of 'unabated' coal power and of 'inefficient' subsidies - a or fossil fuels'. However, there is a special allowance for countries with carbon capture technology which can suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground. Specific language criticising fossil fuels has never appeared before in the final text from a UN climate conference. If the wording survives, the UK team running COP26 believes that will count as a success. The draft text calls for cuts to methane emissions and more aid for nations hit by warming. Can we limit global warming to 1.5C? YES, but pledges at the summit to cut emissions will still let global warming rise by 2.4C. The Earth is 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial levels. Experts project that 2.4C warming would lead to more extreme weather, rising sea levels, the loss of almost all the world's coral reefs, deadly heatwaves, drought, increasing wildfires and catastrophic food shortages as result of widespread crop failures. How will we get to 1.5C? IF the deal is accepted, nations must pledge further cuts next year. While the problem will not have been finally cracked in Glasgow, it will be a big step along the way. However, even a 1.5C rise will have severe impacts. What else is agreed? THE US and China agreed to work together to l imi t global temperature rise to 1.5C. More than 100 leaders promised to reverse deforestation by 2030, including Brazil. The US and EU created a global partnership to cut methane emissions by 2030. More than 40 countries committed to move away from coal - but not big users such as China and the US. The sticking points? BRITAIN and others want more ambitious targets. Developing countries want more money to help them adapt to the impacts of global warming and to develop renewable power sources such as wind and solar rather than cheap coal-fired plants. Why make rich nations pay to help poor ones? POORER nations argue that the First World grew rich on cheap power from coal, oil and gas, the use of which must now be stopped or limited. What is not in the deal? THE treaty does not call for an end to all use of fossil fuels across the world. Has a deal been agreed? NO. The summit in Scotland was meant to finish yesterday.; however, it continued into the early hours today. 'We risk blowing it' Fierce pushback is expected \</doc>

UN study to 'paint a grim vision' for big cities from London to Lima A new UN science report is set to send what may be the starkest warning yet about the impacts of climate change on people and the planet. The assessment is the second in a series of three reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the latest review of climate science, which take place every six or seven years for governments. It is being published today, a little over 100 days after the Cop26 summit agreed to increase action to try and limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The outcomes of the UN talks in Glasgow were described as keeping the temperature goal alive, but only with a weak pulse, by conference president Alok Sharma. The first in the series of reports was described as a "code red for humanity" by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres when it was released last summer, before Cop26 , setting out the unequivocal and unprecedented impact humans were having on the planet. A draft leaked last year warned of the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds or "tipping points", where things such as melting of ice sheets or permafrost, or rainforests becoming grassland, become irreversible, with huge consequences. The final version of the study will be released after its summary was approved line-by-line in a process involving representatives of governments and scientists over the past two weeks. The report will set out the impacts of rising temperatures, which have already risen 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, from droughts to floods, storms, effects on health, agriculture, and cities, and cascading and irreversible impacts. There will be a specific focus on the different regions of the world, as well as looking at vulnerable populations and communities, migration, and displacement. It will detail options for, and limits to, adapting to climate change. Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors taking action on climate change, warned the latest report was likely to "paint a grim vision" for big cities from London to Lima. "City residents are already on the front line of a worsening vulnerability to climate impacts such as deadly flooding, sea-level rise, wild fires, extreme storms, and unbearable urban heat," said Mr Watts. "It is clear we are now in the climate crisis, not waiting for it. We can still overcome climate breakdown and build a thriving future, but urban adaptation efforts must outpace this new climate reality." David King, who founded the Climate Crisis Advisory Group of independent experts, warned that because of the way the IPCC reports worked, they did not include the most up-to-date studies or evidence, such as heatwaves in Canada and floods in Europe last year. He said the importance of the reports could not be overrated: "There's absolutely no guarantee that we will recover from the impacts of climate change, unless we all begin to work together and far more quickly, far more effectively, than we are doing at the moment." \</doc>

Almost a week after Alok Sharma brought down the gavel on Cop26 in Glasgow, the debate continues over whether the climate summit was an important step towards limiting global warming or an elaborate exercise in greenwashing. For Boris Johnson, it was a tipping point that will push the world towards more ambitious goals, and more than that, it was "global Britain in action". "We will build on the historic Glasgow climate pact, which calls for countries to do better next year - accelerating the five-year cycle set out in the Paris Agreement. We will push for more ambitious goals, stronger plans and better implementation, and so we further narrow that gap to 1.5 degrees," Johnson told the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London this week. Most delegates in Glasgow agreed that Sharma did a good job as Cop26 president, using modest, quiet but assiduous diplomacy to shepherd almost 200 countries towards a shared final text. When he choked up on the podium as he apologised for a last-minute change in the text, representatives from states large and small applauded him because they believed he had done his best to keep his promises and to maintain a transparent process. But it was on the floor of the plenary hall that a true picture of global power emerged as huddles formed around the representatives of the US, the EU and China. All three powers bear responsibility for the inadequacy of the final agreement: China for its last-minute demand that coal should be "phased down" rather than phased out; the US because of its mean-spirited refusal to agree to meaningful compensation for poorer countries already suffering the effects of climate change caused by rich nations, and the EU for the poverty of its ambition in the negotiations. But there was no question in Glasgow of any initiative gaining traction without the support of two out of three of the big powers and once the final text had the support of the US, China and the EU other countries fell into line. Outside the EU, Britain was unable to influence even its closest post-Brexit ally Australia, to say nothing of another major Commonwealth partner, India. Insofar as Sharma succeeded, it was because he chaired the process like the representative of a small or middle power rather than a major one. In doing so, he reminded many of Britain's partners of the country's diplomatic strengths and the quality and expertise of many of its officials. Sharma's style offered a glimpse of an alternative "global Britain" focused on international partnership and networks of soft power rather than vainglorious aspirations to project military power east of Suez. He will have an opportunity to deploy it for another year as Britain retains the Cop presidency. The British government's Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy implies an acceptance that Britain is now a middle power like France, Germany, Japan or Canada. But it cannot bring itself to spell it out or to avoid language about being a "leading" power or even a superpower in some areas. The yawning gap in the Integrated Review is about Britain's relationship with the EU, which is hardly mentioned by name in the document. Johnson's failure to draw a line under Brexit - to accept that he has in fact got it done - is also the biggest conceptual obstacle in the way of settling into a new, realistic role in the world. Taking a swipe In his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet, Johnson was unable to praise the internationalism behind the climate talks without taking a swipe at the EU. "Perhaps we were also helped in Glasgow by a collective sense of embarrassment at the way internationalism failed us during Covid: the squabbles about PPE, the crazy decisions of some countries, naming no names, to try to stop the export of vaccines to others, something we were victims of at the start of this year," he said. "And let me say - given all the speculation - that we would rather find a negotiated solution to the problems created by the Northern Ireland protocol, and that still seems possible. But if we do invoke article 16 - which by the way is a perfectly legitimate part of that protocol - we will do so reasonably and appropriately, because we believe it is the only way left to protect the territorial integrity of our country, and meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland under the Belfast Agreement." UK negotiator David Frost last week stepped back from triggering article 16 but he rattled that rusting sabre again in the House of Lords yesterday. So Sharma's version of global Britain may have been nothing more than a short detour from the bumpy path Johnson has chosen. \</doc>

Boris Johnson has promised to boost the expansion of electric cars, subsidise householders to switch from gas boilers to low carbon alternatives and develop new green technologies in order to reach net zero by 2050. Less than a fortnight before he hosts the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow, the prime minister published a 368-page strategy paper outlining how Britain will reach that goal. He said the plan would put Britain ahead of other countries in green technology and would unlock \£390 billion (EUR 107 billion) of private investment and secure 440,000 jobs by 2030. "The UK's path to ending our contribution to climate change will be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment and thriving green industries - powering our green industrial revolution across the country. By moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology and more, whilst supporting people and businesses along the way," he said. The strategy promises \£3120 million to develop new nuclear technologies including small reactors that can be built and assembled more quickly than large-scale nuclear plants. Two sites have been earmarked for carbon capture and storage and the government will invest in hydrogen projects. Car manufacturers will be obliged to sell more electric vehicles and the network of charging stations will be expanded. Householders will be offered a \£35,000 grant to replace gas boilers with heat pumps but the \£3450 million allocated for the programme will fund only 90,000 grants. The treasury said the measures would require more public spending but the biggest impact on public finances would come from the loss of tax revenues on fossil fuel-related activity. It warned that the gap would have to be funded by new taxes. "If there is to be additional public spending, the government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government's fiscal principles," it said. "Seeking to pass the costs onto future taxpayers through borrowing would deviate from the 'polluter pays' principle, would not be consistent with intergenerational fairness nor fiscal sustainability, and could blunt incentives. This could also push up the economic cost of the transition." Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said the plan had been "torpedoed" by the treasury, leaving it inadequate for the green transition demanded by the climate crisis. "Homeowners are left to face the costs of insulation on their own, industries like steel and hydrogen are left hobbled in the global race without the support they need, and the government cannot even confirm they will meet their climate target for 2035," he said. "While Labour has a bold climate investment pledge of \£328 billion extra each and every year to 2030, the government offers a tiny fraction of that. This does not meet our ambitions for British industries to thrive, prosper and lead the world or show the government leadership required to tackle climate breakdown and bring the benefits of a green transition to Britain." \</doc>

Former US President Barack Obama will travel to Glasgow, Scotland in November to attend the COP26 climate summit where he will meet with youth activists and address the threat of climate change, his spokesperson said on Friday. "He will lay out the important progress made in the five years since the Paris Agreement took effect, highlight the leadership of young people around the globe, and urge more robust action going forward by all of us - governments, the private sector, philanthropy, and civil society," said Hannah Hankins, spokesperson for the 44th US president. News of Obama's presence in Glasgow comes as President Joe Biden aims to drum up momentum ahead of the October 31st-November 12th summit. Biden confirmed on Thursday that he will attend the opening of the summit after participating in the Group of 20 leaders summit in Rome. AdvertisementThe White House said it will bring 13 high-level officials and cabinet members to the gathering on Thursday, demonstrating its "all of government" approach to tackling climate change. Paris agreement Since rejoining the Paris climate agreement when Biden took office in January, the administration set a goal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% over this decade. But the president is at risk to arriving in Glasgow without much progress to show. A lot rides on whether the US Congress will pass key infrastructure and budget bills that would set clean power and transportation goals and unleash trillions in spending. US Congress members from Biden's Democratic party have been negotiating about the bills, with some opposed to the price tag and climate measures. Biden needs solid Democratic support because the measures are opposed by Republican lawmakers. Energy Innovation, a California based research group, said these bills, if combined with state policies and executive action, could set the United States on a path to achieve its 2030 target. Obama, during his first term as president in 2009, travelled to Copenhagen where he helped directly intervened in climate summit negotiations with other world leaders that resulted in an agreement that for the first time called emission pledges by all major economies, not just industrialised nations. - Reuters \</doc>

Taoiseach rules out another Christmas lockdown The Taoiseach has ruled out the possibility of another lockdown around the Christmas period. Amid rising Covid-19 case numbers, HYPERLINK Miche\'e1l Martin said the country would be back in lockdown were it not for the vaccine campaign. He told Today FM's Dermot & Dave show that the country was in a different position now because of the vaccine rollout and said he does not anticipate a dramatic return of restrictions. "I don't see Christmas lockdowns," Mr Martin said, but added that the high number of cases at present was worrying. Mr Martin said he expected the vaccine booster campaign to be expanded, but added that people's behaviour was also important.

Both nations agreed to "recall their firm commitment to work together" and to close the "significant gap" to achieving the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Martin praised US president Joe Biden for bringing America back from the point of being in "climate denial" under the Trump administration. He said: "The most important thing that happened in the last year and a bit has been the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States in respect of climate change. "That's my view because prior to that we were facing a fairly depressing scenario where you had an administration that was almost in climate denial. "Why is that important? You can see already leading into Cop 26 that the European Union, which is a leader in terms of climate change, is now partnering with the United States and the Biden administration with John Kerry as a special envoy, and driving the global agenda.

Joe Biden and Pope Francis held talks in the Vatican yesterday in a poignant meeting for the second Catholic US president, as both men strain against conservative critics to set green agendas ahead of the landmark climate summit Cop26 . Pope Francis said the world "cannot allow" an uninhabitable planet to be passed down to our grandchildren and exhorted leaders to rise to the challenge of addressing climate change, in a public appeal ahead of the summits. "These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities. Opportunities that we must not waste," he said in a message recorded for BBC radio. "The political decision-makers who will meet at Cop26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis, and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations," the pope said. "And it is worth repeating: each of us, whoever and wherever we may be, can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change, and the degradation of our common home." Abortion stance The leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics met the US president and first lady Jill Biden for over an hour, exchanging views on international affairs including the common commitment to care for the planet "in the context of the upcoming G20 summit in Rome", a Vatican statement read. Mr Biden, a regular Mass-goer who identifies as an Irish Catholic has met Pope Francis before, but not as US president. The encounter came at a politically resonant moment following criticism from US bishops of Mr Biden's stance on abortion, with hardliners even calling for the Democrat to be denied communion. The US president praised the pontiff for his "leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery", according to a White House statement. At home, Mr Biden's ambitions for a\~$3.5 trillion investment package to drive a transition to clean energy and improve social conditions ran into opposition from centrist holdouts within his own party and had to be pared down in size to garner the required support. On the eve of his departure for Europe, the president insisted that though the headline investment figure had halved in size to $1.75 trillion (EUR 1.5 trillion) and no longer contained proposals for guaranteed paid sick leave for workers, it was still "historic" and "the most significant investment in climate ever". Negotiations at the G20 are focused on speeding up vaccine donations to poorer countries as a gulf in equitable distribution has left richer countries with an excess of supply while most healthcare workers in Africa have yet to be inoculated. Doubts stoked Talks are ongoing to try to secure a pledge to phase out coal that would allow the 20 biggest economies to build momentum for Cop26 by showing their commitment to action, but the attendance of the Chinese and Russian leaders\~Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin by video link rather than in person has stoked doubts about whether ambitious goals would be set. The G20 leaders are also to discuss the next steps towards finalising an OECD agreement to reform the international system for taxing multinationals and set a minimum 15 per cent rate that has seen Ireland abandon its flagship 12.5 per cent policy. The European Union will bring forward proposals to set the taxation reform down in EU law by the end of 2021, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the summit. \</doc>

FAILURE to make progress at the UN climate talks in Glasgow would have a knock-on effect on climate action at home, Minister Eamon Ryan has said. The climate action minister said the Irish public needed to know they were not alone in being asked to take difficult steps to alleviate the climate crisis and the outcome of the COP26 summit would influence opinion. "What we need to come out of this is momentum so that the incredibly radical actions we need to take at home have public support," he said. "We need to give confidence that we are not the only ones doing it and those that don't are going to fall behind." Mr Ryan was speaking in Glasgow where he arrived yesterday morning after announcing on Saturday the trip was cancelled because he had tested positive for Covid-19. He said the test had been notified as positive because it was inconclusive but a second test gave him the all-clear. In his first engagement, Mr Ryan signed Ireland up to the High Ambition Coalition, a grouping of 41 countries pushing for greater urgency on emissions reduction and more finance for developing countries to cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. He also took part in a donor country event, and pledged at least (EURO)10m extra for funding to assist the most vulnerable countries between now and the end of 2022. Earlier, Minister for Overseas Aid Colm Brophy committed (EURO)1m to the National Adaptation Plan Global Network which helps poor countries devise plans to prepare for the impacts of climate change, and (EURO)2.5m to the Least Developed Countries Fund. Mr Brophy said climate change was already threatening food security in many of the poorest countries. "Simple things like delayed rains or insufficient rains leave traditional communities that can no longer engage in agriculture," he said. "We have to be so conscious coming out of COP that we recognise that for millions and millions of people now, that risk to food security, that risk of extreme hunger is a day-today reality of today, not of the future." He spoke of the divisions in the US that still frustrated climate action there after four years of the Trump presidency. "There is one thing that should transcend our day-today politics and geopolitics and that is climate change," he said. The talks are due to end on Friday but there is still no consensus on key issues, including how to increase climate financing for poor countries, how to regulate global trading in carbon credits, and how to standardise measuring and reporting rules to ensure transparency and accuracy in all countries' emissions. \</doc>

I HAVE been reading with interest the Belfast Telegraph's Environment in Focus coverage. I commend the paper for its efforts in developing the conversation on green issues. When it comes to smaller businesses in Northern Ireland, the British Business Bank expects 2022 to be the year when discussion on sustainability is translated into action. On the back of the Cop26 United Nations climate conference in Glasgow last year, and a greater focus from larger companies and the public sector, we expect to see more smaller businesses push forward on reducing their carbon footprint. Our recent Smaller Businesses and the Transition to Net Zero report found that smaller businesses account for around one-third - between 29% and 36% - of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The report also revealed that smaller businesses account for around half (50%) of UK business-driven emissions, the same proportion as larger businesses. While three quarters of businesses (76%) are yet to implement comprehensive decarbonisation strategies, capabilities and actions, it is encouraging to see that the vast majority (94%) say they have taken at least one action to reduce their emissions.

Irish Premier Micheal Martin has said that action on climate change must match the rhetoric, as he appeared at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. The Taoiseach joined other world leaders at the climate conference in Scotland, where he took the opportunity to defend Ireland's own record on climate action. The Irish government is preparing to publish the Climate Action Plan, which will provide greater detail on how the country plans to drastically cut carbon emissions over the next decade. That plan will be discussed by cabinet ministers this week. Mr Martin said it was ``imperative'' that the world responds to the challenge of climate change. ``I think economically we have to do what we're doing,'' he told reporters. ``Because it would not be economically sustainable to carry on the way we are carrying on nationally or globally, because the severe weather events that are happening are very disruptive.'' Carbon taxes, which have been criticised for hiking the cost of living for consumers, are a necessary way of both changing behaviour and funding the measures needed to tackle climate change, Mr Martin said. ``You do need to fund and the carbon tax over time will provide very substantial resources to enable us to do those things, as well as just transition,'' the Taoiseach said. ``I don't see why people would be against cleaner oceans and cleaner water, fresher air and a healthier lifestyle. And that's actually what we can develop,'' he said. Mr Martin rejected the suggestion that Ireland's own record on climate action rendered some of his own government's rhetoric ``hollow''. He said: ``I think there's been a step change since the new government was brought in. ``We've increased significantly the ambition. However, Mr Martin was unclear whether Ireland would be reducing methane emissions by 30% in the next decade, in line with agreed EU targets. He said: ``We do support that pledge. And we'll be signing that. That's a global pledge. ``It's a global pledge. It's not a country-specific pledge, in the sense that we will develop our Climate Action Plan which will give our specifics in respect to the sector. ``The specific manifestation of that in each country may differ because different countries have different challenges in that respect, or produce methane at different levels in different sectors.'' Mr Martin also confirmed that Ireland would be doubling its contribution to climate finance for developing countries impacted by climate change from around 93 million euros to 225 million euros by 2025. That promise was outlined in the Programme for Government agreed between Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Greens. Earlier, Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe said he will not pressure the US to do more to tackle climate change. He was speaking as US treasury secretary Janet Yellen arrived in Dublin for a series of engagements, including a meeting with Mr Donohoe. Mr Donohoe praised the close relationship between Ireland and Joe Biden's administration, but played down any suggestion he might ask the US to do more to reduce carbon emissions. ``I'll be reviewing where we are in Ireland with regards to how we want to reduce our carbon emissions. And I think when we all need to do so much together, I think we should shy away really from making lectures or describing difficulties that other countries may have,'' he said. ``President Biden and Secretary Yellen are very much aware of the obligation that the United States has to reduce its carbon emissions, as I am as a member of the Irish government for Ireland. ``And I think we'll be focusing on what we can do together and acknowledging the great difficulty that there are at times in executing what we want to do.'' Mr Donohoe said he will not be among the Irish ministers attending Cop26 . ``The Finance Bill for the Budget is beginning this week. That Finance Bill includes measures to increase carbon taxation. ``I believe these are the kinds of concrete and practical contributions we can make here in Ireland to how we do better from a carbon point of view, and the government will be represented by a range of other members of government during that time,'' he told RTE radio. ``The breadth of government ministers that are attending speaks to the importance that we place on what is happening in Glasgow. I need to bring in our budgetary legislation this week into the Dail, and given the fact that carbon taxation is a very important element of that, I think my time is best spent doing that.'' Mr Donohoe was asked whether he regretted overseeing the expansion of Ireland's dairy herd. ``If I look back on the last decade, and the many challenges that we have had and faced, the expansion of our dairy herd would not be one of the things that is a cause for the greatest anxiety for me, given all that we've gone through over the decades,'' he said. The minister declined to comment on the expectation that agriculture may be asked to cut emissions by between 20%-30% over the next decade, as part of Ireland's climate targets. ``It is the case that we will be asking our farmers to play a role, and an important role, in how we reduce our emissions. But we will be asking everybody to do that. And we're particularly conscious of the needs and challenges that (are) coupled with Irish farming,'' he said. end \</doc>

It seems everybody I meet and talk to at \' the Cop\' is connected to Ireland. I tried my first vegan cafe yesterday \- a feat never accomplished considering I\' m outnumbered by carnivores. Taking a break from the loud, colourful, but peaceful protests, I popped into The Glasvegan in St Enoch Square in an effort to get woke and down with the kids. A \' mac and cheze\' later, recommended by my server, I was pleasantly surprised. I\' m not too sure how highly processed some of the ham-ish flavours are, but it\' s modern cafe culture. You\' re Caledonian and woke when you see vegan haggis on the menu. Cop26 has worked its way into common parlance in the vegan establishment. The general question goes, \' are you here for the Cop\' and the usual answer is yes. My server, on finding out I was from Ireland \- and the north \- told me she had  lots of family in Newry . A woman walking down the street came up to me and asked was I from Belfast, informing me her husband was a native. My server at a Japanese restaurant was a student from Portadown. Back in the vegan cafe and I decided to buy a dairy-free cupcake and bun to bring back to my lovely host as a way of thanking her for looking after me for my brief but memorable stay. For a mere tenner a night, the Cop is accessible to all. Without Glaswegians like Kirsty Curror kindly opening up their hearts and homes to strangers, accommodation price hikes would make staying in Glasgow impossible. Kirsty, who works as a draughtsman, tells me \' the Cop\' is the main topic of discussion. Yesterday, it was activist Greta Thunberg meeting Nicola Sturgeon which was the main talking point in Kirsty\' s office. How a beaming Scottish first minister was met with a scowling, infuriated head of the protest movement at a photocall greatly amused the Glaswegian workmates. The squadrons of police drafted in from all around Britain is another big talking point among the locals. Kirsty described how her colleague couldn\' t believe the sight of almost every parking space being taken by a mass mobilisation of police vans and vehicles as she made her way into the office yesterday morning. We\' ll be more safe and secure when England\' s finest have had their Weetabix was the bemused response among shoppers. And I\' ve had my porridge so I\' m hitting the high road back to Cairnryan for my ferry to Belfast. All the best of luck for \' the Cop\' and saving our planet to all in Glasgow. \</doc>

The world's 20 richest nations should more than double their annual spending to protect and restore nature to $285 billion by 2050, the United Nations and donors said today. The UN also called for private and overseas investments to be ramped up too. In a first joint report on finance for nature in the G20 countries, they estimated that spending by the bloc - which includes large emerging economies - was $120 billion in 2020. Co-author Ivo Mulder, who heads the climate finance unit at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said the report's focus on the G20 and nature funding gaps could help those rich nations that have shown political leadership on the issue in recent months, including at the COP26 climate summit. "The amount of money being invested in nature-based solutions is not nearly enough," Mulder told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "I would hope that G20 countries can lead by example and they're not doing that at the moment," he added. The report looked at how wealthy nations can better tackle the planet's climate, biodiversity and land degradation crises, such as by promoting sustainable farming and supply chains, or creating green spaces in cities to tackle rising heat. Stepping up protection for natural areas, such as oceans and forests, is seen as vital to maintaining the ecosystems on which humans depend, and to limiting global warming to internationally agreed targets. Dozens of countries pledged to do more to conserve nature and make farming greener at November's COP26 UN climate talks ,including a commitment by more than 100 nations to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Last year, a UN report said global funding for nature conservation needed to triple this decade to about $350 billion a year by 2030 and rise to more than $536 billion by 2050. The new study said the spending gap was larger and more difficult to bridge outside the G20 group of countries - not helped by the fact that only 2% of the G20's $120-billion investment in 2020 was directed towards overseas aid. Funding from G20 nations represented 92% of all global investment in nature, the report found, with the vast majority of this government money - 87%, or $105 billion - allocated to programmes inside their own borders, the report said. Finance from the private sector also remains small at 11% of the G20 total, or $14 billion a year, even though it contributes about 60% of gross domestic product in most G20 countries. The report's authors called on the G20 to grab opportunities to boost their international investment in things like restoring degraded land and ecosystems, which can often be cheaper and more efficient than similar nature-based projects at home. The report also noted that more than $14.6 trillion was spent by 50 leading economies in 2020 to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, of which only $368 billion, or 2%, was considered "green". Governments need to "build back better" instead of following normal spending patterns after the Covid-19 crisis, it added. Mulder said the report's findings could help government on their COP26 pledges and push forward with efforts to finalise a new global pact to halt and reverse biodiversity loss in Kunming, China, later this year. Companies and financial institutions should fully disclose climate and nature-related financial risks, he added, while governments should re-purpose agricultural subsidies that harm nature, introduce trade-related tariffs on similarly damaging goods, and set a floor for forest carbon prices. "The climate and nature crisis are two sides of the same coin," said Justin Adams, director for nature-based solutions at the World Economic Forum, which co-led the report. "We can't turn things around unless we transform our economic models and market systems to take nature's full value into account," he stated. \</doc>

The Irish premier, Micheal Martin, has warned that "time is ticking" for action on climate change. He cited progress in "all countries bar one or two", acknowledging the existential nature of the threat, and commending President Joe Biden for bringing the US onboard. "The United States with President Biden at the helm with the European Union together have really driven increased momentum now in the last year or two, I take great hope from that because if you look at the last four years, the United States were out of the equation, they had come out of the Paris accord, now they're back in, now they're driving the agenda. That's positive," he told RTE. "The problem is time and time is ticking. "That would be a concern, that some countries are still too slow in reacting to this, and we ourselves have to speed up and accelerate our action in terms of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions."

"There is a real sense of urgency here, the young people have spoken, they want political leaders to act, they want societies to change their behaviour, and the positive thing is that it can bring a lot of benefits - cleaner waterways, cleaner air and a healthier lifestyle all round if we make the change in behaviour, move away from fossil fuels into renewables, public transport and a better way of living our lives," he said.

Minister for the Environment and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has expressed confidence that Cop26 will end with an agreement that keeps alive the goal of limiting global warming since the industrial revolution to below 1.5 degrees. Speaking to reporters in Glasgow yesterday as the summit ran over its scheduled time and delegates continued to negotiate, Mr Ryan said he believed the final text would be reasonably ambitious. "My sense of the negotiations is they're not in a bad place because the ambition is not being scaled back. Certain things are slightly weakened, but it's not fundamentally been weakened." Mr Ryan acknowledged that the commitments made in Glasgow were not enough to reach the target of 1.5 degrees even if they were fulfilled, but he hoped the meeting would help to accelerate movement towards that goal. He said he understood why many of the activists outside the conference centre were angry and disappointed by the summit's failure to agree on more radical steps to reach the 1.5 degrees target. "There's always an issue about political science as well as climate science, not just like in our own country but in every country. How do you get people to change their livelihoods? "I was talking to the Indian transport minister as an example of this the other day, and he said 'I have 30 million people working in transport in the current system. How am I going to switch them?' That's a reality as well. And those people in climate justice are absolutely right. They say you have to have a just transition, but that's a reality. That's why you have to get 200 countries together and then each country and the government has to get re-elected while doing this, and that is a real challenge," he said. 'Change is difficult' "If we'd started this 20 years ago we'd have been in a very much easier glide path but we didn't. Why didn't we? Because change is difficult. People, particularly those whose livelihoods are connected to the current system, are nervous about change." Mr Ryan said that among the most valuable outcomes from Cop26 was the message it sent to people in Ireland about the direction the world was moving in and what would be required for success. "In my mind the most important thing is that there's a clear message and a clear understanding to everyone: okay, this is the way the world is going. That's what you need out of it, it's kind of a signal to everyone at home that this is where we go now." European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans suggested that the EU could offer more funding to help poorer countries deal with the impact of climate change and fund the changes they need to make. However, Kevin Conrad, chief negotiator for Papua New Guinea, said the EU's rhetoric was not matched by its actions. "The European Union makes grand statements about commitment to adaptation, commitment to a lot of things, but when you look in the text they are part of the group that is unwinding anything solid when it comes to commitments or anything that is automatic in terms of contributions," he said. "It's nice to talk about something, but unless a developing country feels certainty that they are going to be helped it's just words." US climate envoy John Kerry told the summit that the 20 countries that account for 80 per cent of the world's emissions had the greatest responsibility and must live up to it. "Climate change is an existential threat today and people are dying today. All around the world the impacts are being felt today. We have to live up to the expectations of young people that don't want this to just be a place of words. It has to be in the next hour a place of action." \</doc>

A group of local primary school children, accompanied by their parents, holding up hand-drawn signs . A young girl draws a sign for me, pencil on a notebook, an eye. The eyes of the world indeed are on Glasgow during these two weeks. "We should not be here", a sign reads, "Unfk our future!", another. It expresses what many young people feel: Fear for their future - and in many places, the present - and the knowledge that something needs to happen now. "Change is possible, Covid showed us that", a young man from the US tells me . A series of speakers take their turn on stage. The variety of their contributions illustrate how large, wide-reaching, and complex the issue of climate change is. Inequalities experienced in other social issues are also reflected in attempts to address climate change: Poorer communities are more excluded and more strongly affected; globally the less industrialised regions of the world in the global south, with the least CO2 emissions are most strongly impacted by climate change . Last to speak, Greta Thunberg takes the stage and-criticising the lack of real impact of previous COPs and pledges The scene inside the Scottish Event Centre is quite different: Hustling and bustling to the point of being nearly overwhelming, but also very much activity, discussions, negotiations, and business. There are about 2,000 official country delegates, party members, and observers from different NGOs - from UN Climate Networks to Universities - are trying to find their way to the different side events, meetings, and discussions. There is a good amount of youth representation, too, for the first time in the history of COP events . Those involved in the negotiations have a bit over one week remaining to agree on what will be a historic decision, for better or worse . It's been a very busy week, and what has been achieved is significant: The combined effect of the commitment by India to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and the pledge to cut methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030, signed by over 100 countries (including Ireland) were both important . Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas emitted from oil and gas fields, from landfilled rubbish and from agriculture. The good news is that, as it only stays in the atmosphere for a relatively short time, the warming process can be slowed quite quickly and effectively by reducing methane . Similar pledges have been made to phase out coal, and to stop deforestation. Significant contributions have been made towards the previously agreed commitment of $ 100bn ((EURO)86bn) per year from wealthier countries in climate financing to aid poorer countries to support their efforts to reduce emissions. Despite these achievements, the race for the necessary greenhouse gas reductions to limit global warming to 1.5C will be a close one. The latest estimates are that the combined effect of the pledges may get us to 1.8C (quite a shift from the 2.7C reported before COP26 ) . Of course, these pledges need to be translated into national legislation - in a fair way - and then implemented. For this to work out, we need to think globally, and act locally . Although Ireland is a small country, our national greenhouse gas emissions are among the highest in Europe. If the countries in similar situations work on this too, we can achieve a significant amount in greenhouse gas reductions . And we need both aspects - communities and policies - to work together . If this doesn't happen, COP 26 will be just, as Greta put it, more 'blah blah blah' . Life/Style: 12 \</doc>

It Is sometimes hard to keep a promise. Especially if it is going to cost you and there's no-one actually checking whether you're sticking to your word. And when you boil it right down, that is what COP26 is all about. Countries know they need to act to avoid the worst of the climate crisis, the science has never been clearer. But if they cut out greenhouse gases, it will mean tough choices as part of that transition; choices that citizens will struggle to accept around energy, transport and food production. And that is an uncomfortable place for a politician to be as they eye up the next election. Countries are making pledges on cutting emissions here. The point of this global summit is to get those nailed down and add an accountability mechanism that locks them in. I have heard someone say Glasgow will not be a "Eureka" moment, it will be a meeting that leads to more meetings. The rallying call coming into this summit was "Paris set the target, Glasgow must deliver". But what will it deliver? Well, it will depend on the final text of the communique. But going on the draft, which is the basis for negotiations, it will attempt to secure deeper emissions' cuts than have already been pledged. It will also try to increase the cash available for developing countries to transition out of fossil fuel dependency and adapt to the climate impacts they are already suffering from. And for the first time there is talk of compensation for countries - like the small island states here - who are watching their land mass being surrendered to rising seas. Getting the finance deal right here will be crucial. It greases the wheels of all the other parts. If you are India and dependant on coal for power, how do you move out of fossil fuels if you can not afford an alternative fuel mix? If you are a low-lying island and you can not afford to build sea defences, what choice do you have other than to begin to abandon your homeland? HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate news The truth is that the money being talked about here for this kind of work is peanuts. The UN talks in terms of providing billions. The emerging and vulnerable countries say it will take trillions. It seems an unbridgeable gap. A senior politician from the island state of Tuvalu - a low lying Pacific Island, addressed the COP conference up to his knees in seawater to make a powerful point about rising sea levels. Where he stood had once been dry land. And that is the thing about COP. For developed northern hemisphere nations this is mostly about the financial implications of eradicating fossil fuels - the bedrock of thriving economies. For the global south, it is often about life and death of citizens and like Tuvalu, the destruction of an entire way of life. On the way to the conference centre one morning, we shared a taxi with a couple of delegates and got chatting. Wanjira Mathai is vice president and regional director Africa of the World Resources Institute. She is also what is called a Friend of COP26 , one of a body of people who advise COP President Alok Sharma. And she has a big focus on developed countries, which caused global warming, living up to their responsibilities to those who are suffering from it. Vulnerable countries and indigenous people have a right not to have to carry the financial burden of trying to adapt, she says. "Anchored on this process is trust. If we lose the trust, then we lose everything. The negotiating process has trust as one of the biggest casualties if we do not make good on some of those commitments," she said. She says the key things from Glasgow will be technically dense, difficult to explain, and ultimately very important. For her, it is back to the issue of trust. It is building a system of reporting and measuring emissions that's transparent and where everyone is working to the same timeframe, instead of the pick and mix approach which appears to hold now. That gives countries confidence that everyone is on a level playing field - not hiding behind some impervious accounting mechanism which allows polluters to pull a fast one and gain an economic advantage. As the talks continued into Friday night, it started to feel like everyone was looking for a soft landing. This is a process based on consensus, and with 197 parties to the treaty to placate, we can but imagine the shuttle diplomacy involved into the small hours. A diplomatic source suggested that people were a little confused about the purpose of Glasgow. It was not to negotiate a new treaty, they said, it was to finalise the implementation of the one agreed at Paris in 2015. What countries had committed to was coming forward with targets for cutting emissions out to 2030 with the aim of limiting global warming. They saw some positives, promises from countries which had not publicly agreed a position before. And ofcourse the early slew of pledges on cutting methane, coal and ending deforestation. There is spin in all this of course. The people who have invested so much political capital in this summit want to be able to be hail it a success. Set against that is the climate experts who have been pointing out that the cuts do not go anywhere near far enough to meet the Paris targets of keeping warming well below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. So now it falls to bank the Glasgow wins - some very important - and build on them for the next COP. The EU's Frans Timmermans, its chief climate negotiator, has said the intention is that new emissions reductions brought forward in the near future will mean the path to 1.5C of warming is still alive. That would mean the world to Tuvalu and other threatened nations. But they will be looking for product from the developed countries not more promises. \</doc>

NOW that COP26 While there has been progress, with the critical climate change crisis placed firmly on the global agenda, we are still on course for 2.4 degrees warming. There is deep disappointment that powerful states did not go that extra step to steer current and future generations to safety. For example, Tr\'f3caire was particularly disappointed at the omission of Loss and Damage financing from the final COP26 agreement. This was a missed opportunity by the powerful nations, who have contributed most to climate change, to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities to rebuild after climate disasters. However, it is vital that we don't lose heart. Now that the focus will move to other issues, it is critical that momentum created by COP26 is not lost. It is up to all of us to build on the achievements secured, to bridge the gaps and to pressure decision-makers at home and abroad to continue to act with the urgency that is required. It is easy to label COP26 a cop-out, but a lot can and must be achieved before nations reconvene in Egypt for COP27. Ireland can play its part. We must not forget the millions in the global south who are most impacted by the climate crisis and whose young people are now mobilising to demand change. They have done least to cause this crisis.

At the Cop26 But could Greta Thunberg be wrong? Could these five-yearly festivals of disappointment, where agreements fall short both in ambition and execution, still be the world's best hope of avoiding climate catastrophe? At a demonstration in Glasgow last week, she said that change would not come from inside the conference centre and that it was on the streets that real leadership was to be found. "We say no more blah blah blah, no more exploitation of people and nature and the planet. No more exploitation. No more blah blah blah. No more whatever the f they are doing inside there," she said. It's not easy, even from inside the conference centre, to work out "whatever the f they are doing" and the most important meetings happen behind closed doors and beyond deepening layers of security. The venue itself is a study in alienation, so vast that one German journalist noted that his daily step count was higher than during a walking holiday in the summer. Social distancing and hygiene measures that are a throwback to the early months of the coronavirus pandemic add to the atmosphere of discomfort and awkwardness. A shortage of chairs and desks sees delegates, activists and reporters sitting on the floor of cold, hangar-like spaces, or perched on the sides of tables as they peer into their laptops. By the end of the second week, everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning, nobody has tasted a fresh vegetable since October and the mood has curdled. Billboards around the conference centre show images of pristine snow or solar panels with the single word "now", which is precisely when most of the people who pass them would like to go home. Those billboards capture something of the curious spirit of climate negotiations, which are dominated by abstract language even as they focus on concrete actions to prevent real catastrophe. Ask one of the participants what they hope the conference will produce and they will say something like "solidarity, credibility and ambition". Mood shift Key concepts such as mitigation (reducing greenhouse gases), adaptation (making infrastructure more resilient to the impact of climate change) and loss and damage (compensation for damage caused by climate-related events such as storms and flooding) remain obscure to most outsiders. Even the central goal of "keeping 1.5 alive" is little understood (it means ensuring that the global temperature does not rise by more than 1.5 degrees compared with the middle of the 19th century). There is no established rule for how decisions are made at climate conferences but the practice is that they are taken by consensus, which means that the pace can be set by the least willing. The British presidency of Cop26 sought to circumvent this by starting the conference with a series of multinational announcements on forests, methane emissions and finance. But after the leaders left Glasgow early last week and the negotiations moved into a more technical phase, the initial mood of confidence gave way first to frustration and later to pessimism. It was clear by the middle of this week that the summit's participants would not be able to agree on commitments that would bring them anywhere close to 1.5 degrees and attention turned to securing an agreement to meet again in a year or two with improved offers of action at a national level. Meanwhile, scientific experts and climate activists have pointed out that there is less to some of the summit's most high-profile announcements than meets the eye. A commitment to end deforestation by 2030 restates a goal first identified at a summit in 2014, a methane emissions pledge was already announced two months ago and state-controlled companies such as Coal India and Saudi Aramco could evade curbs on coal and oil. But this year's deforestation pledge is different because big players such as Brazil and Indonesia have signed up to it, and the initiative on methane backed by the US and the European Union has the support of more than 100 countries. Separately, the US and China - the world's two biggest carbon emitters - have agreed to co-operate on "concrete and pragmatic" regulations to decarbonise, cut methane emissions and fight deforestation. As it entered its final hours, Cop26 looked unlikely to resolve disagreements over how a carbon trading system should work but the summit saw other initiatives to direct financial markets away from fossil fuels and towards clean technology. Like all its predecessors, Cop26 will be a disappointment, delivering too little too slowly and with inadequate mechanisms to guarantee that promises are kept. But if today's situation is compared with that in Paris six years ago rather than with an ideal scenario, there are grounds for modest optimism. It was pressure from small island states in Paris that pushed the industrialised countries to consider shifting their goal from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees. In Glasgow, the more ambitious goal has been at the centre of the negotiations and it is accepted by most participants as essential. Emissions have been falling in some developed countries, even if they continue to rise elsewhere and China's will continue to increase for a number of years before peaking by 2030. National plans to cut emissions may not go far enough but they are more ambitious than before and many, such as Ireland's, are enshrined in law. Among the most important changes has been in the attitude of the financial sector, which will not only make financing harmful industries more difficult and expensive but demonstrates that the world of finance recognises the political imperative of dealing with climate change. What has happened since Paris and been accelerated in Glasgow is nothing less than a reorientation of global capitalism towards a carbon neutral future. Economic actors led by the US, China and the EU will make the shift in different ways and at a different pace but the change of direction and increase of urgency are unmistakable. And that amounts to more than blah blah blah. \</doc>

Glasgow is bracing for a second day of protests against what campaigners say is a lack of urgency to address global warming, after Greta Thunberg labelled the crunch UN climate summit there a "failure". More than 200 events are planned worldwide to demand immediate action for communities already affected by climate change, particularly in poorer countries in the south. In Australia, protesters in Sydney and Melbourne dressed as lumps of coal or Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a vigorous defender of the mining industry, labelled the talks as "a sham" and their national leader "an absolute embarrassment." "No more blah, blah blah. Real climate action now," read one sign at a protest in Sydney. In Glasgow, organisers and police said they expect up to 50,000 people to parade through the streets of the Scottish city near the COP26 summit venue, which is under tight security. Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. At the halfway stage of the COP26 negotiations, some countries have signed up to pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with separate deals on phasing out coal, ending foreign fossil fuel funding and slashing methane. The promises followed a major assessment that showed global CO2 emissions are set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels. Activists were unimpressed during yesterday's march. "This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival." Security has been boosted around Glasgow's locked down city centre ahead of today's march, which is expected to draw a variety of groups including Extinction Rebellion. "Many thousands of us are marching right across the world today to demand immediate and serious action," said Scottish activist Mikaela Loach. "We're clear that warm words are not good enough, and that the next week of talks must see a serious ramping up of concrete plans." COP26 negotiations will continue today before taking a pause on Sunday ahead of what is shaping up to be a frantic week of shuttle diplomacy, as ministers arrive to push through hard-fought compromises on a number of issues. Countries still need to flesh out how pledges made in the Paris deal work in practice, including rules governing carbon markets, common reporting timeframes and transparency. Countries came into COP26 with national climate plans that, when brought together, put Earth on course to warm 2.7C this century, according to the UN. With just 1.1C of warming so far, communities across the world are already facing ever more intense fire and drought, displacement and economic ruin wrought by global heating. Brianna Fruean, a Samoan member of the Pacific Climate Warriors, who addressed a world leaders' summit at the start of COP26 , said it was time for leaders to take note of protesters' demands. "It can't go on like this," she said. "We refuse to be just victims to this crisis. We are not drowning, we are fighting and on Saturday the world will hear us."

Good scientists aren't prone to hyperbole, typically detesting media sensationalism and anti-intellectual rhetoric, so when some of the world's finest minds say we're hurtling towards self-destruction, it's worth paying attention. This isn't the first rodeo for the hundreds of scientists across the world forming the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). How long, how long must they sing their song, before world leaders and the public listen to their grim words? The planet has already passed the point of no return for some of the effects of climate change and has a narrow window to avoid even further pain for billions of people. While to some it may sound like sensationalism and doom-mongering, the 34,000 cited references in the IPCC report put together by professors, doctors, and other experts tell a different story - this is pure science. IPCC co-chair Professor Debra Roberts said: "Our report clearly indicates that places where people live and work may cease to exist, that ecosystems and species that we've all grown up with and that are central to our cultures and inform our languages may disappear." Academia, for all its faults, has no time for sentiment - the conclusions are based on cold, clear, and unambiguous evidence. "Increased heatwaves, droughts, and floods are already exceeding plants' and animals' tolerance thresholds, driving mass mortalities in species such as trees and corals. "These weather extremes are occurring simultaneously, causing cascading impacts that are increasingly difficult to manage. They have exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity, especially in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, on small islands and in the Arctic," the IPCC says in its latest findings. Bear in mind, this is less than eight months since its previously grim projections of passing 1.5C global warming, and less than four months since world leaders at Glasgow's Cop26 climate change summit pledged to co-operate to radically reduce global emissions in the coming decades. How long, how long must they sing their song? Cop26 , we have a US Congress strangled by political posturing from a maddeningly anti-science Republican Party, and a ruling Democratic party held to ransom by two of its own senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who are blocking President Joe Biden's already weakened climate mitigation package from passing into legislation. In Europe, we are seeing emissions return to almost pre-pandemic levels and, closer to home, there has been no consensus on tackling emissions from agriculture in Ireland because of the political fallout. More pressingly, the IPCC report this week must fight for every inch of newspaper space and every minute of television time due to the actions of a reckless Russian president in his neighbouring Ukraine. Poignantly, the tragedy of Ukrainian refugees will be replicated over and over again in the future as communities all over the world are forced from their lands because of a force even more powerful than Russian tanks and mortars - the force of climate change. It is also sad that Russia's dominant position when it comes to oil and gas has emboldened President Vladimir Putin's imperial ambitions, gambling that he would ride out the storm geopolitically because of the West's reliance on fossil fuel. If environmental factors weren't reason enough to strive for a renewable energy future, then geopolitical reasons have now bolstered the case. Unfortunately, the perilous change in climate doesn't hang around for political cycles. It doesn't stop for peace talks or ceasefires. Hurricanes don't take breaks to go campaigning, monsoon rains don't stop for election day. Climate change just marches on, growing stronger from the insidious energy that humans feed it. It's the people living on it, and the animals and creatures that most of us profess to love and cherish. \</doc>

TODAY we kick off a week-long series in the Belfast Telegraph focusing on the climate crisis and how it affects Northern Ireland. In this series we will look at stories, big and small, across the country which touch on the environment. The intention is not to tell readers what you should or should not think, but rather highlight the issues and try and answer some of the questions - no matter how trivial they seem. When we initially planned this initiative, we did not know that fears over nuclear safety would be heightened with Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. If anything, Vladimir Putin's action makes it even more crucial that we face up to the increased challenges. War in Europe and the West's subsequent sanctions have massive implications, not just when it comes to the nuclear debate, but in terms of agriculture, trade, travel and of course energy supply. This tiny part of the world can feel even smaller when you realise the enormity of the climate challenge facing all of humankind. Northern Ireland has a role to play but cannot act in isolation. This is a global crisis that requires a global response, and the world's richest countries must take the lead. The Belfast Telegraph is part of Mediahuis, and as a group we want to reduce our CO2 emissions by more than 50% by 2030. To do so, we are examining the printing and distribution of our newspapers, the energy-efficiency of our offices and our transport. It's a big challenge for us, as it is all big media organisations. We start today at the political end of the spectrum and Environment Minster Edwin Poots outlines his plans. We are in election mode in Northern Ireland so columnist Rosalind Skillen, who was a youth delegate at Cop26 last year, highlights the questions we need to ask our Assembly candidates when they come around campaigning for our votes. Whether we think we have an interest or not, decisions made by our politicians on climate will affect our lives, whether they target net zero emissions by 2045 or 2050, or any other point in the future. It makes sense to be ready with the right questions. So today you'll find a few pointers to quite literally hold those vying for power to account. Even those who wear their environmental credentials proudly need to be challenged about how the public - already struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living - can be expected to pay the bills which transitioning to a more green society will bring. But there's so much more than just politics involved. Food, fashion, waste, transport, the weather - these are all key parts of any debate on the environment. We'll highlight the work local organisations are doing to reduce their carbon footprints across all sections of the Belfast Telegraph, from news to sport, business to features. A great example of this is the work being done at Dromore Rugby Club, where clubman Peter Dickson started to think about his team's impact on the environment given the trips they would have to make over a season to places like Enniskillen and Clogher Valley. Peter's experience in the corporate world and the emphasis on sustainability and the responsibilities that go with that led Dromore to initiate a scheme whereby they now plant trees to offset the carbon footprint of the first team's away trips. There are thousands of examples of initiatives like that all over Northern Ireland and we'll highlight some of them in the coming days. We'll also take a look at the RHI scandal - and examine the devastating impact it had, aside from the politics, on the environment here. Lots of the debate about climate change and the environment has been limited to that: debate. In the run-up to Cop26 , campaigner Greta Thunberg summed it up as a lot of "blah, bah, blah". Well, hopefully over the coming days you'll find a bit more than "blah, blah, blah" in our coverage, and instead it will spark conversations over what we should do and how we should go about it. This is another global crisis we cannot afford to ignore. If we bury our heads in the sand long enough, we'll just be washed away. \</doc>

Indigenous people whose island homes are sinking underwater due to climate change have marched on the Cop26 venue in Glasgow asking delegates to help "heal the legacy of colonialism". Groups from Panama, Amazonia, Patagonia, and Alaska, and the wider USA were joined by activists as they progressed through the streets to the sound of drums and wood pipes. They marched from Glasgow Green along the Clyde to the Cop26 campus, where they were initially denied access. A small number of the indigenous people were shortly afterwards allowed into the conference where they planned on meeting with the president of Cop26 , Alok Sharma. Agar Iklenia Tejada, 31, came to Glasgow from Panama and is a member of the Guna people, who live largely on islands off the coast. She started crying when speaking about the plight of her home. "Three of our islands are already underwater," she said. "We are moving from the islands to the mountains or the coasts already." She added: "One of the islands is the one that I was born in and grew up in, so it's very emotional to even talk about it." She said her grandmothers are refusing to leave the partially submerged island, and that the loss of her home makes her angry. "However, we are going to keep fighting to conserve and preserve our traditions, our origin, and who we are," she said. She said people are polluting, mining for gold, and cutting down trees. "All of these things affect the everyday life that we have on the islands," she said. Agar brought the largest ever "mola" - a traditional hand-sewn cloth applique unique to the Guna people - to Glasgow with the help of the NGO Geoversity Foundation. She and her fellow indigenous people carried it through Glasgow's streets to the venue for the global conference. Machi Jorge Kilakeo, of the Mapuche Nation in Chile, said they had come to Cop26 with their "hearts open". "We are here to heal the legacy of colonialism and invisibility and violence," he said. \</doc>

Mr Martin told the summit that Ireland's policies reflect the country's confidence that the aim of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees can be achieved with fairness, adding that legally binding targets will ensure Ireland will reduce emissions and reach climate neutrality by 2050. The Taoiseach's comments come as scores of countries, including Ireland as part of the EU, joined a pledge to https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/cop26-scores-of-countries-pledge-to-cut-methane-emissions-by-30-by-2030-1208108.html cut their methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade.

David Attenborough rolled back decades of his 95 years to give a passionate, scientifically gripping speech at the opening ceremony, appealing to the dignitaries present to roll back the decades of carbon emissions. Few can command an audience like he can. Like so many things that should have been started years ago, his campaigning now sparks regret he didn't shout at us sooner. Boris Johnson crammed so many sporting and James Bond metaphors into his numerous speeches that several translators attempting to convey the meaning to disparate cultures in diverse languages without causing diplomatic incidents are now in therapy. Only part of that statement is untrue. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, was one of just nine female heads of state out of more than 120, but she hands down won the best speaker award. Mottley's "code red" speech attacked the priorities of the global north, shredded central bank bean counters and finance ministers' follies and warned: "Leaders must not fail those who elect them to lead." No one complained that her speech was almost three times longer than the allotted time. Greta Thunberg made a cheeky appearance at an impromptu Fridays for Future gathering where she was filmed telling COP26 organisers they could shove their event up their arse. Thunberg wasn't invited as a guest by the UK government but she is a registered participant so can prowl the venue at will and she snuck into a panel discussion on carbon offsets - buying your way out of emissions cuts - to express her disapproval. She later led 25,000 young campaigners on the official Fridays for Future march through the city and declared the negotiations already a failure. Leonardo DiCaprio turned DiCOPrio as he swept into town to join in Joe Biden's big global methane pledge announcement. He popped up at several fringe events and restaurants around the city, posing for photos with grinning Glaswegians and no doubt enduring one joke too many about sinking ships. Jeff Bezos won the total lack of self-awareness award by telling the audience at a speaking engagement that he really appreciated the beauty and fragility of Earth when he viewed it from a window on his journey into space. Let's just say, his spacecraft is not an electric model. Vinisha Umashankar is a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Tamil Nadu, India, who invented a solar-powered mobile ironing cart to replace the charcoal models used in low-income communities by households without electricity. Her innovation and technical knowhow are one thing; her proclamations on climate and inequality are another. And her maturity in speaking to gatherings of the world's powerful is astounding. There's a temptation to look for the new Greta, but Vinisha is very much her own person and someone we'll be hearing a lot more from. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin managed to stamp their names on proceedings by not turning up. The Chinese and Russian presidents lead two of the world's top four carbon polluting countries, so their input would be useful. There's still a week left though and FOMO might get to them yet. \</doc>

The issue for the Cop26 Global Leaders' Summit on climate change is "matching the rhetoric with action", Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has said. Mr Martin is joining world leaders in Glasgow today and tomorrow for the summit, which has been billed as a make-or-break chance to save the planet from the most calamitous effects of climate change. Delayed by a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Cop26 (or the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties) aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels - the limit scientists say would avoid its most destructive consequences. Yesterday, Mr Martin said "There's no alternative facing the world but to deal very quickly and urgently with the climate change challenge." He said the climate crisis is an "existential threat" for young people and the next generation, and "it's absolutely essential that every country plays its part. And that means Ireland as well." He was "hopeful that we can achieve a positive outcome out of Cop26 ", he said, when asked his view on the expectation that the agreement reached by leaders at the conference will be weak. He said the fact that the United States, under President Joe Biden, had signed up to the Paris agreement "gives a very good platform and safety net to the carbon Cop26 ", and the US is "creating a new momentum with the European Union to become even more ambitious".

As the clock ticks down to the start of Cop26 , the challenges facing efforts to deliver action to avert dangerous climate change are coming into sharp focus. The summit, taking place in Glasgow from tomorrow, has no global treaty to agree - unlike the last major UN climate conference in Paris in 2015. But it is being described as the conference that must deliver on the Paris Agreement and its key pledge to limit global warming to well below 2C or 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. The talks come in the wake of "code red" scientific warnings on the climate crisis and the risk of going over 1.5C of warming, and severe climate-related weather extremes from heatwaves in the US to deadly flooding in Europe and China. Earlier this week, UN scientists warned the build-up of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had sped up and hit record levels in 2020. The UN has also warned that the latest national action plans and pledges from countries to tackle emissions up to 2030 are far off what is needed to limit dangerous warming, and put the world on track for temperature rises of 2.7C. So a key factor in making Glasgow a "success" is keeping the pathway to 1.5C within reach by increasing climate action in this decade, with more national efforts from countries, progress on areas such as coal and saving forests, and a process to ensure countries take more action in the next few years. It is a goal made arguably harder by the latest climate plan submitted by China on Thursday, which does not increase its ambition beyond existing announcements. There is also the question of the long-promised $100bn a year from 2020-2025 for poorer nations to develop cleanly and adapt to the changing climate, and negotiations to finalise the last bits of how the Paris Agreement will work. It has emerged developed countries will not deliver on the $100bn goal until 2023, although around $500bn of climate finance will be provided over five years to 2025. Peter Betts, former lead negotiator for the EU, and the UK, at UN climate talks, said: "Defining success in Glasgow is harder than it was in Paris, where we had a treaty to wave at the end. "Success in Glasgow is more about implementation and action." He said that on efforts to curb warming "we need very substantial step-ups in countries' emission reduction plans, coupled with serious sectoral coalitions on issues like finance and coal, and a road map to more ambition raising in the coming years. "On finance it means the $100bn goal being met, with better delivery for the most vulnerable including on adaptation," adding he expected developing countries to press for discussion on the delay to the delivery of the promised funding in Glasgow. Importantly, he said, the Paris Cop21 was successful - despite insufficient commitments - because people saw governments were serious and that drove action. "We need the same boost to momentum from Glasgow". Nick Mabey, chief executive and co-founder of E3G climate think tank, said the biggest hurdle to success would be whether enough had been put on the table - particularly from China given its disappointing new action plan - to give confidence there had been enough progress towards 1.5C. And whatever is committed by countries and sectoral deals, it will not be enough, so a process is needed to come back sooner than expected to raise efforts in the face of starker scientific evidence on climate dangers, he said. "It's about the pace of change. Yes, we are changing, that's very clear, but we have to go faster because the climate risks are worse," he said. He added it was right of the UK to push for keeping the 1.5C goal within reach at the Glasgow talks, and it was up to countries to decide if they wanted to pursue it. World leaders will kick-start the summit by setting out the domestic action they are taking, although key players will be missing including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. But a year's delay to the talks as a result of the pandemic has allowed for the election of a new US president, Joe Biden, who has announced a net zero goal, and a significant boost to climate finance - and will attend the summit. All G7 leading industrialised nations have targets to hit net zero emissions - needed by mid-century globally to meet the 1.5C goal - along with major polluters such as China, and in the past few days from the likes of Saudi Arabia and Australia, though critics question how robust these targets are. And they do not solve the problem of the need for far greater action in the 2020s - seen as the "decisive decade" for putting the world on the right track to 1.5C or even "well below" 2C - with the UK the only major economy judged as being close to having plans in line with what is needed. British prime minister Boris Johnson has admitted it is "touch and go" whether key goals of the summit could be met. Statements from blocs of countries ahead of the talks suggests fault lines that will be familiar to anyone who has attended UN climate conferences in the past - along questions over which countries should take what action and how it should be paid for. G20 countries which have not brought forward new or updated plans - or ones that are insufficient - are under pressure from others to increase action. But leading emerging economies, including India and China, have pushed back against efforts to get all countries to adopt net zero targets for 2050, saying developed countries should do more. Meanwhile, countries most threatened by climate change want a "climate emergency pact" that includes finance and a process that sees countries - particularly big emitters - come forward every year with additional ambition. Then there are the negotiations on the final - thorny - issues of carbon markets and transparency under the Paris Agreement, not to mention the logistical challenges of holding a global summit of 25,000 people while the pandemic rages.

Ireland and Britain have huge potential to work together in fields such as renewable energy and agricultural technology as the nations tackle climate change obligations post- Cop26 . Mr Johnston acknowledged tensions between London and Dublin over Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. "I think the two Governments want to have a really strong relationship," he told the Irish Examiner . "The societies, economies, and their people are so intertwined that I think we see very common agendas. If you look at the emphasis on the Irish Government's national development plan, so much of it overlaps with what our government is trying to do in its levelling-up agenda." It is vitally important that Ireland and Britain work closely together in the fight to combat climate change, and preserving democracies across the world, he said. Renewable energy, digital health, and other areas of co-operation have "tremendous potential", he added. The ambassador said he closely followed UCC's engagement at Cop26 , and was shown its sustainable communities mural by Cork-based artist Kevin O'Brien. " Cop26 offers an opportunity for communities to engage with each other on an issue that confronts us all and it was wonderful to see the UCC delegation taking part," he said. "I can see first hand the university's strong climate action agenda and its commitment to tackling the climate crisis. "I look forward to exploring further how UCC and the British Embassy can work together beyond Cop26 UCC was the only Irish university with official observer status at Cop26 . The delegation of nine researchers and students made their way to Glasgow by rail and boat, instead of using planes and cars. The UCC delegation consisted of experts in carbon emissions and budgets, transport, societal change, sustainable cities, air and water pollution, and energy efficiency. More than 400 researchers work on climate change at UCC's Environmental Research Institute. UCC president John O'Halloran said: "We share the same objective in securing our future and we can only secure our future by winning hearts and minds though research and collaboration. "As a research-intensive university, we commit to use the knowledge emanating from research to address the welfare of humankind and the global environment, taking into account our responsibility, not only to present but also to future generations." \</doc>

THE surge in energy prices as reflected at the petrol pump and in the cost of heating our homes is hitting families hard. It is also causing problems for those organisations such as NI Water which provide essential services. We are the biggest user of electricity locally, and since the price we pay is linked to the global price of gas, our costs have soared in the last year. Rather than being a source of stability guaranteeing security of supply, fossil fuel prices have now become highly volatile, and are likely to remain so. The lesson is increasingly clear. Creating an indigenous renewable energy system is no longer just an aspiration - it has become an economic necessity. As the recent series of articles published by the Belfast Telegraph demonstrated, there are many different ways to achieve this in different sectors of the economy, and NI Water is ready to play our part. Last November at the time of the Cop26 Climate Change Conference we published the Power of Water report, which set out how we could act as a catalyst for the transition. The work we have done since then has continued to underline that potential, particularly in three areas. As the second largest landowner in Northern Ireland, we could build wind farms which could meet much of our own electricity needs, so freeing up capacity on the network and lessening the need for fossil fuels to act as back-up to ensure security of supply, as well as stabilising prices. We have also continued to progress our pioneering work on electrolysis, which uses water to produce green hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could be used to help our bus network and heavy goods vehicles transition from diesel, whilst the oxygen could increase the capacity of at least some of our treatment works which, in turn, would allow some of our towns and businesses to expand. Following a successful pilot project, a larger demonstrator model is about to be installed at our Belfast works. And, finally, we are investigating how our reservoirs could act as energy stores for periods when the key resources for renewable energy - wind and sun - aren't available. The stored water could be used to create hydropower as and when it is needed as back-up. But there are two other essential ingredients for us to make the transition to a renewable energy system. Our roles - whether it is to provide a water and waste water service, transport, electricity, or gas - will, of course, remain distinct, but, increasingly, we can see how we can help each other provide that service, and do so in a way which makes economic sense, as well as helping us decarbonise. The potential is there to make Northern Ireland not just low-carbon, but also a society that uses its natural resources to meet its own energy needs and in doing so creates a high tech, high skill economy, as set out in the 10x vision. Doing so, however, will mean acting with urgency. The surge in energy prices has underlined the price of standing still. The future will no longer take care of itself. We have to create it - and start doing so now to guarantee the public services we all depend on.

US President Joe Biden has announced ambitious plans to cut America's emissions, and at the COP26 climate conference he will be encouraging fellow world leaders to make similar pledges. From droughts and raging wildfires in the west, to unprecedented rainfall and flooding in the east, the US has been battered by extreme weather events this year. During an address on climate change in September, President Biden highlighted the human and financial costs of hurricanes, droughts and wildfires. "Communities that nearly one in three Americans call home have been struck by weather disasters in just the past few months," Mr Biden said. "We know what the driver is - climate change. We know what's causing climate change - human activity." "Something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans," he said, before repeating his pledge to achieve a 50-52% reduction in US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Mr Biden's approach to climate change is very different to that of his predecessor Donald Trump, who once suggested that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese. He later said he was joking, but throughout his presidency he questioned the human impact on our changing climate. Mr Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Accord was reversed by President Biden. But can the world trust this president's climate promises if they too can be undone by his future successors? It is one of the biggest challenges facing Mr Biden, according to Barry Rabe, a Professor of Environmental Policy at the University of Michigan. "I am not sure how he resolves this. He has to say to the world that not only is he committed but that they can count on things he is proposing actually being delivered," Professor Rabe said. "In three years, Joe Biden will be 82 years old, will he seek re-election? Will a Republican candidate or even Donald Trump be returning to the Oval Office in a few years and then undo the handiwork of their predecessor?" "I don't think there is any question that the standing and reputation of the US in the climate space has been damaged by this uncertainty and back-and-forth," Prof Rabe said. It is easy for presidents to undo the executive orders of their predecessors but legislation that has been passed by Congress is far more difficult to overturn. "The legislative package is crucial because it is much harder for a future president from another party to simply reverse it through executive action, it would take another act of Congress. A legislative piece is likely to be far more durable," according to Prof Rabe. But getting climate change legislation passed by a divided US Congress is proving difficult for Joe Biden and one of the biggest obstacles is coming not from Republicans, but from within his own party. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin is opposing many of the proposed clean energy initiatives. He has ties to the coal industry and represents the coal mining state of West Virginia. Just outside the town of Thomas, West Virginia the conveyor belts and coal piles of the local mine dominate the landscape. In the town, the future of the industry dominates conversation. "I don't know that there are a lot of alternatives to coal for us here so I think it definitely plays into attitudes that may be a little resistant to climate change measures. "Everybody wants to be more environmentally friendly but when it is people's livelihoods, it is a real concern," she said. Joe Biden will this week try to convince the world to follow his lead when it comes to cutting emissions, but convincing Americans, including some in his own party, remains an uphill battle. \</doc>

THE United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop26 ) now under way in Glasgow might conclude with a big international agreement. But whatever tactical successes are achieved, the results are likely to mark a strategic setback for humanity - at least when compared to the hopes of climate activists. The world is missing target after target. This should not be surprising: While a growing number of countries have set net-zero targets, for example, very few have credible plans to meet them. And even if we did meet existing targets, that would not be enough to achieve the 2015 Paris climate agreement's main goal: Limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report warns that the planet is likely to reach the 1.5C limit in the early 2030s. As long as multilateral engagement is defined by nationalism, power politics, and emotion, rather than solidarity, law, and science, our future will continue to grow bleaker. At the height of the Cold War, the American television series The Outer Limits told the story of an idealistic group of scientists staging a fake alien invasion of Earth, in the misguided hope they could avert nuclear Armageddon by giving the world a common enemy against which to unite. When faced with the prospect of extinction, the logic went, the Soviet Union and the US would turn their attention from competition to shared survival. Today, nobody needs to contrive a common cause. Climate change poses as great a threat as any alien invasion. But, far from shocking national leaders out of their petty competition, it is being wielded as a weapon in a many-sided propaganda war. From Brazil and Australia to China and the US, countries are trying to game climate negotiations in order to shift the costs of adaptation onto others. For example, the Brazilian government is trying to get the world to pay it to stop destroying the Amazon rainforest. Chinese President Xi Jinping will participate in Cop26 only by video link, and Russian president Vladimir Putin might not attend at all. Meanwhile, the advanced economies - including those that proudly claim to be committed to climate action - have broken their promise to provide $100bn annually to support the climate transition in the Global South. And even if they did deliver, it wouldn't be enough. Developed economies are finding increasingly coercive ways of shaping other countries' behaviour. Commitments by most of the Western and multilateral development banks to stop financing coal (now joined by China) restrict options for grid expansion in developing countries where demand for power is growing rapidly. Influential countries have also urged the International Monetary Fund to attach green conditions to debt relief for poor countries, as well as to its new allocation of special drawing rights (the IMF's reserve asset). And the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - a non-trade barrier intended to force exporters to Europe to shift to green production - disproportionately hurts small emitters in Africa and Eastern Europe with a lot to lose. This is not to disparage coal bans, green financing, and carbon pricing. On the contrary, these tools have a crucial role to play in changing how the global economy works. But that doesn't mean we can disregard the (very serious) consequences for developing economies. Instead, we need to create a new grand bargain focused on supporting adaptation in the developing world. More broadly, we must ensure that any multilateral agreement for tackling climate change is governed by international law, rather than dependent on the will of individual countries. And decision-making should be driven by scientific truths, not political slogans. The Paris agreement's predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, was broadly in line with this approach: It was a multilateral treaty, with legally binding international targets determined by the world's best scientists. But the Protocol also had many flaws, and it didn't end up going far. The Paris accord took a very different tack. It was hailed as a triumph, because hopes for any agreement were so low. But it entailed a major compromise: It was based on non-binding commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions. Countries could simply pursue the energy policies on which they had already decided, while pretending they were working together to tackle climate change. Not surprisingly, current NDCs are wholly inadequate to achieve the agreement's stated goals. To be sure, climate-change Cops have often made important - if often procedural, boring, and technical - contributions to the climate fight. But showboating and power politics have stood in the way of real progress. And the media and civil-society circus that surrounds the conferences - intended to enforce accountability and transparency - has often impeded negotiators' ability to get things done. More fundamentally, Cops have failed to produce a model of global governance that can tame power politics, let alone forge a sense of shared destiny among countries. And there is little reason to believe this time will be different. Of course, the problem extends beyond UN Climate Change Conferences. While economic globalization has lifted millions out of poverty, it has fuelled increasing concentration of wealth. In this context, efforts to advance shared interests can become less appealing, because they produce asymmetrical rewards. Add to that the psychology of envy unleashed by social media, and it becomes all the more difficult to shift people's focus from their relative position in the global pecking order to the common good. These trends have undermined faith in the power of government, and fuelled pessimism about the possibility that any solution will emerge. The result is what social scientists call a collective action problem. Leaders and citizens alike conclude that the most rational short-term strategy is to pay lip service to the cause and hope others will solve the crisis. Meanwhile, the planet burns.

"Doing more, quicker" is the only way to tackle the climate crisis, an Irish environmental lobby group has said ahead of the latest UN-backed report on global warming. The third part of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) report on the effects of human-induced warming of the planet is due to be released on Monday. The previous two parts warned of "unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades". The first IPCC report last August issued the starkest warning yet of a "code red for humanity", setting the agenda for world leaders to make a range of pledges at the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November. Backed by 270 authors, 675 contributors, and more than 34,000 references, the IPCC revealed that human-caused climate change, which has pushed up global temperatures by 1.1C, is driving weather and climate extremes in every region across the world. The second part of the report in February warned that the already "dangerous and widespread disruption" to nature and billions of people will be made worse. Even temporarily exceeding 1.5C in global warming will result in extreme impacts, some of which will not be reversible, the report said. Stop Climate Chaos (SCC), made up of 30 Irish civil society organisations, said that next week's report is likely to focus on four key issues. "The report will emphasise that we need to do more, and quickly," it stated. "We are on a path to overshoot 2C of warming even if all countries meet their Paris Agreement emission reduction pledges. This would be catastrophic and will be measured as a massive loss of lives, livelihoods, biodiversity, ecosystems, and food security." SCC said renewable energy and storage must be developed at pace "as they are key to climate action and energy security". "Renewable energy deployment continues to accelerate and outperform projections," it stated. "Renewables are also now the cheapest source of power, with costs continuing to fall year on year." SCC said that global fossil fuel production "must decline immediately and steeply". Existing fossil fuel infrastructure must also be phased out now and new capacity must not be commissioned, it added. "We will not be able to remain below 1.5C of warming by 2030 if existing fossil infrastructure continues to operate," it stated. "Of particular concern is the fact that governments plan on producing 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with holding warming to 1.5C, and 45% more than would be consistent with 2C of warming." The IPCC report will be criticised if "climate mitigation pathways it puts forward rely on risky carbon removal technologies that are unproven at the scale needed," SCC claimed. "There are limits to the feasibility of carbon dioxide removal and negative emissions technologies remain theoretical and unproven at scale." \</doc>

I TS ambition was clear: The UN climate summit Cop26 was meant to secure a deal to give the world a chance to avert the worst effects of climate change by capping global warming at 1.5C above preindustrial levels. The accord met that bar, but barely, and its ultimate success will be determined by the future actions of the governments that thrashed it out, according to the summit's UK hosts, participants, and observers. The deal, backed by nearly 200 countries, for the first time explicitly targeted fossil fuels, the biggest driver of man-made global warming, asked governments to accelerate emissions cuts, and promised more money for poor countries struggling with climate change. It also ushered in voluntary pledges and pacts from countries, companies and investors to clean up emissions from cars and planes, curb the powerful greenhouse gas methane, protect forests and bolster green finance. "The approved texts are a compromise," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today." That leaves the world highly vulnerable. "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. It is time to go into emergency mode," he said. The summit did not deliver enough emissions-cutting pledges from countries to set a clear path to limiting warming to 1.5C. Instead, it struck a deal for the nearly 200 countries represented at the event to increase their pledges next year to close the gap. The gap is huge. Governments' current pledges to cut emissions this decade would lead to 2.4C of warming. To align with the 1.5C target, countries need to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45pc by 2030 from 2010 levels. Under current pledges, emissions would rise by nearly 14pc by 2030. "While compromises at Cop26 keep the 1.5C target within reach, it is hanging by a thread," said Bert Wander, the acting CEO of environmental group Avaaz. China, the world's biggest carbon dioxide emitter, announced in a joint declaration with the US last week that it would accelerate efforts to reduce emissions by curbing coal use, tackling methane, and preserving forests. It provided few details, however. China was also among a group of resource-rich developing nations that watered down language targeting fossil fuels in the deal. The draft called on countries to phase out coal use and fossil fuel subsidies. But as the negotiations played out, words were changed: Coal became "unabated coal", leaving scope for continued use of coal that uses tech to capture emissions. Subsidies became "inefficient subsidies", without a definition of which types of subsidies counted as inefficient, providing wriggle room for governments to continue funding oil, gas and coal. A last-minute intervention by India and China just before the pact was adopted also changed the requested coal "phase out" to a "phase down". The Glasgow agreement delivered a mixed bag on finance, a contentious issue between poor countries and their rich and powerful counterparts. Finance boils down to the issue of fairness, and whether rich nations whose historical emissions are largely responsible for causing climate change will pay the costs it is imposing on the world's poorest countries. The deal made some headway. It asked developed countries to "at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country parties from 2019 levels by 2025". It also, for the first time, made mention of "loss and damage" in the cover section of the agreement. Loss and damage refers to the costs countries are already facing from climate-driven disasters, for which those countries have for years sought compensation. But after resistance from the US, the EU and other rich nations, the accord failed to secure such compensation. The world's most vulnerable countries backed the final deal grudgingly. Antigua and Barbuda negotiator Lia Nicholson said her country and other small island states at the talks "will express our grievances in due course". Rich countries broke a 2009 promise to deliver $100bn ((EURO)87m) annually by 2020 in climate finance, making poor countries wary that promised cash will not arrive. They now expect to deliver the $100bn by 2023. The world's most vulnerable countries backed the final deal grudgingly \</doc>

Booster vaccines for healthcare workers The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is meeting today to discuss extending the vaccine booster programme to healthcare workers. HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/booster-jabs-progress-so-far-and-when-is-a-wider-rollout-likely-1207052.html Covid-19 vaccine boosters The fact healthcare workers are yet to receive a booster vaccine has been the source of much anger on the frontline and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) will meet on Monday to discuss extending the programme to healthcare workers. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) has called on Niac to roll out booster vaccines to healthcare workers as soon as possible. INMO General Secretary Phil N\'ed Sheaghdha wrote to Niac chairwoman Professor Karina Butler on Friday for the second time in a week. A total of 3,500 healthcare staff are currently out of work due to Covid-related illnesses, a figure that has almost doubled in the past 10 days. AdvertisementProfessor of Immunology at Trinity College, HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/niac-taking-too-long-to-make-booster-jab-decision-prof-kingston-mills-1207403.html Kingston Mills , says Niac are taking too long to make decisions. "The healthcare workers were among the first to be vaccinated way back in February, March. A lot of them got the AstraZeneca vaccine as well, so the immune response to that vaccine is not as strong as the one generated with mRNA vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer - so the immunity will have waned more in these." HSE vaccination centres close for 'essential updates' All HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/hse-vaccination-centres-and-registrations-close-for-essential-updates-1207422.html vaccination centres It came as HSE chief executive Paul Reid said thousands of people are continuing to come forward for a coronavirus jab. In a statement on Monday, the HSE said the "essential" update to the Covax system will "provide increased capability to support our vaccination booster programme". People will not be able to register for a vaccination online or by phone on Monday, but GP and pharmacy vaccinations are unaffected by the update. Mr Reid said on Twitter that, over the past six days, almost 15,000 people have come forward for vaccination. "It is never too late," he said. Taoiseach at Cop26 The issue of climate change is even more pressing than Brexit or the Covid-19 pandemic Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has warned as he attends the United Nations' Cop26 climate change conference, which\~ HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/cop26-what-happened-on-first-day-of-climate-change-summit-1207215.html continues in Glasgow AdvertisementSpeaking to the\~ HYPERLINK https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40734144.html Irish Examiner , Mr Martin said climate change is "without question" the most serious challenge of our lifetime and must be tackled with action instead of rhetoric. "It is once in a hundred years that you face a pandemic, but I'm convinced that climate change is an existential crisis," Mr Martin said ahead of Monday's roundtable discussion with government leaders from around the world. "I worry for our younger generations, for children yet to be born, what kind of planet they will be born into if there are very severe weather events, such as droughts and floods," he added. Ryanair predicts losses of (EURO)200m Ryanair reported its first quarterly profit since before the onset of Covid-19, but said it expects to post an annual loss of up to HYPERLINK (EURO)200 million as it would be forced to discount tickets to fill its planes over the winter. The airline, which operated more flights this summer than its European rivals, reported on Monday an after-tax loss of (EURO)48 million for the six months to September. A company poll of analysts had forecast a loss of (EURO)43 million. While it did not break out its after-tax profit for the three months ended September, its second quarter, the (EURO)273 million loss it reported in the first quarter implies a second quarter profit of (EURO)225 million. AdvertisementUS treasury secretary HYPERLINK Janet Yellen on Monday said Ireland will remain one of the best places in the world for multinational companies to invest in, even after Dublin gave up its prized 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate as part of a global overhaul. Ms Yellen led the charge towards achieving a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent - endorsed by the leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies on Saturday - to end what she long described as a "race to the bottom" on corporate taxation. Speaking in Ireland, where US companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook directly employ more than 180,000 people or around 8 per cent of the entire workforce, Ms Yellen said Ireland is "already winning this new race to the top with its robust business environment". "Here is my honest assessment of what it will not do: It won't change this country's status as one of the best places to do business in the world," Ms Yellen told an event with the Irish heads of many of those companies, referring to the global tax deal. "As I mentioned, there are hundreds of US companies with real roots in Ireland. Was the corporate tax rate one reason they came? I would have to imagine yes. But it was not the only reason, and it wasn't the reason they stayed, or the main reason they are here now." Ms Yellen recalled how Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told her during the negotiations that she could walk down the main shopping street in Dublin and any passer-by would likely be able to tell her what the corporate tax rate. That showed what a "touchstone issue" corporate tax is in Ireland, she said. Asked if the United States cajoled Ireland into signing up to the deal, Ms Yellen said this was not the case. "I really personally wouldn't use the word cajole. I think we had very productive meetings in which we have tried to understand the viewpoint of Ireland and its needs in terms of being able to sign onto this," she told a news conference. \</doc>

As Russian military forces continued their invasion of Ukraine with an attack on the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, Ukraine's leading climate experts withdrew from an international scientific committee - just as the group was finalising their approval of the landmark climate change report late on Saturday. Leading climate experts from around the world have spent two weeks evaluating the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) investigation, outlining how accelerating human-caused climate change is affecting societies and natural ecosystems worldwide. The report, including recommendations to governments, will be issued today. This is the second part in a global climate assessment released every five to seven years, and it will propose strategies for adapting to current and future warming, sea level rise and ocean acidification, as well as extreme weather events. "We have some delegates from other cities, not only Kyiv, and they were forced to go to shelters," said climate scientist Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Ukrainian delegation. "But most important is that it's very difficult to think about climate change impacts when you have impacts of Russian missiles in our Kyiv, and tanks everywhere." She hoped, nonetheless, that what is known as the IPCC Working Group 2 report would get the coverage and attention it deserves. Preparedness It is likely to be the starkest warning yet about the impacts of climate change on people and the planet - notably impacts that are inevitable due to current levels of carbon emissions and related temperature rise. It will also assess preparedness under "adaptation" measures, such as the ability to withstand extreme weather. It is being published today, in the wake of the Cop26 summit that agreed to increase action to try to limit global warming to 1\'bd degrees to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The outcomes of UN talks in Glasgow were described as keeping the temperature goal alive "but only with a weak pulse", by conference president Alok Sharma. The surge in fossil fuel prices since - especially natural gas in Europe - has undermined global momentum. A draft version leaked last year warned of the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds or "tipping points", where things such as the melting of ice sheets or permafrost, or rainforests becoming grassland, become irreversible, with huge consequences. It will set out the effects of rising temperatures, which have already reached 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, such as droughts, floods, storms and effects on health, agriculture and cities - as well as cascading and irreversible impacts. There will be a specific focus on the different regions of the world, as well as looking at vulnerable populations and communities, migration and displacement. Ahead of its publication, Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors taking action on climate change, warned the latest report was likely to "paint a grim vision" for big cities from London to Lima. "City residents are already on the front line of a worsening vulnerability to climate impacts such as deadly flooding, sea-level rise, wildfires, extreme storms and unbearable urban heat. It is clear we are now in the climate crisis, not waiting for it. We can still overcome climate breakdown and build a thriving future, but urban adaptation efforts must outpace this new climate reality," he added. Rich countries have been seeking to downplay language on "loss and damage", according to Christian Aid. Loss and damage funding is a much-needed source of financial support to help the poorest communities deal with devastating climate impacts caused primarily by emissions of the global north. Undermine Christian Aid's climate justice adviser Nushrat Chowdhury said: "We made real progress at the Cop26 However, it seemed rich nations were now trying to undermine this progress by attacking the reality of loss and damage through the IPCC process, led by countries that claim to be climate leaders, such as the US and UK, she said. "It is shameful to see them boasting about their climate achievements in public yet behind closed doors they are doing everything they can to prevent support reaching the most vulnerable," Ms Chowdhury added. \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will attend the World Leaders Summit at the start of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( Cop26 ) in Glasgow. The World Leaders Summit, which takes place from Monday, November 1st to Tuesday, November 2nd, will kick off two weeks of discussions between 196 countries, and the EU, to secure renewed commitment to global action on climate change. On Monday afternoon, the Taoiseach will take part in a World Leader's Summit Action and Solidarity Event, a round table event for leaders, hosted by British prime minister Boris Johnson. On Tuesday, the Taoiseach will deliver Ireland's National Statement to the summit, setting out how Ireland is contributing to achievement of the Paris Goals, including limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, and to helping developing and vulnerable countries mitigate the impacts of climate change. AdvertisementHe will also attend a number of bilateral meetings, and receptions, throughout the two-day summit. Speaking ahead of his departure for Glasgow, the Taoiseach said: "I hope that this week at COP26 we will see a real coming together for global action. Climate change is already a reality in all parts of the world. If we are to leave a habitable planet to future generations we must act now. "The challenge is big, but I have faith in the capacity of humans to work together to overcome it. Science is leading the way. Leaders must put the right policies in place, as we are doing in Ireland. "I also hope that COP26 will see a real step forward in climate finance, supporting the most vulnerable countries.

Former President Mary Robinson has called on the Government to invest so that it will be more affordable for people to "go green." Speaking on RT\'c9 radio's Morning Ireland , Ms Robinson warned that if the 1.5 degrees climate target was not reached then people under the age of 30 would be in "a less livable" world with more floods, droughts and people having to leave their homes. Some progress had been made at Cop26 , she said, but some delegates had gone home "in despair" at the prospect of not meeting the 1.5 degrees target. Agreements had been made on the phasing out of oil and gas, she said, with the Irish government agreeing to such a phasing out. There had also been a "big shift" in the financial sector. It was important that the voices of the most vulnerable had been heard by "those at the top" The world was now in crisis mode, she added. AdvertisementWhat happens locally from now on would make a difference, said Ms Robinson, who spoke of her pride in her home town of Ballina which organised a climate event last week to coincide with Cop26 . Cop26 . Among them was Saudi Arabia which "always plays a very bad game at Cop". They had attempted to remove wording in relation to youth, human rights and just transition, she said. Ms Robinson warned that some tax exemptions were "killing us" and that reducing subsidies could have huge consequences for some people. They needed to be carefully thought through. Governments might have to invest to make it easier to go green, she said. \</doc>

The issue of climate change has certainly moved centre stage as far as farming is concerned, so when I heard some young Irish people being interviewed on RT\'c9 recently in relation to a proposed youth debate on climate change in the Seanad chambers, it certainly caught my attention. These young people appeared really concerned about climate change, claiming it is an issue which is "affecting us every single day, in our summers and our winters". I thought to myself, have I been sleepwalking through life or has the influence of modern media hype become that persuasive? While CSO figures suggest an average rise in our temperature of 0.8 of a degree over the last century, I must confess that personally, I have noticed very little changes in Irish weather patterns over recent decades. So while I must disagree with these young people's comments, at a global level, the issue is not as simple. Some scientists may blame an increase in solar activity, however the burning of fossil fuels has been identified by most scientists as being the major cause of changes in our global climate. Alarmingly, the current war in Ukraine has exposed the extreme dependence of developed western economies on secure supplies of oil and gas. This dependence has put into sharp focus the difficulties which would arise, not alone in farming, but in all sectors of our economy if these energy sources are restricted for environmental reasons. What is also disturbing is the growing reluctance of wealthy westernised societies to carry the burden of rising consumer prices resulting from these shortages. For example, many media outlets are currently being inundated with calls from irate members of the public protesting about the rising cost of living, including food. While many of these callers are people trying to make ends meet, it is obvious that others are simply reluctant to relinquish an affluent lifestyle and supply of cheap food, which they have become accustomed to. COP26 meeting in Glasgow, are also realising how politically difficult such reductions would be for any government to implement. This has also led to a situation where the UN Secretary General has been obliged to say that the 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report' is "a litany of broken climate promises". So as they fight their way through the thick fog of populist media hype and cynical vested interest, it appears that our youth may find themselves on their own in solving our climate problems. These are indeed very heavy responsibilities to have resting on such young shoulders On a related issue, something which has really changed in the last 12 months is the cost of farm inputs. It's funny how you have to feel the pain before you can fully realise how bad things have become. That is exactly what happened to me when I dropped in to pay my fertiliser bill recently. The situation is certainly not helped by the fact that our Government appears to have very few plans in place to soften the phenomenal increase in farm inputs costs. You could be forgiven for thinking that once again the farming community will be obliged/expected to further subsidise increases in the cost of the public's weekly shopping basket. Of course, the truth is we really don't know what lies ahead. Will the current marketing system, which appears to guarantee that farm-gate prices are kept to a minimum, continue to dominate or will an expected rise in food prices be sufficient to offset rising input costs? Whatever the outcome, it appears that from a farming perspective, we are facing a very scary, rollercoaster ride, so all I can say is hang on to your seats.

Police "seized" an inflatable Loch Ness monster that anti-poverty campaigners had hoped to float on the River Clyde in Glasgow as finance ministers met at Cop26 . However the group said police arrived at Govan Graving Docks in Glasgow at around 7am and prevented them from moving it. The inflatable Nessie, dubbed the Loch Ness Debt Monster, is around four metres tall, eight metres long and three metres wide, and the group said it represents the growing threat of climate debt burdens for lower income countries. Eva Watkinson, of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: "The debt crisis facing lower income countries has been excluded from debate at Cop26 and now police have prevented the 'Loch Ness Debt Monster' from highlighting this fundamental issue. "Rich polluting countries created the climate crisis and should take responsibility by cancelling the debts of countries that need it and ensuring climate finance is given in grants, not more loans." Pictures taken by the group show police officers surrounding the monster, while campaigners held signs saying "drop the debt monster" and "climate justice now". According to recent figures from Jubilee Debt Campaign, lower income countries are spending more than five times more on external debt payments than projects to protect people from the impacts of climate change. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Officers seized a large inflatable due to be launched on the River Clyde as it breached the maritime restrictions in place to maintain public safety and security close to the Cop26 venue." \</doc>

'THIS is how it is, and this is how it must be" is most often said by those who want 'it' to stay that way, those with an investment in how 'it' is, those who benefit from keeping 'it' just the way it is. The first part is usually accurate, the part about the status quo. The second part, about the status quo being fixed and unchangeable, is absolutely a lie. Transformation and evolution are standard. Massive changes happen all the time. Nothing is permanent. Previously unimaginable scenarios play out in front of us all the time, and we quickly begin to see these new realities as "how it is". Germans tore down the Berlin Wall; black Americans fought like hell for the right to vote; Irish women won the right to healthcare in the form of abortion rights. But the tension between how things are and how they could be is always present, never more so than these past two weeks at Cop26 . The UN has brought almost every country on Earth for global climate summits together for the past decades - these summits are called Cops - which stands for Conference of the Parties. In Glasgow, the 26th annual summit has just ended - the organisers billed it as "the world's last best chance to get runaway climate change under control". Yesterday was the summit's final day, and hundreds of representatives of global civil society, the People's Plenary, walked out of the convention centre after lambasting what was happening inside. These people represented environment and development NGOs, trade unions, grassroots community campaigns, faith groups, youth groups, and migrant and racial justice networks. As they left, they held up red ribbons to signify the red lines crossed by Cop26 negotiations, and they yelled and chanted, "another world is possible". The Guardian reported that the indigenous activist Ta'Kaiya Blaney Tla A'min Nation told the meeting before the walkout: " Cop26 is a performance; it is an illusion constructed to save the capitalist economy rooted in resource extraction and colonialism. I didn't come here to fix the agenda - I came here to disrupt." Following the progress of the negotiations and the reaction from activists kept my anxiety high all week. As I processed the updates of Cop26 online, I kept jumping up from my desk and away from my laptop. Any distraction would do; I darted away for endless cups of tea, scrolled my way through half of Instagram, and even made a trip to the dreaded post office. I finally sat down and focused on what happened in Glasgow, a different continent and a different time zone from me, but an event that will change the course of all of our lives in one way or another. Perhaps you've been avoiding news from Glasgow, too, because you know that understanding the implications of Cop26 will require some complex intellectual analysis as well as some deep heartbreak. Head out of the sand now, because I am a grown-up, in the lucky position to learn and think and write about climate chaos rather than living through it in my own body. I am keen to figure out where the US landed at the end of Cop26 and what that might mean for Americans and the population of the rest of the world. I am trying to unpick what is real and to see how it is and how it could be. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres opened with the following, unsparing remarks: "So, as we open this much-anticipated climate conference, we are still heading for climate disaster. Young people know it. Every country sees it. Small island developing states - and other vulnerable ones - live it. For them, failure is not an option. Failure is a death sentence." On November 1, US president Biden said: "It's simple: Will we act? Will we do what is necessary? Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?" As I write this on Friday evening, there is a draft agreement on the table. This is most likely not the final text. Although the conference was officially due to end on Friday, revisions will continue, possibly right throughout the weekend. ONE stated goal was to secure global net-zero emissions by mid-century and keep 1.5C within reach. Last week the Climate Action Tracker, the most reliable and respected climate analysis coalition, announced that temperature rises would top a disastrous 2.4C by the end of this century, based on the shortterm goals countries have set out at Cop26 . As chair of The Elders Mary Robinson put it in a courageous and righteously emotional interview on Sky News: "You can't negotiate with science." She did not hold back on criticising her fellow leaders on their lack of ambition and urgency, pointing out that countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, and even Australia are still in "still in fossilfuel mode, not in crisis mode". Then she slammed Saudi Arabia for the "dirty games" it plays. "What Saudi Arabia has been able to do is take language out of a lot of the [ Cop26 ] text," Mrs Robinson said. "They've taken out the language that refers to youth, human rights, gender equalities ... Saudi Arabia is there when it matters, and they kind of block things." According to Reuters, this claim that Riyadh is using procedural delay tactics to block a solid deal is backed up by several officials involved in the Glasgow negotiations. The second goal was about countries already hit by devastating climate chaos "to protect and restore ecosystems and to build defences, warning systems, and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods, and even lives". But to deliver on those first two goals, developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least $ 100bn in climate finance per year by 2020. This deadline has already been missed, obviously, but progress has been made these last two weeks. Thousands of people from all over the world worked incredibly hard to get even the most incremental changes to the status quo. They have negotiated in good faith to make these shifts towards progress, which is reflected in the latest draft of Cop26 . Grim indeed, but just because that is how it is now, that is not how it must be. So, having processed what just happened, I remind myself that transformation is possible. I do not accept the version of the future laid out by Cop26 . I'm switching focus now to how it could be. \</doc>

Young people are taking part in protests across the country to demand urgent action to tackle climate change. The Fridays for Future Climate rally is taking place in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Belfast. In Cork, several hundred people took part in rally from the Grand Parade to City Hall. Participants acknowledged progress being made by the Government in measures to reverse climate change, but they said more needed to be done. Alannah Wrynn, 17, travelled to the rally from Dunmanway in west Cork with her cousin Ronan McCarthy, who is 16. Alannah said she was advocating for climate justice. "It's about environmental sustainability, economic justice, social justice and that is what we are advocating for here today," she said. "It's about people not profit, and that's the slogan we're using here today." Alannah said while progress was being made, it was not being made quickly enough. "What we are facing now is urgent," she said. "We are standing on the precipice, and if we don't act now it will be too late. We are doing damage that we can't go back and we can't turn the clock back, so we have to act now and act fast and act as if our house is on fire, because it really is." Amy O'Brien, 16, was also at the rally with Theresa Sebastian. Amy is also calling for urgent action. "This climate crisis is impacting people especially in the so-called global south, in countries that have already been exploited by countries with more money and more wealth. "We are demanding that we put people before profit, and that we pay reparations, that we achieve a just transition and that we achieve equality and equity for everyone and that's what our narrative for this strike is all about: people not profit." As of 1pm, between 200 and 300 people were attending the protest in Dublin's Merrion Square. Around 50 people are attending the Fridays for Future rally in Eyre Square, Galway. At the protest in Belfast, Kay Laverty, from Fridays for Future Northern Ireland, challenged Stormont politicians to make good on commitments to reduce emissions legislated for in the recent Climate Change Act. "We've had a whole bunch of people here to raise awareness about the climate crisis and put pressure on the NI assembly to act on the climate bill that they have made," she said. Ms Laverty said activists viewed the measures agreed by global leaders at Cop26 in Glasgow last year as insufficient, branding the event "Flop26". Additional reporting Paschal Sheehy, PA \</doc>

Sectors must act now to reduce emissions and cannot abdicate their responsibility by waiting for new and untested technologies to come to the rescue, a University Colleg e Cork exper t has warned. Plant scientist at the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences and the Environmental Research Institute in UCC, Eoin Lettice, was speaking following the "now or never" scenario laid out by the world's scientific community in the latest UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which stated that steep emissions cuts must begin after peaking in 2025 in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Mr Lettice told the Irish Examiner that the "verdict from the IPCC was reached a long time ago, with some still refusing to accept the outcome". There can be no kicking the can down the road in the wake of its findings, he said. "What this report makes clear is that we cannot rely on hypothetical technological advances to cut GHG emissions, sequester carbon from the atmosphere, or allow for easy adaptation to climate change. In short, we need to act urgently with the tools we have available to us now." Agriculture must do some of the legwork, he added. Nature-based solutions on emissions will also help address another major global crisis - biodiversity loss, according to Mr Lettice, a UCC observer during last November's UN climate change summit in Glasgow, Cop26 . "This new IPCC report emphasises the importance of 'nature-based solutions' in climate change mitigation including tree-planting, halting deforestation, as well as protecting peatlands and coastal wetlands," he said. "While noting that these solutions by themselves will not - and are not meant to be - an alternative to greenhouse gas emissions, such nature-based solutions can also help us to tackle that other existential crisis of our time - biodiversity loss." Meanwhile, non-governmental organisation Our Fish said in light of the IPCC report that ending EU fossil fuel subsidies "would be one of the most effective ways of reducing the size of destructive, industrial fishing fleets and reducing the overfishing that is depleting fish stocks and ecosystems". Overfishing simply means taking more fish out of the water than are naturally replenished. Scientists have increasingly sounded the alarm that overfishing is exacerbating both the biodiversity and climate crises. \</doc>

The US beef industry has escaped "relatively unscathed" from President Joe Biden's attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to leaders at the industry's recent CattleCon convention. Mr Biden and the EU unveiled a global pledge to cut methane gas 30% by 2030 at November's Cop26 climate summit - and there is evidence that methane created by cattle production is a significant contributor to climate change. But those at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) annual trade show in Houston last month heard industry leaders express relief about the administration choosing to incentivise rather than force ranchers and feedlots to reduce emissions. Mary-Thomas Hart, NCBA's environmental counsel, told a sustainability forum at the conference how lucky the industry was with the administration's approach, according to information obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace's investigations project, and shared with the Guardian . Cop26 , the president led a global methane pledge, and that could have gone really badly for livestock production in the United States, could have gone badly for the cattle industry," Ms Hart told her audience. "But this administration seems to have recognised the positive value we bring. We were really excited to get out of that relatively unscathed." Methane, expelled by cows and by their manure, is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Although methane dissipates after 10 to 20 years, it warms the planet at 80 times the rate of carbon dioxide and emissions are accelerating at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN. Although Mr Biden's November pledge to reduce methane included new rules for the oil, gas and coal industries, it proposed only voluntary actions for an agricultural sector the Environmental Protection Agency says contributes more than one-third of the country's emissions. In a November interview with Reuters, agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said he trusted the agriculture industry to do the right thing in response to federal incentives. "Agriculture will respond to this because they have historically responded to financial and market incentives," Mr Vilsack said in that interview. "They appreciate the time has come." Some in Houston made that appreciation clear, with at least one speaker telling the trade show audience that the beef industry stands to make a lot of money off federal emissions-reduction incentives. New rules would stifle an industry that is already working hard to fight climate change, Ms Hart told the trade show audience. "The last thing we need to do is implement regulations. They'd get in the way of that productivity," Hart said. "Global beef demand isn't going away. If US cow producers aren't allowed to do their job and do it well, that production's just going to go to a less sustainable country." Some cattle producers are making an effort to reduce emissions, such as feeding animals grass or other lower-emission materials, but the US will never meet Mr Biden's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction goals without regulation, said Brent Kim, a program of ficer with the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. "We urgently need to curb greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, of which livestock is the biggest producer," Mr Kim said. "We can't have businessas usual." The NCBA declined a request to comment. The beef association has pledged to reach "climate neutrality" by 2040 and said in Houston it was on track to reach that goal. But the group's leaders also said that bench mark should be measured using a scale critics say obscures beef's role in climate change. At the Houston meeting, NCBA's CEO Colin Woodall again noted the importance of getting policymakers on board with the contentious global warming potential measurement, called GWP, which measures changes in greenhouse gases rather than focusing on steady sources such as cattle. The star refers to the new metric for calculating the impact of methane emissions on global heating, which has not been accepted by all. "For us to be successful. GWP - global warming potential star - is the methodology we need to make sure that everybody is utilizing in order to tell the true story of methane," Mr Woodall said. "And that's one of the reasons why NCBA spends time on Capitol Hill making sure that our government recognises it." Some experts said GWP might have merit as one of many ways to measure greenhouse gas emissions, but using it to justify a lack of regulation is questionable. "I'm not throwing shade on it," Kim said. "I think it's helpful to have all these different ways of measurement. But it does paint beef as more reasonable." No other country has accepted GWP as a way of regulating the beef industry, said Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist. "They don't get a free pass by messing about with the metrics," Parr said. Mr "It's pretty obvious that they're sort of leaping on the opportunity to get a free pass as an industry from taking more responsibility for their emissions."  Guardian \</doc>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop26 ), which launches on October 31st, will dominate world news with heightened expectation that it will trigger a strong global response to an already-happening climate crisis. What is Cop26 Almost every country in the world will attend the 26th gathering under the UN "conference of the parties". The 13-day long summit, which will be held in Glasgow, is billed as the last chance to put the world on track to avoid catastrophic damage to Earth due to vast quantities of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The conference is the only global mechanism to galvanise action in addressing this human-caused damage to planet Earth. Who will be there? Superpowers will sit alongside tiny island states from the South Pacific; immensely wealthy countries, who have contributed most to the crisis, will be across the table from impoverished states from sub-Saharan Africa, who are least to blame. What is at stake? The impacts of human-caused overheating of the planet is predicted to persist for centuries but threaten the existence of humankind much sooner. If global temperature rise continues to accelerate and carbon emissions are not dramatically cut, the world faces a temperature rise of 2.7 degrees and an overwhelming sea-level surge this century. No place on Earth will be safe, Ireland included. Yet many climate scientists agree the worst effects can be avoided by swift action. It's possible to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees - the key target of the Paris Agreement forged at Cop21 in 2015. That is provided ambition is ratcheted up. What's more, solutions exist. What will happen at the conference? With upwards of 20,000 people gathered in the one place, a Cop looks at first glance like a recipe for chaos. Numerous briefings, report launches, press conferences, protests, stunts, corporates trying to show off their newly-found green credentials and harrowing stories of climate disruption take place from morning into late evening in crowded venues - with many happening simultaneously. One minute a minister is trying to defend his country's expansionist fossil fuel policy, the next a pastor from Fiji is making a plea for help as a voyager way of life existing for centuries is threatened by rising seas. So, wi ll people work together to find a solution? A fully-fledged Cop somehow restores faith in humanity. Instead of unbridgeable differences, common ground suggests global citizens can in unison restore a scarred Earth, though the clock is ticking faster and faster. Meanwhile, heads of state, ministers, negotiators, advisers and diplomats are ensconced away from the madding crowd. Here optimism is more tempered. Painstaking work is conducted behind closed doors and the mood ebbs and flows in pursuit of agreement. Can we expect an agreement? All too often the outcome has meant disappointment and, more recently, despair as the interlinked crises of a climate emergency, biodiversity loss and pollution arising from excesses of consumerism, are getting worse. The Paris pact left too much to interpretation and failed to provide a mechanism to drive urgent action. Will Covid measures impact the event? Covid-19 will cast a shadow over Cop26 . There will be less "all in this together" sessions. Many elements will be partially online and many delegates from poorer countries where vaccinations rates are low may not travel. As hosts, the UK government resisted calls to postpone the talks, insisting it can be a safe and inclusive gathering where all voices are heard. What actions would help deliver a meaningful agreement? A great trust builder between big emitter states and developing countries would be delivering the long-promised $100 billion a year to help vulnerable states. A decision to "consign coal to history" would improve mood music. Likewise stopping fossil fuel extraction and withdrawing trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies that add fuel to the fire of the climate crisis - big asks. H ow will targets be set and measured? Declaring "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) is the mechanism for setting targets. Many countries (including Ireland) are promising to halve emissions by 2030 and to achieving "net-zero" emissions by 2050 under this heading, but all big emitter states must be onboard. The financial foundations to decarbonise the world needs to be clear, indicating direction of travel for green investment backed by robust carbon trading markets. Methane is a superwarming gas that traps 80 times the heat of CO2. Cutting its production in oil and gas extraction, landfills and agriculture can deliver the quickest climate win. The US and EU have agreed to a 30 per cent cut by 2030. If this prompts a global agreement, it will be a great day's work - though challenging for Ireland's agrifood sector. So is there cause for hope? If scaled-up innovation and new collaborative thinking are evident during Cop26 , it will be a good omen, but all too often states act out of self-interest. There is talk of a novel mechanism to buy out polluting coal plants in developing countries, while some of the world's biggest companies are signing up for a "First Movers Coalition" to scrub notoriously dirty industries including aviation, steel, cement, trucking and shipping - potential levers of big action. But optimism is easily countered by reality; carbon emissions are predicted to rise by 16 per cent by 2030, rather than fall by half to keep global heating under the agreed limit of 1.5 degrees. What role will Greta Thunberg play? Thunberg, who will be in Glasgow, is demanding radical solutions and far quicker decarbonisation. She relentlessly highlights "the growing gap between promised NDCs and meaningful action" and has excoriated global leaders touting promises to address the climate emergency, dismissing them as "blah, blah, blah". No one should underestimate her ability to prompt mass protests across the globe, even bigger than marches in pre-Covid days when many millions took to the streets and spoke in one voice. Impatience at the failure to act has moved up several notches since and is concentrated in the generation about to inherit a tarnished planet. Consequently, the world has reached a tipping point and is crying out for great urgency - matched by what Pope Francis has called for; unprecedented co-operation "in the healing of the planet". \</doc>

S OCIALLY distanced high fives and sound bites dominate the media opportunity for politicians that is COP26 . This is not to say the whole thing is a waste of time - far from it. But people know to take the posturing around the event with a pinch of salt. It is a political speechwriter's dream. "We are digging our own graves", said the UN. Another attention-grabbing phrase referred to our "moment of truth". It is "either up to us to stop it, or it stops us", said another. Queen Elizabeth urged everyone to "act now for our children", while Boris Johnson described it as "one minute to midnight on the Doomsday Clock". The event seems to be primarily about garnering attention for political leaders, while also very legitimately and positively raising awareness about climate change issues for the public at large. It is hard not to be sceptical about some of the commitments that are made. When stripped back, you have to wonder what they really mean. The publicity around the Paris Agreement in 2015 was enormous. The commitments seemed to portray a real sense that governments were taking the urgency around climate change seriously. But were they? Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal. US president Joe Biden reversed the Trump decision and arrived in Glasgow, more or less saying, "sorry about all that. We are back on track". Yet more Americans voted for Donald Trump in the election he lost than for any other previous election candidate in US history. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi gave a commitment in Glasgow for his country to go to net zero emissions by 2070. The 71-year old would be 120 at that stage and it is safe to say he will most likely not be in government. knock-on Several of the most forested countries pledged to end deforestation. But that won't be happening until 2030. So it is chop away until then. This pledge echoed a similar pledge given in 2014 yet forests in Brazil for example, continue to be destroyed on a huge scale. Some of that deforestation goes on producing cheap cattle feed which is exported around the world. Every country's actions have knock-on consequences elsewhere. Take Norway, one of the foremost exponents of electric vehicles. This is because electric vehicles there are not subject to road tax, have free charging and a raft of other state-subsidised incentives for people to buy them. Yet Norway remains the largest exporter of fossil fuels per capita in the world. Few of us are above the charges of hypocrisy that go with the pledges and the battle to deal with climate change. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin is in Glasgow talking about what Ireland is going to do, yet we have been complete laggards in cutting our own emissions reduction targets. Five years ago we were developing food production and expansion strategies built on convincing farmers to borrow money to increase their dairy herds following the end of restrictive EU milk quotas. The size of the national herd is being talked about now as a major obstacle to achieving emissions reduction targets. Farmers get the blame but you have to have some sympathy for dairy farmers in particular who invested heavily in their businesses on the back of a government strategy for the sector. Few of us are hypocrisy with climate The Government is nervous about saying the national herd will have to be cut, so instead it is talking about 'stabilisation' of the herd. Does that mean keeping it to current levels, or does it mean actually cutting it back? While it isn't outright saying this, people know, not least farmers themselves, that we will not meet targets unless the herd numbers are cut back. At some point that debate will shift towards compensation rather than maintaining a fallacy of cutting methane gas and ammonia levels while simultaneously growing herd numbers. This is where the honesty issue comes in. There is a complete lack of honesty and realism about what is required to make the transition that is needed. Big businesses have been plugging away at carbon reduction, not so much to save the planet but to comply with regulations and ensure they have a business in the future. Some are just greenwashing by relying on questionable carbon credit offsets. For all of the headline-grabbing sound bites to emerge from COP26 , the real challenge is actually getting people's attention. The Financial Times ran a fascinating story on Monday quoting a study which found that climate change could bring near-unliveable conditions for three billion people by 2070. Imagine the human cost, not only of poverty or starvation but of displacement of millions to other parts of the world. I would be 102 years old at that stage and unlikely to see it. My children would be 62 and 59. When it was published, the story was only the third most read story on the FT website that day, behind 'Barclays chief Jes Staley to step down following Epstein investigation' and 'Junior lawyers work ever longer hours as demand keeps surging'. Competition for attention is tough, especially when it's something about 2070. One lady in a vox pop on RT\'c9 Radio 1 said the other morning she is considering retrofitting her home, not to save the planet but because the "draft coming in would cut the legs off you". At least she is being honest. It is hard not to be sceptical about the commitments made Every country's actions have knock-on consequences Few of us are above the hypocrisy that goes with climate pledges \</doc>

P\'e1draig Hoare Irish universities continue to have a major presence at the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, as the Cop26 conference drills down into the science in week two . Largely gone from the Scottish Event Campus are the world leaders - former US president Barack Obama appeared yesterday - as well as government ministers and civil servants from around the world . The likes of University College Cork (UCC), Dublin City University, and the National University of Ireland (NUI) Galway are in the thick of research and policy in Glasgow . UCC archaeologist Benjamin Gearey will present at the Peatlands, Climate Change, and Cultural Heritage: Global Perspectives, Problems, Solutions session at Cop26 today, where global policymakers will gather to outline solutions for peatland restoration . "Ireland's peatlands are a rich store of history that offers so much unexploited potential in the sphere of cultural tourism and as a means to reconnect local communities to their past," Mr Gearey said . Peatland restoration, globally and in Ireland, is said to be a vital part of solving the biodiversity crisis that has threatened flora and fauna in unprecedented ways in recent decades . According to Netherlands-based news service Climate-ChangePost, around 20% of Irish surface land is peat, occurring as raised bogs, blanket bogs, or fens. They contain more than 75% of the national soil organic carbon, it said . "Archaeology is a non-renewable resource, and so much has been lost to peat cutting. This is the last chance to ensure we preserve surviving peatland archaeology for future generations," Dr Gearey will tell the Cop26 session "Peatland restoration and rehabilitation programmes offer the potential for both environmental gains in the form of biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and also for the protection of archaeological sites." Meanwhile, NUI Galway's largest research arm, the Ryan Institute, has also been engaging with fellow researchers from around the world at Cop26 . Ryan Institute director Charles Spillane said that, while the pledges made at Cop26 were welcome, they needed to be rapidly implemented well ahead of 2030 . "The evidence is that the necessary transformational shifts are not happening at the pace, scale, and depth that is necessary," Professor Spillane said. "Due to inaction or indecision regarding climate action, our current-day political leaders are at risk of condemning the next generations of citizens to an unsafe operating space for humanity on our planet . "Both speed and scale of climate action now matter and are urgent to forge a more sustainable future for all." Ryan Institute researcher Una Murray, an international development expert working closely with a range of UN agencies, is focusing on human migration and climate change . \</doc>

MINISTERS will continue to approve licences to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea despite the drive for net zero, the Business Secretary said yesterday. Kwasi Kwarteng warned the Cabinet that new fossil fuel sources would continue to be needed for many years to ensure the lights stay on. A Cabinet source said Mr Kwarteng gave an 'impassioned defence of North Sea oil and gas' - and rejected calls from green campaigners to end new drilling. Ministers also 'briefly' discussed whether the ban on fracking should remain in place, although sources insisted there were no plans to change tack. Reports yesterday said ministers are poised to sign off approval for the exploitation of six oil and gas fields in the North Sea in the coming months. And a Government source told the Daily Mail that a further six would be brought forward later this year. Labour has called for a 'hardedged' date for switching off oil and gas production in the North Sea to tackle climate change. Sir Keir Starmer has also opposed the exploitation of the Cambo oil field, one of those ministers are assessing. But a source close to Mr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying: 'We are not halting production and we are not slowing it down. We want to see more investment in the North Sea. 'The transition to net zero is exactly that - a transition. Yes, we need more offshore wind and tidal power and nuclear. 'But in the short term at least we also need oil and gas to help provide that security of supply. There will continue to be demand for oil and gas for decades - we are moving to net zero emissions, not zero.' Yesterday's Cabinet discussion coincided with the announcement by oil giant BP of \£39.5billion profits, however No 10 indicated there was no shift in the Government's opposition to calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel firm. 'There is obviously volatility in gas prices, you are seeing that reflected in profits,' the Prime Minister's spokesman said. 'I am not going to comment on individual companies. Those that perform well pay more in taxes, including corporation tax.' Environmental campaigners condemned the prospect of further North Sea exploration, saying it was at odds with the Government's commitments at last year's Cop26 summit. Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said: 'This would represent a stunning retreat from the pro-climate posturing we saw from the Government at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.' Ministers put a moratorium on fracking in 2019 because of concerns about its potential to cause mini earthquakes. Some Tory MPs are pushing for the ban to be lifted, arguing that the technology could provide a cheap and secure supply of gas. But a Government source insisted the issue was not on the table. Comment - Page 16 \£39.5bn BP's Bumper Profits It prompted campaigners and MPs to demand it was time to target the 'obscene' amounts with a one-off tax to help families struggling to pay soaring energy bills. BP and Shell are predicted to make \£340billion this year as gas prices spiral. BP posted profits of \£33billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 - 35 times the same period in 2020. Adam Scorer, of National Energy Action, said: 'We need deep, targeted measures to help the fuel poor.' BP chief Bernard Looney rejected the idea of windfall tax, saying: 'We need to be encouraging investment in natural gas in Britain, not discouraging.' \</doc>

Entering the climate summit in Glasgow, you feel entirely disconnected from the city which is hosting it. A daily negative Covid test, a 12-foot outer fence and an hour long wait inside at airport-style security are all part of the process. It's a sterile zone, there's tight security and constant checking of credentials. You're an observer who is constantly observed. COP26 . Delegates representing civic society want to be able to watch, listen and dissect what governments are promising; the commitments they're signing up to. They've found it difficult to get into some sessions due to social distancing rules, forced to rely instead on web access provided by the conference organisers. It's not the same - some feel cut off from the process, unable to influence and scrutinise in the way they would like. The organisers cite the challenges of Covid and social distance, ask for forbearance and promise to look at improving things. But it's hard to see how all that will change. A similar sense of disconnect was in evidence on the streets of Glasgow yesterday at the youth rally for climate. It'll be the same today at the main demonstration, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of people from around the world. The people affected most directly by climate change in the global south simply do not trust the politicians of the global north to deliver on climate issues. Several times at the rally yesterday we heard representatives of indigenous people explain how multinational companies had polluted their water and taken their land in the pursuit of profit. For them it's not just a climate crisis, it's a question of much wider social justice. The view of Andrea Ixch\'edu from Central America who spoke to me at the youth rally yesterday is, I think, pretty typical. I asked her why she had travelled to Glasgow? "To say that the answers to climate change are not going to be negotiated inside the COP but constructed around people who want these systems to change. "I think the message we send when we take to the streets is that hope is still alive while we are organising to change the world. "We have nothing to say to the politicians. It's all just blah, blah blah, as Greta says." And that is the challenge for the world leaders when they return to Glasgow next week to see if they can agree a communique at what we are told is the "last, best chance" to stop runaway climate change. How will they convince distrustful activists and people already suffering due to global warming, that they will deliver on the promises that have been made, and will show the ambition needed? And yet the reality is that we need the big political beasts to have any chance of driving down emissions. The richest 20 nations in the world - the so-called G20 - is responsible for the vast bulk of greenhouse gas emissions. If they can be locked into an agreement it has to be an important contribution to the wider effort. China is part of the G20 and the single biggest emitter on the plant. It got some criticism when President Xi Jinping did not attend the world leaders' summit at COP26 in person. But it has now got a net zero target of 2060, and has promised to stop funding coal powered electricity stations overseas and cancel those already planned. Climate expert Professor Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir of University College Cork, who spent the first week at COP, said that alone could save as much emissions as the entire net zero ambition of the EU out to 2050. He also points out that China's emissions per person would be much lower than many other western countries, and while they are a big polluter now, they haven't been at it for as long as many others. It all just shows the complexity of the climate narrative. What's to stop leaders returning home and doing business as usual? /n It would be churlish not to acknowledge some of the commitments made this week. Countries signing up to stop burning coal - though not the ones heavily dependent on it; others, including Ireland, committing to cutting global methane emissions, still others to stopping deforestation. India, one of the planet's biggest emitters, has set itself a net zero target for the first time. It feels it'll be 2070 before it gets there. How do you measure the effectiveness of emission promises? Several groups of climate experts have looked at the promises and worked out that if they are all kept, global warming could be held below two degrees against pre-industrial levels - which would be in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. When you consider that coming into the climate summit the pre-COP pledges on emissions cuts took us to 2.7C degrees of warming, that feels like a ray of hope. Which begs the question how do we measure the effectiveness of an emissions promise? What's to stop leaders returning home and doing business as usual? "I think it's one of the reasons why having an annual event like this on climate change is hugely important," says Professor \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir. "I can't think of any other topic in politics where global leaders meet every year to see how they're progressing, so they can be tracked. "And of course, there's protesters outside - there are people who are looking on and that really helps to ensure that what's stated here as ambition is turning into action." He says people can look to Ireland as an example. A couple of years ago, Ireland coming to COP gatherings was a "bit embarrassing" because of our domestic record on climate action, he says. Now we have legislation, targets and a plan on how to achieve them, although decarbonising our homes, our workplaces and our transport networks and electricity network will be a huge challenge. And while there are many challenges, the focus at COP has also been on the opportunities; better air quality, improved health outcomes, new green jobs. The other thing which struck me this week was the public stance taken by private finance. The risky businesses now are the ones they backed for years; oil, coal, gas. /n People worry about the cost of transition, the hefty price of electric vehicles, the outlay required to replace heating systems for their homes. They tend to look to government grants as the answer. But it was clear from COP that such a wholesale change is needed that public finance can't deliver it all. Much of the burden will fall on trillion-dollar investment funds to back green technologies, and drive down the price, making it simpler for people to make the switch. It's the sort of thing that has happened with renewables, especially wind. The money men and women were here in number this week. The risky businesses now are the ones they backed for years; oil, coal, gas. They're still in the money business, but they now see the financial opportunities in the climate business. That tie up between corporate finance and climate is something the protesters on the rally yesterday would demonstrate loudly against. The relentless pursuit of profit, they say, is one of the reasons we find ourselves in the current climate mess. The venue for the COP gathering was once a bustling dock reliant on energy-hungry heavy industries, like ship building. It was filled in and built over to provide the cavernous Scottish Exhibition Centre to which the world leaders will return next week. It is built on the banks of the Clyde, a river once synonymous with industrial might. Next week we'll know if the river and the city it flows through can enter the climate lexicon in much the same way as Paris did six years ago. \</doc>

The world is on track for catastrophic levels of global heating far in excess of the limits in the Paris agreement despite increased carbon-cutting pledges from governments made at Cop26 , according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The latest verdict of CAT - the world's most respected climate analysis coalition - provided a stark warning to almost 200 countries gathered in Glasgow as negotiations enter their most challenging phase. Temperature rises will top 2.4 degrees by the end of this century based on the short-term goals countries have set out, CAT concludes in its latest analysis. That would far exceed the 2-degree upper limit of the Paris agreement, and 1.5 degree limit aimed for at the Cop26 talks. At that level widespread extreme weather - sea-level rises, drought, floods, heatwaves and storms - would cause devastation across the globe, it predicts. The estimate is in sharp contrast to optimistic forecasts last week suggesting warming could be held to 1.9 degrees or 1.8 degrees, thanks to commitments announced at the talks. The UK, as hosts of Cop26 , were due to release overnight a first draft of the summit communiqu\'e9, which will lead to consultations with national capitals across the globe. \</doc>

WITH the UK hosts warning that "lights are flashing red on the climate change dashboard", the COP26 UN climate summit kicked off yesterday in Glasgow, marked by pointed warnings of growing threats as emissions-cutting pledges still fail to add up. "I do not underestimate the challenge" of reaching an effective deal to adequately slash emissions, Alok Sharma, Britain's COP26 president, told delegates at the talks' opening. But, he added, "I believe that we can resolve the outstanding issues." Heavy rain poured down in Glasgow on the first day of COP26 , and a fallen tree blocked train lines from London, forcing some red-faced delegates into last-minute flights or rental cars. Others struggled to master the smartphone apps governing a daily coronavirus testing regime for attendees, some of whom showed up to the venue of one of the first major international gatherings since the start of the pandemic with negative tests in hand. "This is not a normal COP," Mr Sharma admitted. COP26 may be the outcome of the G20 meeting of major economies in Rome this weekend, where leaders backed a 1.5C limit on global temperature rise but offered few new concrete commitments to achieve it. As world leaders arrive at the talks in Glasgow today, more ambitious emissions-cutting pledges will be crucial for the COP26 hosts to meet their overarching goal to "keep 1.5 alive". "If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26 , then world leaders fluffed their lines," Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement, describing the G20 outcome as "weak". Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think-tank E3G, noted that "much hard work - especially on issues of climate finance - remains ahead, if COP26 is to reach agreement" on keeping the 1.5C goal in sight. At the Glasgow conference's opening session, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa admitted that the task of swiftly shifting the world's economy onto a greener trajectory, to avoid increasingly deadly climate impacts, was enormously difficult. "The transition we need is beyond the scope, scale and speed of anything humanity has accomplished in the past. It is a daunting task. But humanity is a species defined by its ingenuity," she said. She encouraged negotiators to "keep the big picture in mind" as they haggled over details on things like finance and carbon markets, reminding them to think of "what we are trying to achieve together... and the trust invested in you by billions". Abdulla Shahid, president of the UN General Assembly, urged negotiators to "be honest" about past failures to act fast enough on climate threats and to "choose the hard but necessary actions". As the talks got underway, the World Meteorological Organisation said that the last seven years had been the hottest on record and sea level rise reached a new high in 2021. In a report, it called the changes "uncharted territory, with far-reaching repercussions for current and future generations". US President Joe Biden rounded on Moscow and Beijing ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last night, accusing them of failing to show willingness to tackle -climate change. Addressing reporters after the G20 meeting in Rome, he voiced his regret at what he regarded as failure to deliver concrete proposals. "Not only Russia but China basically didn't show up in terms of any firm commitments. I found it disappointing," Mr Biden said. The US president expects progress in Glasgow. Asked why he was pressing oil producers to increase oil supplies while pushing to cut consumption of fossil fuels, Mr Biden said petrol was still needed to drive to work. "It's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric. So the idea we're not going to need gasoline for automobiles is just not realistic," he said. An emotional Mr Biden also spoke of his gratitude to the Pope following the death of his son, Beau Biden, from brain cancer in 2015. "Pope Francis has become someone who provided great solace for my family when my son died," Mr Biden said. "It was only a matter of days since my son had passed away and Pope Francis came to the US. The wounds were still raw from my son. Before he left, the Pope asked to meet with my family." Turning to domestic politics, Mr Biden voiced hopes that his two flagship bills covering infrastructure, climate change and welfare spending will get through Congress. "I believe we will pass the infrastructure bill," he said, referring to his $1.75trn social policy bill. \</doc>

World leaders have pledged to end deforestation by the end of the decade and cut methane emissions as part of efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Nearly 90 countries, including Ireland, have joined a US- and EU-led effort to slash emissions of methane by 2030 from 2020 levels, a senior official in US president Joe Biden's administration has said. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin said Ireland would sign the pledge, but he stressed that the figure was a global target rather than a national one. More than 100 world leaders will sign up to a landmark agreement to protect and restore the Earth's forests. On the second day of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, leaders covering 85% of the world's forests will commit to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030. Meanwhile, the US and EU are launching an initiative to drive global efforts to cut emissions of methane, a powerful but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas caused by sources including fossil fuel extraction and livestock farming, as a significant short-term contribution to climate action. Dozens of heads of state will take part in the launch of the pledge, which commits countries to cut their emissions of the gas by 30% by 2030. The announcements are part of efforts at Cop26 in a range of sectors to drive momentum on reducing emissions,alongside national plans by countries to cut climate-warming pollution in the next decade. Current national action plans to curb emissions leave the world way off track to meet global goals to keep temperature rises to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and to aim for a less dangerous 1.5C limit. Cop26 are under pressure to keep the 1.5C goal in reach, deliver on climate finance to support poorer nations tackle the crisis, and finalise parts of the global Paris climate treaty. Cop26 will not close the gap between the action needed and what countries have promised, even with countries such as India bringing forward new commitments on the first day of the talks, so there will also be a push to negotiate a road map to increasing ambition in the next decade.

POLITICIANS have shown a 'criminal' abdication of leadership on climate change, the UN general secretary said yesterday. Antonio Guterres issued the warning as a new UN report said many impacts of global warming are now irreversible. But there is still a window of time to avoid the very worst, its authors said. There is an immediate need to prevent irreversible impacts - such as melting of polar ice shelves and destruction of ecosystems, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment said. It also predicts worldwide food shortages that will leave millions starving and sea level rises which will destroy coastal communities and hit the world's economy. Mr Guterres said: 'I've seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like these. Today's IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of fake climate leadership. With fact upon fact, these reports reveal people on the planet are getting clobbered by climate change. Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger zone - now. 'Many ecosystems are at the point of no return - now. And unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world's most vulnerable on a frogmarch to destruction - now. 'The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal. The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson on our only home.' Mr Guterres's comments were retweeted by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who added: 'Delay means death.' It comes more than 100 days after world leaders agreed new efforts to limit warming and to deliver finance for adaptation at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The report, called Assessment Review Six, warns it is essential to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, which will require the world to cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But global emissions are set to rise by 14 per cent in the next decades, Mr Guterres said. Coal, oil and gas were 'choking humanity' and he called on governments to 'dismantle' coal power stations. The report is the latest in a series produced by the IPCC, which is a UN body assessing science around climate change. It has been released after being approved in a process involving representatives of 195 governments and scientists. It said human-driven climate change has led to increasing heat and heatwaves, rising sea levels, floods, wildfires and drought, causing death, food and water scarcity, and migration. Current rates of cli- mate change will 'cause loss and degradation of much of the world's forests, coral reefs and low-lying coastal wetlands'. Different weather extremes are happening at the same time, causing 'cascading' effects increasingly hard to manage. The report warned we are nearing 'tipping points' such as melting of ice sheets in Antarctica, thawing of Arctic permafrost or the loss of Amazon rainforest. Some 3.3 billion to 3.6 billion people live in situations where they are highly vulnerable to climate change, the report warns. Consequences of warming will hit sub-Saharan Africa and small island states hardest. At 1.5C of warming - and we are now at 1.1C - 14 per cent of species will face risk of extinction. The world needs to safeguard nature, including conserving 30-50 per cent of land, freshwater and sea habitats, to reduce warming impacts. The report also calls for measures such as restoring wetlands to guard against flooding, avoiding building on flood plains and planting more urban trees to cool cities. Lab-grown meat could reduce pressure on creating pastures for cattle. But it warns against 'maladaptation' - such as hard sea walls which can cause more problems. Debra Roberts, IPCC co-chairman, said: 'This is really a key moment. Our report points out very clearly, this is the decade of action, if we are going to turn things around.' Emma Howard Boyd, chairman of the Environment Agency, said: 'It is adapt or die. Previous IPCC reports have talked about terrible climate risks, this report shows how impacts to people, nature and the economy are interconnected. 'The IPCC offers us a glimmer of hope, the window to deliver climate resilience is still there, but it is closing fast.' A Government spokesman said: 'The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20, and helping over 90 per cent of the global economy set net-zero targets during our Cop26 presidency.'

When world leaders gather in Glasgow for Cop26 in a bid to curb dangerous warming, it will be in the face of code red scientific warnings of climate change and urgent calls for action. But the latest update to the Oxford English Dictionary shows we have been talking about "climate change" for more than a century and a half, so how did we get here and why has it taken so long? Here are some key milestones in the history of climate change: - James Watt patented his steam engine in 1769, helping drive the Industrial Revolution and its use of fossil fuels. - Joseph Fourier recognised the atmosphere acts as a blanket, keeping the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be, the "greenhouse effect", as early as 1824. - Just a few decades later Irish physicist John Tyndall measured the absorption of heat by greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide in his laboratory in London, publishing a paper on his findings in 1861. AdvertisementA few years before him American female scientist Eunice Newton Foote conducted an experiment revealing the heat-trapping properties of carbon dioxide, and warned in a scientific paper in 1856 that an atmosphere of that gas would give the Earth a high temperature. - Before the end of the 19th century - which saw the development of ocean-going steamships, coal fired power stations for electricity and the motor car - scientists began to spell out the impact of changing carbon dioxide levels. In 1896 Svante Arrhenius published a paper on ice ages which estimated temperature changes due to changing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He was followed a few years later by fellow Swede Nils Ekholm suggesting the gas could increase in the atmosphere over the coming millennium due to the burning of coal, which would warm the Earth.

He did the calculations in his spare time, without a computer. - Oceanographer Roger Revelle first briefed the US Congress on climate change in 1956, warning that "we are making perhaps the greatest geophysical experiment in history". AdvertisementShortly afterwards, Charles David Keeling started measuring carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, producing the "Keeling Curve" - a clear record of rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere We are now in the sixth assessment cycle that the IPCC has conducted, which issued a "code red" for humanity this summer. - In the late 1980s there were growing calls for an international treaty on climate change, not least as countries had just managed to successfully negotiate the Montreal Protocol to phase down the use of CFC chemicals that were damaging the ozone layer, another major environment problem. Among those making the calls was UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who warned of the threat of climate change in a speech to the UN in 1989. - The treaty, known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), was agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Advertisement- The first Cop - or "conference of parties" to the UNFCCC - in 1995, presided over by Angela Merkel, got the show on the road towards a deal to take action on the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. - \~The world's first climate change treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was agreed in 1997, with developed nations committing to cuts to their emissions. It entered into force in 2005, but was never ratified by the United States and did not cover the burgeoning emissions of emerging economies such as China. - Talks in Copenhagen in 2009 to secure a new treaty did not go as planned, against a backdrop of the financial crisis, acrimony between countries and efforts by climate sceptics to cast doubt on the science, and failed to secure the comprehensive deal it was now clear was needed. \~ - Countries finally secured the Paris Agreement in 2015 in the French capital, agreeing a comprehensive global deal to limit temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursuing efforts to curb warming to 1.5C. Another six years on, countries meeting in Glasgow for Cop26 are being urged to deliver on the promises they made in Paris and drive the action needed to curb dangerous warming. Climate campaigner and author of Our Biggest Experiment, a history of the climate crisis, Alice Bell, said that the world was still talking about delivering action three decades after the first calls for action in part because the oil industry pushed back with successful tactics for delay. AdvertisementAlso, she said, climate diplomacy takes time, adding: "The architects of the UNFCCC knew that in 1992, which is one of the reasons why they didn't just make an agreement but agreed to meet every year to keep making that agreement, and trying to make it better." But she said people would be "forgiven for thinking this has just offered an opportunity for generations of politicians to keep on chatting rather than actually doing anything. "We've been talking about climate change for well over 150 years, and worried about it for a good 50. It's time to get to work." \</doc>

POLITICIANS, advisers and civil servants will face fines of up to (EURO)25,000 if they do not observe a 'cooling off' period before taking on new jobs, under new rules agreed by Cabinet yesterday. Those who do not comply with the 12- month cooling-off period for lobbying activity will be fined up to (EURO)25,000 and barred from lobbying for up to two years. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath brought a memo to Cabinet finalising legislation to strengthen the regulation of lobbying by former ministers, senior civil servants and special advisers. It is the first time a breach of the cooling-off period will be punishable. The system of sanctions will be administered by the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO). The move follows controversy over Michael D'Arcy's appointment as chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers (IAIM) in 2020, shortly after he left office as a junior minister in the Department of Finance. Mr D'Arcy did not consult with SIPO before taking up the job. However, the IAIM pledged that he would not engage in lobbying activities for at least 12 months. The lobbying register shows Mr D'Arcy lobbied former colleagues in the Department of Finance in the final quarter of 2021 asking them to add a group from IAIM, including himself, to the delegation attending the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. The IAIM was not included in the delegation, although Mr D'Arcy and IAIM chairman Paul Price did attend. The new legislation will now make its way through the Oireachtas. \</doc>

There is potential for an agreement to be reached at COP26 to limit warming to 1.5C, but it is not certain, according to Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan. "It's very important. There\' s a potential for an agreement which would help us keep 1.5C alive and that we stop the worst, most dangerous climate change, but we're not certain," he said. "I think if we get an agreement, it can't not be adequate. We can't agree a deal which doesn't meet the science, so that goes without saying." Speaking to RT\'c9 News at COP26 , Mr Ryan said the talks may run into tomorrow. "This is a critical moment when Europe has to stand with the developing world, and help the developing world in this really impossible challenge. The only way we can do it is collectively. "One of the key issues in getting an agreement, I think, would be how we help developing countries, poor countries, and I think Ireland has a role to play in that." He said in a meeting with fellow European countries, Ireland - along with three other countries - are offering immediate finance. Ireland will be providing \€ 5 million. Mr Ryan said this was "to help host the network we need to discuss this issue", referring to the discussion around loss and damage, and how wealthier countries provide financial support to countries who have already experienced impacts of climate change. "I think Ireland can help in that way, and we also have a good record on humanitarian relief and helping countries manage loss and damage." The minister said he is saying to his European colleagues that Ireland will provide "whatever support and help" so that the poorest countries are protected, "and so we don't ignore the science". A revised draft deal has been published at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. The document retains references for countries to upgrade climate pledges next year and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that have been criticised by some nations.

INFRASTRUCTURE minister Nichola Mallon has signed the Glasgow declaration on zero emission vehicles, on behalf of the Executive. The SDLP politician yesterday also chaired an expert panel discussion for Transport Day at COP26 , which aimed to explore the innovation and business opportunities arising from the transition to zero emission vehicles. Ms Mallon inset, said it was a  critical announcement for governments, businesses, and other organisations with an influence over the future of the automotive industry and road transport .  I am pleased to sign this declaration to show that Northern Ireland has endorsed this COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100 per cent zero emission cars and vans, she said.  Together, we are committing to rapidly accelerating the transition to zero emission vehicles, to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, by agreeing that we will work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission by no later than 2035.  Across these islands, we have already seen significant innovation in transport decarbonisation. Specifically in relation to zero emission vehicles, key investment in innovative projects is delivering new vehicle and infrastructure technologies.  These projects are providing economic benefits such as job creation and are unlocking private investment to support new technologies to come to market. She added that it was  an honour to attend COP26 to  play my part working with leaders across these islands and across the globe to tackle the climate crisis . \</doc>

IRELAND is sending its largest ever climate team to the COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, with an official delegation of 50 ministers, staff and experts due to attend at different times over the two weeks. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will attend on Monday and Tuesday, while Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan will attend for the second week. Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue and minsters of state Pippa Hackett (biodiversity), Malcolm Noonan (heritage), Colm Brophy (development aid) and Martin Heydon (farm safety) will also travel for events specific to their briefs. State and semi-state bodies such as Eirgrid and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and Met \'c9ireann will also take part. Separately, dozens of academics, students, activists, representatives of environmental NGOs and development agencies are sending representatives as official observers or to participate in the many fringe events being held in and around the summit venue. Proximity is a factor in the size of the official delegation as the annual UN climate summit has never before been hosted so close to home. But the Government is also keen to promote Ireland's role in climate action, both on the home front and on behalf of poorer countries. For negotiation purposes, Ireland is part of the EU grouping and our national aims are consistent with the bloc as a whole. Primarily that means supporting the call for increased efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, the point beyond which scientists warn climate change will escalate with much more severe and long-lasting consequences than currently experienced. Key to that is pushing countries to improve on the pledges they made at the 2015 Paris Agreement to cut their own carbon emissions so that collectively the reduction would make 1.5 degrees feasible. Only around a dozen countries, and the EU as a bloc, have enshrined the target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in law. Ireland has done this nationally in the Climate Act and as an EU member. That, along with the carbon budget announced this week, puts Ireland in a position of being able to show a degree of leadership to other countries. The official delegation is also keen to take part in discussions on climate finance - assistance to poor countries to enable them to develop their economies with clean technology and renewable energy. Irish representatives will also be involved in talks about "loss and damage" - the establishment of a permanent fund for climate catastrophe assistance that usually comes piecemeal after repeated appeals for donations. Sustainable agriculture, protection of oceans and gender issues will also have Irish input. Mr Ryan said he would measure the success of the summit if a genuine commitment emerged from all parties to work harder and faster toward the Paris goals. "Keeping 1.5 alive - that's what it's all about," he said. Mr Ryan told the Indo Daily podcast he agreed with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg's criticisms of the "all talk, no action" approach of the international community. "She's right. We don't have room now. We have to stop talking and we do have to start acting," he said. "We've been involved in this for 30 years now, and if we'd started 30 years ago with real action it would have been so much easier, it would have been a gentle glide to decarbonise. But now we don't have that luxury, we don't have that time." He said Ireland did not always have a good record on climate issues, but with the Climate Act, carbon budgets, a new Climate Action Plan on the way and the halt to fossil fuel exploration, things had changed. \</doc>

FORMER US president Barack Obama has urged climate activists to "do a little more listening" to those reluctant to take action. Speaking at Cop26 Groups including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have been criticised for blocking traffic in protests they have used to draw attention to the effects of climate change and the environmental impact of inefficient heating. "Protests are necessary to raise awareness, hashtag campaigns can spread awareness," he said. "But to build the broad-based coalitions necessary for bold action, we have to persuade people who either currently don't agree with us, or are indifferent to the issue. "To change the minds of those fellow citizens in our respective countries, we have to do a little more listening." He added: "We can't just yell at them, or say they're ignorant. "We can't just tweet at them, it's not enough to inconvenience them through blocking traffic in a protest - we actually have to listen to their objections and understand the reluctance of some ordinary people to see their countries move too fast on climate change. "We have to understand their realities and work with them so that serious action on climate change doesn't adversely impact them." Work must be done, the former president told delegates, to understand the impact of rapid de-carbonisation on normal people. "It is true - a lot of climate opposition comes from fossil fuel companies trying to make a buck, despite the green ads they run on TV," he said. "It is true that there are climate deniers out there who for ideological reasons you will never convince. "But I'm not talking about them - I'm talking about the fact that we've got to persuade the guy who has got to drive to his factory job every day, can't afford a Tesla and might not be able to pay the rent or feed his family if gas prices go up. "We have to think about the mother in India who, yes, will suffer droughts and floods made worse by climate change, but whose more immediate concern is getting electricity so her children don't have to sit in the dark and can't do their homework. "You can't dismiss that concern - there are workers and communities that still depend on coal for power and jobs and yes, they are concerned about maintaining their wages - that's not unreasonable for them to be concerned about that." Moving away from fossil fuels, the former president said, will have a cost, but it was for the more developed nations to ensure "the people most effected by the transition to clean energy aren't the ones baring most of the cost". "They don't have any margin for error," he said. He added: "Any climate plan worth its salt has to take these inequities into account - whether that its through subsidies to poor people to ease the transition to clean energy, whether its technology transfers that help poor countries meet their development goals by leapfrogging dirty fuels - we have to pay attention to those embedded inequities and the politics that surrounds that." He urged young people to "stay angry" about climate change, but asked them to channel their frustration into action. He said: "Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more - because that's what's required to meet this challenge. "Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint. "For solving a problem this big and this complex has never happened all at once." Quoting Shakespeare, former US president Barack Obama said the "wounds" caused to the planet by climate change will "be healed by degrees". Referencing a line from Othello, Mr Obama said: "What wound did ever heal but by degrees? "Our planet has been wounded by our actions - those wounds won't be healed today, or tomorrow, or the next, but they can be healed by degrees. "If we start with that spirit and each of us can fight through the occasional frustration and dread, if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, I believe we can secure a better future. We have to. "And what a profound and noble task to set for ourselves. "I'm ready for the long haul if you are, so let's get to work." 'We have to leep pushing harder and harder for more and more - because that's what's required to meet this challenge' \</doc>

The next three years will be the most critical in recent global history if "unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages" are to be avoided. That is the stark warning from the latest assessment of the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says it is "now or never" if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C. The public must immediately be encouraged to move to more plant-based diets, heat homes in a more environmentally friendly way, and take up walking and cycling or driving electric cars. Cities must be made greener, more walkable, and healthier. There will need to be fewer flights taken by individuals, the widespread electrif ication of transport, and the rapid adaptation of more renewable energy. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have to peak by 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030, while at the same time, methane - one of Ireland's biggest emissions culprits - would need to be reduced by about a third if the 1.5C target is to be met, says the IPCC. Even if this is accomplished, "it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century", states the report. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said: "Some government and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic." Even if all the pledges made up to 2020 had been implemented, a rise of 3.2C would occur, the scientists found. Mr Guterres said that would mean heat waves, storms, and water shortages on an unprecedented scale. Eoin Lettice, plant scientist and lecturer at the School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences and the Environmental Research Institute, said: "The agriculture sector in Ireland is not on a sustainable lowcarbon path, according to the Climate Change Advisory Council. "This will need to be tackled, as farming is the largest contributor by sector to greenhouse gas emissions in the country." Among the most problematic of issues is what we do about methane, he said. "Methane is a short-lived but potent GHG which is derived mainly from cattle in the Irish context. The IPCC calls for a 30% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 if we are to avert disaster. "Despite signing the global methane pledge at Cop26 in Glasgow and committing to this reduction and timeframe, the Government was quick to clarify that they consider this a global pledge, and that Ireland may not reach anywhere near this target," said Dr Lettice. Stop Climate Chaos, a group comprising 30 Irish civil society organisations, said Government action to reduce emissions immediately and phase out fossil fuels "must begin now, not in 10 years' time". It pointed to the IPCC's finding that average annual GHGs were at their highest recorded level between 2010 and 2019, and that global emissions from energy hit a record high in 2021. The IPCC report states the global temperature will stabilise when carbon dioxide emissions reach net zero. "For 1.5C, this means achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions globally in the early 2050s; for 2C, it is in the early 2070s," it said. Peter Thorne, a leading Irish contributor to previous IPCC reports and a professor at Maynooth University, said the pathway is narrow but achievable. "Nationally, the Climate Act puts in place the governance aspects but governance is nothing without action. We now need to see progress on the ground." \</doc>

ENVIRONMENT Minister Edwin Poots has been criticised for flying to the global climate change summit in Glasgow. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said Mr Poots will ensure the carbon emissions of his flight are offset by the planting of trees. But climate campaigners in Belfast were less than impressed that the DUP man jetted to Cop26 . Green Party MLA Rachel Woods said: "Minister Poots is opposed to the cross-party consensus that Northern Ireland should aim for a net zero emissions target, so it comes as little surprise that he's seemingly not taking emissions reductions seriously in terms of his own travel choices. "Northern Ireland is already in an embarrassing place as Cop26 gets under way, as we still have no climate legislation, and the highest per-capita emissions in the UK and Ireland. This is likely to further add to our poor reputation for climate action." Queen's University professor of green political economy John Barry said Mr Poots' decision was disappointing. "We don't want to be 'flight shaming' people, but for shorthaul flights like this? You can understand coming from Australia and so on," he said. "The minister could have easily got the ferry to Stranraer, got the train up to Glasgow and shown some leadership." Other local politicians will be taking more sustainable routes to the Glasgow summit. Mr Smyth, along with Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl and his Green Party councillor colleague Aine Groogan, will be taking the ferry. And Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan cycled there. DAERA said: "The minister is committed to ensure that his department offsets any emissions associated with travel to and from the conference. To that effect officials will be gathering details of journeys made and putting in place a programme to plant native broadleaved trees to offset more than the equivalent emissions." Meanwhile, Sammy Wilson has branded Cop26 a "climate circus". In a letter published in today's Belfast Telegraph the DUP MP also questioned whether world leaders can really "control the Earth's thermostat" simply by reducing C02 emissions. In a Commons question to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Wilson had asked: "Given the commitments which the Prime Minister is making at the climate circus in Glasgow this week, how can the Chancellor possibly say that public finances will be managed effectively when the huge costs of net zero are not even published by the Treasury, let alone known by the public, and we are already seeing taxes increasing to pay for the huge infrastructure changes which reaching net zero are going to entail." The Chancellor said the net zero strategy would be backed up by \£330bn of investment, with Northern Ireland to receive around \£31.5bn. In his letter, Mr Wilson questioned efforts at Cop26 . "Those with a basic knowledge of geography, science and history would know that the Earth's climate is constantly changing and the natural forces which are responsible are well beyond the ability of man to influence," he said. Friends of the Earth said: "The DUP should be deeply embarrassed in the face of the climate denialism brazenly shown by Sammy Wilson - while his party colleagues are at the Cop26 negotiations and when the survivability of life on our planet is at stake. "Does the former Environment Minister, who previously tried to ban adverts warning of the effects of climate change, know more than the world's leading climate scientists?" Letters, Page 21 \</doc>

COP26 should have been the Cop of increased ambition, decisive action and financial reparations. Instead, we have the Glasgow Climate Pact, and this pact is not enough. While early drafts of the pact talked about 'phasing out' fossil fuels, last minute opposition meant the wording of text changed from 'phasing out' to 'phasing down'. Watering down the language of the final draft is highly significant, 'phasing down' can mean anything from curbing emissions from 0.1% to 50%. Secondly, the Glasgow Climate Pact does not deliver justice for the world's most vulnerable countries. In Cop15 in 2009, it was agreed that developed countries would provide $100 billion per year to fund developing nations. Cop26 did not close this gap. While the Glasgow Climate Pact may not have gone as far as we would have liked, we must recognise that to disregard the pact as a failure undermines significant commitments made by some countries to further progress. Climate finance was undoubtedly a major topic of discussion in Glasgow, and wealthy states and developed countries have committed to doubling climate adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025. The £ccelerating efforts' of developed countries to limit coal use are also politically significant. Indeed, Cop26 is the first time that 197 countries have universally acknowledged the harmful impact of fossil fuels and coal. Countries will also strengthen their 2030 climate plans next year. Loss and damage funding - established to help countries already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis - is also a topic which will be revisited next year. With negotiations dragging on in Glasgow, vulnerable nations were forced to accept this decision in order to move the talks forward. Putting off funding commitments for loss and damage until next year is deeply unfair. The climate crisis has injured, displaced and destroyed communities around the world. Loss and damage reparations is one of the most pressing topics on our global agenda, and should have been the first issue which was addressed and resolved in Glasgow. Where establishing an international loss and damage fund has been put off in the name of 'compromise', emotionally-charged statements from the Informal Plenary on Friday reveals how the only thing being compromised is our future. 'The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us', in the words of the Maldives. 'We are negotiating our very existence', in the words of Bangladesh. '1.5 degrees is not a statistic, it's a matter of life and death', in the words of Kenya. Following this Cop, the projected level of warming is 2.4 degrees. Despite pledges 'to keep 1.5 alive', we are not even close. Those disappointed and outraged by the outcome of Cop26 have every right to be angry. After two gruelling weeks of intense negotiations, many of us have been stretched beyond our capacities. However, even in these challenging months to come, we must keep up the momentum. We must choose to persevere. We must continue to hold our governments to account. We must rise to the next level of our abilities. Rosalind Skillen is a climate activist and Cop26 delegate 'Loss and damage reparations is one of the most pressing topics on our agenda' \</doc>

Barack Obama's motivational words were designed to spur on parties to the Cop26 negotiations midway through proceedings. His arrival in Glasgow coincided with my own as I joined the UCC delegation for the second week of these lengthy talks. We left Cork and Waterford on Saturday morning, travelling by train to Belfast before catching the boat to Cairnryan on Sunday. We completed our sustainable, public transport-based journey to Cop26 with a bus ride to Edinburgh. Now that I'm here the mood seems like (to borrow a phrase): "A lot done. More to do". Leading up to the meeting, a number of goals including keeping warming by mid-century at or below 1.5C had been set out. The latest commitments from the likes of India and China to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and 2060, respectively; along with the US/EU pledge to cut methane emissions globally by 30% means that this target is still alive. An International Energy Agency analysis late last week suggested that we are currently on target for 1.8C when the new pledges are taken into account. It's not 1.5 (yet) but it's closer then we've ever been before. So, progress is being made but there is no shortage of bad news. We hear in talk after talk of the impact of climate change today on countries that were struggling even before global warming and severe weather events hit. Elizabeth Robinson of the London School of Economics highlighted in one session how undernourishment in Ethiopia had decreased from 47% in 2002 to 14% in 2016 before increasing to 16% in 2020. Gains in human health outcomes across many developing nations are being eroded by the impact of climate change on crop production and this erosion will continue. "Climate change makes everything harder," said Prof Robinson. As we adapt food production to a changing climate there are legitimate concerns that natural ecosystems will continue to be lost to make way for agriculture.

The latest climate report from the UN sets out the action needed to tackle the global warming crisis. Here are answers to some key questions about the report. What is the report? It is the third part of a global assessment of climate science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the sixth such assessment the UN body has conducted, with the most recent one back in 2013/14. This third report looks at "mitigation" or the action needed to curb global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The first part, labelled a "code red for humanity" when it was published last August, examined the physical basis of climate change, while the second report in February this year spelled out the impacts of rising temperatures and the options for - and limits to - adapting to them. What is the IPCC? It is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established in 1988 to provide political leaders with scientific assessments on climate change, to help them make policy. Some 195 countries are members of the IPCC. There always seems to be another climate report coming out. What is different about this one? The IPCC reports are an assessment of all the available science on climate change. This latest study references more than 18,000 studies and sources, and has involved hundreds of authors from around the world, who have received tens of thousands of comments on earlier drafts from scientists and governments. Most importantly, the 63-page summary of the report has been subject to a line-by-line approval process involving scientists and representatives of the 195 governments before publication - which has taken place online over the last two weeks. It significantly overran its scheduled Friday finishing time, wrapping up the approval process late on Sunday evening, but it does mean that governments have signed off on the findings. What does the report say? That means substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels, a switch to clean energy such as increasingly cheap renewables, technology to capture carbon and scaling up everything from electric cars to energy efficiency in buildings. It also highlights ways to encourage people to make greener choices, such as plant-based diets or choosing to walk and cycle, and warns that measures to take carbon from the atmosphere, including tree planting and new technology will also be needed. What impact will it have? The first part of the assessment came out in the run-up to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, which aimed - and just about managed - to keep limiting global warming to 1.5C within reach. The war, which worsened already soaring energy prices as western nations scrambled to shift away from Russian oil and gas, has put security of supplies and fuel costs at the top of the agenda for many countries including the UK. Those backing climate action have seized on the report's findings on the need for deep cuts in fossil fuel use, saying it is another reason to wean countries off oil and gas, alongside energy security and curbing Russian aggression. But with fossil fuel companies putting pressure on governments to increase exploration and production, and with consumers facing a cost-of-living crisis, there is a danger - once again - that decisive climate action falls victim to more immediate concerns for politicians. \</doc>

In all fairness, I must admit that, in my many years of writing a weekly column for this paper, environmental news has never been so urgent that I needed a hotline to the editorial desk. Still, I remember being a tad miffed when I missed the chance of a scoop after being the first environmental correspondent to hear that a fin whale was to be seen lying stranded on the floor of ebbed Courtmacsherry Bay one dawn morning in 2014. Or to tell the world that a bearded seal from the Arctic Ocean was relaxing on a sandbank in the same bay when, in 2017, an observant farmer phoned to tell me the news as I was getting out of bed. The chance to file exclusives, in each case, was frustrated as both creatures appeared midweek, and my column wouldn't appear until the Monday following. Meanwhile, interlopers from other media arrived to post the tidings on the 6pm television news and, as for print publication, the weekend newspaper beat me to it by two days. While the unprecedented appearances of 20m beached whales, confused auks, disorientated walruses, and wandering snow-white seals weren't of urgent or global import, well may we hope that such 'trivia' aren't henceforth increasingly eclipsed by overnight wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and tsunamis occurring in every corner of the world. Which brings me to Glasgow Cop26 , and this morning's good news. UK prime minister Boris Johnson, hosting the event, the attendees of which are charged with saving the globe from burning, drowning, baking, suffocating or starving, has declared that the heads of state of the 100-plus nations holding 85% of the world's forests will sign The Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use committing them to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030. Forests cover 31% of the Earth's land area. The forests controlled by these 100+ leaders total more than 33m sq km of surviving, sustainable carbon sinks. Pledges were made by 12 countries, including the UK, to provide \'e2\£c10bn of public funding with a further \'e2\£c6.2bn in private investment to assist developing countries, reward indigenous forest guardians and to extend sustainable agricultural land. The reforestation and concomitant regeneration of one third of the Earth's surface would be a mighty achievement if brought to fruition in the space of the next nine years. It would give new hope for the continuance of nature and of our species. But the provision of secure carbon sinks should not slow ongoing attempts to radically reduce the burning of fossil fuels. So far, the business of achieving credible and binding pledges from national leaders and big business to reduce carbon emissions has not topped the agenda. It will: and let us hope we see the same ratio of commitment to this. As mentioned in previous articles, David Attenborough has said that by conserving one third of the land, the forests and the seas we would save the planet for our children. Conservation of the seas must be on the agenda of the summit. But only so much can be done. China, which is not attending the summit, accounts for nearly half of the world's fishing, including the 17,000 Chinese ships comprising the largest distant-water fishing fleet in the world, and operating in all the world's oceans. Any one of these ships can scoop up in a week what a local boat would catch in a year. Such harvesting is unsustainable. In Czechia, where I am visiting family, following a week of warm sunshine the winter is 'icumen in'. Yesterday, I found a peacock butterfly seeking a hibernation site on the stairwell to my son's flat. It wasn't a safe location, so I cupped it gently between my palms and transferred it to an open cellar in the basement. There, central heating wouldn't wake it in mid-winter when it would find no nectar and starve, but it could escape when the weather naturally warmed in spring. Czechia (formerly The Czech Republic) has six nuclear reactors generating about a third of its electricity. Apparently, small scale nuclear power sources are the optimum solution for the country. The building of a new nuclear power unit has substantial public support. A team of scientists has recently found a radical way to heat cities using spent nuclear rods, which they say is cost-effective and greener than natural gas. As the EU moves away from coal, this development has been widely studied. Nuclear power reactors don't create carbon dioxide emissions or air pollution. However, mining and refining uranium ore and making reactor fuel requires large amounts of energy. Energy, energy! May the great creator of energy endow the Glasgow gathering with workable ideas to create it without global burnout. \</doc>

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos defended his trip to space in July which he said made him realise how fragile the planet was. "I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens from which you view the world," he said. "But I was not prepared for just how much that would be true. "Looking back at Earth from up there, the atmosphere seems so thin, the world so finite and so fragile. "Now, in this critical year and what we all know is the decisive decade, we must all stand together to protect our world." Karine Elharrar, Israel's energy and water resources minister, received an apology from Cop26 organisers after she could not attend the summit on Monday due to a lack of wheelchair accessibility . She wrote on Twitter: "To Cop26 I came to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a joint fight against the climate crisis. "It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not take care of accessibility at its events. "I hope that the lessons required to be learned tomorrow to promote green energies, remove barriers and energy efficiency will be the things I deal with." Cop26 apologised for the incident : "Regarding minister Elharrar's experience at the entry point yesterday, this was a genuine mistake and we have apologised for that. "We are pleased to see her in attendance at Cop26 today. " Cop26 Boris Johnson, British prime minister, hailed the pledge by more than 100 leaders to end the "great chainsaw massacre" of the world's forests : "Let's end this great chainsaw massacre by making conservation do what we know it can do, and that is deliver long-term sustainable jobs and growth as well," he said. "Today is not just a vital win in the struggle to contain global temperature increases, it is also a huge economic opportunity. "This is the long-term sustainable path to ending the loss of our forests, protecting our sacred biodiversity and helping to keep alive the ambition of 1.5 degrees by the end of the century." In response to the announcements to end deforestation by 2030, Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, said : "In Paris in 2016, the world's leaders committed to recognise the concept of net zero, to draw a line in the sand around how much greenhouse gases can be allowed into the atmosphere. "Now in Glasgow, they have committed to a similar aspiration for deforestation and land degradation, to stop and start reversing these by 2030." Speaking at the summit, US President Joe Biden thanked those who have signed the commitment to cut methane emissions by 30% by the end of the decade : "Together we are committing to \</doc>

Failure to introduce carbon markets, which effectively allow countries to buy and sell emissions reductions, would set back the post-pandemic recovery, the Taoiseach was warned before Cop26 . He said that if a common rulebook on such markets was not agreed, it risked "triggering damaging climate-related trade frictions which could place a significant drag on any post-pandemic recovery". HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NvbnRlbnQuYXNzZXRzLnByZXNzYXNzb2NpYXRpb24uaW9cXFwvMjAyMVxcXC8xMlxcXC8yMzEzMzcwMFxcXC83YjM2Nzc3OS0xNTgxLTRlZDMtYTllMS0xMjUxYjk4MWI0YTMuanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOm51bGwsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOntcIm91dHB1dFwiOlwid2VicFwifX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiOWViZmM1MjczMTJiMTk1YjRiODlhNTZlODMwMzQxZjgyMjMyMjIyOCJ9/risk-to-post-covid-recovery-if-countries-cannot-buy-emissions-reductions.jpg Link to Image A view of the Chambers Ireland offices in Dublin's city centre (Brian Lawless/PA) The provision, under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, had been a sticking point in negotiations for six years until it was signed off on at the climate conference in Glasgow in November. Mr Talbot said failure to introduce the measure would have driven up costs, particularly for small businesses, though others argue that the availability of cheap offsets could disincentivise emissions reductions. AdvertisementIn a letter on October 14th, Mr Talbot wrote: "We note with great concern that current domestic climate policies are insufficient to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. "We also see a cast-iron economic case for ensuring that the Paris Agreement can enable the creation of effective international carbon markets. "As you may be aware, recent independent research has shown that implementation of Article 6 has the potential to reduce the total cost of implementing national climate commitments by more than half - a total of (EURO)216 billion per year in 2030. "Given the fiscal toll of the coronavirus pandemic, we believe that this is too significant a dividend for any government to leave on the table in Glasgow next month. "By contrast, a further failure to agree on a robust set of rules to implement Article 6 risks driving up the costs of climate action in the years to come."

(Hannah McKay/PA) He added: "Many businesses in our network already report that the fragmented nature of existing domestic carbon pricing regimes poses increasing operational challenges and risks - particularly smaller businesses with limited administrative or technical capacities. Advertisement"While we recognise that Article 6 itself is not designed to lead to a global carbon price, we believe - with the right operating rules - that it has the potential to create the necessary transparency to forge a more cohesive multilateral approach to carbon pricing. "From a real economy perspective, this is clearly vital to avoid the unintended consequences of unilateral climate policy measures - which increasingly risk triggering damaging climate-related trade frictions which could place a significant drag on any post pandemic recovery." Mr Talbot, chief executive of both Chambers Ireland and the International Chamber of Commerce Ireland, said was writing on "behalf of the global business community". Carbon markets have been a contentious issue in the fight against climate change. \~ Celia Nyssens, policy officer for agriculture at the European Environment Bureau, argues that they "rely on polluters purchasing carbon offsets". "The availability of cheap offsets would however disincentivise prior emissions reductions" she adds. "Even if these issues are properly addressed by the commission's framework for the certification of carbon removals, it remains questionable whether polluters should be allowed to buy the right to claim 'climate neutrality'. "This could send confusing signals to consumers, slowing the shift to more sustainable lifestyles." AdvertisementThe Bellona Foundation, an international not-for-profit organisation that seeks to identify climate solutions, says the success of such markets depends on the rules governing them. "If done well, it may serve to optimise the mitigation of climate change by channelling much-needed financial resources to projects and countries where it can be applied most efficiently" they state. "If done badly, it would amount to little more than climate negligence." \</doc>

FOR the past week, on my daily drive to the hill farm I've been passing the river in my local village and watching a pair of swans. After two or three days it became apparent the swans were hatching this year's brood of cygnets. Both the male and female will incubate the eggs for up to 40 days then the young will emerge into the cool and clear early summer river of life. Seeing the swans each day gives me a great delight. I do not go near them. They are in their world and I am in mine, so it would seem, but that is not so for we all live in this shared world. The imagination of the world created the beauty of the swans. The imagination of man created the bridge I travelled over. It is a worthy addition to this world but our imagination has also created other things, dark things that can threaten those young cygnets. They are the inheritors of a world that is changing, a world that needs action and thoughts of different kinds. Perhaps it was the swans, perhaps it was nature at its most beautiful, but I have taken to reading the collected speeches of Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist. Greta's school strikes, starting in August 2018 when she was 15, began outside the Swedish parliament with a call for stronger action on climate change by her own government. However, in this digital age, word soon spread, and Fridays for Future was born, when young people around the world protested on Fridays in a call for greater climate action. Thunberg, who is a plain and direct speaker, something that I greatly admired in reading her speeches, rose to public prominence quite quickly and by December 2018 gave an address at the UN climate change conference. In 2019 the protest movement became a major one, with millions attending events. The movement caught many by surprise and brought for the first time the children of the world into the debate on climate change. Thunberg had the ability, as she says herself through her self-titled "gift" of Asperger's syndrome, to see things in a different way - to coalesce the, at times, complex issues of climate change and emissions into simple dialogue. She has become the symbol and voice for the change we need. In her speech "I'm too young to do this", she addresses the fact that some people think she has over-simplified - she just wants the emissions of greenhouse gases to stop. The question, as Thunberg outlines again and again in her speeches ranging over three years, is can we limit global warming to 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial levels? That, in short, can we stop the tipping point where the chain reaction goes beyond human control? She returns repeatedly to the fact that she is a child, and that it is strange that a child has to speak to the politicians and leaders of the world, pointing out that if people listened to the scientists on the data they would not need to listen to her. She points out that she is not saying anything new but I think in this she does herself a disservice for she is saying something new - something that needed to be heard. Her mantra that we need to reduce our CO2 emissions by at least 50pc before 2030 commands attention. We emit, she points out, 42 gigatonnes of CO2 each year and that in her ledger we had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left in our CO2 budget back in 2018. What strikes one in reading these collected speeches is the fact that the timer, the gauge, gets less and less as the years go in the book. We are emitting carbon dioxide ceaselessly and time is starting to run out. The climate crisis is the great issue of our time. It's true that Thunberg has not been as audible in this time, and yet on reading back now she spoke last year at COP26 . Then, Thunberg said the conference was "business as usual" and "full of blah, blah, blah". Thunberg finishes her book of speeches with a piece from June 2020, a time when I was making my own environmental pilgrimage in my home. She said nature doesn't bargain and she is right. What is needed is action and action now. Those swans on the river are special things, their young are special and if we are to ensure the next generation can see the swans as I now see them, in their world that is not depleted, in their environment full of mayflies and trout, we must all become the messenger. \</doc>

'We need to create fear!" So Al Gore told Hans Rosling, a public health guru, about his strategy for promoting climate action, in 2009. Rosling disagreed. As Rosling recounted in his book, Factfulness: "Fear plus urgency make for stupid, drastic decisions... Climate change is too important for that. It needs systematic analysis, thought-through decisions, incremental actions, and careful evaluation." Rosling similarly disapproved of exaggeration - which "makes people tune out altogether". There was plenty of fear on offer last week, thanks to the COP26 conference in Glasgow and the publication of our own climate action plan: it is seemingly obligatory for news broadcasts to feature montages of wildfires, floods and melting ice caps. And there has been no little exaggeration. COP26 was "literally the last chance saloon", Prince Charles said. "One last chance before disaster?" Le Monde diplomatique asked. The Irish Times said: "Our last chance." But if COP26 was the last chance, what was the Paris conference in 2015 - dubbed the "last chance for action" by the BBC? Or the Copenhagen conference in 2009 - our "last chance", according to a Guardian headline? The Guardian used to run a monthly series called "100 months to save the world". They got to 100 in January 2017. The world is still going; the series isn't. There is a danger in this kind of reporting, as Hans Rosling noted - people tune out. One climate activist I spoke to last week recalled that expectations for 2009's Copenhagen were enormous, with Hillary Clinton - then secretary of state to US president Barack Obama - flying in at the last minute to broker a supposed "deal of the century". The putative deal collapsed, and that sucked all the energy out of the climate action movement for the next few years (the global economic crisis didn't help). Expectations in 2015 were lower, and the deal agreed in Paris "pretty weak" - but it has delivered action. If the media sets up COP26 as our "last chance" and then relishes in judgments of it as a failure - as Greta Thunberg declared it at a rally on Friday - then all we are offering is a counsel of despair. The issue can seem overwhelming. But, in the spirit of Rosling's advice to seek out "systematic analysis", Columbia University historian Adam Tooze broke the problem down into digestible chunks on a recent episode of his podcast, Ones and Tooze. There are five key sectors: electricity generation, transport, industry, housing and agriculture. Each produces between a sixth and a third of global emissions. For electricity generation, we know what the solution is, he summarised: renewables, better storage, perhaps hydrogen fuel, perhaps some nuclear. For transport, the path to decarbonising is similarly clear. For industry, the path is not clear: decarbonising cement, steel and petrochemicals poses huge technical challenges. But these sectors are dominated by giant corporations, which have huge capacity for innovation - and great incentive to solve these problems. For housing, the problem is scale, not technical difficulty: retrofitting individual buildings is not difficult, but getting to them all quickly enough is. For food and agriculture, the key solutions are to massively reduce meat and dairy intake. Ninety per cent of the world's economy and 85pc of its population is now covered by "net zero" pledges, according to the Net Zero Tracker launched recently at Oxford University. In Europe, those pledges are being put into law. We don't have all the answers - far from it. But the path is reasonably clear; and, crucially, it is affordable - particularly because much of the investment will have an economic return. The Government's climate action plan was criticised for its reliance on private investment. There are valid questions to ask: how will people afford electric cars? How will dairy farmers be supported in moving out of dairy? The "just transition" is key. But the left should be wary of reflexive dismissals of reliance on private investment. The next decade is going to see perhaps the greatest reorientation of private investment the world has ever seen. The combination of laws, "nudges", incentives and moral intent will see billions of people and most of the world's large financial players start to spend their money differently. Sectors we currently think of as pillars of the economy are going to be bankrupted; sectors we currently think of as marginal are going to become mainstream. A study in the journal Nature last week found that half of the world's fossil fuel assets would be worthless by 2036 under a net zero transition. A 2019 report by RethinkX, a tech thinktank, estimated the US dairy market will have shrunk by 90pc by 2030, with the US cattle industry "effectively bankrupt". The money in those industries won't disappear: it will go elsewhere, rewarding innovation and driving down emissions. Rather than having to deal with sectors that have been "left behind" a decade from now, we would be better trying to help those sectors transition now. So money isn't the problem; politics is. I wrote last week about the hypocrisy of Irish government policy over the past decade, encouraging an increase in the dairy herd while proclaiming support for climate action. Former government adviser Ed Brophy tweeted in response that increasing the dairy herd was "a textbook policy error which haunts me". I asked him to elaborate. "It was a policy mistake that happened because of its context - a massive economic crash," he said. "Agriculture was the only sector that appeared to offer us a way out of our troubles. But that was just setting up future HYPERLINK http://www.problems.No www.problems.No Irish government has ever spoken honestly with the agricultural sector about what climate change means. We're not good at having public policy conversations about trade-offs in this country." Other countries are not good either, and there are plenty of political opportunists waiting to exploit these tensions. The populist playbook on this is clear: climate policy is designed by "elites" in ignorance of - or in hostility to - the lifestyles and culture of "ordinary people". Ultimately, the populists argue that the costs should be born elsewhere: not by ordinary people; not by sectors that are intrinsic to our way of life; not by our country, but by other, more retrograde countries. But it is not merely inevitable that some of the costs of climate action will fall on ordinary people - it is vital. It is precisely the ordinary people whose habits and choices need to change. Governments need to orient those choices and to cushion those on whom disproportionate costs fall, but not remove those costs altogether. The political threat to climate action will come not just from populists, but also from purists. If climate is the priority, then other issues are not. Winning over China to comprehensive climate action will be difficult while also holding China to account on human rights. With the US Republicans now seemingly a lost cause, American climate action will rely on the Democrats retaining control of Congress and the presidency; that will require compromise on other causes cherished by the left. Climate action may be idealistic but, like all politics, it will require compromises that are unsavoury. It is going to be extraordinarily difficult. But we have not lost our last chance. We have always ahead of us the chance to make things HYPERLINK www.better.No Irish government has ever spoken honestly with the agricultural sector about what climate change means \</doc>

The financial sector has committed (EURO)112tn in striving for net zero emissions by 2050, as Cop26 president Alok Sharma denied claims that the involvement of banks and investment firms would lead to high-level "green-washing". On the third day of the United Nations (UN) climate change summit, which had finance as its theme, Cop26 Mr Sharma had earlier described Cop26 delegates at the Finance Day as the "new Swampys", referring to the British environmentalist who drew widespread international attention in the late 1990s with his high-profile stunts to highlight what he saw as eco-vandalism. Clarifying his comments, Mr Sharma said: "What we have seen over the last number of years is the big move in the private sector and the financial services sector to go green. I re-member when I started in the City (London's financial centre) in the 1990s, clearly climate finance and investing in green was not mainstream. I do believe it is now mainstream. "The point I was making is that there is big momentum from the private sector in pursuing green growth and that is something I think we should all welcome." UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa said there was "no doubt "a need to have a "complete transformation" of economies. "That includes of course the private sector. Yes, of course, we hope there will be some willingness to work closer together in a collaborative way," she added. "It is a fact that we need the private sector to do this deep transformation." Cop26 attendee and EY Ireland's head of sustainability Stephen Prendiville said the (EURO)112tn was a "sobering" figure. "While this is an alarming sum to even comprehend, we now need the largest companies in the world to commit to aligning their wealth to net-zero projects. "We already know that investors are increasingly reassessing risks associated with hard to abate industries, and becoming increasingly discerning of the climate credentials of the investments. This must increase in the near term to drive strategic planning and action in those industries." However, echoing sceptics' fear that it would allow for greenwashing on a mass scale, Mr Prendiville added: "It is important to flag that without appropriate transparency and regulatory oversight, the scope for greenwashing will remain high and likely." The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions, will oversee the (EURO)112trn package. Leaders include former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, while Michael Bloomberg is a co-chair. \</doc>

HOW much warming can the world bear? COP26 , in Glasgow. Six years ago, when countries came together in Paris for the COP21 summit, at which the Paris climate accord was shaped, they committed to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, while the 2015 agreement set 2C as the minimum, it included language that suggested countries should push for a more ambitious goal: 1.5C. A preliminary draft of the COP26 agreement released on Wednesday "reaffirms" the Paris agreement's goal: limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing a target of 1.5C. But it does not commit to meeting the 1.5C threshold. The difference between the two targets may seem small, but they represent divergent outcomes for the planet. Some experts doubt that 1.5C remains achievable. Evidence shows that the two targets also represent different scenarios for the climate's impact on human life. A study released on Tuesday by the UK Met Office, Britain's national weather service, found that one billion people could face heat stress, a potentially fatal combination of heat and humidity, if temperatures rise by 2C. "The higher the level of warming, the more severe and widespread the risks to people's lives, but it is still possible to avoid these higher risks if we act now," said Richard Betts, one of the leaders of the project. The latter had included non-binding language that referenced "the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius". Nearly 200 countries signed onto the agreement in Paris, which was adopted in 2015 and took effect in 2016. Under the accord, countries would set their own emission reduction targets and plans to reach those targets, but agreed to the long-term temperature goal to limit "the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels". Countries would also pursue "efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change," according to the text. The two targets, one firm and one aspirational, represented a fierce policy debate. Developing countries had been pushing to set a rise of 1.5C as a target for years. Small island nations were often the most vocal in their support, pointing to the existential threat they faced. Around the world, many adopted the slogan "1.5 to stay alive". Has there been a movement toward a 1.5C target? The Paris agreement represented a significant shift. More than 100 countries expressed support for a target of 1.5C, including for the first time some major emitters. Notably, the United States got on board, joining a group called the High Ambition Coalition founded by the Marshall Islands in 2014. Scientific pressure played a role in the change. In a paper published during COP21, Nature Geoscience stated that "no scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the 2C target as a safe level of warming, and indeed, this is not a problem that science alone can address". But there remained some scepticism, with oil and gas-producing Saudi Arabia among the countries pushing back on the more ambitious targets. Some officials argued that countries should keep to the less ambitious target so that countries were not set up for failure. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement and promoted the use of fossil fuels. Under President Joe Biden the United States has not only rejoined that agreement but also the group of nations that say that 1.5C should be the standard. What does the science say about the difference between 1.5C and 2C warming? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body responsible for assessing the scientific research on climate change, has warned that even an increase of 1.5C of global warming would result in significant differences, with increased heatwaves and short cold seasons. At 2C, however, the changes will be more profound. "With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger," the IPCC wrote in a report released earlier this year that evaluated more than 14,000 papers. The IPCC has found that an extreme heat event that would have occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5C of warming. It would occur 5.6 times at 2C. Other events such as heavy precipitation or drought would also increase. The IPCC also noted that it was very likely that the relative sea level will continue to rise throughout the 21st century and beyond, and the level it rises will be affected significantly by the level of climate change. If temperatures are confined to an increase of 1.5C, over the next 2,000 years, sea levels could rise by as much as 10 feet. But it could be double that if temperatures grow by 2C, the IPCC research found, and potentially worse if ice sheets in Antarctica become even more destabilised. What are we at now? A Washington Post analysis of multiple data sets has found that Earth has already warmed more than 1C on average over the past century. Some places may already have seen rises of 2C. In their latest report, the IPCC estimated that under the current scenario, the world would be likely to hit the 1.5C threshold by 2040. Under the most optimistic scenario presented in the report, global temperatures would reach 1.5C by the middle of the century and then drop back down as emissions were cut further, potentially averting some of the worst outcomes. But under the worst scenario envisaged by the IPCC, the best estimate was that the world will probably see a rise of 4.4C by the end of the century - with an extremely detrimental impact for life on Earth.

A much bigger push is needed from countries across the globe if the goal of keeping temperature rises to 1.5C is to be achieved, a leading expert has warned. Peter Betts, who for years was the UK and EU lead negotiator in UN climate agreements, said it is "reasonably likely" that sufficient action will be taken to limit global temperatures rises to below 2C. But with the Paris Agreement from 2015 having set out to limit global warming "preferably to 1.5C" compared with pre-industrial levels, he said action from counties such as China and India is critical. \~ Mr Betts was speaking halfway through the Cop26 summit, which is currently taking place in Glasgow. He travelled to Scotland for the huge UN event, but is now isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, although he insisted there have been "relatively few cases" so far. AdvertisementSpeaking about progress made so far, Mr Betts told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show: "This is not going to be the meeting that solves the climate problem in a single bite. "The truth is we have made significant progress on tackling climate change and we will have made more at this meeting, but it is just nothing like enough, so we are going to need to accelerate."

He said that one of the "most important" things for the Cop26 summit is for countries to increase action to reduce emissions by 2030. And while he said some countries had made pledges to do this ahead of the talks starting, others had not. "Who we didn't hear from was China - they didn't significantly tweak their ambition and that is a concern," he said. These increased targets could help "close the gap" towards achieving 1.5C by about 20 per cent to 25 per cent, the expert added, saying this is "significant" but "just not enough". Cop26 has also seen commitments made to reduce deforestation, decrease methane production and move away from burning coal. AdvertisementMr Betts said: "If you aggregate all of that stuff together... maybe we might be on track for something like 2C. "But the big proviso is countries need to implement what they have signed up to. That is where we need to focus, real pressure to make countries deliver what they have said they are going to do." \~ He continued: "The decisions that are most important will be the decisions that are made in Beijing, in Delhi, in the capitals of South East Asia, so we have to find arguments that resonate with them. "We are not going to solve the problem without their taking significant action. That is not to put the blame on them, that is just the reality of the arithmetic of where the tonnes are coming from." The adviser said there is "growing momentum" for tackling climate change, adding: "When you look at the targets in the developed world they imply very, very stringent policy over the coming years. "I think it is reasonably likely we can get below 2C if we maintain the momentum - 1.5C is much harder, and we're going to need a much bigger push to get there." \</doc>

INFRASTRUCTURE Minister Nichola Mallon has said she is open to the idea of introducing congestion charges in Northern Ireland's cities in a bid to cut emissions and move people away from private vehicles. Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph from the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, the deputy SDLP leader also said her party is hoping to progress a bill through Westminster that would include 'green taxes' for large businesses in order to fund initiatives needed to meet environmental targets. Congestion charges are fees paid by drivers allowing them to drive in areas that experience heavy traffic volumes, typically city centres. Questioned about the possibility of introducing such charges here, the minister said: "In June I published my Time for Change document, setting out a hierarchy of transport and travel, with walking and cycling at the top, sustainable public transport, and with private car use towards the bottom. In my view, we need to make people travel less. "A lot of people are making unnecessary journeys in the first place and, as a result of Covid, hybrid working will help with that. We also need to ensure we have safe infrastructure in place for people who want to cycle and I've introduced the \£320m blue/ green fund, which is about promoting active travel and greenways. "But I think we are going to have to look at incentivising people out of their cars and I am mindful that, in other places, they are looking at issues like parking charges and congestion charges. That would be an issue that would have to be brought to the Executive, but certainly I am open to considering a range of things. We're in the middle of a climate crisis and we need to be bold in our thinking." On Wednesday, Ms Mallon signed the Glasgow Declaration, on behalf of the Executive. The declaration involves signatories agreeing that they will work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero-emission vehicles by no later than 2035. With such initiatives requiring investment if they are to be achievable, Ms Mallon said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is bring- ing forward a private member's bill at Westminster that includes measures to help this. The Infrastructure Minister was also asked what she will take away from her time at the conference. "I was at an event yesterday where the Scottish Transport Minister Graeme Dey was saying that sometimes people think that because some places are small, they can't contribute a lot to climate action, but actually they can," she said. "In Northern Ireland we have opportunities that don't present themselves in other places, such as our publicly-owned public transport network and water provider. There are huge synergies there in terms of renewable energy and zero emissions. "We also have Wrightbus, for example, a local company building cutting-edge buses with zero emissions. It's about finding that win for the environment and a win for the economy." 'A key component of the bill is looking to the big companies, the big polluters' \</doc>

Leaders at the G20 have agreed on carbon neutrality "by or around mid-century" as the conference came to a close just ahead of the UN's Cop26 summit. Politicians attending the event in Rome also pledged to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad. But they set no target for phasing out domestic coal. Their agreements came on the eve of Cop26 in Glasgow, which Boris Johnson has described as a\~"moment of truth" for humanity. Crunch climate change talks are due to begin in the Scottish city on Monday. Mr Johnson spent the weekend pushing the message that the developed countries needed to move further and faster in order to succeed in meeting the goal set out in the Paris climate accords of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C.

The Government's climate action plan contains a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the agriculture sector by between 22pc and 30pc - but the national livestock herd will not be cut, the Sunday Independent has learned. The disclosure comes as leading climate scientist Tara Shine, who was appointed by the United Nations to work towards global climate goals, warns that Ireland must stop "demonising" farmers in the drive to reduce carbon emissions. Yesterday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said farmers will be given longer to adjust to climate changes. "All sectors must play their part, but some can go faster than others. Agriculture will take longer," Mr Ryan told the Sunday Independent. However, confirmation today that agriculture emissions are to be reduced by up to 30pc will anger farmers. The Irish Farmers' Association has warned that many farms would not remain viable if agriculture had to reduce emissions by that level. Its president, Tim Cullinan, has said such a move would have "profound implications for the rural economy". Separately, the Sunday Independent has learned the Government's Climate Action Plan, still being finalised and to be published soon, contains a range of measures related to transport. There will be measures to phase out the public fleet of fossil fuel vehicles, as well as schemes to incentivise sustainable trucks, buses and vans. Around (EURO)360m will be announced for new walk and cycle ways nationally. A centrepiece of the plan is said to be "major investment" in offshore wind energy in Dublin Bay and along the east coast, according to political sources. However, much focus will remain on the agriculture sector. The Climate Action Plan will contain wide-ranging incentives for farmers aimed at achieving an overall national emissions reduction of 51pc by 2030. Across the EU agriculture accounts for 11pc of all emissions but in Ireland accounts for more than 32pc of total emissions, according to a recent study. This has led to considerable focus on the national dairy and beef herd, with speculation that the climate action plan could lead to a livestock cull. In recent weeks, government figures have referred to the intention to Continued on page 3 Continued from page 1 "stabilise" the national herd. The Sunday Independent understands that the plan does not refer to a herd cull but will recommend a significant reduction in agriculture greenhouse gasses of 22pc to 30pc. This is in line with a recommendation contained in the carbon budget technical report published last week by the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC). Speaking to the Sunday Independent ahead of her attendance at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Irish climate expert Dr Tara Shine said the high level of agriculture emissions was a direct result of "completely contradictory" Government policy and "incentives from Europe" over the past decade. Yesterday she said it was no surprise that farmers felt "victimised." The Government was telling farmers to "produce more, that Ireland is going to be the biggest exporter of food in the world, but at the same time we have to cut emissions". She said the time had come for leaders to "start a conversation" with farmers about how they can get value from their land through alternative sources to livestock. But farmers' livelihoods "must be protected as part of the transition", she said. "That's absolutely critical. They have to be part of shaping the policy response and their livelihoods have to be protected as they make a change, otherwise this is unjust," Dr Shine said. "If farmers are the villains then we are all the villains because we eat the food, we use energy, we drive cars, we go on holidays. "We are all the villains. That is the problem with climate change. There is no one evil force. The evil force is us. Human beings. We caused climate change. But we can also find the answers." Her comments come days after IFA President Cullinan said carbon budgets will have serious repercussions for farming. He was speaking after the CCAC submitted proposed carbon budgets to Government, which will see the country cut its carbon emissions by 51pc by 2030. Mr Cullinan said the most productive farmers could not remain viable if agriculture had to reduce emissions by up to 30pc. He warned it will have "profound implications for the rural economy." Yesterday he said he would not rule out further protests in the coming weeks. "Farmers are genuinely fearful about their futures," he said. "The Government is doing a lot of talking, but rhetoric is all we have seen." "But "we don't have a 'national herd'. We have 100,000 farmers in all parts of the country with an average of 70 cattle. These farmers feel like they are being unfairly targeted." Meanwhile climate instability elsewhere could be a "danger" to Ireland if we are seen as a lifeboat country by those fleeing uninhabitable zones, the Green leader warned. Miche\'e1l Martin will make Ireland's national statement at COP26 , with Minister for the Environment and Climate Mr Ryan looking over his shoulder. "If we are to leave a habitable planet to future generations we must act now," the Taoiseach said. "The challenge is big, but I have faith in the capacity of humans to work together to overcome it. "Science is leading the way. Leaders must put the right policies in place, as we are doing in Ireland." Mr Ryan will be attending as leader of Ireland's negotiation delegation in the second week of COP26 , when the wrangling over efforts to find a containment of global carbon emissions will really begin. "We've seen the footage of flooding in Germany, the extraordinary heat in the Pacific Northwest and the ice melt in the Arctic," Mr Ryan told the Sunday Independent on the eve of today's conference in Glasgow. "The dangers for Ireland aren't just the impacts of more storms and flooding - we would also be affected by global insecurity caused by events elsewhere. \</doc>

This weekend, world leaders start a series of intensive meetings - first in Rome, then in Glasgow - to try and limit man-made climate change. The main event is known as COP26 , the latest in a series of United Nations meetings which is being held to co-ordinate action against climate change. But what are they trying to agree on? Stopping the planet overheating by stopping so-called greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. It is easy to say - but really difficult to achieve in practice, because of the upheaval in the lives of so many that it entails. Not to mention the cost. But failure is not an option. Our planet is heating up - and we are heading for catastrophe if we don't stop it. Climate change is causing severe weather events, changing habitats, killing off animals and plants, causing environmental degradation and mass migration, as humans leave regions uninhabitable. The big driver of climate change has been human activity - particularly burning fossil fuels for energy. The pollution from all that burning puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which causes the temperature to rise. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate news Our challenge is to stop the bad stuff happening without destroying our economies and undermining human progress. It is a monster political headache - but the United Nations has been co-ordinating governments around the world to take action to stop climate change and the environmental damage it is causing. Through a series of UN conferences of the parties - COPs for short - governments have agreed action plans, notably in Kyoto and Paris, to try and limit global warming. This stuff is so difficult that without the public pressure of a massively-hyped conference like the COP, it probably would not get done. In political terms, the governments of the world all hold hands and jump together. Top-level targets The whole process is managed by a couple of top-level targets: a temperature change target, a "net zero" target, and constantly updated national action plans to hit those targets. Six years ago in Paris, at COP21, the Governments agreed a binding treaty to keep global warming below 2C, and, ideally, at 1.5C by the end of this century. To meet the temperature target, governments made a series of national climate change plans, to cut back on carbon pollution. But when those plans were added up by the UN, they found they would produce a global temperature rise of 2.7C - far from the 1.5C target. So now they have to come back and make a plan to do more - and that's the point of this meeting in Glasgow. The scientific consensus is that a really steep cut in carbon emissions is needed over the remaining years of this decade to keep the 1.5C target alive. Hitting the temperature target by the end of the century effectively means no new emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of the century - an objective known as net zero. Any slippage means more pollution in the short term, making it harder to catch up later on. UN scientists say a bigger effort this decade will make it easier to hit the target over the long run. How big of an effort? Well last year's Covid lockdowns around the world caused carbon dioxide emissions to fall by just over 5%. However, it has bounced back up again, in line with the economic rebound in the developed world. But staying on track for 1.5C needs a 50% cut by the end of the decade. The most difficult of political challenges The challenge is to cut carbon emissions way more than last year's lockdown achieved, but still keep the economy working, so we all enjoy the benefits of modern life. It might just be doable. On her way to the G20 summit, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said: "we have already reduced our emissions by more than 31% compared to 1990, while growing our economy by 60%. "And I think that this is an encouraging message that shows that you can cut emissions and prosper; you can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, you can produce in a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable way, while growing your economy." Still, it is without question the most difficult of political challenges, entailing sweeping changes in the way we live, work and interact with nature. The political tool of choice to drive this change is another top-level target - the reduction in CO2, measured in gigatonnes (billion tonnes) per annum. So, a key number that is worth keeping in mind to measure progress at this COP is 25. Based on the latest set of announcements from governments, the world will pump 50 billion tonnes of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere in 2030. To stay on track for a temperature rise of no more than 2C, that figure should be around 39 billion tonnes - that's a cut of eleven billion tonnes. But, to be on track to hit the 1.5C target, carbon emissions at the end of this decade should be around 25 billion tonnes. That is a 25 billion tonne cut. And that is the 25 to keep an eye on - how close to 25 billion tonnes in 2030 can the governments get in their meetings at COP 26. If that is the case, an agreement that cuts less than 11 billion tonnes from the 2030 level looks like failure. There are few who expect this COP to hit the full 25 billion tonne target. Obviously the closer to 25, the better. But the parties will have to come back at it again. Under the usual COP pattern, that would mean another big target setting conference in five years' time-possibly four years' time, to get back on the old timetable - the one knocked back a year by Covid. But that would only leave one chance to revise plans before 2030 - not ideal if you are trying to achieve cuts of the scale the scientists are seeking. That is why another outcome worth watching is any changes to the review timetable. Whilst an annual review is unlikely - and could even be counterproductive, weakening political drive and interest- review conferences every two or three years would give more chances to change the targets, moving ever closer to the magic number of 25. As political circumstances, technology and the climate itself changes, so does the possibility of additional agreements becoming feasible - even if some things cannot be agreed at this COP. So be careful of a failure narrative - not getting the whole 25 at this COP is not the end of the earth. Literally. The point of this meeting now is to take another big, decisive step forward in driving what is the biggest shared project in the history of humanity - saving our own planet from ourselves, for ourselves. \</doc>

We have left it late. But it is not yet too late. In the first of those truths lies the justification for fear. In the second lies the possibility of hope. The Cop26 summit on climate change crystallises a moment when the fate of humanity hovers between these realities. It is all too easy to be overwhelmed by terror and despair. The first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published in 1990. It laid out very clearly the catastrophic consequences of continuing to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Yet global greenhouse gas emissions are on course to be 16 per cent higher by the end of this decade compared to 2010. Thirty years of failure to heed the warnings raises grim questions. Are our political systems so corrupted and dominated by those who have vested interests in the carbon economy that they cannot act in the collective interest? Are our imaginations so limited that we have to see apocalyptic fires and biblical floods before we truly believe what is happening? There has been an abundance of sheer malignity: Donald Trump's assaults on science and truth; Jair Bolsonaro's savaging of the Amazon rainforest; Rupert Murdoch's systematic support for climate denialism. There has been the more subtle propaganda of the big carbon producers, the false reassurance of greenwashing. And there is the gravitational pull of mere inertia, the million immediacies that obscure the wider canvas of existential necessity. These forces have driven us very close to the edge. The last decade has been the hottest on earth for 125,000 years. It is now, according to the IPCC, a virtual certainty that the world will experience within the next two decades 1.5 degrees of heating over pre-industrial levels. Some of the forces we have set in motion, like rising sea levels and the retreat of glaciers, will not be reversed for centuries to come. We are living in the future we were warned against. There is little doubt that in 2031 we will be looking back on this year's weather-related disasters with a degree of nostalgia. Yet despair is both disabling and unwarranted. Those gathering in Glasgow must not allow themselves to succumb to the two most wistful words in the language: if only. It is sadly true that they can look back over the last 30 years and sigh that if only their governments had acted sooner, humanity would not be at this moment of crisis. But that realisation must galvanise their determination that their successors will not look back in 30 years' time and utter those same words with a much deeper sense of anguish. Seeing the damage as clearly as they do now, they must act to limit it. They must commit themselves - not on paper but in reality - to cuts of at least 50 per cent in carbon emissions over the rest of this decade and their complete elimination by 2050. They have the power to do so: rapid, co-ordinated and transformational action can ensure that heating is kept to 1.5 degrees by the end of this century. The technologies needed for this transformation are already well developed. The science is increasingly difficult even for the worst deceivers to deny. Above all, people the world over now understand that the price of passivity is infinitely higher than the cost of change. Cop26 is not a chance for global leaders to make history. It is much bigger than that. It is their one-off opportunity to reshape humanity's relationship to the natural world. The idea that our species can and should dominate and exploit nature has driven the progress of civilisation. It has now reached its end point: the realisation that if we treat the world as material to be burned we ourselves will be consumed in that fire. In this end must be a beginning. This conference can be the start of a new epoch of interdependence, one in which we finally accept that no country can prosper without the others and that no species - even one as arrogant as ours - can afford to be careless of the fate of all the others. James Connolly, in a very different context, wrote that "our demands most moderate are, /We only want the earth." That is all that humanity demands now of those who hold its fate in their hands. \</doc>

Glasgow might not be looking its best during the fortnight- long negotiations with rubbish piled up on streets due to an ongoing strike by refuse collectors but the welcome is consistently friendly from the hosts. Scotland's own environmental credentials cannot be questioned; it is a climate leader planning to reduce emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 and already uses remarkable levels of renewable energy to drive its economy. Cop26 , with 25,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries, is a chaotic affair, with interminable queues and where everyone must produce a negative antigen test before they are allowed to gain access to venues. Inside, as chairwoman of the Elders, Mary Robinson, noted, it has a feel of being "too white and elite" - and sanitised, with climate activists kept well away, observed by hundreds of police officers across the city. The collective mood is one of worry about the future of the planet, but there is, too, a surprising degree of modest hope that has built up over the week. The clear instructions of two 90 year olds, it seems, set the right tone. In a video message, Queen Elizabeth, confined to staying at home by doctors' orders, told 120 global leaders in town for Monday and Tuesday to "rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship". So what's on the table so far? Leaders came with a raft of new pledges including newly forged alliances on methane, deforestation and coal. Big business was talking of a just transition; a notable first. The British wanted to "consign coal to history". A cobbled-together deal was endorsed by 40 countries but with less demanding timelines. However, it showed how mega-emitters can revert to type despite committing to net-zero emissions since Australia, the US, India and China refused to sign up. UN climate envoy Mark Carney announced a pact between 450 banks, investors and insurers, making available $130 trillion (EUR 112.5 trillion) to pursue net zero. A staggering amount which, if delivered, would mark a radical shift in global capitalism. With the UK as Cop26 host, how is Johnson playing it? Prime minister Boris Johnson has not been his usual ebullient, over-promising self. Indeed, he was uncharacteristically sombre after last weekend's G20 summit. So far, the British have held to a "cautiously optimistic" line, but no more. Has the US re-joining the Paris agreement fold made a difference? US president Joe Biden put down a marker that the US will stay the course for decades to come, while pointing the finger of blame at China and Russia for not turning up. Failure to get his domestic climate package across the line meant, however, it has not been a triumphant outing. Most significantly, the US rejoined the "high ambition coalition", the group of developed and developing countries with its chief goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees - the most demanding Paris target. Is it, as billed, 'the most inclusive Cop ever'? Cop26 is not hearing enough of civic society voices, says DCU climate policy specialist Prof Diarmuid Torney, and not all of that can be blamed on security concerns: "The voices of vulnerable and marginalised communities need to be heard louder." What's happening in negotiation rooms? The British believe that a "can-do attitude" shown by leaders has percolated down to the negotiators handling the detail of the tortuous talks - a surprise given the way Cop26 was shaping up beforehand. Will it turn the dial? The bottom line is: are the promises to force emissions and temperature dials downwards and to keep 1.5 alive enough? Before Cop26 started, the betting was against, since national pledges, even if met, would see the planet warm by 2.7 degrees. During Cop26 Cop26 This is a "a significant win", says energy specialist Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir of MaREI in UCC. \</doc>

This year's UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, marks the 26th time since 1995 that world leaders have gathered to confront global warming. But the realisation that industrial activity was causing climate change, and discussions about what to do about it, began much earlier. Here are some key moments in the global climate conversation: 1800s Throughout the 1800s, several European scientists study how different gases and vapours can trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. In the 1890s, HYPERLINK https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius 1938 By compiling historical weather data, British engineer Guy Callendar for the first time shows the planet's HYPERLINK https://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/qjcallender38.pdf temperatures are rising 1958 AdvertisementAmerican scientist Charles David Keeling starts systematically measuring atmospheric CO2 levels over Hawaii's Mauna Loa Observatory. His findings result in the "Keeling Curve," a graph showing CO2 concentrations steadily increasing. 1988 James Hansen, an American climate scientist, HYPERLINK https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/june_23_1988_senate_hearing_1.pdf testifies before the US Congress 1990 At the UN's so-called Second World Climate Conference, scientists highlight the risks of global warming to nature and society. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher says binding emissions targets are needed. 1992 Countries sign onto the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit. The UNFCCC's goal is to control emissions to prevent extreme climate change, but it also enshrines the idea of "common but differentiated responsibilities," meaning developed countries must do more because they are responsible for most historical emissions. The treaty does not set out binding emissions targets. 1995 UNFCCC treaty members gather for a first "conference of parties," or Cop, in Berlin. The final document calls for legally binding emissions targets. 1997 At Cop3 in Kyoto, Japan, parties agree to the first treaty that requires specific emissions reductions. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are obligated to reduce emissions between 2008 and 2012 from 1990 levels, with different limits assigned to different countries. In the United States, key Senate Republicans denounce the accord as "dead on arrival."

Insulated initially from the protests and visceral anger pervading the chilly Glasgow air this week, Cop26 delegates got their first sense yesterday morning that all is not well among the environmental warriors on the ground. Thousands of delegates - some 25,000 will attend the Glasgow event overall - queued impatiently on Monday and Tuesday for hours on end, herded together with social distancing nowhere in sight and a single-line entrance to alleviate the bottleneck. It was the most middle-class of annoyance, as civil servants, academics, business executives, and media figures moaned at the terrible logistics laid on at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC), oblivious to the real and growing anger that is fermenting throughout the city among footsoldiers of the environmental cause. The long-time environmental activists protesting with banners and voices couldn't even get past the initial turnstiles into the outside grounds of the SEC. True environmental warriors may have been persona non grata at the SEC, as style triumphed over substance while world leaders were in the building - but legacy energy companies had no such problems. Far from being locked out of proceedings, advertising hoardings and stalls from fossil fuel giants were unmissable as attendees meandered their way through the sprawling campus. Born in 2005, Earth Uprising founder Alexandria Villase\'f1or has become a powerful voice in the climate crisis, along with Greta Thunberg, Vanessa Nakate, and other young champions of action. Ms Villase\'f1or could barely hide her disgust from inside the SEC. "First, it's true, there's one entrance for 20k attendees, it's like a single file line for everyone to get in and get through security. I've spent 4 hours in line over the past 2 days. It's chaos and a failure on the part of the organizers... Inside, it gets even weirder, with civil society literally locked out of negotiation spaces, with no video link or any other way to effectively observe at all," she tweeted. She pointed to the farcical sponsorship of Australia's Cop26 stand by oil and gas producer Santos, among other anomalies that should have no place at a major summit aimed at fundamentally altering the current disastrous climate emergency. While people of colour and indigenous people of the world protested with righteous anger outside the security barriers at the disproportionate impacts of fossil-fuel emissions on their communities, members of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) were having a grand time, whisked through barriers to attend their meetings at Cop26 . Cop26 president Alok Sharma, who resigned from his business secretary position in Boris Johnson's Tory government in order to concentrate on the Glasgow event, was stumped when reporter Caroline O'Doherty asked for a breakdown of fossil fuel firm delegates at the two-week event. He'd have to get back to her on that, he said, while insisting everything about the event was "pretty transparent". Yes, it is pretty transparent. As the world burns, fossil fuel and legacy industries with high emissions will continue to be the loudest voices in the room, unless a radical shift comes out of Cop26 . \</doc>

IT ALMOST didn't happen. Last Friday's heavy rain and floods in northern England threatened to cancel my slow travel plans to attend the beginning of the United Nations Climate Conference, COP26 . Thankfully, a pocket of clear weather on Saturday allowed me to travel from Brussels to Glasgow on the Rail to the COP train, an initiative sponsored by Youth for Sustainable Travel, a European non-profit organisation. The first part of my climate train journey kicked off in the morning from Brussels South Station, a short stroll from my apartment. It is a well-trodden journey for me, as I take the slow travel option by rail and ferry for a third of my travelling between Dublin and Brussels. The gas emissions saved by travelling this way are tremendous: train and ferry generates one tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions of an airline flight. The trip also gives me time to think, avoid the crowded security queues in airports and, in this instance, enjoy great conversations with climate activists, campaigners and negotiators. Our train pulled out of the station and was quickly travelling at 300kmh toward the Channel Tunnel. Several of the carriages featured climate-themed discussions. I got chatting to Jacques Damas, CEO of Eurostar. They have exciting routes in the works, but, like many businesses, have experienced tough trading conditions due to the pandemic. I also spoke with European Commission officials who are working to invest in train line improvements, as well as to simplify the red tape of European rail travel. Our conversations prompted me to think about the travel options from Ireland to England. With planning, a SailRail ticket from anywhere in Ireland to anywhere in the UK can be bought for less than (EURO)90. Why, then, can Ryanair offer last-minute (EURO)5 flights? Easy - they do not pay tax on their aviation fuel. Meanwhile, train companies must pay tax on the electricity or fuel they use. Fairer fares are needed. As we approached the Eurotunnel, I was invited into the driver's cab for the journey through the 50km-long tunnel. At lunchtime, we pulled into St Pancras Station and were met by a brass band as well as UK Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Hands. I caught up with Labour MP Emily Thornberry and chatted to Zamzam Ibrahim, a student union leader who I had last met just before lockdown in March last year. Our Climate Train group then walked from St Pancras to Euston Station. The Climate Train organisers took us along the 1km Wellness Walk, launched in 2015, which avoids the elevated levels of traffic and pollution on the Euston Road. As we boarded the train from London to Glasgow, I exchanged glances with a small familiar figure also stepping on board. It was Greta Thunberg. "Ain't she something," said the ticket-checker beside me. I nodded in agreement. Greta is a climate leader who has done more to raise our collective awareness of the climate crisis than any politician. As the evening sun was falling, with the hills of the Lake District flashing past our train window, a young Hungarian environmentalist described to me how her Budapest university was effectively shut down by prime minister Viktor Orban. As the impact of the climate crisis on human lives and livelihoods crystallises, many nations are predicted to flirt with electing right-wing leaders like Orban. America has done it already. In the early evening, our train rumbled over the River Clyde and pulled into our final destination. Ahead of us lay two weeks of negotiating, lobbying and haggling over decisions that will have real-world impact on possibilities for ourselves, for Greta Thunberg and for other young people of her generation. \</doc>

Greta Thunberg has joked she is going "net zero on swear words" after a video emerged of her joining in with a rude chant outside Cop26 . Footage published on Monday showed the 18-year-old speaking to young protesters in Festival Park in Govan, across the River Clyde from the Cop26 venue. She said: "Change is not going to come from inside there - that is not leadership, this is leadership. "We say no more blah blah blah, no more exploitation of people and nature and the planet. No more exploitation. No more blah blah blah. No more whatever the f they are doing inside there." AdvertisementLater on, she was filmed singing: "You can shove your climate crisis up your arse". The teenager has since joked she is now going to continue "net zero" on her language. "In the event that I should say something inappropriate I pledge to compensate that by saying something nice." In September, she mocked British prime minister Boris Johnson by quoting parts of his speeches on climate change and adding "blah, blah, blah". During her time outside the summit this week, Ms Thunberg has accused politicians of not taking the climate crisis seriously. \</doc>

AS £ code red' for humanity has been declared, momentum and demand is building for politicians to act to save our natural world. Ruairi Brogan is a climate campaigner with UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC) and works as a policy officer at RSPB NI. He is attending COP28 in Glasgow and shares how we can all make a difference to our environment. How important is an event like COP26 ? COP28 is huge. It is going to push governments from every corner of the planet to really do more to tackle climate change. The heat is on, particularly here in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK and Ireland without climate legislation. Do we appreciate our environment? What, if anything, gives you hope for the future? I think we do. COVID made a lot of people, like myself, get stuck back into nature. From birdwatching, to close encounters with seals up the North Coast! But a lot of people are unaware of how much their actions impact the climate and natural world. Like how Northern Ireland is the 12th worst country in the world for biodiversity loss and the 13th worst for carbon emissions per person. I hope for a world teeming with wildlife where my children won't have to worry about the land failing to produce any food. We still have a mountain to climb but the momentum coming from youth movements fills me with excitement and hope as well as working with organisations like RSPB and UKYCC. Future leaders like that won't let this continue. What do you hope comes from COP26 ? The momentum building around COP is inspiring me and will hopefully lead to more people having many great conversations, just like this one, as well as taking action, whether it's making changes at home or attending the Global Day of Action Rally on November 8. But this is only part of the story. Governments must match their words with action, stop committing to new fossil fuel projects and invest in ambitious green recovery plans. Can you give us some information about your role within UKYCC? I am an organiser in the Systems Change Group at UK Youth Climate Coalition. That means I work to change how we operate within our current economic system, which is based on perpetual growth at all costs. In fact, most of our environmental problems and social injustices come from unsustainable growth, and it has to stop. We raise money to get young people from the Global South to COP and call out the hypocrisy of governments and businesses as they try everything to continue making money during these emergencies. What is the one thing we can all do is effect lasting change? Use your voice and your vote! With the NI Assembly elections coming up next year, it's time to start thinking about who best represents a strong positive change for nature and climate action. How can we encourage those who seem less than interested in being more involved in climate change? Absolutely everyone can do something to help revive our world. Climate actions can simply be making small changes to your day that will benefit the planet. Things like eating less but better meat or committing to only using peat-free compost for your garden can reduce your carbon emissions and conserve our countryside. There are a growing number of green jobs out there for young people which can really make a difference. I have started a new role as policy officer for RSPB NI and it's absolutely brilliant getting to work doing what I love - saving nature and the tackling climate change.

Thousands of young activists have marched through the streets of Glasgow to demand action on climate change from politicians at Cop26 . Participants marched from Kelvingrove Park to George Squarge, passing the Cop26 venue at the SEC on the way. Campaigner Greta Thunberg was among the protesters on the march, and is due to speak to crowds in George Square alongside fellow activist Vanessa Nakate, other young campaigners, and trade unionists. It comes as the Cop26 talks feature events highlighting the voice of young people and education in climate action. At least 8,000 people were expected to take part in the march. But in London, Downing Street said young people missing school to attend the demonstration was "extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning". AdvertisementA spokesman for the British prime minister said: "We do understand why young people feel so strongly about climate change, and we want to see them use that passion and turn it into action. "That's exactly why we're empowering them through our new virtual national education park, climate leaders awards, and giving teachers the tools to put climate change at the heart of the curriculum, and we're backing this up with our continued pledge to cut the carbon footprint of school buildings as well."

THE last seven years have been the hottest on record - with sea levels rising to new highs and climate-related destructive weather extremes in 2021, UN experts have said. In its annual state of the global climate report launched as the UN COP26 summit got under way, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said that 2021 is likely to have been the fifth to seventh hottest year on record. While it is not quite as hot as some recent years, due to a 'La Nina' weather phenomenon in the Pacific - which has a cooling effect on global temperatures - it still averaged 1.09C above preindustrial levels, the WMO said. The last seven years since 2015, when countries secured the Paris Agreement to curb temperature rises to 1.5C or well below 2C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, have been the hottest in records dating back to 1850. And the UK's Met Office warned the world's temperature has reached an average exceeding 1C above pre-industrial levels for the past two decades, the first time a 20-year period has been at that level since the records began. The average global temperature for 2002-2021 was 1.01C above pre-industrial levels, the scientists said. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called for the COP26 talks, where leaders are under pressure to keep the 1.5C temperature limit within reach with more action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, to be a "turning point for people and planet". Communities and natural systems around the world were being devastated, he warned, as he urged leaders to act. "The door is open; the solutions are there. COP26 must be a turning point. We must act now - with ambition and solidarity - to safeguard our future and save humanity," he said. And WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said extreme events "are the new normal", with mounting evidence that some bear the footprint of human-induced climate change. At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, temperatures by the end of the century would be far in excess of the Paris goals, he said. " COP26 COP26 will be essential to protect all of us and the planet." Among the findings in the WMO assessment are that temperatures from January to September 2021 were around 1.09C above the 1850-1900 period, with a moderate La Nina reducing temperatures early in the year, but with temperatures rising as the La Nina faded. The last seven years, 2015-2021, are on track to be the hottest seven years on record. Sea level rise has increased from an average of 2.1mm a year between 1993-2000 to 4.4mm a year between 2013-2021, mostly due to a speed up in the loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets. And Arctic sea ice cover was below the average for 1981-2010, while Antarctic sea ice was close to the average. \</doc>

Voices of young people continue to be excluded from United Nations climate summits when they should be heard in negotiation rooms, according to Valery Molay of the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI). While everyone knew there would be logistical difficulties at Cop26 due to coronavirus, she believed it was "an excuse to exclude civil society, young people [and] the voices of marginalised people". On that basis, Cop26 was lacking something, said the NYCI climate justice officer who is among a large group of young Irish climate activists in Glasgow. "It's the 26th Cop so at some point you have to ask yourself the question, £re we going to keep on coming and talking about this all the time?' " she asked. It had been established that global warming was a systemic problem. But when young activists came Cop26 Personally, she found it upsetting that the EU bloc in talking about "loss and damage", and increasing adaptation targets, was doing so within a framework of charity. She added: "Is it charity or reparation that we are talking out?" To solve the climate crisis was not just about cutting greenhouse gases, she said. "It must be while changing the system that created the problem in the first place." The Irish activists had an hour-long meeting with Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan in Glasgow, where she said the exclusion issue was highlighted. Ms Molay said it was emotional for her hearing from people at the meeting talking about themselves and how overwhelming the climate issue was, as indicated by one person saying, "I started this at 13, now I'm going to college, I can't continue doing this". \</doc>

WELL over two thousand people have signed petitions both in favour and in opposition to the renewed plans for the long-mooted \€ 650 million liquid natural gas facility on the Ballylongford Landbank - as the battle lines take shape in what is already proving one of the nation's hottest flashpoints in the climate debate. The petitions, along with numerous submissions on the plan, were posted and hand delivered to An Bord Plean\'e1la by the close of deadline for observations on the fresh LNG plans currently before it. It is to decide on the planning by March 7 next. On the one side is ranged a host of environmental groups opposed to the plant tying the country into continued reliance on fossil fuels; and what they fear is its potential to use gas obtained through the controversial 'fracking' method in the US. On the other side is a host of voices supporting Shannon LNG's plan for the landbank for its potential to boost a flagging local economy and\~secure a supply of gas for Ireland not reliant on the Scottish interconnectors. Increasingly, many economic commentators\~are coming around to what local supporters have been warning for sometime: That without the\~power plant the plan also contains Ireland is facing years of intermittment power outages. North Kerry is where the climate/power debate is now focusing most keenly. Locals are acutely aware of the ageing nature of the old ESB infrastructure at the 530MW Tarbert Island station, closed again this week due to technical problems in what\~led\~to yet another amber alert. The LNG power plant would reset the country's energy supply at a time when the older systems are struggling to meet demand\~when the wind dips, supporters of it say. Environmentalists are meanwhile pinning their hopes to the massive plans for offshore wind power in the Irish Sea and the Kerry/Clare coasts; aghast at the continued\~fossil fuel plans. Hundreds of local signed petitions in recent weeks flagging their support for a plan they hope will revitalise the moribund economy of the region -\~considered among the most disadvantaged in Kerry. Tarbert Development Association sent a petition to ABP containing over 850 signatures -\~chiefly from local people -\~supporting the LNG plan. Safety Before LNG group opposed to the project meanwhile presented a petition comprised of over 1,500 signatures to ABP by Friday -\~76 of which were Irish politicians, from other constituencies than Kerry.The majority of signatories to this petition are from right across the world and around the country, in some indication of the interest it has generated far beyond Kerry. Green Party members in Kerry, Limerick and Clare meanwhile also wrote to ABP by the deadline urging it to refuse permission. They informed ABP they were chiefly worried about the impact the plan would have on the rising hopes of transforming the whole estuary into a massive hub for landing offshore power. Chairperson of the Green Party in Kerry Anluan Dunne said: "This project will not serve the people of North Kerry, nor the people of Ireland. The facility would have a short lifespan and would undermine the development of long-term sustainable jobs in North Kerry. With COP26 now underway we need to capitalise on the momentum to do better, faster which is what communities along the Shannon Estuary deserve. We want a swift decision, rejecting this application to put unnecessary this proposal to bed once and for all." On behalf of the Limerick Greens, Brian Leddin TD said: "The proposed development is against clearly-stated government policy and would lock Ireland into a highly polluting source of fuel. Over the next two weeks the International Conference of Parties will meet in Glasgow to discuss our global ambition to maintain temperatures on earth at a level where it is safe for human civilisation. The proposed Energy Park in Shannon does not align with this urgent global ambition." But for many, the 'cleaner' fossil fuel of gas represents the best chance Ireland has of transitioning to carbon neutrality without compromising the economy irreparably. Tarbert Development Association spokesperson John Fox said that a petition the group ran in recent weeks showed that the people of North Kerry continue to support the plan in great numbers. "We were very pleasantly surprised with the level of support out there from local people, the people of North Kerry and from people closely connected to North Kerry," Mr Fox told The Kerryman. Aside from the online petition which garnered 850 plus signatures, the TDA also collected signatures -\~on an ad hoc basis -\~locally, again meeting what they said was widespread support. "The very clear message we got was that the people of North Kerry are in favour of this. End of story," Mr Fox added.\~ \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has said he is unable to guarantee Ireland will avoid the return of Covid-19 restrictions. Mr Martin, speaking from the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, acknowledged the rise in cases is a concern.

Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow starting on Sunday may be the world's last chance to cap global warming at the 1.5-2 degrees Celsius upper limit set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The stakes for the planet are huge - among them the impact on economic livelihoods the world over and the future stability of the global financial system. Here are 10 climate change-related questions that economic policy-makers are trying to answer: 1. How much does climate change cost? From floods and fires to conflict and migration: economic models struggle with the many possible knock-on effects from global warming. The ballpark IMF estimate is that unchecked warming would shave 7 per cent off world output by 2100. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NFGS) group of world central banks puts it even higher - 13 per cent. In a Reuters poll of economists, the median figure for the output loss in that scenario was 18 per cent. Advertisement 2. Where is the impact going to be felt the hardest? Clearly, the developing world. Much of the world's poor live in the tropical or low-lying regions already suffering climate change fall-out like droughts or rising sea levels. Moreover their countries rarely have the resources to mitigate such damage. The NFGS report projects overall output losses of above 15 per cent for much of Asia and Africa, rising to 20 per cent in the Sahel countries. Climate change will drive up to 132 million more people into extreme poverty by 2030, a World Bank paper last year concluded. Factors included lost farming income; lower outdoor labour productivity; rising food prices; increased disease; and economic losses from extreme weather. 4. How much will it cost to fix? Advocates of early action say the sooner you start the better. The widely used NiGEM macroeconomic forecast model even suggests an early start would offer small net gains for output thanks to the big investments needed in green infrastructure. The same model warns of output losses of up to 3 per cent in last-minute transition scenarios.

Who loses out in a net-zero carbon world? Primarily, anyone with fossil fuel exposure. A report by think tank Carbon Tracker in September estimated that over $1 trillion of business-as-usual investment by the oil and gas sector would no longer be viable in a genuinely low-carbon world. Moreover the IMF has called for the end of all fossil fuel subsidies - which it calculates at $5 trillion annually if defined to include undercharging for supply, environmental and health costs. 6. What should carbon really cost? AdvertisementTax or permit schemes that try to price in the damage done by emissions create incentives to go green. But so far only a fifth of global carbon emissions are covered by such programmes, pricing carbon on average at a mere $3 a tonne. That's well below the $75/tonne the IMF says is needed to cap global warming at well below 2 degrees. The Reuters poll of economists recommended $100/tonne. 7. Wouldn't that lead to inflation? Anything which factors in the polluting cost of fossil fuels is likely to lead to price rises in some sectors - aviation for example. That could in turn lead to what central banks define as inflation - broad-based and durable price rises across the whole economy. Yet history shows this hasn't necessarily been the case: carbon taxes introduced in Canada and Europe pushed overall prices lower because they cut into household income and hence consumer demand, a recent study showed. 8. Are green advances really decoupling emissions from economic growth? Genuinely sustainable growth implies that economic activity can grow as needed without adding yet more emissions. This is the holy grail of "absolute decoupling". But so far, any decoupling has either been largely relative - in the sense of merely achieving higher rates of economic growth than gains in emissions - or achieved by shifting dirty production from one national territory to another. And that is why, for now, global emissions are still rising. HYPERLINK https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjFcXFwvMTBcXFwvMjUxNTIxNDRcXFwvR2V0dHlJbWFnZXMtMTIyOTY4NTU5OS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6XCIxMDI0XCIsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjpcIjY4M1wiLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjp7XCJvdXRwdXRcIjpcIndlYnBcIn19IiwiaGFzaCI6IjYzNjc4YmNhMmU4MzdjNTcxM2MzOGM5MDExYjFlZjgyMTgwODZmODAifQ==/climate-change-and-cop26-what-are-the-economic-stakes.jpg Link to Image Prominent campaigners like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are calling for a 'just transition' and want rich countries to take bold action on climate change and economic inequalities. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty 9. Who bears the brunt of transition? The idea of "Just Transition" has been espoused by bodies such as the European Union to acknowledge that the transition to net-zero should happen fairly - for example by ensuring low-income groups are not made worse-off. At a global scale, the rich countries which since their industrial revolutions have generated the bulk of emissions have promised to help developing countries transition via $100 billion of annual transfers - a promise so far not fulfilled. 10. Could this spark a financial crisis? The global financial system needs to be insulated against both the physical risks of climate change itself and the upheavals likely to happen during a transition to net-zero. Central banks and national treasuries are calling on banks and other financial players to come clean about the exposure of their books to such risks. The ECB and other regulators have made it clear there is a long way to go on this. \</doc>

For some, warnings about the cataclysmic climate threat facing the world can sound endlessly repetitive, but scientists' warnings about the dangers that lie ahead are getting more and more stark. As the Cop26 Latest indications of "Code Red for humanity" - as described by UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres - came this week from the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The Unep 2021 "emissions gap" report highlighted glaring gaps between countries promises and their emissions, while the WMO measures greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The promises made to date to cut emissions by 2030 would still leave the world 2.7 degrees hotter by the end of the century, resulting in an irreversible catastrophe and making most of the Earth unliveable, the Unep warns. Despite all of the talk, current pledges would reduce carbon by only about 7.5 per cent by 2030, far less than the 55 per cent needed to keep temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees. Guterres described the findings as a "thundering wake-up call" to world leaders as they gather in Glasgow, while climate experts demanded drastic action against fossil fuel companies. Failure, as of now, to get all G20 countries - responsible for 80 per cent of emissions - on board is a bad omen, with the current energy crisis forcing some back to using coal. Previously, the Unep has warned that planned production of oil, coal and gas over the next decade is "dangerously" out of sync with climate change targets already made, never mind new ones. Ireland in the shade Ireland has made some of the most ambitious pledges, promising to cut emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and to hit net zero by 2050 - but ranks a poorly 80th out of 193 countries when it come to rhetoric meeting reality. "If everyone in the world had the same per-capita emissions as Ireland, the planet would already have warmed by a catastrophic 3 degrees," noted Dr Hannah Daly of MaREI energy research centre in UCC. Global concentrations of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas, are now 50 per cent higher than before the Industrial Revolution which sparked mass burning of fossil fuels, the WMO bulletin confirmed. Methane levels have more than doubled since 1750. All key greenhouse gasses rose faster in 2020 than the average for the previous decade. Despite coronavirus lockdowns, they hit record levels in 2020. Calling this week for much greater urgency, Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University, a lead author in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report offered a bleak assessment. Humans have pushed the climate system to a state not seen in thousands of years - arguably, not seen since the peak of the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago. All of human development has happened during "a remarkably quiescent" climate period on Earth but that is changing and "all of the warming is down to us. It's not a question of how much; it's all of it," said Thorne this week. "Greenhouse gas emissions, sadly, despite of 30 years of negotiations, are still stubbornly going upwards. That is not a good look if we want to stabilise the climate, we have to get down," he added. Warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees, but that means half of CO2 now produced annually will have to be taken out of the atmosphere every year from 2050 onwards. "That is a very risky bet. The longer we continue to emit carbon dioxide, the more we will have to draw down later to limit warming to 1.5." And it's not just CO2, nitrous oxide must be reduced and methane halved by the middle of this century: "Each action, every bit of warming matters," according to the IPCC - and failure is not an option. Climate action should have started 30 years ago, he suggested. "We would have had a gentle glide path. The longer we leave it the steeper the cliff is getting and that cliff is already terrifying steep. If we leave it longer it will become impossible . . . We will be committed to expensive solutions to bring us back after a period of overshoot." However, the "good news" is the climate can be stabilised within our lifetimes: "We can stabilise rainfall; temperature, other aspects - the fast responding aspects of the climate system," said Thorne. However, the "slow-acting" consequences of climate change - the rise in sea levels, ice sheet collapse, ocean warming - cannot be stopped by humans on the planet today. "Those are a multigenerational commitment. If we don't act soon, we will be committing on a multigenerational two to 10,000-years basis to tens of metres of sea level rise." And it is not something that will trouble people living in faraway places, said Thorne: "Many of this island's great cities would not be viable under that level of sea level rise." The fundamental question in his view is: "Will we be seen as a people who knew we had a problem and fixed it quickly to make it liveable for many generations hence? Or will we be the damned?" Prof Euan Nisbet based in Royal Holloway, London, backs that verdict. "Greenhouse gas measurements are like skidding into a car crash. You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl." The "extreme" growth in methane emissions is especially worrying, he said - figures are now rising faster than ever suggests the warming [is] feeding the warming. Diplomatic efforts US president Joe Biden desperately wants to lead collective global action on climate in Glasgow, but his domestic agenda is stuttering so he faces credibility issues in Glasgow. Cop veteran Sadhbh O'Neill, a Dublin City University climate researcher, said every country must sign up in Glasgow to real emissions cuts that are in line with science, that are real, and in time to make a difference. Cop26 Cop26 will be written in our skies in the form of greenhouse gas concentrations." So far, the response is "an epic fail," he said and the small window of opportunity that exists is about to vanish: "Will this 26th Cop find success where the previous 25 have fallen short? Our atmosphere will bear witness." There is no doubt climate action is being ratcheted up, but is it enough? Is it happening quickly enough? Is the Paris Agreement enough to avoid a 2.7-degree scenario? Based on hard data, and to borrow a famous phrase from Margaret Thatcher, the emphatic answers are: "No! No! No!" If a "Yes! Yes!" could be nailed down at Cop26 on the first two questions at least, it would make for a meaningful outcome. \</doc>

In early November, 197 nations came together for the United Nations COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland to discuss how to accelerate current efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change across the planet. After some last-minute compromises on coal, a revised agreement was reached, which is the most ambitious climate pact since Paris 2015. The deal aims to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The COP26 Companies-large and small -will also need to take steps to ramp up their sustainability efforts to help reduce negative environmental impacts. Building a more sustainable business At Alexion, sustainability is at the forefront of everything we do, not least manufacturing, to minimise negative environmental impacts while conserving energy and natural resources. "We all need to be good stewards of our environment and planet," says Shane Doyle, Senior Vice President and Head of Operations at Alexion. "As a pharmaceutical company, we have an obligation to our patients, employees and communities to develop innovative medicines and solutions in the most responsible way." In late July, Alexion Pharmaceuticals joined AstraZeneca creating Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, which is the group within AstraZeneca focused on rare diseases. As a leader in rare diseases for nearly 30 years, Alexion's mission is to transform the lives of people affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions through the development and delivery of innovative medicines, as well as through supportive technologies and healthcare services. Building toward a sustainable future "We have done a lot of great work around sustainability and our carbon footprint. Alexion's recent integration with AstraZeneca will really allow us to take this work to the next level enabling us to achieve our sustainability ambitions," says Michael Teehan, Vice President and Head of Integrated Manufacturing for Alexion. In 2020, AstraZeneca launched Ambition Zero Carbon, committing to become zero carbon by 2025 across operations (sites and fleet) without carbon credits and carbon negative in its value chain by 2030. These greenhouse gas targets exceed the science based targets initiative reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which was signed at the 2015 COP meeting. During COP26 During the next three years, Alexion will move at an even faster pace in sustainability and has joined Project Energize with AstraZeneca in pursuing a science-based sustainability strategy, Teehan says. "We all have an obligation to the world we live in to give it the best chance for the long term," he adds. "The less we rely on fossil fuels now, the better off we will be in the future." AstraZeneca is establishing a next-generation active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility for small molecules at the College Park Campus in Dublin. The $360 million planned investment is expected to create about 100 highly skilled direct jobs, including scientists and engineers and further indirect jobs. \</doc>

I RELAND is donating millions of euro as part of a funding initiative that makes poor countries jump through impossible hoops and wait years for financial help with the climate crisis. The system is so dysfunctional that Ireland mostly bypasses it and sends money through separate channels. The revelation comes as governments attending the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow haggle over a $100bn annual climate finance fund for developing nations. They agreed to create the Green Climate Fund more than a decade ago but have been slow to hit the target. COP26 president Alok Sharma said yesterday he believed the goal would be reached in 2023. On Tuesday, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin confirmed in his address to the summit that Ireland would assist by more than doubling its annual contribution to the fund by 2025. Reaching $100bn has become a benchmark by which the success or failure of COP26 is being judged. But countries that depend on grants and low-cost loans from the fund to help them cope with the impact of climate change and adopt renewable energy and clean technologies say they have severe difficulty accessing the money that already exists. Sonam Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group at the COP26 negotiations, told the Irish Independent a multitude of different eligibility criteria, application methods and assessment procedures applied and there were long delays in getting approval. "Access is a huge problem," he said. "For us it takes four to five years even to secure a loan. "If you have a climate disaster and you apply for loan, and it takes four or five years, it doesn't make sense. "You are not able to help your people, not able to rebuild or secure livelihoods. We end up borrowing [on commercial markets] and most LDCs are getting in debt traps." Mr Wangdi said the system needed to be streamlined. "It's a goal from the LDCs' perspective to have a simplified process where the requirements are harmonised, there is one template for all and you could get your loan in a turnaround time of six months or a year," he said. 'The money is sitting there and yet it is not given out', so it is very frustrating." Conor O'Neill of Christian Aid Ireland said Mr Wangdi accurately described what was happening. "The idea was to have a central Green Climate Fund where developing countries would have their own representatives coordinating the flows of money, so there would be a really transparent system in place," he said. "Instead the money goes through more than 100 channels and very few are monitored in meaningful ways. "There is research to show that only 60pc of climate finance available was used between 2002 and 2018, so while there is a lot of emphasis on increasing the size of the fund, there is an equally important issue in ensuring the countries that need it can access it." Campaigners say the lack of harmonised regulations and monitoring allows donor countries to fudge their contributions by mixing in private sector loans and loans with restrictive conditions, and reclassifying portions of existing overseas aid budgets as climate finance. Mr O'Neill said Ireland's approach was praiseworthy as funding was in the form of grants, not loans, and it was almost all provided through trusted Irish Aid channels. "We would still have an issue with the quantity of Ireland's contribution. We think it should be (EURO)500m a year, but on the quality side, it's an example to follow." He added, however, that it would still be preferable if the centralised Green Climate Fund could be used. "If it operated as originally planned, it would have direct involvement of the countries who use it and it would be much more democratic." Ireland's donation to climate finance this year was (EURO)93m, but the Government has pledged to increase this to (EURO)225m by 2025. Minister for Overseas Aid Colm Brophy, who is in Dubai visiting the Irish pavilion at the Dubai Expo 2020 event, but who will attend COP26 next week, said he was aware of the barriers for countries trying to tap into funding. "Developing countries have faced issues with accessing international climate funds," he said in a statement. "This challenge is particularly acute for least developed countries and small island developing states which are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. "Ireland raises these accessibility issues with international climate funds and actively seeks solutions. "We also work directly with our partner countries to help build their capacity to access financial support through international climate funds." Minister Brophy said Ireland had recently co-founded a 'Champions Group on Adaptation Finance'. "Addressing accessibility issues of developing countries to international finance is a key objective of this group," he said. He is due to speak on the topic at COP26 next Monday. Climate finance dominated the summit agenda yesterday, with multi-billion euro pledges on private and public-private investments in renewables and green technologies being finalised. Activists argue, however, that private investors demand a return on their money and that poor countries need more public funding to safeguard their development.

EAMON Ryan is going to the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow today after all. A second Covid-19 test showed negative - apparently undoing the result of a previous positive test which had initially prompted him to cancel his trip. A spokesman for the Environment Minister and Green Party leader has defended the handling of the case and insisted Mr Ryan acted at all times on the basis of the professional advice he was given. After the initial test, Mr Ryan also followed all HSE protocols for people who test positive for Covid-19, including self-isolation and informing all his close contacts. Mr Ryan's first test, taken last Friday, was done at the behest of the COP26 organisers and had a positive result. But the National Ambulance Service, which does tests for government ministers and officials in cases where they are required for official business, administered a second test, which yesterday was revealed to be negative. The HSE said second tests are sometimes administered where the result is deemed "ambiguous". It is understood the case for carrying out a second test was added to by Mr Ryan having no symptoms and not being in any way associated with other cases of the virus in his direct contacts. A HSE spokesman said they could not comment on any individual case. But he said there were general criteria for carrying out a second test. "In certain instances, where clinically indicated, a repeat test may be recommended for an individual. This is typically based on a discussion between the testing laboratory and the person requesting the test, and takes into account a number of factors, such as the laboratory result itself, including viral targets detected etc, the reason for the test, and the condition of the person having the test performed," the senior HSE official said. Health service sources said that second tests "happen pretty regularly" - especially in cases where a person does not have any Covid-19 symptoms. Cases where the first result is deemed to be on the lower end of the infection scale are also a reason for a second test. In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Ryan said that following his initial positive test result for Covid-19 on Saturday, he received notification from the HSE that a second test was recommended. The result of this test showed that Covid-19 was not detected. "The public health advice in this instance is that the case is de-notified, close contacts are informed and the person can continue about their business. Minister Ryan now plans to travel to Glasgow for COP26 tomorrow," the statement said. COP26 . "On receipt of the initial result, he followed all HSE protocols including self-isolation and informing close contacts. Minister Ryan has updated the Taoiseach, T\'e1naiste and the Secretary to the Government with this information," it concluded. \</doc>

As he prepared to leave Glasgow last night after two apparently successful days at the Cop26 climate summit, Boris Johnson warned against succumbing to false hope. But the meeting had a better start than many predicted, bringing more than 100 countries together behind two important pledges on methane emissions and deforestation. Activists and experts were quick to note correctly that neither of the pledges - to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent, and to end and reverse deforestation - are binding and the pledge to reverse deforestation is not unlike a promise made in 2014. The difference is that while 40 countries signed the 2014 pledge, more than twice as many have made the commitment this week. Clearing forests The signatories, which include countries like Canada, China, Indonesia and Brazil, account for more than 85 per cent of the world's forests. There will be significant financial incentives to avoid clearing forests and pressure on investors to avoid companies that profit from deforestation. The third big event during the leaders' summit was Narendra Modi's announcement that India would cut its emissions to net zero by 2070, two decades later than the goal set by Cop26 . The date may be less important, however, than the fact it is the first time that India has set a target for net zero. India is the fourth-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, although its huge population means its per capita emissions are lower than in other big countries. Modi promises to get half of India's energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to cut carbon emissions by a billion tonnes by the same date. Modi's visibility in Glasgow was more noticeable for the absence of China's President Xi Jinping, who has not left his country since the start of the pandemic. China has promised to bring its emissions to a peak by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2060, 10 years later than the Cop26 goal. As Johnson pointed out in his press conference yesterday evening, China's size and economic power mean that it will make a huge difference if its emissions peak as early as 2025. And its commitment to stop financing coal-fired power projects overseas will impact on the use of coal in parts of Europe as well as Asia. With the leaders gone, negotiators will spend the next two weeks working on the details that will determine the success of Cop26 and the real value of the politicians' pledges. \</doc>

Boris Johnson has insisted he takes a "responsible" approach to wearing a mask after facing criticism for appearing at a hospital and the Cop26 summit without one. The UK prime minister, who appeared to be losing his voice, told a Downing Street press conference that he obeyed the rules on mask wearing and had donned one more regularly as cases had increased. "I wear a mask wherever the rules say that I should, and I urge everybody else to do the same," he said. "People have actually seen me wearing face coverings quite a bit more regularly as we have seen the numbers ticking up in the UK. "I think that is the responsible thing to do and I am going to continue to do it."

More than 100 countries have joined an effort led by the United States and the European Union to slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels, an initiative aimed at tackling one of the main causes of climate change. Methane is the main greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but breaks down in the atmosphere faster - meaning that cutting methane emissions can have a rapid impact in reining in global warming. The Global Methane Pledge, launched at the COP26 summit in Glasgow today after being announced in September, now covers countries representing nearly half of global methane emissions and 70% of global GDP, US President Joe Biden said. "Together, we're committing to collectively reduce our methane by 30% by 2030. And I think we can probably go beyond that," Mr Biden said at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. "It's going to boost our economies, saving companies money, reducing methane leaks, capturing methane to turn it into new revenue streams, as well as creating good paying union jobs for our workers." Among the new signatories was Brazil - one of the world's biggest emitters of methane. The pledge now includes six of the world's 10 biggest methane emitters: the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Mexico. China, Russia, India and Iran, also top-10 methane emitters, have not signed up. Those countries were all included on a list identified as targets to join the pledge, first reported by Reuters. "Methane is one of the gases we can cut fastest. Doing that will immediately slow down climate change," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Since it was first announced in September with a handful of signatories, the United States and the European Union have worked to get the world's biggest methane emitters to join the partnership. There were roughly 60 countries signed up only last week, after a final diplomatic push from the United States and EU ahead of the COP26 summit. While it is not part of the formal UN negotiations, the methane pledge could rank among the most significant outcomes from the COP26 conference, given its potential impact in holding off disastrous climate change. A UN report in May said steep cuts in methane emissions this decade could avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming by the 2040s. Failing to tackle methane, however, would push out of reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's objective to limit the global rise in temperature to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The 30% methane cut, which is not legally binding, would be jointly achieved by the signatories, and cover all sectors. Key sources of methane emissions include leaky oil and gas infrastructure, old coal mines, agriculture and landfill sites. If fulfilled, the pledge is likely to have the biggest impact on the energy sector, since analysts say fixing leaky oil and gas infrastructure is the fastest and cheapest way to curb methane emissions. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/cop26/ Latest COP26 news The United States is the world's biggest oil and natural gas producer, while the EU is the biggest importer of gas. Separately, the United States unveiled its own sweeping proposal today to crack down on methane emissions with a focus on the oil and gas sector. The main regulation could take effect as soon as 2023 and slash methane from oil and gas operations by 74% from 2005 levels by 2035, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The EU and Canada both plan to unveil methane legislation addressing the energy sector later this year. \</doc>

THIS week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a litany of broken climate promises. Together with the IPCC's previous two reports on physical science and adaptation in the past year, it reveals the yawning gap between climate pledges and reality. The reality is that we are speeding toward disastrous global warming of more than double the limit of 1.5C by 2100, as cited in the Paris agreement of 2016. In concrete terms, this means major cities under water, unprecedented heat waves, terrifying storms, widespread water shortages, and the extinction of one million species of plants and animals. So far, high-emitting governments and corporations are not just turning a blind eye; they are adding fuel to the flames by continuing to invest in climate-choking industries. Scientists warn that we are already perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate effects. The new IPCC report arrives in a period of extraordinary global political and economic turbulence that has further jeopardised efforts to address climate change. Energy prices spiked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting several nations to increase fossil-fuel production. In the long run, that will only make matters worse. Leaders who claim to be protecting their people by doubling down on fossil fuels are doing the exact opposite: throwing their people to the wolves of energy insecurity, price volatility and climate chaos. The IPCC report lays out a saner, safer approach, one that would get the world back on track by using renewable solutions that provide green jobs, energy security and greater price stability. This report is a blueprint to bring us back to the 1.5C pledge that nearly 200 nations made in Paris and renewed at the COP26 gathering in Glasgow, Scotland, last November. We left Scotland with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments. But the main problem - the enormous, growing emissions gap - was all but ignored. The science is clear. To keep the 1.5C limit within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45pc this decade. But current climate pledges would mean a 14pc increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises. That is why this latest IPCC report is focused on mitigation - cutting emissions. It sets out viable, financially sound options in every sector. First and foremost, we must triple the speed of the shift to renewable energy. That means moving investments and subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables - now. In most cases, renewables are already cheaper. It means governments ending the funding of coal, not just abroad, but at home. The financing of all forms of coal extraction, production and power generation everywhere must be stopped. To support major emerging economies in making this shift, I have been advocating for climate coalitions, made up of developing and developed countries, multilateral development banks, private financial institutions and corporations with the technical know-how to help. All of us have a role to play in the shift to green energy. Young people, civil society and indigenous communities are among those who have stepped up, sounding the alarm and holding leaders accountable. We now need to build on their work to create a worldwide grassroots movement that no one can ignore. I hereby appeal directly to everyone with an interest in our planet and our future: make your voice heard, wherever decisions are taken - in political debates, local authorities, boardrooms and at the ballot box. The decisions governments make today will determine the future of achieving the 1.5C limit. A shift to renewables will mend our broken global energy mix and offer hope to millions of people already suffering from the impact of climate change. Climate promises and plans must be turned into reality and action, now. It is time to stop burning our planet and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.

People from African nations who are most effected by the impacts of climate change are having their voices heard in the halls of COP26 as crunch time for a deal begins. Emen Okon comes from Port Harcourt, Rivers State in Nigeria, which is an area where crude oil is extracted. The west African nation is the largest oil and gas producer in Africa. "Rivers State is the hub of the oil and gas industry. Right now in Port Harcourt, what we experience is soot." If you left a white shirt outside it would show black particles within a short amount of time, Ms Okon said. "If you rub your hand on a window, you will see the soot, black, on your hand, like charcoal. That is what we have been inhaling.

Hundreds of people gathered for protests across the island of Ireland on Friday as part of a global climate strike. A rally closed off one side of Merrion Square in Dublin, as protesters gathered to demand urgent action to tackle climate change. Demonstrators also held a minute's silence for the people of Ukraine at the event, organised by Fridays for Future. Speaker after speaker called on the Irish Government and world leaders to do more to tackle the threat of global warming and climate change. The Green Party was warned that young voters would be scrutinising its record in Government at the next election. Speakers were cheered on with whoops and applause from a crowd that contained scores of schoolchildren in uniform. Some politicians joined the protest for a time on Friday afternoon, which brought a carnival atmosphere to the street only a short walk from Government Buildings. Newly installed Labour leader Ivana Bacik joined the crowd, as well as People Before Profit TDs Paul Murphy and Brid Smith. Nineteen-year-old Aine Dempsey, one of the speakers at the rally, is already a seasoned climate activist. This is her third year of being involved in the Fridays for Future climate movement. She said the Government is ``clearly not'' doing enough on climate change. ``I think everyone here shows exactly what people of the recent climate crisis. ``We have had several crises - one after another. Covid, that deserved to be treated like the crisis that it was. Now we have the Ukrainian crisis and that deserves to be treated like the crisis that it is. ``But the climate crisis has not gone away throughout all of this. ``We are here today to put the climate conversation right back on the map, right back in your face, because we are actually running out of time.'' Anya Bazilo, from Kyiv in Ukraine, also spoke to protesters as she waved a Ukrainian flag. She fled from her city to join family in Ireland following the outbreak of war. ``You see a smile on my face, because I see your amazing energy and your amazing smiles and your look into the future that you want to live in. ``A beautiful, safe environment for all of us - for Ireland, for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world. ``Thank you very much for putting a smile on my face for the first time. Thank you.'' Protests took place across the island, with climate protesters also gathering in Cork, Galway and Belfast. At the protest in Belfast, Kay Laverty, from Fridays for Future Northern Ireland, challenged Stormont politicians to make good on commitments to reduce emissions legislated for in the recent Climate Change Act. Ms Laverty said activists viewed the measures agreed by global leaders at Cop26 in Glasgow last year as insufficient, branding the event ``Flop26''. Addressing the climate strike protest in Belfast, Green Party NI deputy leader Mal O'Hara said climate deniers were now climate delayers. ``They laughed at us when as an environmental movement 40 years ago we started talking about the dangers of climate change and its impact on our natural world and on our people,'' he told the crowd that gathered in the city centre for the demo. ``They laughed at us, they ignored us, now those who used to be deniers are only delayers and we will not let them delay us as we demand a more just, fair and greener world.'' end \</doc>

A group of friends in Co Dublin have been crafting colourful climate messages for display at next week's key COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. The self-proclaimed "oldies" from Shankill are looped in with the UK-based 'Stitches for Survival' group, a sprawling network of knitters, crocheters, stitchers and crafters who together are aiming to create a 1.5 mile (2.4km) 'scarf' to send to COP26 . The Shankill group has created 20 panels so far. Organiser Kathie Davey said: "Single panels have gone already. There is a group up in Glasgow who are busy stitching them together into blocks of 20. We are going to send a block of 20. "This project started in Scotland to raise awareness of the climate change crisis that we are beginning to endure. And to sensitise people to the COP26 conference in Glasgow. "The governments are going to have to bite the bullet and take serious action. That is really going to hurt our pockets and our lifestyle. And unless the public are behind these measures, they won't be taken. And that is really what the panels are about." June Nursey, 83, has been using her spinning wheel to create her panel, thinking about her eight-year-old grandson as she spins. She said: "He's a lovely boy and I'm hoping that there will be a future for him and other youngsters. I just feel that future generations are really going to pick up the mess of what we have created over the years." Another member of the Shankill group, Bernie Healy, explained that the idea for one of her panels came from "the need to look after the soil, biodiversity, and the needs of all the little, small creatures that we sometimes forget about". She added: "Peaceful protest is just so important. And I think sometimes that it has a big impact. To think what is behind all of this, the people, everything. There's just so many stitches gone into this. It stretches far and wide." Ahead of COP26 Kathie explained that it was important for older people to stand in solidarity with the younger generation. She said: "We are the 'oldies', the ones who like using our hands. And we're here to let people know that there's a terrible crisis on for the climate. And it's great to be here with all the young ones. It makes us feel a bit younger too." COP26 opens in Glasgow on 31 October. The two-week conference is widely thought of as the last chance for world leaders to commit to action on climate change ahead of the 2030 deadline to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Kathie said: "We can't take back what's been done but we can slow it down and prevent it from getting, please God, much more than 1.5C." \</doc>

NORTHERN Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said that there is "an onus on big corporations to decarbonise and work to deliver green jobs and healthier, first-class public transport for all". Ms O'Neill was speaking after launching a party document on tackling the climate crisis at the UN's COP26 "The COP26 summit is an important opportunity to send a clear message on the actions that will need to be taken by governments to tackle the climate emergency," she said. "Today at the summit, attended by world leaders, Sinn F\'e9in have launched a document on green energy and tackling the climate emergency. Just like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change doesn't recognise borders and we need an all-Ireland approach," Ms O'Neill added. "We must secure a fair transition to a low carbon economy and increase support for rural communities and family farms. "There's an onus on big corporations to decarbonise and work to deliver green jobs and healthier, first-class public transport for all. Sinn F\'e9in will play our part in the fight back against climate change and protecting the environment for future generations." The UN conference opened on Sunday, with the UK pressing world leaders to sign up to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Ms O'Neill said failing to act would be a dereliction of leaders' responsibilities. Downing Street said Cop26 will be one of the biggest events the UK has hosted, with 25,000 delegates expected from 196 countries. "Governments, businesses and individuals must all shoulder their responsibilities to create a cleaner environment and it is important that the voice of the Northern Ireland Executive is heard at the summit over the next fortnight," said First Minister Paul Givan. He said the Executive's draft Green Growth Strategy, published last week, sets out the long-term vision for tackling the climate crisis. \</doc>

World leaders are to travel to Glasgow for the most important round of climate talks since the Paris Agreement in 2015. COP26 , the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, takes place from 31 October to 12 November. On Tuesday, a United Nations report said that current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on course for an HYPERLINK average 2.7C temperature rise this century . UN chief Antonio Guterres said the report showed the world was "still on track for climate catastrophe". Against this stark backdrop, we have been asking young people to send their messages to the leaders attending COP26 . At 14, she is one of the country's youngest climate activists. She is a member of Fridays for Future and part of An Taisce's Climate Ambassador programme. She said: "I feel as a young person - basically a child - that this is my future and it\' s a future governments and stakeholders have in their hands." At COP26 , countries are being asked to strengthen action to tackle global warming under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Heather is not only concerned about the outcome of the conference, she is also worried that if her generation are not educated properly on climate change "then we\' re not going to be able to do things properly either". She is calling for more lesson time to be devoted to climate change at all levels of education. "Educating young people is such an important tactic to use, because we\' ll take that knowledge and remember it for later life when we are the policy makers and leaders," she said. Heather works climate change into as many conversations with her schoolmates as she can and urges them to research the topic themselves. "I have been called annoying. People say 'why do you keep talking about this?\' . They can give you snarky looks or comments. But teenage girls will be teenage girls," she reflected. "There's a motto written up in our hall which says: 'Don\' t let them dull your sparkle'. I really believe you can't let people dull your sparkle. You have to keep fighting for what you believe in." Heather is urging world leaders to "think about their young people" during the climate change summit. "They\' re going to COP26 now, but in a few years time, we\' ll be going. And tackling the climate crisis will take much more time if we have to be the ones fixing their mistakes." \</doc>

"Boris Johnson, as host of these climate talks, must demonstrate what real climate action looks like."

The maker of Irn-Bru, the iconic orange Scottish soft drink, said today that it had increased its prices due to soaring inflation in Britain. UK consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in almost 30 years, stoked by global supply chain problems and increases in the price of raw materials, forcing companies to increasingly pass higher costs on to customers. Irn-Bru is regarded by many as a national symbol of Scotland and is known for its surreal and sometimes provocative advertising campaigns. Described as Scotland's other national drink, with whisky being the first, it secured another fan last year when US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tried it at the COP26 climate summit in Scotland. "We have initiated several cost control actions to reduce the impact of these rising costs and have adjusted our pricingwith customers where appropriate," owner AG Barr said in a statement. The company, which also makes the Rubicon and Sun Exotic brands of fruit drinks, said it would seek opportunities to offset the impact of inflation on its business. Cost pressures for British consumers look likely to intensify over the next few months, although some business surveys show tentative signs that input cost pressures for companies may have peaked. British grocery inflation rose to 3.8% in the four weeks to January 23, with the prices of savoury snacks, crisps and beef rising the most, market researcher Kantar said this week, underlining the growing cost-of-living squeeze facing many households. The headline gauge of annual consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in December and the Bank of England thinks it will peak at around 6% in April. \</doc>

The crisis of climate change risks irrevocably damaging the planet and biodiversity - and all of us will be affected by the challenge of mitigating it. The UN Environment Programme has described what we are facing as a "triple planetary crisis", such is the gravity of scientific evidence about global warming, the scale of biodiversity loss and the impact of toxic waste pollution. It's a crisis for humanity, damaging health, claiming lives and livelihoods, and threatening the existence of small island states and coastal communities. According to the World Health Organisation, 24 per cent of global deaths are linked to the environment each year - eight million of which are caused by forms of air pollution. Between 2030 and 2050, an extra 250,000 deaths are anticipated globally directly due to climate-induced risks, such as heat stress, malnutrition and malaria. Climate change is part of a deeper environmental crisis, which has the destruction of human rights and health at its core. Cop26 was not expected to meet the ambition contained in the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rises within 1.5 degrees, with models predicting 1.8-2.4 degrees if existing commitments are delivered. If Cop27 in Egypt next year can definitively close that gap, it will be the most impactful step possible to safeguard human rights. The inclusivity of the language on human rights in the preamble to the Glasgow Climate Pact is striking. It's tempting to dismiss this as not providing anything fresh or substantive. The pact calls on states to "respect, promote and consider" their obligations on human rights "when taking action to address climate change". The preamble highlights in particular the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and other vulnerable persons - including migrants, people with disabilities and young people. The importance of "climate justice" is noted, a brief acknowledgment in stark contrast with the size of the global movement so effectively raising awareness of social injustice inherent in climate change . Repeated mentions of rights of indigenous peoples and their role in highlighting cultural knowledge to inform action on climate change extends the language on indigenous peoples present in the Paris Agreement. Cop26 , when the Norwegian Supreme Court revoked wind-farm licences for violating the Sami reindeer herders' way of life. Pro-climate projects shouldn't get a special pass. Damage There is substantial scope to deliver actions upholding rights, equality, climate justice - and the expansion of this language in the Glasgow Climate Pact shows that demands for such action cannot be ignored. The idea of the international community providing compensation to developing countries for material damage was part of the climate debate three decades ago. Instead of establishing a body to deliver funding, the "Glasgow Dialogue between Parties" will discuss the concept over the coming three years. Whatever inspires this ongoing reluctance to take responsibility, the moral imperative to compensate countries impacted by climate change caused by industrialised nations largely remains a topic for dialogue. Adaptation funding pledges at Cop26 could help notwithstanding this - pledges stand at $356 million, one-third pledged by the EU ($116 million). But dealing with climate damage can only be comprehensively done with predictable and formalised funding streams. Cop26 was tasked with finalising the "Paris rulebook" to guide countries on how to meet their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Central to this was the regulation of carbon markets - whereby countries which overperform in decarbonisation can sell their credits on, in theory helping other countries to decarbonise more affordably and meet their climate goals. The Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) warned that the models in which the world avoids the risk of failing to limit warming to 1.5 degrees rely on "near or complete decarbonisation by 2050". With the international community so far off the goal of 1.5 degrees, and when commitments to the deep decarbonisation needed are set to long time scales, the urgency to proceed with carbon trading mechanisms at Cop26 was unjustified. Sharpening human rights, environmental and social safeguards, enhancing accountability and public engagement, and requiring the consent of indigenous communities for projects are essential measures to prevent polluting states abusing the system. At Cop27, the stakes will be even higher - for the future of our climate and for the rights of people already suffering the consequences of climate change. There is huge energy and optimism outside of the Cop arena that will keep pushing for progress, not least on filling the gaps evident in the Glasgow Climate Pact. The youth climate justice movement sweeping courts around the world reminds us that intergenerational rights risk being defined by the climate crisis. It is in everyone's interest that Cop27 elevates human rights, placing them at the centre of every political decision that makes it into the final text.

Idon't know about you, but I'm confused. More panicked than ever about our rapidly overheating planet after the debacle that was Cop26 , I am actively considering trading in the diesel-guzzler for one of those sleek and silent electric jobs. But wait a second: most of those electric cars are made in China, which emerged (along with Russia and Saudi Arabia) as the bogeyman of Cop26 : in addition, sourcing the lithium which is an essential component of these emission-free vehicles is causing misery for underpaid and unsafe miners, and threatening environmental damage on an industrial scale. Driving range is another issue of course, as is expense, but then I hear some guy on the radio telling me that I'd be better off sticking with my diesel (which is a modern, low-emission one), which might do less damage in the long run. It's a conundrum, but one we're all going to have to come to terms with, because the writing is on the wall for petrol, and fossil fuels in general. Over in post-Brexit Britain, diesel and petrol shortages are commonplace, and Boris Johnson's government is pushing a not particularly convincing green agenda. So is now a good time to spend tens of thousands on an electric vehicle? In this Dispatches special, reporter and electric car owner Morland Sanders considers the options for your average motorist. \</doc>

Ireland can lead the battle against climate change from the front as it is "one of the better countries" when it comes to food technology and emissions . That is what Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will tell his fellow world leaders as they gather at Cop26 , the Glasgow-based United Nations climate change event . "The key message for us at Cop26 is that every country has to play its part. Sometimes you'll get the kind of lazy analysis, where people say let China do it or the bigger states do it," said Mr Martin . "It is only when everybody does their bit that one makes the difference. That is certainly true of climate change. Every single state has to play its role." The Taoiseach likened fighting climate change to the ongoing battle against the pandemic . . "The same applies to climate change. If every member state and country in the world works to try and improve its performance, we will have a much better chance of dealing with climate change." Mr Martin says Ireland can stand out on the world stage when it comes to addressing the climate crisis . "I want Ireland to be in a place where we can bring solutions to the world table in terms of technology and in terms of methods of food production, because we are one of the better food production systems in Europe from an emissions perspective, but also in terms of other technologies." Cop26 comes as Ireland prepares to unveil its climate action plan in the next few days. It is believed that a reduction of up to 30% in emissions from agriculture will be a key element of the plan, with no specifics on herd numbers being capped or cut . Transport will also form a major part of the plan, with electric vehicle charging points being significantly increased, along with walking and cycling targets, and an ambition to reduce petrol and diesel vehicle use . Mr Martin insisted herd culling is not on the agenda, despite agriculture's status as a major source of Irish emissions . "I know the minister for agriculture has reached an accommodation with the minister for climate, and it doesn't involve the kind of sweeping generalisations that are being advanced in newspaper articles," he said . "We have to work together as a society because, if we stand back for a minute, the planet is in trouble and our world is in trouble." \</doc>

Citizens across the world are punch drunk from report after report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Its latest verdict on the outlook for the Earth, including a shocking outline of human-induced damage, provides little comfort. However, its framework of how governments can act to avoid the worst consequences of rising temperatures must now become the over-riding focus. Nonetheless, the IPCC's assessment of impacts on humanity and nature confirms that dangers are mounting so rapidly they could soon overwhelm the ability of both nature and mankind to adapt unless greenhouse gas emissions are quickly reduced. Unfortunately, Ireland is far off a position where sufficient cuts are happening within its jurisdiction. Separately, based on IPCC global predictions, there is every likelihood Ireland would fail a climate resilience test on its preparedness and ability to withstand upcoming threats that cannot be avoided. The vulnerability of our major cities and much of our coastline are likely to stand out in such an evaluation. The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal; climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet. "Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future," the IPCC warns. Climate and biodiversity crises are tightly interlinked, and can amplify one another's effects. The resulting impacts will continue to increase for decades until emissions are reduced to zero. However, it also means there is opportunity to tackle both challenges at once by protecting and restoring natural ecosystems. This is not vague hope; it is the mechanism for tangible progress that must be grasped. The onus on governments is to take action to adapt to inevitable impacts and to aggressively slash emissions. This is in a scenario of weather extremes occurring simultaneously, "causing cascading impacts that are increasingly difficult to manage". Issues of justice and equity are raised also, particularly how wealthy countries live up to their responsibilities by increasing support for developing countries for "loss and damage" that has been inflicted upon them by growth-obsessed societies and their rampant fossil fuel use. Repeated promises to deliver financing have been made at UN climate summits. At Cop26 in Glasgow, Ireland led efforts to finally put in place a financial mechanism to resolve the loss and damage issue with substantial supports in the form of grants rather than loans. The IPCC report, infused with a new can-do approach, provides the evidence that such supports are critical. They can also help secure new momentum on global climate action while protecting the wellbeing of billions of people and the places where they live. \</doc>

Police arrested 21 people during the climate rally in Glasgow, with demonstrators kettled and protesters forcibly removed from a city centre bridge. Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Glasgow to demand action to tackle the climate emergency as the city hosts the Cop26 summit. Crowds walked from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green, with organisers estimating that more than 100,000 people took park in the march. Police officers removed activists from the Scientist Rebellion movement who had chained themselves to the King George V Bridge, and were seen to block in other protesters in a "kettle" in the city centre. Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie claimed that the day had "passed largely without incident", although 21 people had been arrested. Mr Ritchie said: "Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. "As one of the key events of Cop26 , the Climate March this afternoon brought together thousands of people from across Scotland, the UK and the world. "Months of planning has gone into the policing operation for the procession and through regular discussion with organisers and key campaign groups, we clearly set our expectations for the behaviour of participants." He added: "The procession has been generally good-natured, with participants in high spirits, keen to draw attention to their respective causes with Police Scotland officers deployed alongside mutual aid officers from across the UK. "As we've made clear throughout, our aim has been to deliver a safe and secure conference, and ensure people's right to protest - and counterprotest - and having their voices heard is upheld through the facilitation of peaceful, lawful protest. Advertisement"However, we've also been steadfast in our commitment that we will not tolerate damage to property, violence or disorder. "A group of people was contained by officers after their conduct deteriorated, pyrotechnic devices were used, and they brought the procession to a halt. "The containment remained in place for a short time before being lifted as the march came to a conclusion. One person was arrested following the end of the march. "In a separate incident this morning, our Police Liaison Team and Protest Removal Team attended to ensure the safe removal of people involved in a lock-on at the King George V Bridge at the Broomielaw in Glasgow. "As a result, 21 people were arrested and have been released on an undertaking. "I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers." Police refused to estimate how many people were marching, but organisers the Cop26 Coalition claimed more than 100,000 people had turned out despite the weather, as an estimated 300 events were taking place worldwide. Asad Rehman, spokesman for the Cop26 Coalition, said: "Many thousands of people took to the streets today on every continent demanding that governments move from climate inaction to climate justice. "We won't tolerate warm words and long-term targets any more, we want action now." \</doc>

UN chief Antonio Guterres said today that the world is "sleepwalking to climate catastrophe", with major economies allowing carbon pollution to increase when drastic cuts are needed. The planet-saving goal of capping global warming at 1.5C is already "on life support," he told a sustainability conference in London. Keeping 1.5C in play requires a 45% drop in emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by mid-century, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But even if nations honour newly revised pledges under the Paris Agreement, emissions are still set to rise 14% before the decade ends. "The problem is getting worse," Mr Guterres said in a pre-recorded video message. "We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe." "If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5C goodbye," he added. "Even two degrees may be out of reach." His comments came only hours before the 195-nation IPCC kicks off a two-week meeting to validate a landmark report on options for reducing carbon pollution and extracting CO2 from the air. The report is expected to conclude that CO2 emissions must peak within a few years if the Paris temperature targets are to be met. Mr Guterres described covid recovery spending as "scandalously uneven" and a missed opportunity to accelerate the turn toward clean energy. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, he added, could further derail climate action with importers locking in fossil fuel dependence as they scramble to replace Russian oil and gas. 'Addiction to fossil fuel' "This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction." A bombshell report last year from the intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IEA) concluded that a 1.5C world was incompatible with any new oil or gas developments, or new coal-fired power plants. Breaking with the usual practice of not singling out countries, Mr Guterres called out Australia and a "handful of holdouts" for failing to lay out "meaningful" near-term plans to slash emissions. He also said the development needs and economic structures of China, India, Indonesia and other "emerging economies" prevent them from making similar commitments, especially on coal. Rich nations should provide money, technology and know how to help these emerging economies purge coal from their energy portfolios, he added, pointing to a pathbreaking deal for South Africa unveiled at the COP26 climate summit last November in Glasgow. "Our planet can't afford a climate blame game," he cautioned. "we can't point fingers while the planet burns." Wealthy nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) must phase-out coal by 2030, and all other countries by 2040, Mr Guterres said. China and India - both heavily reliant on coal - have resisted a full embrace of the 1.5C goal, along with pressure to set more ambitious short-term emissions reduction targets. Both nations, however, have set long-term "net-zero" goals for carbon neutrality, 2060 for China and 2070 for India. G20 countries account for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A landmark IPCC report on climate impact and humanity's capacity to adapt, published last month, details an atlas of human suffering and warned that far worse is to come. Unprecedented floods, heatwaves and wildfires seen across four continents in the last year will all accelerate in coming decades even if the fossil fuel pollution is rapidly brought to heel, the report concluded. \</doc>

D ESPITE the fact COP26 opens to the funeral drum beat of climate doom, there are reasons for believing we can do better - mainly because we have no choice. True, we have been living in emergency intervention mode on global warming for too long - and still await the intervention. Teenage activist Greta Thunberg could hardly have been more articulate when she summed up the value of the hot air from world leaders. She dismissed their 30 years of "blah, blah, blah" when they should have been acting to curb the crisis. Today, some white smoke is expected from the G20 on the banning of coal. The meeting is billed as the curtain-raiser for COP26 , which opens in Glasgow tomorrow. In the past, such grand planetary pageants merely served as preparations for failure. But the Paris Accord of 2015 set down meaningful markers, and the effort to meet them has been considerable. But we are still not doing nearly enough. Without the remotest hint of hyperbole, this week the UN's top human rights official called for countries to act decisively, saying it is a "matter of survival" for humanity. In her primer for tomorrow's climate showcase, High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned: "Only urgent, priority action can mitigate or avert disasters that will have huge - and in some cases lethal - impacts on all of us, especially our children and grandchildren." It is regrettable that two of the global "big beasts" are not represented - neither Xi Jinping of China nor Vladimir Putin of Russia are attending COP26 . The presence of Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will make the gathering look more weighted toward the industrialised north than it would otherwise have done - and appearances at such gatherings matter. Much can still be achieved, and it has been pointed out that the absence of Xi and Putin could be more symbolic than substantive, as both will send highly placed envoys. Defining goals will be a vital step. Success means altering emissions trajectories in line with the Paris objectives. That must include not only net-zero targets decades into the future, but big cuts in emissions by 2030. Pope Francis has appealed for leaders to agree a meaningful deal offering "concrete hope" to future generations. Carbon taxes and clean energy initiatives are key to addressing a crisis on which there is little time left to act. It is no exaggeration to suggest it could lay the groundwork for humanity to step back from the brink. Much rests on commitments to curtail carbon emissions and restrict warming to 1.5C. The financial structures to facilitate change must be agreed. This must not be our last missed chance to preserve a sustainable planet. COP26 must not go down in history as our last missed chance to secure the planet's future \</doc>

Miche\'e1l Martin said there is no alternative facing the world but to deal with the climate change challenge "quickly and urgently". The Taoiseach said it is "absolutely essential" that every country plays its part in tackling climate change. As world leaders gather for the Cop26 global climate conference in Glasgow, Mr Martin described climate issues as an "existential threat". "I believe, through research technologies we can significantly improve our capacity to reduce emissions in agriculture, but also in transport, energy," Mr Martin said on Sunday. \~ "Every sector of our society will have to contribute to the reduction of emissions. But the the parallel side of that is, it will create opportunities, it will create jobs, it will create a healthier world, and a healthier country in Ireland. "We will transform, for example, active travel; we will take the fossil fuel-powered buses and cars off our streets. One of the big polluters in our streets is fossil fuel driven cars and buses. Advertisement"Just think of what it would be like, in any one of our cities or towns, if we can walk down without that sort of stuff coming out of exhaust pipes.

The Sunday Independent also reported that the climate action plan, to be published next week, includes a scheme to install 200 street electric charge vehicle points a year.

He said that a lot of progress has been made in the last 10 years, and is hopeful a positive outcome can be achieved at the international, climate change conference which began on Sunday. "Obviously, that depends on China's contribution to that and Russia's contribution also," Mr Martin added.

"Politicians listen to an extent, but that needs to translate into physical change. "This is our opportunity now to ring these conversations right to the top of the agenda in world terms." 'Act with the same urgency we saw during Covid' Cop26 . But agreements on ambitious legally-binding targets would be a step in the right direction. "We know that we can find the political will and money to act quickly when we treat something like a crisis, which we have done with Covid but have failed to do with the climate and nature crises. We know putting money towards solutions is a good investment because it will save us the massive costs that are coming on down the line if we don't take action. I want world leaders to act immediately and with the same urgency as they acted during Covid. 'We know we can find the political will and money' \</doc>

The devastating financial cost of natural disasters has been laid bare in a research report that reveals hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and millions were pushed to the brink of starvation. This year was the sixth time in history that global natural catastrophes cost over $100bn ( 88bn) in insurance - the fourth in five years, and all coming in the last decade. That is one of the stark facts outlined in a report from development agency Christian Aid, which analysed the top 10 most financially devastating climate events of 2021, which had an even greater impact in human terms. Authors Dr Kat Kramer and Joe Ware said in Christian Aid's Counting the Cost 2021 - A Year of Climate Breakdown that the top 10 most expensive events financially all cost over $1.5bn dollars of damage, with Hurricane Ida in the US topping the list at $65bn and the floods in Europe $43bn. Unless the world acts rapidly to cut emissions, these kinds of disasters are likely to worsen, state the authors. "Worryingly, despite the pandemic, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a new alltime record, according to a study by the World Meteorological Organisation published in October. And the latest Emissions Gap Report published by the UN's Environment Programme last month showed that the national climate plans which make up the Paris Agreement were not currently on track to ensure global heating is kept below 1.5C," they state. The UN's climate change summit in Glasgow last month, Cop26 , will be redundant if action is not taken as a matter of urgency, states the report. Cop26 Christian Aid said: "The Cop26 summit in Glasgow generated plenty of headlines but without concrete emissions cuts and financial support the world will continue to suffer. One glaring omission from the outcome in Glasgow was a fund to deal with the permanent loss and damage caused by climate change. This is one issue which will need to be addressed at Cop27 in Egypt in 2022." A cold snap in the US in february brought home the extreme impact of climate change, especially in Texas, says the report. "During the storm, Texas suffered a massive power outage that led to shor tages of basic supplies, leaving around 5m people without electricity. "While of f icially there were 215 deaths recorded in Texas, it has been estimated that the true number could be three times higher. "While insured losses have been calculated at $23bn, the total economic impact could be as high as $200bn, according to some estimates." Largely under the radar to many Western people was a flooding catastrophe in South Sudan, described as the worst in decades by the UN. Christian Aid said: "Over the last few months, intense flooding has affected more than 850,000 people in South Sudan, affecting 33 out of 78 counties. The floods are taking place in areas along the Nile and Lol rivers and in the Sudd marshlands. "The United Nations has described the situation as the worst flooding in decades. Many of the impacts faced today by the country are the result of cumulative damages, as this is the third consecutive year with intense flooding. "A report released this year by the World Meteorological Organisation notes that climate change is contributing to food insecurity, poverty, and displacement in Africa through changing precipitation patterns, rising temperatures, and more extreme weather." Closer to home, the flooding in Europe during the summer came as a shock to many observers, but not to climate scientists who have been bracing for such events as the planet warms. "The resulting floods killed at least 240 people and caused widespread damage, with economic losses estimated at more than $43bn. A study by World Weather Attribution concluded that climate change made extreme rainfall events similar to those that led to the floods in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg between 1.2 and 9 times more likely to happen, and that such downpours in the region are now 3%-19% heavier because of human-caused warming. "While the region has decreased its carbon emissions by 31% since 1990, Europe is still responsible for around 18% of all human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Current plans to reduce carbon emissions include reducing them £t least' 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and to become net-zero by 2050. However, the region's climate targets are still insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement, according to Climate Action Tracker," said Christian Aid. \</doc>

MARY LOU MCDONALD was the keynote speaker at the first national energy summit, convened last Tuesday in Croke Park. The summit was conceived to bring together "industry experts and thought leaders from both the public and private sectors to find solutions to the issues facing us in securing our energy supply... to reach our 2030 targets and to meet the demands of our growing and decarbonising economy". No small task, certainly one requiring some vision. And there to show the way into this green, decarbonised future was the Sinn F\'e9in leader. Right now, the planet craves leadership. An existential crisis is already under way with climate change. Parts of the developing world are today suffering the dire effects that are disproportionately attributable to the wealthier countries, including this one. The poorest are getting it in the neck but everybody else will soon enough. Without immediate and transformative action, today's children are en route to a dystopian future. We need leaders to persuade and lead into the necessary transition that is going to be painful and disruptive in order to properly serve those coming after us. Step forward Mary Lou McDonald, putative taoiseach, self-identifying leftwinger, standard bearer for the hopes and dreams of all who feel ill-served by politics as usual. The MC for the energy summit, Ivan Yates, introduced the keynote speaker by saying usually it might be expected that a "green" person would be delivering the speech but that politics requires that "all the stuff you're working on has somebody there to popularise it at every level of society and government". What exactly is a "green person" these days? Yates was presumably referring to a member of the Green Party, but his comment is entirely reflective of a body of opinion in which "this climate thing" is a hobby horse for the Greens rather than an existential crisis for mankind. Mary Lou stepped forward to present her vision. "In the long and winding human story, each generation faces its own unique challenge and today's challenge is how to meet energy needs now and into the future, how we play our part from changing the economic model from extractive to regenerative, and how the energy sector evolves." The speech went on in this vein, visionary, polished, articulate. "We stand at a crossroads and the decisions we make today will shape the future. The stakes are very high for our environment, our planet, out future, our survival," she said. Then she quoted John F Kennedy. "Change is the law of life, those who look only to the past are certain to miss the future. Let's not make that mistake." At the end of it all, the audience was sufficiently appreciative. It had been, by any standards, a fine address, a vision setter. A few hours later, back in the real world, Ms McDonald was addressing the D\'e1il. The subject matter was the issue of people dying through poisoned air quality as a result of the burning of dirty fuel, including turf. Three previous environment ministers shied away from banning the sale of turf. Now Eamon Ryan is attempting to rectify things, in order to save lives and possibly also save bogs that they may continue to be a repository for the carbon that is killing the planet. Perhaps Mr Ryan thought that growing awareness about climate change had engendered a political mood whereby politicians in general might see this as an issue on which to show that they are serious about what lies ahead. So here was Mary Lou at Leader's Questions on Tuesday afternoon, fresh from her Croker call to arms in the name of the planet. "I invite the Taoiseach again to clarify that there will be no ban and that the proposed ban is officially from today ditched and assurance is given to people living in rural Ireland. This is what we need. We need clarity. The Taoiseach should not talk in riddles. He should tell us that the madcap, half-baked, unfair notion advanced by Eamon Ryan is now officially ditched." There you have it. Striving for clean air, attempting to retain a sump for the carbon that is killing the planet, is a madcap idea from this green person, Eamon Ryan. Perhaps, on reflection, Ms McDonald in her morning speech should have quoted not JFK, but Danny Healy-Rae. "Vote for the people, stay with the people, and to hell with the planet and the fellas that say we must save the planet and forget about the people." Mary Lou McDonald is the most obvious, but by no means the only, example of the kind of leading from the rear that typifies the political approach to tackling climate change. When the choice is to either pander or persuade, she will opt for the former, as the latter might take too much work and is no guarantee of success. Her party is against the carbon tax, the one proven - and minor - instrument designed to tackle carbon emissions with a sense of urgency. Why would a party described by its finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty as "centre left" oppose a carbon tax? Because all taxes are nominally unpopular and who wants to be unpopular? So it also goes with wind energy. Earlier this month, Ms McDonald was a keynote speaker at the annual conference of Wind Energy Ireland, the industry body for windfarms. She is all for windfarms offshore, and she told the conference that what was required was an expedited planning process. On that she is correct. Last November though, her party had to withdraw at the last minute a private members' bill that, if successful, would have ended the development of wind energy onshore. Embarrassingly, the bill was scheduled for the same week as COP26 in Glasgow convened. The difference between onshore and offshore windfarms for Sinn F\'e9in? Fish don't vote and there is always bound to be a few first and second preferences from somebody opposing a windfarm onshore. At some point, all of the main parties are going to have to grapple with the crisis. In this respect, Sinn F\'e9in, currently the largest party and in all likelihood the leading component of the next government, has the furthest to travel. Its rise has been largely based on a populist appeal in which difficult problems can be solved without inconveniencing anybody who might vote for the party. Its climate change policy is based on a so-called just transition that promises no disruption or pain for any of its voters. Unfortunately, that won't suffice. Time is not on our side. That may not bother today's leaders, but they will stand indicted by history. \</doc>

Binmen and train drivers are planning to strike just as 25,000 delegates descend on a city where health officials are sweating over superspreader scenarios. Accommodation is so scarce that the going rate for a couch in a family living room is (EURO)120 a night. The host of the event comes across at best glib about the very reason for its existence, and his facetious ramblings about those who take it seriously do little to challenge that perception. Big-name guests have announced they're staying home, while many of the regular cast haven't updated their script since the last time they attended. And someone thought it would be a good idea to ask survival expert Bear Grylls to talk to the young folk among the attendees, as if in tacit acknowledgement that the whole thing is doomed to failure. The UN's make-or-break climate summit COP26 kicks off in Glasgow next week, and if it wasn't for the fact that humanity's future on the planet is at stake, the temptation to poke fun at its inauspicious build-up would be irresistible. But it is hard to overstate the importance of the meeting. Even if it does not achieve any substantial new agreement - and the odds are stacked against that happening - the eyes of a burning world are on it, and any repeat of the side-stepping of genuine action that has characterised so many of its predecessors will take place under a spotlight of greater intensity than ever before. That creates the possibility of public pressure for action - a missing ingredient from previous COPs. There have been protests before, and the youth climate movement has grown in numbers and strength. But though they are loud, those clamouring for action are still relatively few. This COP will be revealing, then, for the interest it generates among the public as much as for the conduct of the heads of state present. Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan this week acknowledged that COP negotiations were somewhat removed from ordinary people. He described the event as a "big circus" and said he was unsure if the "trappings" that surrounded it were helpful. Arguably, that depends on who the ringmaster is. For COP26 , British prime minister Boris Johnson is in the big top, and when it comes to diplomacy, he is no acrobat. He has referred to climate action as "bunny hugging" and suggested anyone who believes that human action can arrest as climate change is "blind with conceit and self-love". "Colourful" is how Eamon Ryan described him. World in his hands: Boris Johnson has been flippant about climate action As for COP26 , the Green leader described it as "the one global structure we have. 'How do you get global agreement with 200 countries ranging from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Vanuatu and islands in the Caribbean?'" he said. "It's far from ideal but I don't see an alternative. For all its failings, it's the only show in town." SO WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? COP stands for Conference of the Parties and this is its 26th annual meeting. The parties are the countries that signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which came into effect in 1995. It was signed by 198 countries, and their leaders or representatives meet every year to review progress and set new goals. The UK is hosting the next meeting in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. WHY IS THIS COP GETTING SO MUCH ATTENTION? It is billed as the "last best chance" to prevent runaway climate change. We're fast running out of time to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning oil and gas, and methane from oil, gas and agriculture - that drive global warming. That leaves us moving ever closer to a level of global temperature rise that will gradually make large parts of the earth uninhabitable because of unbearable heat, chronic drought, higher sea level and extreme weather events. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body that reviews and assesses the science around climate change. Its reports distil the work of thousands of scientists from all over the world. It has been warning with increasing urgency that the global average temperature is rising, that the cause is human activity, and that the impact is going to get worse. Its last report, published in August, warned it was inevitable that temperature rise, which is already more than 1C above pre-industrial or 'normal' levels, would reach 1.5C within 20 years and probably sooner. It says only immediate, dramatic action to reduce emissions will prevent it reaching 2C, when the scale of climate change is expected to be catastrophic and unstoppable. WHY IS 1.5C OR 2C A BIG DEAL? Many plants, crops, insects, bacteria and chemical reactions only activate at a certain temperature or between strict temperature parameters. Mess with that and you upset farming, fishing and food production; you destroy natural habitats and wildlife; you spread diseases that find homes in previously inhospitable regions. Also, the number is only an average. Some regions have much more pronounced temperature increases and some lower. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? If the world stopped all emissions by 2030, temperature rise could most likely be maintained at 1.5C. Realistically, that will not happen, so the next best thing is to cut emissions by as much as possible as fast as possible and hope to keep temperature rise below 2C. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT COP26 ? Countries will be asked to commit to halving their emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and to finalise how they will account for their performance toward those targets. They will be asked to speed up the phasing-out of fossil fuels, with coal an immediate priority; to stop clear-felling forests, which form the atmosphere; to accelerate investment in renewable energy such as wind, solar, wave and tidal power; and to rapidly electrify transport. They will also be expected to collectively provide at least $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries. The money is to help low-income countries already suffering the severe impacts of climate change caused by their rich neighbours and to allow them to invest in clean energy and infrastructure. A fresh emphasis will be placed on protecting and restoring the natural world. WHAT ELSE IS ON THE AGENDA? Carbon trading: how countries and companies that fail to meet emission reduction targets can offset their overshoot by buying allowances from others that come in under budget. Adaptation: how to adapt infrastructure, utilities, warning systems, food production and so on to cope with climate change. Previously an issue for developing countries, the fires, floods and heatwaves that hit richer countries in the past few years have moved it up the agenda. Technology: what role it has or might have in tackling emissions and how much faith and finance should be placed in it. Other topics include: gender and climate change; a dedicated 'loss and damage' fund to provide emergency response to climate-driven catastrophes; the heightened challenges for least developed countries and small island developing states; and, possibly, the challenges for international aviation and shipping. WHO IS ATTENDING? Delegations from all COP countries take part, and the leaders or relevant ministers come for at least a few days. The leaders of two of the top four carbon-polluting countries, China and Russia, have said they will not attend, and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, whose country is the third biggest polluter, is wavering. Hundreds of non-governmental organisations have a standing invitation to attend as observers and to hold side events in the official 'Blue Zone' area. A further 520 sought permission to attend as observers for the first time. Dozens of other organisations, institutions and state and non-state bodies are accredited to hold events in the 'Green Zone' area, which is open to the general public with bookable tickets. WHAT WILL IT ACHIEVE? China and Russia have indicated they are not ready to bring forward their net zero ambitions from 2060, so agreeing a 2050 target will be a struggle. Tying down the details of how the 2050 target will be met by many other countries that have made the pledge but not backed it up with concrete plans will also be difficult. The climate finance goal should be met, and commitments to pull back from investing in new coal mines, and on methane emission cuts, are also expected.

The Social Democrats co-leader R\'f3is\'edn Shortall has accused Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin of "dodging" questions about whether or not Ireland's cattle herd will be reduced, or stabilised, in order to achieve emissions reduction targets. Referencing Ireland signing-up to a global commitment to reduce methane emissions by 30% by the year 2030, Ms Shortall claimed the Taoiseach was signing "commitments at COP which you cop-out of" before the ink has dried on the paper. She said a statement from T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar yesterday in the D\'e1il, that Ireland would reduce its methane emissions by only 10%, suggested that Ireland has "no intention" of trying to achieve the goal. In reply, the Taoiseach accused Ms Shortall of continually making D\'e1il contributions with an "abundance of negativity", which fail to recognise the "step-change" that has been made by the Government through its recent climate change legislation and the creation of the Climate Change Advisory Council. Regarding the COP26 methane pledge, he said the Social Democrat co-leader was being "somewhat disingenuous" because the global commitment of a 30% reduction did not compel individual countries to reach that target. Soc-Dems co-leader HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/RoisinShortall @RoisinShortall asks why the Taoiseach is making commitments at COP26 that "you cop-out of as soon as the ink is dry". HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/MichealMartinTD @MichealMartinTD says the methane deal is a global one and says it is positive so many countries signed up. | More: HYPERLINK https://t.co/p15fkyzcz3 https://t.co/p15fkyzcz3 HYPERLINK https://t.co/wzTo24oIdQ pic.twitter.com/wzTo24oIdQ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1455875370763366405 November 3, 2021 The Taoiseach said different countries would assist reaching the global target in "different ways" with "different mechanisms". He said methane did not just come from cattle, but also landfill and fossil fuel extraction. He said the "positive news" coming from Glasgow was that "so many countries signed up to the pledge" because they recognised the role of methane in "exacerbating" the climate crisis. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate news The Taoiseach said that Ireland was "behind as a country" and that "we have to move very fast as a country to catch up". Martin rejects 'best boys in class' criticism He accused Government of kowtowing to big agri business and said that the young generation should not place faith in politicians. Mr Barry said that COP26 was attended by individuals like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who he said had contributed significantly to global emissions. The Cork North-Central will travel to COP26 tomorrow to protest outside. "You told the conference Ireland will end deforestation by 2030, didn't tell the conference that your Government currently oversees the cutting down of five hectares of trees for every one hectare planted," Mr Barry said. In response, the Taoiseach said that serial objections to "every kind of forest" over the past few years was a significant issue. Mr Martin told the D\'e1\'edl that he did not meet the Jeff Bezos's of the world at COP26 , but rather met a farmer from Dingle. He said that the farmer told him that a group from Dingle were creating an approach across the Dingle peninsula to combat climate change. Sinn F\'e9in must get off the fence on climate change - Taoiseach Meanwhile, the Sinn F\'e9in Leader told the D\'e1il that households have been hammered by increasing fuel and energy bills. Mary Lou McDonald said that the cost of living was now out of control and she accused the Government of making it harder for people with the recent increase in carbon tax. She called on Government to cut VAT on energy bills this winter. The Taoiseach said prices were increasing because of global factors particularly around the supply of gas. Mr Martin said that Sinn F\'e9in must get off the fence on climate change and he said the party was seeking to exploit measures Government took address the global emergency.

THE Prince of Wales has revealed the Queen is "a lot better now" following her bout of Covid as she carried out virtual events meeting diplomats. Charles' comment came during a visit to Essex to formally present Southend with the Letters Patent granting it city status following the death of MP Sir David Amess. Earlier the Queen was photographed hosting virtual audiences with ambassadors for the first time since her Covid diagnosis. The head of state's recovery seemed to be progressing as she appeared via videolink from her Windsor Castle home to speak to dignitaries at Buckingham Palace after postponing a number of similar engagements last week. But during their visit to the UK's newest city, the prince and his wife went on a long walkabout on the seafront and Janice Jacom (64), an admin worker from a local golf course, asked about the Queen's health. She said: "I asked the prince about his mother and he said 'she's a lot better now - it was very mild'. It was a bit worrying as the Queen is getting on a bit, but I think she's absolutely wonderful." On Tuesday the Queen received His Excellency Mr Carles Jordana Madero, who presented the Letters of Recall of his predecessor and his own Letters of Credence as ambassador from the Principality of Andorra to the Court of St James's. He was joined by his wife Soraia Maria Valls Pinilla. She also received His Excellency Mr Kedella Younous Hamidi, who presented his Letters of Credence as ambassador from the Republic of Chad to the Court of St James's. During the two audiences the Queen wore a green dress with a large brooch and her trademark pearls. It comes after a diplomatic reception the monarch was due to host at Windsor Castle on Wednesday was also postponed. The Queen was due to meet hundreds of members of the Diplomatic Corps but Buckingham Palace said on Saturday she had accepted the Foreign Secretary's advice to delay the event. It is understood the decision was made because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. She has a string of high-profile events coming up that she is due to attend, including the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service, also at the Abbey, on March 29. The nation's longest reigning monarch recently spent more than three months resting, on doctors' orders. In the autumn she pulled out of attending the Cop26 climate change summit, the Festival of Remembrance and then the Remembrance Sunday Cenotaph service due to a sprained back. \</doc>

Greta Thunberg famously asked "how dare you?" in a speech in 2019. The emotional question was followed by "we are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth". In the movement towards climate action, is economic growth an opposing force? Does there have to be trade-off between economic growth and climate action? HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP26 # COP26 \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/EUlcVRqpy5 HYPERLINK https://t.co/t38d8GOCpN pic.twitter.com/t38d8GOCpN HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1457616686304174087 November 8, 2021 I asked Ecological Economist Caroline Whyte from the Foundation for the Economic Sustainability whether there has to be trade-off between economic growth and climate action, because when an economy grows it has mostly done so powered by fossil fuels. "I think a good stance to have is to declare independence from economic growth, having a growth neutral stance, instead of focusing on trying to expand the economy or shrink the economy, we're thinking what do we really want from the economy. We want well-being, we want to have an economy that serves everyone\' s needs." "If we manage to do that within environmental constraints, and there is some economic growth, great, but we don't actually need the growth." She added: "For a lot of people growth equals having a nice life, having enough jobs, keeping the economic going, so it's very hard to think could we have an economy without growth." FEASTA or The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability have had a delegation at the COP26 climate summit for the passed week. Ms Whyte said they are trying to spread their idea of Cap Global Carbon - this is limiting carbon emissions at the source of extraction or import, and any money made from the sale of permits for a limited amount of extraction or imports of fossil fuels, would be shared equally among population. "One very exciting thing for me at this COP is we have been hearing that Denmark and Costa Rica are forming a partnership and they are going to be putting a cap on fossil fuel production, so it's not just stopping opening and exploring for new fossil fuels facilities, it's actually phasing out the existing ones too." A positive thing Caroline said is this commitment between Costa Rica and Denmark that they will seek a managed phase-out of oil and gas production to align with Paris agreement goals. "That will affect everything, the whole economy, everything will have to respond to that, there will be less fossil fuels coming into the economy in the first place." The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) will be launched by Costa Rica and Denmark, and they are looking for other countries to join. Ms Whyte said they would love for other countries, and particularly Ireland to join, saying: "It's a real step forward." The Alliance will see members seek "a managed and just phase-out of oil and gas production" to align with Paris agreement goals of keeping warming to 1.5C degrees. In the first week of COP26 , 25 countries, development banks, and national groupings committed to end public finance for most fossil fuels exploration and production oversees by the end of 2022. The alliance goes a step beyond that, as it aims to end all fossil fuel exploration and production within member countries. "It's very concrete and an upstream measure, it effects the supply of fossil fuels to the economy so it's a positive thing," Caroline said. A major goal of COP26 is to end finance for coal and as well as commitments to end its use for power production. However, the International Energy Agency has said that new investment in not just coal but also oil and natural gas needs to end this year if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C degrees. \</doc>

C OP27, Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, November 7-18 2022. Mark the dates. COP26 was still in the throes of petulant penultimate day negotiations but already the Egyptian delegation was graciously accepting its official designation as hosts for the next one. There was less emphasis on the summit venue, a former tiny fishing village transformed into a vast tourist resort where every rental room has access to a pool and nearby white sands caressed by the warm blue Red Sea. Climate negotiations have always been fat with figures - tonnes of carbon, percentage reductions, temperatures, timelines. Dollars and euro don't fit so well with the 'it's all about the science' narrative. But while talks president Alok Sharma said the "currency of compromise" would secure a deal, it was cold, hard cash that repeatedly looked the biggest threat to progress. And that looks set to be the case over the next 12 months, that is until delegates once again pack their suitcases, albeit with linens rather than waterproofs. What became very clear throughout the two weeks in Glasgow is that developing countries and climate-vulnerable nations, which are often one and the same, are fed up with the posturing and promises of rich states on the question of climate finance. A pledge made 12 years ago to provide $100bn ((EURO)87bn) a year for climate adaptation has yet to be honoured. Meanwhile, United States climate envoy John Kerry reminded the talks yesterday that trillions of dollars had been spent on fossil fuel subsidies over the past few years. "That's the definition of insanity. We are feeding the very problem we are here to try and cure," he said. But the fact is the US has been one of the countries stalling on finance. It's not only about the $100bn, or the tentative plans to increase that target as soon as it is reached, or the many billions more developing countries want set aside for "loss and damage". It's about the push to have those funds established as permanent, legal structures so that donations effectively become reparations. Rich nations built their wealth on fossil fuels and, in doing so, imperilled the poor, is the argument. "We want climate justice, not charity," said Dr Saleelmul Huq of the Bangladeshi delegation. That's a shift of emphasis that worries rich nations. Open-ended liability does not sit well with them. But has there been anything at all to take comfort from in these talks? They set out with the core task of securing agreement on future action compatible with the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement which is to keep global temperature rise below 2C and ideally no higher than 1.5C - keep 1.5 alive as the slogan said. It was alive but "on life support", said Friends of the Earth International in their assessment yesterday. Some positive developments lifted moods during the fortnight, such as diverse groups of countries coming together to commit to cutting global methane emissions by 30pc by 2030, to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, end coal burning by 2050, and to stop sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. A new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance came into being, with Ireland one of the 11 founding members. China and the US, the world's top two carbon-polluting countries, put aside four years of acrimony to announce a kind of mutual support pact to egg each other on in reducing emissions. Not everyone was impressed that they used COP26 time to work on their relationship. "This is not the G2," said Alden Meyer of the Climate Action Network. "There are 195 other parties here they need to be talking to." COP26 solidified a change in Irish politics too. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney spoke during the fortnight as if they had been taught their first words by Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan. So close were the Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael representatives in tone and content to the Green Party head of delegation it was like watching "I'm Spartacus" re-enacted. Ryan said he would judge the success or failure of COP26 by the criteria set by his Spanish counterpart, Teresa Ribera, who was looking for solidarity, credibility and ambition. That meant climate justice, transparency and enhanced emission cutting plans. Some progress has been made, but all three will need space among the folded linens. Mr Sharma's mantra for the talks was: "Paris promised, Glasgow must deliver." There is now another panel in the triptych: Egypt must do better. 'It's insanity. We are feeding the very problem we are here to try and cure' \</doc>

Ireland is falling seriously short in its contribution to avert the "gravest crisis facing humanity" and must step up its commitments to "pay its fair share of the devastating costs of climate change", Tr\'f3caire said today. In a policy document issued to mark the start head of the crucial Cop26 Climate Change Summit in Glasgow, the overseas development agency said while Ireland's recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill sets out a target of reducing emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, we remain the secondnhighest emitters per capita in the EU. Emissions Tr\'f3caire said it is unacceptable that the "gap between Ireland and our neighbours is widening at a time when we need to be catching up as fast as possible". By comparison to Ireland the EU has set a target of reducing emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. AdvertisementTr\'f3caire outlines three key areas where collective global action is needed to "stave off a humanitarian disaster fuelled by the impacts of climate change". Firstly, in relation to climate emissions, Tr\'f3caire says success at Cop26 can be achieved only if high-emitting countries show genuine leadership and strongly commit to closing the gap and keeping global temperatures below 1.5C. "While recent progress is welcome, climate policies in place across the world will not keep global warming within the limits that governments agreed in Paris." Secondly Tr\'f3caire says progress on climate finance for adaptation is essential to support countries least responsible for creating the climate change problem, but who suffer the worst of its impacts including sea level rises, floods and droughts. The agency says increased adaptation finance, and the development of a Global Goal for Adaptation as called for in the Paris Agreement, is necessary. Thirdly the agency says we are now in an era of "loss and damage", irreparable harm caused by climate change that has huge costs for people in low-income countries. Cop26 must establish a new financing facility for loss and damage, specifically to support low-income countries. 'Historic opportunity' Tr\'f3caire CEO Caoimhe de Barra said: " Cop26 She added: "The harsh reality is that 2021 was a year of unprecedented climate impacts compounding existing health, poverty and inequality crises. Tr\'f3caire's work across the world has given us first-hand experience of the unequal impact of climate change, especially on women and indigenous peoples who are bearing the brunt of climate impacts. "We support communities to pick up the pieces when climate-related disasters strike. However, the ability of people to bounce back is being severely eroded. There is a limit to what the poorest people can be expected to adapt to. This is a matter of global justice." \</doc>

GRETA Thunberg branded COP26 £ failure' yesterday as she rallied thousands of protesters in Glasgow. In the largest demonstration since the conference began, up to 25,000 mostly young people swarmed into the heart of the city to demand action on climate change. Ms Thunberg's participation drew eager protesters onto the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of the young Swede. In an impassioned address to the crowd at George Square, the environmentalist said: 'It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. 'It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place. 'The people in power can continue to live in their bubble while the world is literally burning, on fire, and while the people living on the front lines are still bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.' She also described the UN climate change summit as a 'two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah'. The march was markedly different from demonstrations by Extinction Rebellion earlier in the week when a heavy police presence outnumbered protesters. Drums, indigenous costumes and banners declaring a climate emergency characterised the march, with people from across the world taking part. Scheduled to set off from Kelvingrove Park at 11am, the march was slightly delayed but made its way to George Square by around 2pm before various speakers took to the stage. The event was organised by youth activist group Fridays For Future, a movement inspired by Ms Thunberg in 2018, which has seen pupils all over the world abandon classes to make their voices heard on climate change. Ms Thunberg was cordoned off from the rest of the crowd by a blue rope held by organisers at the front of the march to keep her away from the public. Demonstrators revelled in the carnival atmosphere, but some questioned the cult of celebrity which follows Ms Thunberg. Rashmi Singh, 20, from the University of Glasgow, said: 'This is great. What's happening on the outside is more important than what's happening on the inside. 'We are the ones that can bring change.' Commenting on Ms Thunberg's presence, she said: 'It's amazing that she's here, but I don't like the idea of her being made into a celebrity. She's a person like you or me. This is about the event uniting people.' Thousands of schoolchildren joined the protest, with many holding placards and chanting slogans calling for change. Parent Michael Murphy, 40, said: 'I wanted to show the kids that this is important. My kids - I want them to be aware. That's the gift I can give them.' Asked about her support for climate action, Mr Murphy's daughter, Eliza, nine, said: 'I love animals, I think they are important.' Fellow marcher Charlie O'Rourke, 14, said his message to global leaders at COP26 was to 'listen'. He said: 'Listen to what [people] want to say. Don't just go for profit. Listen to what the planet needs and things like that.' He marched alongside his mother Cairsty and sister Edith. His mother said: 'I'm basically here for my children and for the generations to come to just show that something has to happen and it has to happen very quickly in order to change the trajectory that we're going on.' Ms O'Rourke, who is from Glasgow and works for the NHS, said she wants to see £ way out of using fossil fuels'. Estimates of how many people marched from the West End to George Square varied from 10,000 to 25,000. Images showed tightly packed crowds stretching more than half a mile but police and the local council could not confirm the number. Police Scotland's assistant chief constable Gary Ritchie hailed the event as a 'success' and said the low number of arrests throughout COP26 - fewer than 20 so far - 'demonstrates the positive engagement between police officers and protesters and the facilitative policing approach to peaceful protest'. Another march through Glasgow today, which will again feature Ms Thunberg, is expected to have at least 50,000 attending, with some estimates as high as 150,000 demonstrators.

Climate change is "without doubt" the most serious challenge in our lifetime, an existential crisis if it is not tackled with action instead of rhetoric. Those were the words of Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin as the United Nations Cop26 climate change event in Glasgow beg an, with world leaders descending on the Scottish city on Monday. Mr Martin told the Irish Examiner that as big as the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit crises were, climate change is even more pressing. The Taoiseach was involved in roundtable discussions with his fellow government leaders in Glasgow, before addressing the world today along with other countries. "It is once in a hundred years that you face a pandemic. But I'm convinced that climate change is an existential crisis. I worry for our younger generations, for children yet to be born, what kind of planet they will be born into if there are very severe weather events, such as droughts and floods. "Climate change is the most serious challenge in our lifetime, without question. This affects the whole food production chain, and I link it with biodiversity. The plus side of it is, if we meet it head-on, we can create a better life for people, safer and healthier. "For example, if we took out all the fossil fuels from our cities, we'd have a remarkable urban environment in terms of health. I think this can happen rapidly, there is nothing worse than going down Patrick Street in Cork and seeing a bus belch out diesel fumes. EV buses can be transformative," he said. Cop26 must be a seminal event in the fight against climate change, Mr Mar tin said. Ireland will more than double its commitment to vulnerable countries to combat climate change, he said. Some $ 100bn a year from 2020 was committed at Cop15 in 2009 to support developing countries to cut their carbon emissions and adapt their economies to deal with climate change. However, that target has fallen well short in the intervening years. Mr Martin said: "Climate finance is a significant area and we'll be signalling on Tuesday that we'll be upping our commitments in respect of that. "The Government has committed to a doubling of our global finance commitments by 2025, and we aim to go above that. Our commitment is stronger as well because it's very focused on adaptation, so those countries can benefit from climate finance. "It is not just rhetoric from us, it is a pledge that is provided for in subsequent budgets. They are trying to get to $100bn and every country has to make its own contribution per capita. We're about $ 20bn off that. The US has upped its pledge at the UN Security Council and we are going to increase ours, to more than double our commitment over the next number of years. "On climate finance, we were around (EURO)93m in 2019. We'll be over (EURO)200m by 2025, for countries in need," he said. Environment Minister Eamon Ryan is expected to take part in the second week of Cop26 , which runs until Friday, November 12. \</doc>

The world is heading for at least 2.4C of global warming as a result of the climate action that countries have pledged to take in the next decade, analysis warns. Cop26 talks between countries' long-term promises and the action they are actually taking. While 140 countries covering 90% of global emissions have announced long-term targets to cut the emissions driving climate change to zero overall (known as net zero) analysts warn the targets risk just being "lip service to real climate action". The analysis warns that emissions-cutting action pledged up to 2030 will leave global greenhouse gases twice as high by the end of the decade as what is needed for the 1.5C limit, leaving the world on track for 2.4C of warming. Countries were required to submit more ambitious 2030 targets in the run-up to Glasgow to get the world on track to limit dangerous warming. But the analysis says the latest targets are still totally inadequate. The current "appalling outlook" is being driven by continuing use of coal and gas, which has seen use increase since the Paris Agreement. This is despite warnings that the fossil fue must be phased out in more advanced economies by 2030 and globally by 2040. The Glasgow talks have seen a slew of announcements on sectors such as cutting methane and halting deforestation, which the analysis says supports important action, but must go beyond existing national targets to have an impact. Climate Analytics chief executive Bill Hare, who is one of the partners in the analysis, said: "The vast majority of 2030 actions and targets are inconsistent with net zero goals: there's a nearly 1C gap between government current policies and their net zero goals. "It's all very well for leaders to claim they have a net zero target, but if they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action. "Glasgow has a serious credibility gap," he said. And he warned: "If the massive 2030 gap cannot be narrowed in Glasgow, governments must agree to come back next year, by Cop27, with new and stronger targets. "Today's leaders need to be held to account for this massive 2030 gap." \</doc>

THE future of Ireland's electricity network is being shaped by 35 families from Kerry's Dingle Peninsula. For the past three years, ESB Networks has been monitoring how the families' electricity demands have changed as they adjust the way they live, work and travel as part of a (EURO)5million project to measure the impact of a low-carbon lifestyle. The Dingle Project has funded retrofitting houses, solar PV panels, heat pumps and electric vehicle (EV) use. Two members of the project are travelling from Dingle to Glasgow by electric car for the COP26 international climate conference this week. They will give the UN climate group an insight into how reducing their families' carbon footprints can impact the electricity system. Engineer Deirdre de Bhail\'eds, one of the group's participants, has a keen interest in sustainable rural development and runs the Dingle Creativity and Innovation Hub. As part of the project, she swapped her petrol people carrier for an EV for a year. A charging point was installed at her home and the costs, amounting to around (EURO)15,000, were covered by ESB Networks. Ms de Bhail\'eds's car use and charging pattern have been monitored and logged to assess in part how overnight charging of higher numbers of EVs will impact the electricity network in the future. 'There is nothing but advantages for me in using an electric car. I am travelling for far less than it costs to get petrol. It is a dramatic reduction,' she said. The people carrier had been costing her (EURO)50 per week to fill with petrol, while the cost of charging her EV over the week comes in at less than (EURO)10. Once the Dingle project comes to an end in December, she intends to use the money she saved over the year of driving the loaned EV to buy her own. But for now she will be driving her Hyundai Kona electric car from Dingle to the Glasgow conference, via Belfast, to prove the viability of EVs to others. Ms de Bhail\'eds said: 'People wonder how they can use an electric vehicle in Dingle when we live so far away from everything. 'I understand that there are challenges with extended journeys. I have driven to Dublin and back in the day without any issues, but when we travel to Glasgow [today, Monday] it will be a good test to prove it can work. And Ms de Bhail\'eds's has news for those attending COP26 , saying: 'The message we want to bring is that rural communities are very dependent on transport and agriculture. Here in the Dingle Peninsula we are preparing and getting organised with solutions to address the impact on the climate of both of these, but we would really like the right policy support to help us find the way to address and to implement this.' In her passenger seat on the way to Glasgow will be dairy farmer Dinny Galvin, 51, whose farm overlooks Dingle Bay at Aglish. Mr Galvin milks 50 cows and tends to around 150 sheep, and has been a farmer since the age of 16. He is one of the project's ambassadors and has made a wide range of changes to the home he shares with wife Nicola and their five children. Mr Galvin wants the savings he has got from the work to their house to be extended to farms all over the country. He is already using a heat exchanger in his dairy farm and wants to put solar PV panels on the roofs of the sheds he uses for the cows and the milking parlour. He set up the West Kerry Dairy Farmers' Sustainable Energy Community, with 100 members, to share ideas on energy saving, and they are dedicated to change. Mr Galvin said: 'Farmers don't want to be in the spotlight and be attacked about all these emissions. Yes, we are contributing to them. But farmers are not the villains we are made out to be. 'We can take control of our own destiny and use solar panel PVs and small low-sight wind turbines to create the energy we need and give the rest to the grid to offset our carbon footprint.' The ESB Networks Dingle Project has installed a range of new technologies across the peninsula since its launch in 2018. There have been full retrofits in three of the five project ambassadors' homes, while 15 EVs were given out to members of the project for a year with an additional two cars made available to some members of the wider community. They have also installed 20 solar PV panels on various properties. The ESB said trialling these technologies and monitoring their use will help them increase reliability of their electrical network and therefore enable faster restoration times during power outages. The project's community engagement manager, Claire McElligott, said: 'It has demonstrated what can be achieved by working closely in collaboration with local communities as we transition to a lowcarbon energy system. What we have seen is a real willingness from the community to change their behaviour and adopt these renewable technologies which, in turn, is reducing their costs and their carbon footprint. 'We wish a safe journey to our two ambassadors who are travelling to COP26 in Glasgow and hope they can share some of their learnings from the Dingle Project with a worldwide audience.' The results of the research gathered over the past three years will be collated by ESB Networks when the project ends. They hope that the lessons learned in west Kerry can be applied throughout the country. The ESB project is part of Dingle Peninsula 2030, an initiative to transform the 'beautiful peninsula into a low-carbon society' by reducing energy demand and using local renewable resources, which could save the area (EURO)8million. Provisional figures from the Environmental Protection Agency showed that last year's emissions reduction was far off the 7% annual target set out in the Government's Climate Action Plan to secure a 51% decrease by 2030. It will also reduce emissions from the residential sector and improve air quality. While (EURO)10million is going towards solar PV panel schemes in the country and a new low-cost loan scheme for residential retrofitting is also being introduced. Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan said: 'Budget 2022 is about supporting our citizens as we begin the transition to a climate-neutral, circular and connected economy and society. 'More than half of our retrofitting grants will go to free energy upgrades for low-income households - helping them save on bills.' HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ie news@dailymail.ie There are no more rows over showers and the immersion. I really feel like I have won the lottery DINNY GALVIN Dairy farmer Mr Galvin, 51, had a heat pump and PV solar panels installed at his home, while also being provided with an electric car during the Dingle Project. Mr Galvin has used a heat pump since 2013, and with wife Nicola and their five children, he said it only costs around (EURO)650 a year to heat the house and water. One of his big recommendations from the Dingle Project is to get an electric car: 'We are getting over 500km for around (EURO)7 instead of (EURO)70-(EURO)80,' he said. He is also saving through solar panel PVs that cut his costs by around (EURO)100 a month. His home was built in 2006, so it was 'pretty well insulated' and did not need retrofitting but the work on their house cost around (EURO)40,000 and was paid for by ESB Networks as part of the project. Mr Galvin thinks farmers should be acting to offset their carbon impact and give back to the environment. He said that farmers may have the key to dealing with crucial environmental issues. He added that many farmers are open to installing small wind turbines, but not bigger ones. 'We are in a very scenic part of the world here and big wind turbines will never happen,' Mr Galvin said. 'The electricity grid in west Kerry is going to come under fierce pressure in the future - there are going to be more electric cars on the road, houses are going to be heated with heat pumps, and there will be a big pull on the grid.' Carol Leary Primary school teacher Ms Leary, 51, heard about the project on the radio and thought that it sounded £mazing'. She shares her home with husband Se\'e1n and their six daughters, and said: 'There was always a constant argument from the oldest to the youngest over hot water. 'They would turn on the immersion and then never turn it off. They'd have hair straighteners, hairdryers plugged in at all times - you name it, they were burning through it.' Now, the Dingle Project and ESB Networks have completed about (EURO)100,000 of work on their home (around half of which was refunded in grants), which was built to specification in 1992. 'There's no more rows over immersion and electric showers, it is great. The house is so cosy. It is constantly warm. It is like I have won the lottery,' Ms Leary said. However, she said the retrofit 'was not without its ups and downs' as they had to move out because of issues with the roof. 'In hindsight, if we had to pay for everything ourselves it would be a lot of money,' Ms Leary recognised. But having seen the benefits and financial returns, she said she would have invested her own money in the PV panels and battery storage. And having the electric vehicle (EV) has been £mazing', she said, adding that 'it is clear that it has produced some of the biggest savings'. Ms Leary stores solar power throughout the day - to charge the car - and changed to a nightrate whereby she is now saving anything up to (EURO)100 a week. On a really sunny day, three quarters of the energy the solar panels produce is being stored. She has an app which shows exactly how much is coming through the solar panels, how much is being used, what is being stored and what is the best time to use it. While they have only been given access to the electric vehicle for a year, she 'found it so good that I have already changed my own diesel car for an electric'. 'I would never go back, I'm electric all the way now. I would highly recommend it. The savings are astronomical,' Ms Leary added. She also said she can do a month in the electric car on just (EURO)50 compared with eight times that - (EURO)400 - in the old car. But she said there are serious problems in the country with charging points and that Dingle has only very recently got a single fast-charging point for electric vehicles. 'It is time for the Government to provide a really good incentive', she added. Rory McKeown World Health Organisation consultant Mr McKeown, 42, said that making the changes to his carbon footprint through the Dingle Project had been £ huge learning curve'. The work that has been done on his home was completed in phases - starting with solar PVs and then a full, deep retrofit to the house. 'We have a '90s bungalow, which wasn't ideal for energy efficiency,' he said. He continued: 'Our building energy rating was at D1 when we moved in, which is on the lower end of the scale.' All of the house's windows and doors were replaced, the walls were cavity-filled, new radiators were fitted and they had the loft space insulated. Mr McKeown said: 'We originally had oil-burner central heating and we could not get rid of it soon enough. I was very happy to see the back of that. 'The oil burner was not great with our kids running around, it didn't feel too safe.' He has two children, Lugh\'e1n, aged five, and Art, aged seven, with his wife Bl\'e1ith\'edn. Before the changes were made, he said, 'everyone would be arguing' over the heating'. Mr McKeown said: 'Simple things that we have done have saved us money. 'We used to use flat-rate electricity but - now we have an electric car - it is much more economical while also reducing our carbon footprint to use a night rate, which eliminates significant costs. 'It is about (EURO)6-(EURO)12 for a charge versus (EURO)60-(EURO)70 for fuel for our two-litre Honda. 'Often carbon footprint can be linked to spending.' The McKeown family are now looking at making the permanent switch to an electric car, but recognise some of the downsides and might keep a petrol car for longer trips 'because the infrastructure for charging just isn't there'. They had only been in their home for six months before the work from the Dingle Project started, and Mr McKeown admitted that they would not have been able to afford to do it themselves. 'The retrofit was a lot easier than what we were expecting. But that was partially down to luck of the draw which allowed them to stay in the home while work was being done,' he said. For average homeowners, he recommended that solar panels and a battery management system to store energy would be most cost-effective, especially for those where retrofitting would be a price stretch. 'The battery management system is brilliant. It stops 50%-70% of the energy produced from solar panels on a sunny day from just spilling back out into the grid', he said. He added that 'before that our behaviour was a bit mad', explaining: 'We were looking at the weather forecasts to see when to put the dishwasher on to use the energy as it was being produced in real time the battery management makes it much easier. 'I've started realising how to run things more efficiently.' 'Will create jobs and cut emissions' 'It has shown what can be achieved' 'I'm on a mission to prove we can do it' \</doc>

Cop26 will generate significant momentum for climate actions across the globe if a detailed and precise rulebook on implementing the landmark Paris Agreement emerges from Glasgow this week, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said yesterday. He said that even if only a majority of countries supported a rulebook reinforced by "the same rules, the same reporting, and the same timelines", it would "build momentum for the decisions you need to take in business, in transport and elsewhere". The Green Party leader, who is heading the Irish delegation at the Glasgow conference, took part in the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue, an initiative aimed at scaling up funding to help countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts. Ireland is to contribute at least EUR 10 million by the end of next year in the form of grants for developing countries, he said. Addressing the adaptation challenge would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, Mr Ryan said. 'High stakes' "I believe it can be done and Ireland is determined to play its part, during the final days of Cop26 this week but also through our efforts at home." Speaking at the same event, US climate envoy John Kerry said the coming week "can define the decade" in terms of global climate action, warning that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. "The stakes here could not be higher," he added. Cop26 would achieve a good outcome if the rulebook was "absolutely precise" on timelines for reviews and how governments report on their "national determined contributions" for reducing emissions. On reducing methane, he agreed it was the fastest and most effective way to cut emissions. While an international pact, backed by the Government, aiming to reduce global methane levels by 30 per cent by 2030 was not a national target, he believed Ireland would be "centrally involved in addressing methane arising from agriculture and land use". Nervous On a push for carbon markets with options for big business to offset emissions in developing countries, he said he would be nervous about that given the chequered history of offsetting. Ireland has joined the National Adaptation Plan Global Network and committed EUR 1 million to help developing countries build national adaptation plans and become climate-resilient. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy announced the funding, which will support small island developing states and the least-developed countries. \</doc>

Intense diplomatic efforts are being made in advance of the Cop26 climate summit to get the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases to increase their ambitions to combat climate change. Led by the US, the UK and Italy, the drive is taking place with a view to ensuring a better chance of limiting the global temperature rise this century to less than 1.5 degrees. A significant potential positive has emerged in the text of a draft G20 communique in circulation among world leaders gathering for talks in Rome, which commits to taking urgent steps to reach that key target of the Paris agreement. G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions. The communique, which is subject to negotiation and changes during today's talks, indicates that the world's 20 richest countries are on track to commit to tackling the existential threat of climate change. This would pave the way for more detailed actions at the UN gathering of almost 200 countries which begins in earnest in Glasgow on Monday. Pope Francis yesterday lent his voice to calls for action rather than mere words at Cop26 . He later met US president Joe Biden at the Vatican, with the climate crisis dominating their discussions. Extreme weather Expectations of a breakthrough at Cop26 are at their highest level since the Paris pact was agreed in 2015. Since then, as extreme weather episodes have intensified and carbon levels in the atmosphere have grown to record levels, climate scientists have underlined the importance of the 1.5 degree cap to limit the risk of environmental catastrophe. It is a key element of the agenda being pushed by the UK government, which is hosting Cop26 . "We acknowledge the key relevance of achieving global net zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by 2050," the statement says, referring to a recommendation by IPCC experts who say the mid-century deadline is crucial to meet the 1.5 degree warming limit. Subject to negotiation However, the 2050 date appears in the draft in brackets, indicating it is still subject to negotiation. Some of the world's biggest polluters say they cannot reach the 2050 target date. China, by far the largest carbon emitter, is aiming for 2060 - as is Russia, which is not part of the G20. The bloc includes Brazil, China, India, Germany, Australia, the US and the EU. The draft communique reaffirms a commitment to "phase out and rationalise" fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and to curb coal-powered electricity generation. They also pledge to cut collective emissions of methane "substantially" by 2030. This deadline is also in brackets. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the fall of the Roman Empire showed how quickly civilisations can collapse as he urged G20 leaders to go faster on tackling climate change. Speaking to reporters on his flight to the G20 summit, he said it showed humanity "can go backwards as well as forwards". "When things start to go wrong, they can go wrong at extraordinary speed," he added. \</doc>

For more than two decades, promoters and purveyors of nuclear energy felt shunned at UN climate change conferences. At the COP26 The spectre of Chernobyl and Fukushima, along with the enduring problem of nuclear waste, kept energy generated by splitting atoms on the sidelines, even if that energy was virtually carbon free. But as the climate crisis deepens and the need to transition away from fossil fuels becomes urgent, attitudes may be shifting. "Nuclear energy is part of the solution to global warming, there's no way around it," said Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in an interview. It already accounts for a quarter of "clean", that is, carbon-free, energy worldwide, and Mr Grossi said this COP is the first where it has "had a seat at the table". To have even a 50/50 chance of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the threshold for dangerous tipping points that could trigger runaway warming, global greenhouse emissions must be slashed by almost half within a decade, scientists say. But things are still moving in the wrong direction: a report on Thursday said emissions in 2021 are approaching record levels.

That is helping refocus attention on nuclear. COP26 sporting a T-shirt saying "Let's Talk Nuclear". "There was a belief it was not needed. Now many countries are looking at the feasibility, especially with the rise in gas prices." From the time he took the IAEA's helm nearly two years ago, Grossi, an Argentine diplomat, has been a tireless advocate for the industry. At his first COP in Madrid he "went in spite of the general assumption that nuclear would not be welcome". On the contrary in Glasgow, where nearly 200 countries are still trying to put flesh on the bone of the 2015 Paris Agreement, he said "nuclear is not only welcome, but is generating a lot of interest". Grossi argues that the technology can not only speed the transition away from fossil fuels, but also power research on technologies needed for adapting to climate impacts, from finding drought-resistant crops to eradicating mosquitoes. He acknowledges that it carries serious risks. The industry also has yet to find a way to dispose of nuclear waste, which remains highly radioactive for thousands of years. But Grossi said these issues are not disqualifying, arguing that statistically the technology has fewer negative consequences than many other forms of energy. It could also be a complement to renewables. "Nuclear energy goes on and on for the entire year, it never stops," he said. Even so, with prolonged construction times, many argue that it is too late to build enough nuclear capacity to effectively join the battle against global warming. But Grossi said he thinks part of the answer lies in keeping existing reactors up and running. Many power plants designed to run for 40 years are now licensed for 60 years under strict national safety standards supervised by the IAEA, he said. "What could be more efficient than a facility that you build that gives you energy for close to 100 years?" he said. He acknowledged that plants running that long might be a "bit of a provocation". In their projections on how to limit the rise in global temperatures and satisfy a growing global demand for energy at the same time, the IEA takes all non-carbon sources on board. The UN's climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, has also given a place to nuclear in its models, even as it says that its deployment "could be limited by social preferences". Indeed, attitudes towards nuclear power vary sharply across nations. While New Zealand and Germany are opposed, India is in discussions with French energy giant EDF to build what would be the largest nuclear power plant in the world. Meanwhile, both Canada and the United States are developing so-called "small modular reactors", although only Russia has put into operation a floating reactor using this technology. Price is also not the barrier it used to be, said Grossi. "Countries see in smaller units a very interesting alternative, which is not in the range of billions but of hundreds of millions," he said. "When it comes to energy projects, this is quite affordable." \</doc>

Leaked documents show that the biggest producers of oil, coal and beef are lobbying scientists intensely to try to strip a landmark climate report of recommendations that threaten their interests. Australia, Saudi Arabia and Japan are among the countries pressuring the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to remove or weaken the conclusion that the world needs to phase out fossil fuels. The documents have been obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace's team of investigative journalists, and the BBC. They show how Australia, for example, rejected the widely-accepted science that eliminating coal-fired power stations was one of the most important ways of reducing greenhouse gases. Australia is the world's fifth largest coal producer. Rather than phasing out fossil fuels, Saudi Arabia's approach involves relying on unproven technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere after fuels are burned. Brazil and Argentina have also reportedly made comments pressing the report's authors to delete messages about the climate benefits of undertaking a "plant-based" diet, despite a study in 2018 finding that moving to a meat-free diet could cut food land use, and reduce emissions by 49%. The IPCC report is due to be published next year. The leak comes ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) which gets under way in Glasgow later this month. Some 30,000 delegates, including world leaders, are due in the Scottish city for what is billed as a make-or-break summit to strengthen commitments to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius - preferably 1.5C. Greenpeace Chief Scientist Dr Doug Parr said the organisation felt it was important to publish the documents to show other countries what they are dealing with ahead of the COP26 negotiations. Indian PM Modi to attend COP26 conference India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, it has emerged. Mr Modi will join other world leaders including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the talks, although the leaders of some major polluting countries are set to the skip the event. "India play an important role in this and the prime minister has had a number of conversations with Modi on the importance of climate change, so we look forward to discussing it with him further."

What was the goal of COP26 ? The 196-nation summit aimed to keep alive the commitment to halt global warming at 1.5C, compared to pre-industrial levels, set in Paris six years ago. So, is 1.5C alive? Yes. Just. As COP president Alok Sharma said in his closing remarks: 'I think today we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C within reach.' But the pledges on the table at COP26 mean global warming could rise to 2.4C, although more optimistic readings put it as low as 1.8C. The Glasgow Climate Pact asked governments to strengthen those pledges next year. But 1.5C is an unsafe level of global warming - with scientists estimating that around 70% of the world's coral reefs will die if the earth warms this much. And what about coal? For the first time, the pact asks countries to 'phase down' coal - signalling the beginning of the end for coal power, the biggest source of greenhouse gases. A draft said coal should be 'phased out', but this was vetoed by India and China - to the dismay of campaigners. What else does the deal say? It urges countries to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Many states such as Saudi Arabia and India keep fuel costs artificially low, encouraging people to use them. For the first time, the deal also raises the topic of 'loss and damage' - which would mean that the rich countries who have heated up the planet with greenhouse gases for years will have to pay compensation to the poorer countries that are now suffering from the impacts. \</doc>

Leaders of the world's biggest economies made a compromise commitment to reach carbon neutrality "by or around mid-century" as they wrapped up a two-day summit that was laying the groundwork for the UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. According to the final communique, the Group of 20 leaders also agreed to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad, but set no target for phasing out coal domestically, a clear nod to coal-dependent countries including China and India and a blow to Britain which had hoped for more solid commitments ahead of the Glasgow meeting. The Group of 20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and summit host Italy had been looking for solid targets on how to reduce emissions while helping poor countries deal with the impact of rising temperatures. AdvertisementWithout them, momentum could be lost for the larger annual talks that officially opened Sunday in Glasgow and where countries from around the globe will be represented, including poor ones most vulnerable to rising seas, desertification and other effects. Italian premier Mario Draghi told the leaders going into the final working session that they needed both to set long-term goals and make short-term changes to reach them. "We must accelerate the phasing-out of coal and invest more in renewable energy," he said. "We also need to make sure that we use available resources wisely, which means that we should become able to adapt our technologies and also our lifestyles to this new world." According to the communique, the G20 reaffirmed past commitments by rich countries to mobilise 100 billion US dollars annually to help poorer countries cope with climate change, and committed to scaling up financing for helping them adapt. The sticking point remained the deadline to reach carbon neutrality or "net zero" emissions, meaning a balance between greenhouse gases added to and removed from the atmosphere. Going into the summit Italy had all-but conceded it would only be able to secure commitments to reach net-zero emissions "by mid-century", rather than a specific year.

A French official said "mid-century" meant 2050 in the strict sense "but given the diversity of the G20 countries ... it means everyone agrees to a common goal while providing a bit of flexibility to take into account national diversity". Speaking on condition of anonymity, the French official cited top carbon polluters China and India, as well as Indonesia. Some countries have set 2050 as their deadline for net zero emissions, while China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are aiming for 2060. The future of coal, a key source of greenhouse gas emissions, has been one of the hardest things for the G20 to agree on. At the Rome summit, leaders agreed to "put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021." That refers to financial support for building coal plants abroad, something Western countries have been moving away from and major Asian economies are now doing the same: Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the UN General Assembly last month that Beijing would stop funding such projects, and Japan and South Korea made similar commitments earlier in the year. AdvertisementThe failure of the G20 to set a target for phasing out domestic coal use was a blow to Britain, which had hoping there would be progress on the issue at Cop26 . The spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the G20 communique "was never meant to be the main lever in order to secure commitments on climate change", which would be hammered out at the Glasgow summit. He said the U.K. would continue to push for "ambitious commitments" on coal. Youth climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate issued an open letter to the media as the G-20 was wrapping up, stressing three fundamental aspects of the climate crisis that often are downplayed: that time is running out, that any solution must provide justice to the people most affected by climate change, and that the biggest polluters often hide behind incomplete statistics about their true emissions. "The climate crisis is only going to become more urgent. "We can still avoid the worst consequences, we can still turn this around. "But not if we continue like today," they wrote, just weeks after Ms Thunberg shamed global leaders for their "blah blah blah" rhetoric during a youth climate summit in Milan. AdvertisementThe Prince of Wales addressed the G20 on Sunday morning and urged leaders to listen to young people who are inheriting the warming Earth, warning that "it is quite literally the last-chance saloon". "It is impossible not to hear the despairing voices of young people who see you as the stewards of the planet, holding the viability of their future in your hands," Charles said. \</doc>

Negotiators took the UN climate talks in Scotland into an extra day on Saturday, after two long weeks of wrangling, to try to agree a deal that would give the world a realistic shot at avoiding the worst effects of global warming. Alok Sharma, the British conference president, said he expected Cop26 to close on Saturday afternoon with a deal between the almost 200 countries present, ranging from coal- and gas-fuelled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. China, the biggest current emitter of greenhouse gases, and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, were among a group of countries seeking to prevent the final deal including language that opposes subsidies for fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming, two sources told Reuters on Friday. AdvertisementHowever, the new draft, published by the United Nations, continued to single out fossil fuels - something no UN climate conference has yet succeeded in doing. It also urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. The meeting's overarching aim is to keep within reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that to go beyond that limit would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophic weather extremes, including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering. But national emissions-cutting pledges made so far would cap the average global temperature rise at only 2.4 Celsius. While there is little chance of that gap being closed in Glasgow, Sharma said he hoped the final Cop26 deal would pave the way for deeper cuts. Wait and see US climate envoy John Kerry struck a positive note when asked late Friday whether he agreed with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg that Cop26 was a "festival for 'business as usual'". "Obviously I don't agree," he replied, "and I think you will see that when you see what happens." AdvertisementKerry helped to revive flagging hopes for the conference when he and Chinese negotiator Xie Zhenhua on Thursday announced the countries would ramp up efforts to preserve forests, needed to soak up and hold in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and to cut output of the second-most important greenhouse gas, methane. The US-China agreement requires both countries to set aside mutual tensions over other political differences. The White House said on Friday that US president Joe Biden, who has succeeded in pushing $555 billion ((EURO)485 billion) in climate measures through Congress in a post-pandemic recovery programme, will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday night, US time. Ambition and finance The newest draft of what many hope will be the final Glasgow agreement also retained a significant demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than doing so every five years as they are currently required. Money remains one of the thorniest issues to resolve, with developing countries pushing for tougher rules to ensure that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, offer more cash to help them adapt to its consequences. Rich countries have failed to meet a 12-year-old goal to provide $100 billion a year in so-called "climate finance" by 2020, undermining trust and making some developing countries more reluctant to curb their emissions. The latest draft said rich countries should double the funding set aside for adaptation by 2025, from 2019 levels. \</doc>

Government negotiators from nearly 200 countries have adopted a new deal on climate action after a last-minute intervention by India to water down the language on cutting emissions from coal. Several countries including small island states said they were deeply disappointed by the move to "phase down," rather than "phase out" coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Other nations described the revision as odious and against the rules, but said it was something they had to accept to bring the two weeks of COP26 talks in Glasgow to a close. Before India succeeded in getting the change made, nation after nation talked about the final provisions not going far or fast enough but a compromise was better than nothing and provided progress, if not success. The deal calls for an eventual end of some coal power and of fossil fuel subsidies. It also includes enough financial incentives to almost satisfy poorer nations that anticipate harms from climate change out of proportion with their roles in causing it. Most importantly, negotiators said, it preserves the overarching goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. Ahead of the talks in Scotland, the United Nations had set three criteria for success - and none of them were achieved. Those criteria included pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030, $100bn ((EURO)87bn) in financial aid from rich nations to poor, and ensuring half of the money went to helping the developing world adapt to the worst effects of climate change. The draft agreement says big carbon polluting nations have to come back and submit stronger emission cutting pledges by the end of 2022. A rich-poor divide widened at the summit in recent days, with developing nations complaining about not being heard. But when the representative from Guinea, speaking for 77 poorer nations and China, said his group could live with the general results, negotiators applauded. The Chinese delegation also said it was fine with the positions that would come out of a Glasgow in a final conference agreement. But Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav potentially threw a spanner in the works when he argued against a provision on phasing out coal, saying developing countries were "entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels." Mr Yadav blamed "unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns" in rich countries for causing global warming. Iran said it supported India on not being so tough on fossil fuels. A frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the EU's climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations. "For heaven's sake, don't kill this moment," Mr Timmermans pleaded. "Please embrace this text so that we bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren." US climate envoy John Kerry expressed support for the most recent provisions, calling the early draft a "powerful statement." Mr Kerry and several other negotiators noted that good compromises leave everyone slightly unsatisfied. "Not everyone in public life ... gets to make choices about life and death. Not everyone gets to make choices that actually affect an entire planet. "We here are privileged today to do exactly that," he said. Gabon's delegation indicated it couldn't leave Glasgow without "scaled up" and predictable assurances for more money to help poorer nations adapt to the worst effects of global warming. Mr Kerry tried to assure Gabon's representatives the United States would redouble its efforts on adaptation finance. Small island nations that are vulnerable to catastrophic effects of climate change and had pushed for bolder actions in Glasgow said they were satisfied with the spirit of compromise, if not outcome of the talks. "I'd like to note that this progress is not in line with the urgency and scale with the problem at hand.'' Ireland's Environment Minister Eamon Ryan also expressed his disappointment with the last-minute coal deal. "But we had to agree on a deal," he tweeted last night. "We can no longer delay. It brings momentum at home and has to deliver climate justice for the world." \</doc>

Young people and activists across Ireland made their way to Scotland to join thousands of discontented voices around the Cop26 event in Glasgow. They joined young people from all over the world - including Greta Thunberg, Vanessa Nakate, and Alexandria Villase\'f1or, whose relentless campaigning on environmental issues has captured the attention of young people like no other issue previously. There was also a sizeable contingent of older protesters on hand to join in solidarity with their younger counterparts, as frustration at the perceived lip service and lack of action from the United Nations climate change conference reached a crescendo. Cork North Central TD Mick Barry was among those who attended, tweeting: "If I was a big capitalist or a billionaire I'd be getting worried about this generation. More of more of the young are beginning to point the finger at capitalism [sic]." Just after 5am yesterday, Cop26 organisers warned attendees that protests would disrupt their plans for the weekend, including those planning to fly in and out of 10 UK airports, including Glasgow. On a day themed around youth action, Cop26 organisers said that, inside the Scottish Event Campus (which has locked out activists and campaigners all week)," young climate leaders came together in Glasgow today with negotiators, officials and ministers from across the world, making their voices heard and demanding the action needed to prevent catastrophic climate change in our life times". The day was co-chaired by Youngo, the official children's and youth constidtuency of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Youngo presented the Coy16 global youth position statement, representing the views of more than 40,000 young climate leaders worldwide. Youngo's Heeta Lakhani and Marie-Claire Graf said: "We successfully profiled global youth voices through the Coy16 global youth statement and brought together four generations to share best-practice examples of achieving climate justice collectively." Rather than acknowledging the burgeoning anger of young people from all over the world, Nadhim Zahawi, the UK's education secretary, suggested those taking part in the protests could face fines for missing school. The response from Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, to the young marchers echoed the education secretary. A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said young people missing school to attend the demonstration was "extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning". "We do understand why young people feel so strongly about climate change, and we want to see them use that passion and turn it into action. That's exactly why we're empowering them through our new virtual national education park, climate leaders awards, and giving teachers the tools to put climate change at the heart of the curriculum, and we're backing this up with our continued pledge to cut the carbon foot print of school buildings as well," the spokesperson said. Yesterday's protest comes ahead of today's marches, where tens of thousands of people are again expected in Glasgow, with other marches in Dublin, and cities across the world.

THE energy sector will face the biggest carbon emissions reduction target in the Government's Climate Action Plan, which is set to be launched today. Construction and transport sectors will also have to meet major cuts to their carbon output, along with enterprise and agriculture. Under the Cabinet-agreed plan on the Environment and Climate Change last night - which aims to cut Ireland's emissions by 51% by 2030 - the energy sector will be tasked with a reduction of 62% to 81% through a greater focus on generating renewable energy. Carbon emissions in construction will have to be reduced to between 44% and 56% in the next eight years under the plan, with a major emphasis being placed on the of retrofitting homes. The Climate Action plan outlines that the transport sector will have to cut its emissions by between 42% and 50% through measures including going electric with Ireland's public transport fleet, while enterprise has a reduction target of between 29% and 41%. After much heated debate over the plan to cut emissions in Ireland's agriculture sector, the goal for the industry has been set to between 22% and 30%. The full plan will be unveiled by Green Party leader and Environment and Climate Minister Eamon Ryan today. Meanwhile, the Taoiseach has accused Sinn F\'e9in of making an 'each-way bet' on climate change after the party criticised the carbon tax. Sinn F\'e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald told the D\'e1il that an increase in the carbon tax has made it 'harder for people to light and fuel their homes', and called on the Government to remove VAT on energy bills for the winter months. In response, Miche\'e1l Martin accused her party of wanting it both ways. 'I want to say to you, in terms of your comments on carbon tax, it's about time you got off the fence on climate change,' he said. 'You're having an each-way bet every week, every month, for the last number of years on the issue of climate and on the issue of carbon tax... I think that's so disingenuous from you, that you continually seek to exploit measures we've taken which are not popular, I accept, but which are very important in terms of dealing with the climate emergency facing the globe and facing this country. 'We know we have taken measures already that help people who are on low incomes, in terms of their fuel poverty, through the measures we've taken, through the increased taxation,' he said. He added global supply issues, not the carbon tax, are responsible for recent increases in costs.

A week ago, Dublin actor and former MMA star Cathal Pendred posted a photo of himself on social media wearing a graduation cap and gown. He had just graduated with a master's degree in climate change from Dublin City University and tweeted that he had taken the course because "when it comes to preserving our environment, we need to do better and we can do better". Qualifications like Pendred's - and the new climate action and sustainable development subject added to the Leaving Cert in a shake-up of the exam cycle last week - will not just better equip their recipients to deal with climate change: they are also prized among employers engaged in a battle for talent amid the transition to a green economy. As the environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials of companies come under more scrutiny than ever from governments, regulators, investors, customers and employees, the shiny job field du jour is sustainability and ESG. A cursory glance at LinkedIn reveals 1,210 Irish job vacancies in the area being advertised last week by companies including Glanbia, Aer Lingus, Ikea, Twitter and Brown Thomas Arnotts. Indeed, businesses are on a hiring spree after climate change, social justice and governance issues soared to the top of the corporate agenda during the pandemic and the run-up to the UN Climate Change conference ( COP26 ) in November and as a raft of EU disclosure regulations are introduced. A report by global recruiter Robert Walters found there was a record 1,600 new jobs in ESG and sustainability in Ireland in 2021, with the trend expected to accelerate this year. The biggest recruiters are the professional services, financial services, and technology firms. Suzanne Feeney, country manager for Robert Walters Ireland, said: "The volume of recruitment in the first quarter of this year was far ahead of this time last year. The skills and expertise in this area are very much in demand and in short supply so that means candidates with experience are attracting counter offers. "There's also a greater focus on attracting candidates from other sectors and countries." Trayc Keevans, from recruiter Morgan McKinley, says sustainability analysts with at least five years' experience are now commanding salaries of between (EURO)80,000 and (EURO)100,000, while portfolio managers with ESG experience can earn anything from (EURO)90,000 to (EURO)170,000 at investment management, wealth management and stockbroking firms. There has been a 25pc increase in the number of sustainability analysts working in Ireland in the last 18 months but the plethora of job offers on the table means more of them are moving for better pay and conditions. "A lot of people are trying to get into this space. But this is more hearts than minds. We're seeing a lot of people transition from different areas, having done qualifications in environmental studies, energy management systems and even philosophy." A boom in ESG investing has also created a surge in demand for talent at asset managers, pension funds, investment and retail banks, private equity firms, and international insurance firms, according to Judith Kelly, the director of business development and operations at financial recruiter FK International. Karen O'Regan, strategy lead at Accenture, says: "Investors are increasingly looking at ESG performance and investing in ESG assets. Global ESG assets are on track to exceed $53tn by 2025 - more than a third of all projected total assets under management." Peter Smith, investment director at Aviva Investors, says: "In the UK, six out of every 10 pounds last year went into global ESG funds and these funds all need to be backed up by managers to show their credibility." "We noticed that within the space of six months, ESG and sustainable finance was elevated from being a medium-term 'to do' priority for most businesses to rocketing to the top of every board agenda," says Kelly. "I recognised that all businesses would have to build ESG and sustainability frameworks into their business models and that, in time, these models would be audited by investors and regulators. This shake-up would require companies across the board to invest in talented people in order to meet their ESG and sustainable finance objectives." Kelly says a record number of new jobs were filled in ESG and sustainability-related roles in the finance sector last year and she expects "a further surge" throughout 2022. Because there is a shortage of these skills, some employers are having to look outside the finance sector for new hires. "As this is a relatively new area and the talent pool is still small, businesses are having to think more innovatively about hiring tactics," she says. \</doc>

Climate change is not gender neutral and its impacts amplify existing inequality, writes Rhoda Jennings in her Cop26 diary Cop26 . It is a mild, sunny day in Glasgow and the queues to get into the Scottish Event Centre, locally christened the Armadillo, show no signs of slowing. The world leaders have left but the ministers are on site, negotiating the finer points of the promises made last week. This is where the work really gets done. The mood has changed. Last week ended on an optimistic note. We were on target for a reduction in global warming of 1.8C by 2100 if all countries abided by the commitments made in the summit. This week, after a more careful analysis of the promises, this has been re-estimated at a 2.4C increase to temperatures by 2100, far from the 2C reduction target, not to mention the aspirational 1.5C. Some of the promises were double-counted, already contained in national plans submitted to the UN. The detail in the plans is also lacking. Cop26 president Alok Sharma gives a warning to delegates that there is a lot of work to do before the conference ends today, adding that there is "still too far between us". Laurence Tubiana, architect of the Paris Agreement, which lays down the targets we are now trying to meet, was unequivocal: "Greenwashing is the new climate denial. We need to be honest and truthful to make these commitments a reality." To add to the woes, the climate finance target is also predicted to be missed by several million. Funding under this target can assist the implementation of mitigation measures (ways to reduce emissions) or assist adaptation (ways to cope with the impact of climate change). The funding of mitigation measures is being favoured, instead of splitting the funding between the two areas. There is also a growing tension around the position on 'loss and damage'. This is a fund and a mechanism to cover damage caused by climate change, or as one minister from the Dominican Republic succinctly put it, "death and destruction". There is a fear that to contribute to this fund is an admission of liability. The nuances and conditions attached to the funding are frustrating developing nations and small island developing states. To highlight the very real threat to his home, the foreign minister of Tuvalu, a Pacific Island nation, recorded a speech while standing knee-deep in water. "We are sinking," he said. "So is everyone else." To raise awareness of the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls around the world, a 3.5m puppet of a young Syrian refugee named Little Amal arrived at Cop26 after walking 8000km from the Syrian border. She shook hands with attendees and took centre stage alongside politicians and campaigners. Climate change is not gender neutral and its impacts amplify existing inequality. Women are often tasked with household and caring duties and in developing nations it is the women who work the land in order to support the family. Extreme weather events caused by climate change disproportionately affect their lives. Failing crops and the burden of household duties means that there is less time and money for girls to attend school, excluding them at an early stage from the education system. Armed conflict and farmer herder conflict (conflict over contested land use) are both exacerbated by climate change. Figures from a UN report indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. With a focus on liberating women to play more of a role in the economy, Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, rechristened the 'Build Back Better Bill' currently being deliberated in Congress as the 'Build Back Better with Women Bill'. She reaffirmed the US' commitment to climate change and the need to recognise the centrality of women in the climate fight, finishing her speech with "when women succeed, the world succeeds". Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, opened her speech by stating that climate change must be seen as a feminist issue, but it was Tarcila Rivera Xea, a Quechua activist and advocate for indigenous rights, who cut through the sweeping soundbites and captured true sentiment, by stating: "Women are not pleading to be supported, they are demanding to be empowered."

National plans by countries to tackle the climate crisis leave the world on track for temperature rises of 2.7C, the United Nations has warned. A report by the UN Climate Change body assessed all the national plans that have been put forward by countries to cut emissions over the next decade as part of efforts to meet international targets to curb dangerous warming. Published in the run-up to the latest UN climate summit, it confirms that countries are nowhere near what the science says the world needs to be to limit rising temperatures to globally-agreed goals. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa urged countries to redouble their climate efforts or face a\~"destabilised world and endless suffering" as a result of the crisis. Countries attending the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are under pressure to up their ambition on tackling emissions to deliver on promises made in the global climate treaty, the Paris Agreement, secured six\~years ago. AdvertisementUnder the Paris Agreement, countries committed to holding global temperature rises to "well below" 2C and to try to keep warming to 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But the national plans countries forward for the deal left the world well off-track for the 1.5C and 2C limits, so they have had to submit new or updated plans for action up to 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), by Cop26 . Keeping temperatures to the 1.5C limit requires cutting emissions by 45 per cent on 2010 levels by 2030, while meeting the 2C goal requires cuts of 25 per cent. The latest update on national action plans from countries includes 116 new or updated NDCs submitted by 143 countries, including one covering all 27 EU countries, in the run-up to Cop26 . Of those, 71 have a goal to reach net-zero emissions or carbon neutrality by around mid-century, which would deliver deep cuts to the overall emissions of that group by 2050. However, an assessment of all the available plans from all 192 parties to the UN climate process shows the world is set to see a 16 per cent increase in global greenhouse emissions by 2030 on 2010 levels. AdvertisementThat would put the planet on track for temperature rises of 2.7C by the end of the century, without quick action to change direction. Ms Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), said the new and updated action plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions represent a commitment to acting on climate change. "At the same time, the message from this update is loud and clear: parties must urgently redouble their climate efforts if they are to prevent global temperature increases beyond the Paris Agreement's goal of well below 2C, ideally 1.5C, by the end of the century. "Overshooting the temperature goals will lead to a destabilised world and endless suffering, especially among those who have contributed the least to the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere." The report from UN Climate Change has been produced so countries have the most up-to-date information before Cop26 , and includes extra plans put forward since a full analysis on the issue in September. AdvertisementMs Espinosa said the update confirmed what the earlier report showed: "That we are nowhere near where science says we should be." Incoming Cop26 President Alok Sharma said the latest report made clear that "to protect the world from the most devastating impacts of climate change, countries must take more ambitious action on emissions, and they must act now". He said that if countries delivered on their 2030 promises and on their commitments to cut emissions to net-zero, it could limit temperature rises to just over 2C, compared to below 4C under the original Paris plans. \</doc>

A FUND to encourage companies to be innovative on climate change has (EURO)1 million in grants to give away. The 'Dragons' Den for climate' applies specifically to ideas that can be applied in developing countries. It comes a week after a major report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that at least 3.3 billion people were already suffering serious effects from climate change. The vast majority of those are in poor and developing countries least equipped to deal with the consequences. The report said while efforts to bring climate change under control must continue, much more attention was now needed for adaptation measures to help people, nature, food systems, infrastructure and economies cope with the impacts already evident. Overseas Aid Minister Colm Brophy said the new Irish Aid Enterprise Fund for International Climate Action would help small Irish companies with solid business ideas that could help but lacked funding get their project into production. Projects can range from physical devices to software, from an individualised solution for a particular need to something that can be replicated many times for different circumstances. "We're trying to be as open and as broad as we can on this," the minister said. "We'll look at any type of project that a commercial organisation would be interested in developing that would have a direct benefit in terms of climate action. "For want of a better description, it's a Dragons' Den for small Irish companies that have a great project in the climate area and want to come in and make their pitch to the experts. "We will give them start-up capital to get them out there and get them under way." The judges will also be on the look-out for projects that work with and develop local talent on the ground in developing countries, and that have a strong gender equity focus. The number of grants awarded will depend on the projects. The maximum single grant available is (EURO)300,000 so there may be a small number of large awards or a mix of large and small. An information day for prospective applicants will be held on March 24 and applications close at the end of April. Awards are expected to be made during the summer. "The key message that came through is that we are running out of time at an ever-faster rate." He said implementation of the promises made at last year's UN climate summit, COP26 , must not be abandoned despite the many other issues vying for attention. "Sustained implementation is vital. That is difficult on the ground," he said. "As you can see, the world gets buffeted. Whether it's a pandemic or a horrendous war in Ukraine, the focus of world leaders, the focus of international organisations and institutions, shifts. "But the importance of the next 10 years has been brought home to us by that report. "If we're not willing to put in place the type of measures in terms of societal change, then the situation we're facing could be considerably worse than what we envisaged even a short while ago." \</doc>

World leaders must commit to ending all new fossil fuel projects at the COP26 climate summit, climate activist Vanessa Nakate has said. On the eve of the UN summit, the Ugandan environmentalist said that plans to tackle the climate crisis must not leave room for more oil and gas development. The Independent reported that 70 of the world's leading climate scientists have called for UK prime minister Boris Johnson to stop all new investment in fossil fuels ahead of the summit. An influential report from the world's energy watchdog released in May said there can be no further fossil fuel expansion anywhere if global climate targets are to be met. "My message to leaders is that their words should really match their actions," the 24-year-old said. "If leaders are going to talk about going net zero, then they have to start now. They must put an end to investment in new fossil fuel projects. Something that I always say is that we can't eat coal, we can't drink oil and we cannot breathe so-called natural gas." The two-week summit will see 25,000 people descend on Glasgow to negotiate a path for getting the world on track to meeting its climate goals. The mechanics of the conference mean that a commitment to end new fossil fuel projects will not feature in a final deal between countries. However, there are growing hopes among some experts that many countries and institutions will come together at the fringes of the event to reach agreements to stop the development of new coal, oil and gas. A recent study found that 60pc of existing oil and gas reserves must be left in the ground if the world is to have even half a chance of preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C - the international aspiration set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. "We want leaders to rise up for the people and for the planet," said Ms Nakate. "The climate crisis is more than statistics, it's about people," she said. "I hope to get people to understand what the climate crisis does to individuals, families and communities. I hope they can understand the interconnections between the climate crisis and other issues like poverty eradication, gender equality and peace-building." She added that wealthier nations must recognise this by finally meeting promises first made in 2009 to provide $100bn in climate funds to help poorer countries tackle and cope with rising emissions. A recent analysis released by the UK's COP26 team said that rich countries are currently on track to meet the funding target by 2023, three years shy of the original deadline of 2020. "The delay in climate finance is really unfair for communities who are on the front lines of the climate crisis, for communities that are losing their livelihoods, cultures, homes and land because of increasing disasters," said Ms Nakate. "Delaying climate finance doesn't help us at all. It makes me feel like leaders in the global north really don't understand the urgency of the problem. They don't understand how seriously people's lives are being impacted by the climate crisis." Ms Nakate added that she would be travelling to Glasgow to take part in protests alongside other youth activists, including Greta Thunberg. Major protests against climate inaction are expected on several days during the summit. "My message to leaders and oppressors going to the COP to make promises and speak about their targets is that their actions must really match their words," she added. Meanwhile, the British government's top adviser has accused the UK of letting down the world's poorest nations by failing to help them tackle the climate crisis. Lord Deben, chair of the Climate Change Committee, said the UK had "caused climate change more than anyone else", but not done enough to secure global funding for those now hit hardest by its effects. He also criticised the "immoral" decision to slash Britain's foreign aid budget. "The one weakness we go in with is over helping the developing countries," Lord Deben said. "Britain has caused climate change more than anyone else. We invented the industrial revolution, it's part of our history. We've caused climate change and we've got to pay for it. The fact that we haven't yet put together the money which we promised to help the developing countries move from where they are to where they ought to be is a considerable drawback." He added that the government's decision to temporarily slash foreign aid from 0.7pc to 0.5pc of the national income in November 2020 was likely to haunt negotiations at the summit. "The quite unacceptable decision by Britain to reduce its overseas aid, which is immoral and unacceptable in every way - so I would be opposed to it in any case - gives the wrong signal to developing countries. It's the wrong signal not just because of the amount, but because it means there's much less women's education in the world, and that of course is crucial for nations becoming more resilient [to climate change]." In his Budget announcement on Wednesday, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the cut to foreign aid would last until at least 2024-25. And in July, The Independent revealed that the UK's own contribution to the \£3100bn climate finance fund was to be paid for by even deeper cuts to the UK's other overseas aid projects. "The cut in overseas development aid was quite unacceptable from a timing point of view," Lord Deben said. "If we can't secure the money that we promised, then we could have at least looked like a nation which was more generous than others. But now we don't look like that. "We've gone back not only on our promises, but also on what the Conservatives put in their manifesto." He added that he believed the government had made good progress in other areas, welcoming the general contents of its recently published net zero strategy. "The fact is this is a net zero strategy that takes Britain ahead of many countries, probably all countries," he said. However, he added the strategy contained "very clear gaps" when it comes to how land will be harnessed in climate efforts - and how the government will convince people to eat less meat and fly less. "I understand why the government is reluctant to talk about changes in behaviour because it doesn't want to look like the nanny state. But you can't ignore it," said Lord Deben. \£9 Independent News Service \</doc>

Logistics at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) may have been shambolic as Cop26 got under way, but getting here has been an eyeopener for all the right reasons. There is much to criticise and even lambast about UK-led preparations for the 25,000-strong delegate UN climate change conference in Glasgow this week. Scrunched into queues for hours on end, with zero social distancing, inside a security tent has become an invitation for Covid-19 to be a breakout presence in nations across the globe as delegates return home from Scotland. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, for example, tested positive a day after a breakfast meeting with world leaders at the event. Climate activists - the real agents of change over the past three decades as the world woke up to the metastasis that is global warming - have been excluded from the process as world leaders, business executives, academics, and media assemble in various zones to discuss the obvious. However, there have been bright spots. For those of us priced out of exorbitant hotel rooms in Glasgow and its surrounds over the past week, the daily train commute from Edinburgh has shown that when public transport is nurtured and respected, it is a marvellous asset for any urban setting. Getting from Edinburgh Airport to the centre of the great Scottish city costs little if one takes the bus just a 60-second walk outside the arrivals terminal. The bus drops you around 500m outside Waverley Train Station in Edinburgh in around 30 minutes. From Waverley, it's a 48-minute train ride into Glasgow's Queen Street Station, or about an hour into Glasgow Central. Thinking this is where things would get tricky, this correspondent walked the 2.5km to the SEC on day one of the conference, oblivious to the fact that specially designated Cop26 buses were picking up delegates 10m outside the entrance to both rail stations. Mistake rectified on day two, the 10-minute journey by bus was made seamless due to roads around the SEC being closed off to general traffic. It was a wholly enjoyable experience. While not quite a cynic about mass adaptation of public transport back home in Ireland, I have believed that getting the public at large (myself included) out of their cars and onto trains, trams, and buses is going to be the tallest of orders. What Cop26 It would be naive, and arrogant, to think that citizens living outside of urban congregations should just get on with it, and just get on board with the changes. Their fears are real and founded. It won't be easy to convince them otherwise, but mass investment in public transport of all kinds, and in all areas, should be a centrepiece of any climate mitigation vision for an island like Ireland. In July, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin described the (EURO)185m plan as a "game-changer" for Cork when it was announced in June as part of the (EURO)1bn recovery plan, with a commuter line from Cobh to Midleton to Mallow planned, running through Kent Station, and new stations at Tivoli, Blarney, and Kilbarry. The Irish Examiner "More bus services with shorter wait times are also promised with a simplified route and fares structure to make interchange seamless. "Passengers won't have to pay extra to change between bus, rail, or future light rail services within a 90-minute period. "The details are contained in the draft new bus network proposal for Cork which has been published today by the National Transport Authority." A light rail system running through the city, along with the new bus network plan for Cork, will be transformational - if the Climate Action Plan reduction of 500,000 car journey kilometres coincides with such investment. Public transport cannot be implemented in a piecemeal fashion. This will need to be one of the most radical shifts in the State's history if it is to work. But if it does, it will be one of its finest achievements. Cop26 , on energy day, the conference's press office confidently (and brazenly) announced that "coal is being consigned to history ... as countries, banks, and organisations move away from the single biggest contributor to climate change". "At least 23 countries have made new commitments today to phase out coal power, including five of the world's top 20 coal power-using countries," it said. What the triumphalist line did not say was that countries such as China, India, and Australia were not part of the deal, nor was the US, despite president Joe Biden's lofty words earlier in the week about his country's commitment to climate change mitigation. Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: "From the start of the UK's presidency, we have been clear that Cop26 must be the Cop that consigns coal to history. "With these ambitious commitments we are seeing today, the end of coal power is now within sight." Stuart Haszeldine, professor of geology at Edinburgh University, was a little more circumspect. The likes of South Africa, Poland, and Vietnam signing the agreement was very useful, he told BBC Scotland, but Australia, China, and the US were the major emitters. "There's talk about moving towards the end of coal, but this is not quite that," he said. It will be "tens of years" before fossil fuels are fully phased out, he added. \</doc>

GOODBYE then 2021. You've been weird, but at least you weren't 2020. Role reversal of the year goes to James Bond, who was killed off, and the Taliban, who made a sequel - shouldn't that have been the other way around? And despite the continuing global erosion of democracy, as Brazil, China, Russia, India, Hungary, Turkey, etc, continue to be run by Bond villains, at least Twitter got rid of Trump. The Bidens are German Shepherd lovers, a detail we can cling to for comfort after the dogless Trump was hounded out, leaving a January 6 trail of Capitol-invading Q Anons in his wake. We watched them on the telly - a reality show to make Squid Game look like . Like JK Rowling faced with the idea that trans people are not predatory, significant swathes of public reaction to the Covid vaccine remain unenthused. Which has resulted in the supreme irony of millions of people in rich countries being offered a free vaccine and refusing it - taking to the streets to refuse it - while in poorer countries, millions are desperate for it, and can't get their hands on it. A lesser - but still remarkable - irony of 2021 is Elon Musk being made Person of the Year by Time magazine. For what - being the world's richest tax evader? Still, 2021 proved a better year for some areas of equality, as Kamala Harris became vice-president of the US, and Black Lives Matter was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. George Floyd's murderer was jailed, although Trump was not, despite being impeached again. The Kardashians were kancelled, and Daft Punk broke up. So did Adele, who released another album about it. Meanwhile, as world leaders flew in private jets to discuss the climate emergency at Cop26 and the rest of us tried to figure out what Cop26 Vegan went mainstream. So goodbye, 2021 - you were definitely better than your predecessor. As we cautiously poke open the door of 2022 to peek, fingers over eyes, at what lies ahead, let us deal with the continuing encroachment of the Greek alphabet on our lives with pragmatism, not fear. And go me for writing a whole column without once mentioning the word Omicron. Happy New Year. \</doc>

Sir, - As we anxiously await the outcome of Cop26 in Glasgow for a decisive action plan to curtail the rise in global temperatures, Michael Viney recaps on 60 years ago when he joined a protest march in London campaigning for nuclear disarmament. His intention then was saving western civilisation, as opposed to today's efforts to save the planet ("Young protesters in Glasgow for Cop26 will have much to fight against", Another Life, October 30th). At that time, the painful memory of the tragedy of Nagasaki and Hiroshima was all too recent and in the years since then, nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima have meant a reluctance by many countries to embrace nuclear power. As fossil fuels are being phased out, the less than fully effective wind and solar energy are the only established global alternatives until other renewable energy sources become proven. It appears essential that nuclear energy, whose generation and use is cheap and independent of weather, will have to be considered as a high-priority interim option to supply the ever-increasing demand for electricity and maintain the living standards that people have become accustomed to. In dealing with the human future, Viney says that "resignation is not the business of the young". They may ultimately have to decide between global warming with its catastrophic consequences and the existing risks of nuclear power. - Yours, etc, KEVIN McLOUGHLIN, Ballina, Co Mayo. \</doc>

Under fire for his environmental policies, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will skip climate talks in Glasgow next week and instead visit an Italian town awarding him honorary citizenship. The president's provisional itinerary shows Mr Bolsonaro will attend the G20 summit in Rome this weekend before heading to Anguillara Veneta in northeast Italy on Monday. Other world leaders will be in Glasgow on Monday for the start of the UN COP26 climate talks. Mr Bolsonaro and his government have faced biting criticism on the environment, especially in the wake of massive deforestation in Brazil and associated greenhouse gas emissions. He is also facing criticism for his Covid policy. A Brazilian Senate commission endorsed a report that seeks to indict Mr Bolsonaro for nine crimes, including crimes against humanity, over his Covid response. Some 606,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19, second only to the United States. The citizenship decision by Anguillara Veneta, approved by the city council, has caused a stir in Italy. The spokesman for the regional opposition, Arturo Lorenzoni, called it "a slap in the face for the values of the Constitution". But mayor Alessandra Buoso, a member of the far-right League party, told AFP that the honorary citizenship was "to reward the welcome that migrants from Anguillara Veneta have received in Brazil". About a thousand inhabitants of the town fled poverty to emigrate to Brazil at the end of the 19th century, among them Mr Bolsonaro's ancestors. Mr Bolsonaro is suffering low approval ratings at home, one year ahead of an election that polls predict him to lose. Earlier this month, he was accused of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in the destruction of the Amazon. The complaint brought by Austrian environmental justice campaigners AllRise accused Mr Bolsonaro of waging a widespread campaign resulting in the murder of environmental defenders and of endangering the global population through emissions caused by deforestation. Earlier this week, Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourao suggested the country would continue a confrontational negotiating strategy at COP26 , renewing calls for other countries to pay Brazil to preserve the Amazon. Brazil's Environment Minister Joaquim Leite will lead the coutnry's COP26 delegation. \</doc>

Here are some of the pledges made so far at the UN climate conference COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. Deforestation More than 100 global leaders pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, a promise underpinned by $19bn public and private funds to invest in protecting and restoring forests. The statement was initially backed by leaders of countries including Brazil and Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia, which collectively account for 85% of the world's forests. But Indonesia's environment minister later dismissed the plan as "inappropriate and unfair. Forests absorb roughly 30% of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the non-profit World Resources Institute. However, forest degradation and loss has been aggravated by fires that in some places are being fuelled by climate change. Those seeking to conserve forests also have to deal with the massive commercial incentives to fell trees. Under the far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaroin Brazil, illegal loggers have become emboldened in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest from the region have sent 40 envoys to the COP26 talks to highlight the need to protect their territories. Methane About 100 countries have joined an effort led by the United States and the European Union to cut emissions of the climate-warming gas methane compared with 2020 levels. Methane has a shorter life in the atmosphere than the biggest greenhouse gas CO2, but has around 80 times more planet-warming potency. That means quickly reducing methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry and agriculture could have a big impact in the short term. But big methane emitters Russia, China and India have not yet signed up, while Australia has rejected the idea of joining. Net-zero emissions goal COP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels to avert the most dire climate change impacts. So far, the world is far off track. A UN report released days before the Glasgow talks said current pledges to cut climate-warming emissions put the planet on course for a 2.7C temperature rise this century. Scientists say the world must halve emissions by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050, to avert the worst impacts of global warming. India's prime minister on Monday said the country, one of the world's biggest carbon emitters, after China and the United States, aimed to reach net zero. Financing For years, finance has been a major sticking point at the UN talks, with rich nations having failed to meet a 2020 deadline to deliver $100bn of funds a year to help developing nations transition away from fossil fuels and prepare for climate impacts. The pledge, made in 2009, is an acknowledgement that developed nations have contributed most emissions to the atmosphere and so bear more responsibility for reversing course. Last week, the British COP president, Alok Sharma, said the goal would be met only in 2023. But on Tuesday, US climate envoy John Kerry suggested 2022 could be achievable. Financing firms join net zero pledge Banks, insurers and investors with $130 trillion at their disposal have pledged to put combating climate change at the centre of their work, and gained support in the form of efforts to put green investing on a firmer footing. In theory, $130 trillion is more than enough to finance the world's transition to a greener economy, but it remains to be seen how many of the trillions will be channelled into action that reduces emissions. Regulators are working on establishing uniform standards to break through "greenwashing", whereby companies portray their business as climate-friendly when in reality it is not. End of coal? Major coal users Indonesia, Poland, Vietnam and others pledged to phase out their use of coal-fired power host Britain said put the end of coal use "in sight". Twenty governments have committed to stop public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of next year, although they do not include some of the world's most coal-dependent nations, including Australia, China and India. Protect Nature Dozens of nations pledged to do more to protect nature and overhaul farming, amid misgivings about past failures. Britain said 45 nations were making pledges to safeguard nature on Saturday, including the United States, Japan, Germany, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Vietnam, the Philippines, Gabon, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uruguay.Sharma said the pledges included $4bn in public sector investment which would help spur innovation such as developing crops resilient to droughts, floods and heatwaves that could benefit "hundreds of millions of farmers". Adaption, loss and damage At the start of the second week of COP26 , governments will push for agreement on how to help vulnerable countries deal with global warming and compensate them for damage already done, a test of whether developing and rich nations can end a standoff over cash for climate change. Britain, which is hosting the COP26 meeting, will again try to set the pace, announcing \£3290m ($391m) in new funding, including support for countries in the Asia Pacific region to deal with the impact of global warming. That will come, the British government says, on top of the "billions in additional international funding" already committed by rich countries such as the United States, Japan and Denmark for adaption and resilience in vulnerable nations. \</doc>

THE countries of the world need to do more to limit global warming to 1.5C, COP26 president Alok Sharma warned yesterday as he opened the summit. Mr Sharma said the 193 nations attending had the 'last, best chance' to put the brakes on dangerous climate change. The former British business secretary told delegates: 'The rapidly changing climate is sounding an alarm to the world to step up on adaptation, to address loss and damage, and to act now to keep 1.5 alive. 'We know that this COP, COP26 , is our last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach.' Pointing to devastating impacts around the world, including droughts, heatwaves, hurricanes and floods, he said: 'We know our shared planet is changing for the worse and we can only address that together.' Mr Sharma told the countries that six years ago at the Paris summit, they agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C by the year 2100 under the Paris Agreement. The world has already warmed by around 1.1C compared with preindustrial times. Mr Sharma stressed, however, that progress has been made as, 'without Paris, we would be hitting 6C'. The COP26 president said he believed this conference could resolve the outstanding issues needed to implement the Paris deal. Concluding his speech, he said: 'If we act now, and we act together, we can protect our precious planet. 'So, let's come together and ensure that where Paris promised, Glasgow delivers.' It was: 'Leave the ghosts of the past behind you and let's focus on the future and unite around this one issue that we know matters to all of us, which is protecting our precious planet.' He added: 'This is a chance for all these countries to show leadership, this is the point where they have to stand up and be counted. I want more out of every country.' \</doc>

The energy sector's overall emissions of methane are massively underreported, the International Energy Agency has said, as it promoted cuts to the most potent greenhouse gas as a quick way to make a major impact on global warming. HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022 The IEA said its latest annual Global Methane Tracker had found that emissions by the energy sector were about 70% higher than official government figures. It said this showed the need for greater transparency as well as "stronger policy action to drive down emissions of this potent greenhouse gas," responsible for some 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. While methane dissipates faster than carbon dioxide, it has a much more powerful warming effect in the atmosphere. Humans are responsible for about 60% of methane emissions, and cutting these could have a quick and major impact. "Cutting global methane emissions from human activities by 30% by the end of this decade would have the same effect on global warming by 2050 as shifting the entire transport sector to net zero CO2 emissions," IEA chief Fatih Birol said. The tracker, which for the first time includes country-by-country emissions from coal mines and bioenergy, showed methane emissions from the energy sector grew by just under 5% last year. The IEA logged "significant emissions" in Texas and parts of Central Asia, with Turkmenistan alone responsible for one-third of "large emissions events" logged by satellites last year. We just released our new comprehensive Global Methane Tracker It shows that methane emissions from oil, gas & coal are on the rise again, underscoring the need for greater transparency, stronger policies & immediate action.Read more HYPERLINK https://t.co/z97PToki12 https://t.co/z97PToki12 HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/IEA/status/1496386897496752128 February 23, 2022 30% cut target The energy industry is a major source of methane emissions from leaks and operations. Many older oil wells flare off unwanted methane, which is essentially natural gas used to heat homes, as building infrastructure may have originally cost too much. But with gas prices soaring, the costs of investments to capture methane and reduce leaks will quickly pay for itself, and would help reduce tight supplies. "Had all methane leaks from fossil fuel operations in 2021 been captured and sold, natural gas markets would have been supplied with an additional 180 billion cubic metres of natural gas ... equivalent to all the gas used in Europe's power sector and more than enough to ease today's market tightness," the report found. At last year's COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, participants signed a Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. But of the five countries with the largest methane emissions from their energy sectors - China, Russia, the United States, Iran and India - the IEA noted only the US is currently a signatory. \</doc>

The Taoiseach and US president Joe Biden have met on the margins of the Cop26 summit. Miche\'e1l Martin said President Biden reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday Agreement during their encounter in Glasgow. Mr Biden, who has family roots in Ireland, has often spoke about the importance of preserving peace on the island of Ireland. In meetings with UK prime minister Boris Johnson at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June, Mr Biden stressed the importance of protecting the Good Friday Agreement amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. More than 100 world leaders have been meeting at the start of a two-week summit in Glasgow aimed at producing agreed policies to combat climate change. Speaking from Glasgow today, HYPERLINK https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/biden-apologises-for-trump-climate-actions-and-tells-cop26-it-is-decisive-decade-1207635.html Mr Biden acknowledged that the US "None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come if we fail to seize this moment," Mr Biden declared at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. The president treated the already visible crisis for the planet - flooding, volatile weather, droughts and wildfires - as a unique opportunity to reinvent the global economy. Standing before world leaders gathered at the UN climate summit in Scotland, he sought to portray the enormous costs of limiting carbon emissions as a chance to create jobs by transitioning to renewable energy and electric vehicles. Paris Agreement Yet he also apologised for former president Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris Agreement and the role the US and other wealthy countries played in contributing to climate change. "Those of us who are responsible for much of the deforestation and all of the problems we have so far," Mr Biden said, have "overwhelming obligations" to the poorer nations that account for few of the emissions yet are paying a price as the planet has grown hotter. As for Mr Trump's action, he said: "I shouldn't apologise, but I do apologise for the fact the United States, the last administration, pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit." \</doc>

The burning of fossil fuels "is killing us", the World Health Organisation has warned in a report calling for ambitious climate action. The WHO's report, issued in the run-up the UN Cop26 conference in Glasgow where countries will be under pressure to raise ambition on tackling climate change, warns it is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. The climate crisis threatens to undo the past 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, it says. Climate change is leading to death and illness from increasingly extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods, disruptions to food systems, increases in disease spread and mental health issues. Fossil fuels are fuelling the climate crisis, as well as causing millions of premature deaths every year from air pollutants, the report said. AdvertisementIt calls for governments to commit to a green, healthy recovery from the pandemic, making sure efforts are aligned to the goals of the global Paris Agreement on tackling climate change, focus on 100 per cent green stimulus spending and end fossil fuel subsidies. Next pandemic The WHO report also calls for action to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic, commit to vaccine equality and address inequalities at the root of the current climate and health crises. The report lays out further recommendations to deal with climate change, including prioritising action with the largest health, social and economic gains, promoting sustainable and healthy cities, and transport and food systems, restoring nature, and moving to an economy based more on wellbeing. "The burning of fossil fuels is killing us," the WHO report said, and also warned: "Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity." While no one was safe from the health impacts of climate change, they were disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, it added. \~ An open letter from 300 organisations representing at least 45 million doctors and health professionals worldwide has been published alongside the report, calling for leaders and negotiators at Cop26 to step up climate action. The letter urges governments to take action to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change are set to be felt. Advertisement"We call on the leaders of every country and their representatives at Cop26 to avert the impending health catastrophe by limiting global warming to 1.5C, and to make human health and equity central to all climate change mitigation and adaptation actions," the letter says. As the report and letter were released, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said: "The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment. "WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at Cop26 to limit global warming to 1.5C - not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests." Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of environment, climate change and health, added: "It has never been clearer that the climate crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we all face." But measures such as bringing down air pollution would reduce the number of global deaths from the problem while dramatically cutting greenhouse gases, and a shift to more nutritious, health-based diets would reduce emissions and avoid up to 5.1 million diet-related deaths a year by 2050, she said. \</doc>

"Your voices are being heard, I really believe that, sorry you don't feel that" \- that was the message US Special Envoy on Climate John Kerry had for a group of young climate activists he met with privately at COP26 , in a meeting convened with the help of an Irish student. Mr Kerry told the campaigners, led by University College Cork student Alicia O\' Sullivan, "your movement and the things that you\' re saying are on the lips of everybody here in discussions, people all talk about responsibility to your generation, the future". Ms O\' Sullivan brought along fellow young climate campaigners from the US, Philippines, Zambia and Kosovo to the meeting at the US delegation office at COP26 . Mr Kerry set up the meeting with Ms O\' Sullivan to hear from her and her fellow delegates from World YMCA about how they feel COP26 is going. She told him: "We all really feel as a collective, even though we come from extremely different backgrounds and experiences of climate change, is that this conference is particularly inaccessible." The group voiced a concern that many sectors of society, including young people, are being locked out of negotiations. Ms O\' Sullivan said that while she has a badge that says 'observer\' she feel she has not been able to do that. Referring to his anti-war stance during the Vietnam war, John Kerry told youth activists at HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cop26 # Cop26 : "I was once in your shoes, trying to protest something that was going on that wasn't being listened to, so I understand exactly where you\' re coming from." HYPERLINK https://t.co/s1xKWmmwlK https://t.co/s1xKWmmwlK HYPERLINK https://t.co/GiYB9vVqFx pic.twitter.com/GiYB9vVqFx HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1458878955939840002 November 11, 2021 Mr Kerry said that Covid-19 has governed a lot of what can and can\' t be done at this year\' s event, and has contributed to people not having access they want to rooms where negotiations are taking place. Referring to his years as an anti-war veteran during the Vietnam war, Mr Kerry said: "I was once in your shoes, trying to protest something that was going on that wasn\' t being listened to, so I understand exactly where you\' re coming from." However, he said that when it comes to COP26 : "Nothing has been as energised as this, and you guys have really helped energise it." Mr Kerry told the panel of youth across the table: "There are passionate, deeply committed people at the table here, not everybody is in the same place, but I will tell you that this is moving things more rapidly and bigger than I have seen, and I have been at this since the very first COP back in 1992." "I know there have been criticisms, saying it\' s just talk but you have to talk to make an agreement. "Unfortunately, countries have different interests, people come from different places, and so you have to work through those differences, I think this has been a pretty damn good model of banging away for hours and hours staying up until the wee hours of the morning, and trying to find solutions. "You have to create accelerated research, as we did with vaccines, as we did with going to the moon and now we have to do that about saving the earth. "We have private sector, business, at the table in way they have never been at the table, and by the way, some young people resent the fact that some corporation or other is at the table, but I got news for you, no government has enough money to do what we need to do, we can\' t. "If we\' re going to transition, when you\' re going to have clean air, electricity that\' s not made with fossil fuels, if you\' re going to have a sustainable circular economy, it takes a massive transition in the trillions of dollars of expenditure. "We all know we have ten years, ten critical years, so this process will grow." Ma Magda Gana, from the Philippines, told Mr Kerry that it\' s not just about young people at the table, but young people being consulted on decisions being made. Rebecca Nkunde, from Zambia, said: "we\' re not looking to take anything away from the older generation because we need you, we need your wisdom. We just need you to carry us along, and take us with you." To finish the meeting Mr Kerry said that "perception is reality" and if the young people feel they are being left out, then, he said, "we need to do more". "I\' d love to figure out how we continue to work to bring your voices to the table, you\' re here, you\' re at the table, here\' s the table," he said. Speaking to RT\'c9 News about the announcement that China and the US will work together to cut greenhouse gas emissions and whether it will give the talks momentum, Mr Kerry said: "We hope so, obviously, everybody is working hard now to come to an agreement on the decisions, and I am quite confident that we can find unity, it\' s always a difficult process at the end, but everybody is working hard." \</doc>

THE recent COP26 China, India, the US and Brazil paid lip service to any meaningful agreement. China and India are still building coal-fired power stations at home and in Africa; Brazil has cleared an area of rain forest larger than Ireland in the last five years and plans on increasing cattle production by 12.5 million animals. Greenhouse gases do not recognise hard borders, soft borders or sea borders; there are no protocols they recognise. So this little region needs to stand back from the proposed legislation in front of our Assembly today. Ninety-three per cent of the land in Ireland is held by owner-occupiers. I have survived well into my seventh decade as a farmer and I intend to pass on this farm to the next generation as a better place than I found it, where they can breathe the air, drink the water, enjoy the beauty in the knowledge each hectare of our soils sequesters 1.3 tonnes of carbon per annum and stores it. Am I part of the solution to climate change? Yes, I am one of thousands of owner-occupiers who need to be brought into this discussion. Legislators need to consider carefully before they enact measures that "throw the baby out with the bathwater" WILLIAM J TAYLOR OBE, FR.Ag.S Kircubbin \</doc>

"Is this how our story is due to end - a tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals?" Those were the sobering words of one of the most instantly recognisable and trusted figures of modern times, David Attenborough, as he spoke of the existential crisis around climate change at the Cop26 event in Glasgow yesterday. "Perhaps the fact that the people affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generations but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story, to turn this tragedy into a triumph," said Mr Attenborough. US president Joe Biden, weakened from a tough month at home with climate provisions struggling to remain intact in his $1,750bn ((EURO)1,500bn) economic package, nevertheless took a firm stance on the climate crisis in Glasgow. He told fellow world leaders that there was "no more time to hang back" or "argue amongst ourselves" about the crisis facing the planet. He echoed Mr Attenborough in his appraisal that acting decisively now could help reverse the course. "In an age where this pandemic has made so painfully clear that no nation can wall itself off from borderless threats, we know that none of us can escape the worst that's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment," said Mr Biden. Earlier, Miche\'e1l Martin told the Irish Examiner he was encouraged by the Biden administration's attitude to climate change, after four years of inaction and denial by Donald Trump. The Taoiseach said climate change would form a major part of any State visit to Ireland for Mr Biden, an Irish-American with ancestral roots in Connacht, and the invitation remained firmly open. "Joe Biden is more than welcome to come here when he wishes," said Mr Martin. "We've made that clear to him and will do so again. He has been very strong on climate change, to be fair to him, creating a new momentum around it, in partnership with the EU." The Taoiseach was also firm in his language on climate change, saying "the time had come for action, not more rhetoric". "Fundamentally, it's about translating rhetoric into action. That is what Cop26 has to be about," said Mr Martin. "I think the Paris Agreement was a very significant agreement. Then there was a setback when Donald Trump led the US out of Paris. It was four years before the return to the Paris Accord by Joe Biden, and that gives Cop26 a very strong platform to increase momentum. The G20 this week did something similar. "There are still challenges, notwithstanding China and Russia. Nonetheless it is expected that there will be commitments. They may fall short of what people want, but I think overall there will be a very positive momentum coming out of Cop26 ." "We face a stark choice," he said. "Either we stop it or it stops us. It's time to say: 'Enough.' "Enough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves." News: 4&5 Editorial: 10 \</doc>

FORMER Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's initiative to boost the market for carbon offsets is being scaled back, in the wake of fierce debate around whether the traded assets really help avert global warming. In September 2020 Mr Carney and Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters launched the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets to expand the controversial market for the financial instruments, which allow buyers to claim reduced greenhouse gas emissions often without making any changes to their own activity. Now, 18 months later, the body is repurposing its mission to tackle the criticism that offsets don't represent real carbon reductions. As more corporations pledge to make their emissions "netzero", carbon offset prices could grow more than 50-fold by 2050, according to BloombergNEF. While Mr Carney initially predicted the total market could reach $100bn ((EURO)91bn) by the end of this decade, the sector remains mired in confusion over the integrity of carbon removal projects and a lack of clarity over how global trading of them should function. The slimmer version, with about 90 members, is dubbed the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market and will instead focus on assuring the quality of offsets sold, according to Annette Nazareth, co-chair of the governance body and a former head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Targets to increase the size of the market have been ditched, and Mr Carney's promise of a pilot market early this year has also been scrapped, she said. Mr Carney and Mr Winters still sit on the board, but are no longer involved in the day-today running of the project. The 400-members of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, as it was known, included academics, traders and environmental groups, and they soon squabbled over the path through the maze of exchanges and standards. At COP26 Voluntary carbon offsets represent a metric ton of reduced, removed or avoided greenhouse gas emissions, and are bought by companies and individuals to subtract emissions from their own accounts in order to declare improved environmental performance. Projects generating carbon offsets span from planting trees and protecting forests to building wind farms and cleaner-energy cooking stoves. Renewables and naturebased projects in particular have been criticised for carbon accounting issues, their longevity and for negative impacts on local communities. The group has also delayed delivering on its key objective: to come up with a "core carbon principle" (CCP) label that could be used to mark offsets that meet its standards. Members spent months arguing over the criteria for inclusion, with sharp divides over how high to set the bar. "Some people wanted to start early but, frankly, that would have been guessing what the CCPs would say," Ms Nazareth said. "You want to encourage voluntary carbon trading, but only the high-integrity, CCPaligned trading." The council intends to consult on a set of CCPs in May, with a decision expected in September, Ms Nazareth said. In the meantime, offset trading is taking off. She admits that even when those CCPs are confirmed, the group will be toothless to enforce them. "I'd love to have regulatory authority and be able to do all those wonderful things I got to do with the SEC," Ms Nazareth said. "Unfortunately, nobody gave us that power. But we do have the power to name and shame. We have the power to be very public and noisy about what's going on in this area." The International Energy Agency said earlier this month that global greenhouse-gas emissions rebounded in 2021 to their highest-ever level after the pandemic.

Irish consumers have never been more targeted by companies using green claims to market their products. Land Rover has used celebrities such as Brian O'Driscoll and Diarmuid Gavin in sponsored content to promote its SUVs as being better for the environment, and AppleGreen, the fossil fuel retailer, introduced "carbon-neutral driving" at its diesel pumps and a biodiversity initiative for schools. Consumers, investors and businesses themselves often struggle to determine which corporate green initiatives are simply marketing practices and which ones are truly environmental. A survey published last week by the Compliance Institute suggests that as the fight against climate change steps up, greenwashing efforts by some Irish firms have gone into overdrive: 43pc of businesses have seen evidence of greenwashing by companies, with the institute likening the practice to "the virtue signalling of the corporate world". Last year, the European Commission and consumer protection authorities across the EU revealed that at least 42pc of firms had made exaggerated or false claims about their green credentials on their corporate websites. In November, Gabriel Makhlouf, the governor of the Central Bank, said he was he was "particularly concerned" about greenwashing because "green market practices are currently almost exclusively based on voluntary principles and standards, which leaves a lot of room for different interpretations". But corporates will face tougher scrutiny than ever on how they are addressing climate change and social issues amid upcoming EU sustainability reporting standards and a new "taxonomy" that will offer a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The increasing barrage of complex regulations - with an alphabet soup of acronyms - are designed to direct capital into sustainable activities and to combat greenwashing as the EU seeks to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050. Maura Quinn, chief executive of the Institute of Directors (IoD) in Ireland, whose membership comprises some of the most senior directors and business leaders in the country, noticed environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues soar to the top of the corporate agenda during the pandemic and in the run-up to the UN Climate Change conference ( COP26 ) in November. "None of us was around the last time there was a pandemic and it created an enormous sense that we live in a global community," she says. "So we understood that the decisions we make at a local level have huge implications internationally. During severe lockdowns, we could see clear skies and notice the return of wildlife and birdlife and there was a reduction in environmental pollution. Then Cop26 happened. And we are now seeing the reality of climate change, with three storms in one week in Ireland." But there are signs that corporate Ireland may be struggling to measure and report on ESG issues. Almost half of business leaders surveyed by the IoD at the end of 2021 said their organisation has found it difficult to set realistic key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure ESG targets. An analysis of Ireland's top 50 listed and privately held companies published in December by KPMG found that 72pc were "far from ready" for new EU sustainability reporting requirements. Until recently, non-financial reporting has largely been the preserve of listed entities. But this is all poised to change after the European Commission last year published proposals for sustainability reporting standards in its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The CSRD significantly expands the scope of companies that must provide sustainability-related information as part of their corporate reporting and sets out in great detail the nature and extent of non-financial information that companies will be required to report. The EU estimates that 49,000 companies across the bloc will fall under the scope of the new directive, compared to the 11,600 which currently have reporting obligations. Firms will have to adhere to sustainability reporting in 2024 for the 2023 financial year, with data gathering starting next January. The measure will be mandatory for large companies, defined as having at least 250 employees and having either (EURO)40m in turnover or (EURO)20m in total assets. Small and medium-sized listed companies will have to comply by 2025. Conor Holland, director of ESG reporting and assurance at KPMG, says: "It's like a whole new set of accounting standards being transposed. The whole genesis of this is that we are moving to a place where there will be an equilibrium between financial and non-financial reporting. They'll also be assured, so an independent third party - most likely an auditor - will have to provide a limited assurance opinion on the reporting to combat greenwashing." Alongside the introduction of the CSRD is the EU taxonomy regulation, which will require companies to report specific metrics - called the Taxonomy KPIs - including the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure and operational expenditure that qualify as sustainable economic activities. Irish organisations are also being encouraged to adhere to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global framework that provides companies with recommendations on disclosing climate-related topics in their financial reporting and one that has become a basis of regulation in the EU. A TCFD support campaign launched in 2020 by Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe to improve the level of climate-related reporting among Irish corporates now has 35 Irish supporters, according to Colette Coogan from Sustainable Finance Ireland. These include AIB, Bank of Ireland, CRH, Glenveagh, Hibernia Reit, Ryanair, and Smurfit Kappa. "The TCFD is a voluntary framework but from a reputational standpoint, it's important to be adhering to global benchmark in this area," Coogan says. Most of all, boardrooms are under pressure from investors to adopt such reporting measures and fully sustainable practices. Earlier this month, for instance, it emerged that activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns just 200 shares of McDonald's stock, launched a board fight at the fast-food retailer to demand changes to the way its pork suppliers treat pigs. Icahn, who nominated two board directors to McDonald's, asked the corporation to require that all its US pork suppliers end the practice of keeping pregnant sows confined in small crates or "gestation stalls". Indeed, "investor sentiment is potentially moving faster than the regulations," says Laura Wadding, a partner in risk advisory and sustainability at Deloitte. "There are investor lobbying groups actively encouraging corporates to make additional disclosures, such as additional data on their carbon footprint, their emissions, their use of fossil fuels, or their employment practices." Quinn says: "There is a push-pull at play here. The push piece is the regulatory side, but the pull factor is people really looking more closely at companies and how they operate. Historically, companies were there to make money and return shareholder value. Now they have to make the world a better place." HISTORICALLY, COMPANIES WERE THERE TO MAKE MONEY. NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE \</doc>

As they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks, exhausted Cop26 negotiators - some shocked at last-minute compromise on the vexatious issue of coal - knew they'd been through a bruising battle where "uncomfortable" compromise marked the outcome. In spite of this, tangible commitments, and even progressive moves to shift course, were nailed down. For the first time a Cop agreement targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming. The tone is much different to the usual arcane language of UN climate summit outcomes. The 2015 Paris Agreement is finally moving to gearing-up stage. There is no doubt now keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees is the priority of the 197 signatory countries, who can no longer put vague commitments on the table in the hope the world might warm by less than two degrees. Emerging into the Glasgow daylight probably provided a far greater shock for negotiating teams, especially political leaders heading up delegations, as the reaction was marked by a wave of deep disappointment. Reaction in climate-vulnerable states can be summed up by one word - despair. Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan admitted that dramatic twist was "gut- wrenching" as India - the world's third biggest emitter - pushed for "phase down" rather than "phase out" of coal. This prompted a rushed manoeuvre by the EU, China and United States to amend the text in the interests of holding "what we've got", though it was against protocols and the final political, rather than legal, decision was already agreed going into the final plenary. The critical target of keeping global warming to within 1.5 degrees was still alive, Cop26 president Alok Sharma insisted; a view backed by those big players. "What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity," Ryan said. Unfinished business Much unfinished business, however, is confirmed by definitive analysis published in Glasgow showing all promises made before and at the UN summit make for a 2.4 degree rise in temperatures, where already dangerous climate impacts would become catastrophic. "For many countries, two degrees is a death sentence," executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said. The deal backs "best available science" to inform actions. Applying that framework, there is no sugar-coating the standout failure of ambition on actions to curb emissions, leaving our fragile planet still hanging by a thread. That said, there is enough to suggest the world is facing into a decade of scaled-up action. In that scenario the request that parties "revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022" becomes the key enabler. A request in "UN speak" is close to a demand. The temperature issue aside, this was the most productive Cop since Paris. Decisions on doubling adaptation finance and setting up a body to assist countries most impacted by climate disruption represents progress, but more is needed. When it comes to hard money, the long-awaited $100 billion a year for developing countries under climate finance will be realised, while adaptation funding to help vulnerable countries adjust for inevitable climate impacts is set to be in excess of $1 trillion a year by 2025. While Cop26 A historic proposal to "phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" was watered down; part of the compromise needed to agree a deal by inserting "phase down". It has left a bad aftertaste, especially for the EU. The reality, however, is the economics of coal-powered electricity generation no longer add up in face of cheap solar and wind energy. The coal industry that once brought wealth to the developed world is coming to a rapid end, probably by 2030. Developing countries are predicted to follow the same course over the following decade. Outside the Cop process, groups of countries committed to ending fossil fuel extraction, to accelerating the phasing out of coal, to tackling methane and to ending deforestation. If all of this is delivered, acceleration of decarbonisation over the coming decade is realisable. New alliances between public and private sectors have been forged, especially on switching to green energy. There was also a strong indication the financial world is gearing up for transitioning to a world of net-zero emissions. Analysis by Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency indicate fresh pledges made over the past fortnight have the potential to reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees - a significant stride toward the 1.5 target. Delivery reinforced by meaningful near-term commitments is critical. Being unable to bend the emissions curve downwards this decade will put huge pressure on the remaining carbon budget for "keeping 1.5 degrees alive". The Cop26 As climate scientist Prof John Sweeney has highlighted, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has four out of five possible scenarios which indicate the world will exceed 1.5 degrees over the next 20 years. The one that keeps us to within 1.5 degrees is a trajectory the world is nowhere near at present. It will be some years before we know if Cop26 has helped bridge the gap. \</doc>

and in New York Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, huddled with a group of top climate activists in Washington on Monday to reassure them of the Biden administration's mettle in the fight against a warming planet. With a week to go before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, and in the middle of tense negotiations with politicians to pass emissions-cutting legislation through Congress, Harris suggested the US would no longer bring half-measures to the global stage. The battle against the climate crisis was a leitmotif of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign and a constant focus of his administration since taking office in January. This marked a sharp U-turn from Donald Trump's time in the White House, but also an uptick in attention on the problem compared with Democratic predecessors including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as it emerged as an increasingly salient issue for many voters. Yet even so, Biden will be heading to Scotland - and before then, this weekend's G20 in Rome - facing questions about his ability to enact meaningful change in climate policy in the world's largest economy. If it is approved, the White House's flagship spending package - worth up to $2 trillion - is expected to include more than $500 billion (EUR 430 billion) in climate measures, including an array of clean-energy tax credits. But some of the most aggressive steps, such as a scheme called the Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) that would force power companies away from fossil fuels, are likely to be stripped out after opposition from politicians including Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator of West Virginia. A carbon tax has been periodically floated in the negotiations but was also ruled out. Some analysts say this would make it much harder for the US to meet its own goal of halving its 2005 greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2030. Transformation Sanjay Patnaik, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a fellow for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy at Johns Hopkins University, said it was very unlikely that "only carrots, without a stick" would succeed in cutting US emissions sufficiently. "International partners are going to look and say: 'Okay, it's great that Americans are back at least at the negotiating table, they are trying diplomatically to take a leading role. But ... why should I reduce emissions if the US is not willing to seriously reduce emissions?'" he added. Some climate experts say the transformation in Washington's approach under Biden should not be underestimated. Aside from re-entering the Paris climate accord, his administration has signed on to a global deal to reduce methane emissions, designated climate change a "systemic risk" to the US financial system, and labelled it a threat to national security and global stability. "With every IPCC [Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change] report that comes out, we are hearing that we have almost no time left to really address the climate crisis. And the Biden administration is taking that to heart," said Anne Christianson, director of international climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank. Still, in recent days Democrats have been scrambling to bolster the bill's climate provisions before the president arrives in Glasgow. "Especially in light of not having something like the CEPP, it's essential that we really lock in and solidify the tax credit portion of this, because that is going to be one of the most important pieces of this entire puzzle," said Lindsey Walter, deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at think-tank Third Way. Environmentalists are also pushing policymakers to find an alternative to the CEPP that would be acceptable to moderates. After proposals to put a price on carbon were shot down, the focus has shifted to a system of grants for states to support efforts to go green. Democratic politicians are turning up the pressure as well, amid fears of a repeat of the experience of the first two years of Obama's administration, when climate legislation was blocked by the Senate after passing the House. No Republicans are expected to back Biden's Bill. "If the US doesn't have a strong commitment to carbon reduction in this legislation, we're not only weakening our position in these climate negotiations, we're weakening the entire opportunity to reduce carbon for the entire planet," said Melanie Stansbury, a Democratic member of the US House of Representatives from New Mexico. 'Political action' "I don't think that the problem is a lack of grassroots political action by Americans, I think the problem is a lack of willingness by politicians to be brave in policymaking and do what they know is right," she said. Sean Casten, a House Democrat from Illinois, said he would like to see the US in a "position of leadership" in Glasgow. "If we pass [strong climate legislation] we are in a position to set the tone for Cop26 ," hesaid. "If not, we are basically ceding that leadership role to the Chinese, and I don't want to do that." Without any action by Congress, the US is on track to achieve a reduction of 17-25 per cent in emissions by the end of the decade. But a report released last week by the Rhodium Group suggested that the 2030 target could still be within reach without the CEPP, provided the tax credits were pushed through and accompanied by new measures taken by federal agencies, states and companies. Even so, in Glasgow Biden will be unable to pledge what the world may be wanting to hear most: that climate legislation is gaining bipartisan support in the US and won't be undone. "I think one problem with US policy has been its unpredictability," said Patnaik at the Brookings Institution. "We have these big pendulum swings between Republican and Democratic administrations." - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021 \</doc>

The Minister for Environment has said he followed health guidelines at all times after receiving different results in two tests for Covid-19. Eamon Ryan added that he was conscious of the perception that different rules applied for ministers after he attended the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow on Monday. On Saturday, the Green Party leader announced that he had cancelled his visit to Glasgow after testing positive for coronavirus, but on Sunday he said a second test had a returned a negative result and indicated he would make the trip. Speaking to the media in Glasgow, Mr Ryan said he took the first test on Friday. \~ He added: "It was standard enough. On Saturday I got the text saying you are positive. I went home and followed all the protocols. Advertisement"The main thing I had to work out was my contact tracing. I contacted the Taoiseach, the T\'e1naiste. "After that, the HSE contacted my private secretary. The details of the first test had been inconclusive, even in those circumstances you get a positive reading. "It is standard to have a second test, particularly in circumstances where you weren't symptomatic, and you were just doing the test as part of a routine travel arrangement. "So I did a test that evening and the next morning it came back negative. "I followed medical advice right the way through. I didn't have to isolate. Had I ignored that advice I would have been going against the health advice. The health advice was go about your business as normal. That is what I did." Asked if he was aware of the perception that there was one rule for Government figures and another for other people, he said: "I am very conscious of that. But the only thing I could do was follow the health advice, follow the protocols, do what I was told by the HSE. "I kept in touch with the Taoiseach and the T\'e1naiste and followed the protocols. Then I said why should I not travel? I would not be taking the advice from the HSE." AdvertisementMr Ryan said he believed the Cop26 conference was about creating "momentum for action".

Former president Mary Robinson has said a lack of ambition at COP26 means that anyone under the age of 60 is likely to inhabit a world that is less livable in and facing extreme weather events, while anyone under 30 is "sure to live in that world". On Saturday, nearly 200 nations reached a deal to combat climate change after two weeks of negotiations in Glasgow. However, scientists and environmentalists said the agreement fell short of what was needed to contain dangerous temperature rises. They also accused rich countries of not delivering much-needed finance to vulnerable states at risk of drought, rising seas, fire and storms. Ms Robinson, who is chair of The Elders and former UN high commissioner for human rights said that presidents of small island countries will have gone home from COP26 "almost in despair" because they are barely just being kept alive. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, Ms Robinson said big emitter countries \- US, Australia, China, Mexico and Brazil - did not increase ambition, while there was also a lack of ambition on the financial side. Former President Mary Robinson on £ shameful dereliction of duty' at COP26 .

You need the complexities and the voices of the most vulnerable at the COP, she said, to impress upon those who do not have a crisis mindset. However, she warned that the world is in more crisis mode and that was felt in Glasgow, and she said what will make the difference now is what happens on a local level. The pact for the first time includes language that asks countries to reduce their reliance on coal and roll back fossil fuel subsidies, moves that would target the energy sources that scientists say are the primary drivers of manmade climate change. Ms Robinson said that it is significant that for the first time the agreement reached at COP did include language on phasing out fossil fuels in the text. She said that governments, including the Irish Government, need to invest to "make the move to green" and to make green jobs affordable . Ms Robinson said that the fossil fuel lobby has always been very powerful, in particular Saudi Arabia, which she said "always claims a bad gain at COP" and seeks to remove language on youth, human rights, indigenous people and just transition. Fossil fuel subsidies Ms Robinson said fossil fuel subsidies fall into two categories. The first is a subsidy that grants tax exemption to companies that produce fossil fuels, meaning that "we tax exempt what is killing us, would you believe it?" She said that real thought and sensitivity is needed in removing the second type of subsidy, on the consumption of fossil fuels. "Removing those ... can put people into energy poverty or real poverty and need to be done sensitively," Ms Robinson said She added that the Government needs to invest in and make sure we can afford to go green in a way that brings people with us and also to have regenerative agriculture, which she described as "exciting". Meanwhile, the chair of the Marine Ecosystems Protected Areas environmental group for seven Caribbean nations said local people must have a voice in decision making processes to tackle climate change. Ruth Spencer said this was the final time for action and the voices of the local people are important in coming up with solutions that will work. Speaking on the same programme, he said governments must be held accountable to ensure that a damage fund to mimimise the effects of climate change reaches those on the frontline of the crisis. Ms Spencer said: "I want to hold everybody accountable. We at the local level, we have to get it right. "When we go to ask for funding upon, then we should have the evidence. We should show the impact on people. The impacts on our ecosystems, our farmers, our oceans, we have to have it right. This is the final time for action."

WE'RE at the sporting analogies stage of the climate crisis. COP26 is not the only game in the league but it's a really important one, said Alok Sharma who, as president of the UN climate summit, is effectively head coach of the team of world leaders entrusted to deliver on climate goals. Meanwhile, Professor Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organisation, delivered a warning about performance enhancing drugs. "There are sports people who perform very well, but when they are doped, they perform even better," he said. They behave as if turbocharged and easily smash records, just like the world's weather has been doing these past few years with its hottest heatwaves, fiercest fires, heaviest rains and deadliest floods. "We have been doping the atmosphere," said Prof Taalas, carbon dioxide being the drug of choice. The two men delivered addresses on the opening day of COP26 , an event which has the task of marrying scholarly science with intricate intergovernmental negotiations. Both pursuits can lose an audience faster than a nil-all final without a whiff of a shot on target, so tossing a little punter-friendly analogy into the arena is a smart move. Today it's the turn of 130 heads of state, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin among them, to see if they can find the right words to hold on to the crowd as they begin delivering 'national statements' on their country's climate ambitions. With so many listed to speak, it will take all of this afternoon and much of tomorrow to get through everyone. A few star players will be watched closely. US President Joe Biden is among the starting line-up and before the end of the day, we expect to hear also from the prime minister of India. The US and India are the second and third largest emitters of greenhouse gas in the world. Their big four clubmates, China and Russia, decided to stay home. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, who has been on and off the pitch in terms of climate talks so often it's hard to tell what team he plays for, has decided he will tog out after all and will join the list of speakers. Many of the most compelling statements are likely to come from smaller and poor countries bearing the brunt of climate change to which they contributed hardly anything. Watch out for Mia Amor Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, who has the passion and no-nonsense delivery of a hurling coach on county final day. But there are only so many ways to deliver a short speech when the general aim is to appear reasonable and committed without promising too much. There are cliches alive this morning that will be barely breathing from overuse by tomorrow evening, and by the end, only the most committed spectator will be left standing. But what we will hear from the world leaders over the next two days is really only the team talk. What matters is what happens next when they actually face each other and begin their negotiations in earnest. They first have to deal with the fact that they have made little progress since their last big showdown. That was in Paris in 2015 when they agreed goals to keep global temperature rise to a maximum of 1.5C or at least as far below 2C as possible. The actions they took, and more importantly didn't take to cut greenhouse gas emissions, means all the signs are the world is on course for warming of 2.7C. That's supercharged doping. Alok Sharma warned yesterday that even with all the new commitments countries were bringing to COP26 , they still may not add up to a winning outcome. "Countries may have to look again at their emissions reduction targets if we are not going to be able to close the emissions gap on this occasion," he said. "I would describe COP26 as a really important game in the league. There will be further COPs but what is clear is that this is the decisive decade, and that's why we need world leaders, we need countries, we need parties, to come forward with agreements at this COP on how we close the emissions gap." What he was really saying is the pace of climate change is quickening - and that means the goalposts for all countries moving, What we will hear from world leaders over the next two days is 'team talk' The world's weather patterns are behaving like they're being doped \</doc>

On the coastline near India's southern tip, workers toil on a pier carrying a conveyor belt that cuts a mile into the Indian Ocean where the waters are deep enough for ships to berth and unload huge cargoes of coal. The belt will carry millions of tonnes of coal each year to a giant power plant several kilometres inland that will burn the fuel for at least 30 years to generate power for the over 70 million people that live in India's Tamil Nadu state. The Udangudi plant is one of nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from US nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM). Many industrialised countries have been shutting down coal plants for years to reduce emissions. The US alone has retired 301 plants since 2000. But in Asia, home to 60% of the world's population and about half of global manufacturing, coal's use is growing rather than shrinking as rapidly developing countries seek to meet booming demand for power. More than 90% of the 195 coal plants being built around the world are in Asia, according to data from GEM. Tamil Nadu is India's second-most industrialised state and is one of the country's top renewable energy producers. But it is also building the most coal-fired plants in the country. "We cannot depend on just solar and wind," a senior official at Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp told Reuters. "You can have the cake of coal and an icing of solar," he said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media. Despite dramatic jumps in renewable energy output, the global economy remains hooked on coal for electricity. In Asia, coal's share of the generation mix is twice the global average - especially in surging economies such as India. In 2020, more than 35% of the world's power came from coal, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Roughly 25% came from natural gas, 16% from hydro dams, 10% from nuclear and 12% from renewables like solar and wind. This year, coal demand is set for a new record, driving prices to all-time highs and contributing to a worldwide scramble for fuel. Record coal demand is contributing to a rapid rise in emissions in 2021 after a fall last year, when restrictions on movement for billions of people to slow the pandemic caused fuel use to plummet. While some of the new coal plants under construction will replace older, more polluting stations, together they will add to total emissions. "The completion of the capacity that is already under construction in these countries will drive up coal demand and emissions," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clear Air. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the new plants alone will be close to 28 billion tonnes over their 30-year lifespans, according to GEM. That is not far off the 32 billion tonnes of total worldwide CO2 emissions from all sources in 2020, according to BP, highlighting how tough it will be for leaders gathering in Glasgow - including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - to make meaningful progress on climate change. India's Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta told Reuters that India was on track to reach its target of cutting back the country's carbon footprint, and with that coal, too, would fall - but it cannot be abolished. "Look, every country has its strengths. We have coal, we have to depend on it," Gupta said. "Our position is once you take up targets of reducing carbon intensity, that will have impact ... Leave it to us whether we do it in coal, or somewhere else." Across India, 281 coal plants are operating and beyond the 28 being built another 23 are in pre-construction phases, GEM data show. These numbers are dwarfed by China, the top global coal miner, consumer and emitter, whose leader, President Xi Jinping, is not expected to attend COP26 . More than 1,000 coal plants are in operation, almost 240 planned or already under construction. Together, coal plants in the world's second-largest economy will emit 170 billion tonnes of carbon in their lifetime - more than all global CO2 emissions between 2016 and 2020, BP data show. Despite also boasting the world's largest renewables capacity, China is now suffering a major energy crunch and has urged coal miners to raise output. That is likely to boost coal consumption in the near term, even though China plans to reduce coal use from 2026. Even so, total global coal consumption looks set to rise, driven by accelerating use in South and Southeast Asia, where projects under construction will raise coal-burning capacity by 17% and 26% respectively. Even in economies committed to slashing emissions, coal's grip remains strong. Japan, with its nuclear power industry in crisis since the Fukushima disaster, has turned to coal to fill the gap and is building seven large new coal-fired power stations. Leading generator JERA plans to add clean-burning ammonia to be used with coal to help meet its target to be carbon neutral by 2050, and potentially keep old units operating longer. On a bay near Nagoya, JERA's 30-year-old, 4,100 megawatt Hekinan station - once Asia's largest - supplies electricity to the likes of car giant Toyota. Like many power plants, Hekinan's boilers rely on fuel from top exporters such as Australia, where coal is both a vital source of revenue - $18 billion in the current financial year - and a bone of contention with allies urging ambitious emissions cuts. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to attend the Glasgow talks. But resources minister Keith Pitt has said there would be demand for coal for decades and made it clear the country would not be swayed by pressure from banks, regulators and investors to hobble the industry. "While the market exists, Australia will look to fill it," Pitt said. \</doc>

An international effort seeking to phase out coal use throughout the world has insisted "the end of coal is in sight" in spite of four major economies declining to back a global agreement at Cop26 . Burning coal is the single biggest emitter of carbon emissions, while phasing out coal use in the UK was a major factor in reducing its emissions by more than 40 per cent over the past 30 years. There has been a 76 per cent drop in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the past six years since the Paris Agreement was adopted. The "powering past coal" pact was endorsed by more than 40 countries including Poland, Indonesia and Vietnam. Developing countries vowed to quit coal in the 2030s "or as soon as possible thereafter" a significant change to the original 2030 goal. Major international banks, however, committed to effectively end all international public financing of new unabated coal power by the end of 2021. Meanwhile, at least 25 countries and public finance institutions committed to ending international public support for the unabated fossil-fuel energy sector by the end of 2022. Collectively, this could shift an estimated $17.8 billion a year in public support out of fossil fuels and into the clean-energy transition. In a new "Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement", countries also committed to scaling up clean power and ensuring a just transition away from coal. This follows recent announcements from China, Japan and South Korea to end overseas coal financing which now means all significant public international financing for coal power has effectively ended. Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: "We have been clear that Cop26 must be the Cop that consigns coal to history. With these ambitious commitments we are seeing today, the end of coal power is now within sight." About half of the world's fossil-fuel assets will be worthless by 2036 under a net-zero transition, according to research published yesterday. Countries that are slow to change will suffer but early movers will profit, it predicts. Renewables and freed-up investment will more than make up for the losses to the global economy. Demand The risk of producing far more oil and gas than required for future demand, which is estimated to leave $11 trillion-$14 trillion in so-called stranded assets - infrastructure, property and investments where the value has fallen so steeply they must be written off. Lead author Jean-Francois Mercure of the University of Exeter said the shift to clean energy would benefit the world economy overall but needed to be handled carefully to prevent regional pockets of misery and possible global instability. "In a worst-case scenario, people will keep investing in fossil fuels until suddenly the demand they expected does not materialise and they realise that what they own is worthless. Then we could see a financial crisis on the scale of 2008," he warned. The challenge is evident at the ongoing Cop26 where some of the states most at risk of being left with stranded assets - such as the oil and gas exporters Russia and Brazil - are likely to try to slow down the transition as they have done at previous climate meetings, while those most likely to gain - such as the fuel-importing European Union - are pushing for faster action. The study published in Nature Energy, illustrates how a drop in demand for oil and gas before 2036 will reshape the geopolitical landscape. Current investment flows and government commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 will make renewable energy more efficient, cheaper and stable, while fossil fuels will be hit by more price volatility. - Additional reporting: Guardian \</doc>

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg opened a youth climate summit by lambasting three decades of government inaction, accusing world leaders of having "drowned" future generations with "empty words and promises". Speaking weeks ahead of a crunch UN climate meeting in Glasgow, Ms Thunberg accused governments of "shamelessly congratulating themselves" for insufficient pledges to cut emissions and promises of financing. Hurling leaders' own words back at them, the 18-year-old laid bare to delegates at the Youth4Climate event in Milan the gap between words and action. "There is no Planet B, there is no planet blah, blah, blah," Ms Thunberg said to warm applause. Echoing a speech by COP26 summit host Boris Johnson in April, she continued: "This is not about some expensive politically correct dream of bunny hugging, or build back better, blah blah blah, green economy, blah blah blah, net zero by 2050, blah blah blah, climate neutral blah blah blah. "This is all we hear from our so-called leaders: words, words that sound great but so far have led to no action, our hopes and dreams drowned in their empty words and promises," said Ms Thunberg. The three-day event in Italy gathers some 400 youth activists from nearly 200 countries, who will submit a joint declaration to a ministerial meeting at the end of the week as a lead-in to COP26 in November in Glasgow.

She said governments had been "shamelessly congratulating themselves while still failing to come up with the long overdue funding" for developing nations. Ugandan youth activist Vanessa Nakate echoed Ms Thunberg's exasperation at leaders' lack of urgency. "How long must children sleep hungry because their farms have been washed away, because their crops have been dried up because of the extreme weather conditions?" she asked attendees. "How long are we to watch them die of thirst and gasp for air in the floods? World leaders watch this happen and allow this to continue." COP26 is being billed as vital for the continued viability of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which saw countries commit to limit global temperature rises to "well below" 2C. The landmark deal aims for a safer warming cap of 1.5C. But six years after the accord was struck, countries still have not agreed how it will work in practice. Among long-overdue issues still outstanding for COP26 is how each country's carbon cuts will be counted, as well as how the fight against climate change is financed. Nations already suffering from extreme floods, droughts and storms supercharged by rising seas have called on developed countries at COP26 to make good on a decade-old promise to provide $100 billion each year to help them recover and adapt. COP26 President Alok Sharma told delegates that "now is the time for the developed countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries dealing with rising impact of climate change". The UK says it wants the Glasgow summit to keep the 1.5C temperature goal viable, specifically by seeking a global agreement to phase out coal power. However the United Nations said this month that the latest round of country emissions reductions plans still puts Earth on course for a "catastrophic" 2.7C of warming. \</doc>

Cop26 hears developing nations must get funding to cut emissions Emily Beament, Tess de la Mare, and Jonathan Watts Cop26 president Alok Sharma says negations around finance to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change "need to accelerate and they need to accelerate now" as the summit enters its final days. The failure of developed nations to deliver the longpromised $100bn ((EURO)87bn) in finance to poorer nations has been a major sticking point in the talks so far. Developing nations want commitments to phasing out fossil fuels to be stripped from the cover agreement, arguing that being asked to decarbonise without financial support will leave them trapped in poverty. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Sharma said: "Negotiations on finance really need to accelerate and they need to accelerate now. "Having engaged extensively with parties of the past year and at Cop, I know that everyone understands what is at stake for the future of our planet here in Glasgow." He continued: "We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome that we can all be proud of. His words were echoed by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, who emphasised that, under current plans, the world is still on course for temperature rises well above 2C. "Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies, as measured by the IMF, or when countries are still building coal plants, or when carbon is still without a price, distorting markets and investors decisions," he said. "The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging but they are far from enough. "The emissions gap remains a devastating threat, the finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world." With Glasgow failing to close the gap, the pressure is now on countries to agree on a deal that will ensure they take mitigation action to cut emissions in the 2020s and keep the 1.5C goal within reach, as well as deliver on finance. A first draft of the cover decision includes a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, the first time this has ever appeared in such a text. New Cop26 pledges announced on methane, coal, transport, and deforestation could nudge the world 9% closer to a pathway that keeps heating to 1.5C, according to a study by the world's most respected climate analysis coalition. Climate Action Tracker says the sectoral commitments announced in Glasgow represent potential cuts of 2.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the emissions of Germany, Japan, and the UK combined, or 20,000 fully loaded aircraft carriers. This is in addition to measures previously outlined in national climate plans. However, this is dependant on governments keeping their climate promises, which almost none have done until now, and it still leaves the world heading towards ever more dangerous levels of heating.

UNEMPLOYMENT and inflation in Zimbabwe are currently sky-high. And the country's leader is accused of presiding over a regime as oppressive and ruthless as that of predecessor Robert Mugabe. But regime supporters didn't seem to care as they threw a boozy welcome party for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Scotland. Pictures emerged yesterday of two backers of the leader's ZANU-PF party leaving a Costco in Glasgow with trollies full of Budweiser, prosecco, Scotch whisky and snacks. Zimbabwe is believed to have sent a 100- strong delegation to the Cop26 summit. Critics have accused Mr Mnangagwa's regime of human rights abuses and crackdowns on journalism. He is even nicknamed 'The Crocodile' because of his alleged political cunning. Meanwhile, unemployment in the country has been estimated to be as high as 90 per cent this year and inflation stood at 54.4 per cent last month. One regime critic suggested the group was not taking the summit seriously, asking: 'What is Zimbabwe's position at Cop26 ? Do we have a clear agenda?' But yesterday a government spokesman insisted the gathering was not attended by delegates, but by Zimbabweans who were already in the UK, adding: 'It's the Zimbabwean culture to make a party of most occasions.' \</doc>

P RESIDENTS, prime ministers and princes all had their three minutes of fame and relished it as the World Leaders Summit began at COP26 . Boris Johnson kicked off the event and looked set to elevate himself to royalty by playing the role of clown prince. The UK's rambunctious prime minister makes lampooning hard to resist. His address to the world leaders and the watching world beyond the Glasgow venue was full of the kind of language that sounds like he's in a satirical programme mimicking himself. Who else would begin a life-or-death international summit with 120 world leaders by describing scenes from James Bond movies? Who else would talk of 'Kiwi scientists trying to teach belching cows to be more polite'? Who else would risk resurrecting a spat with arguably the world's most influential leader, Greta Thunberg, by stealing from her 'blah, blah, blah' speech? Only a real-life rogue-villain like Johnson. But just as court jesters often delivered hard truths in clownish antics, there were harsh facts in the prime minister's song and dance routine. "My fellow leaders, I do not wish to put too fine a point on it but when we all talk about what we are going to do in 2050 or 2060, I don't think it will escape the notice of the crowds of young people outside and the billions who are watching around the world, half of the population of the world under 30 that the average age of this conclave of cardinals is 60," he said. "I fully intend to be alive in 2060," he added. "I will be a mere 94 years old, even if I'm not still in Downing Street, you never know. "But the people who will judge us are children not yet born and their children, and we are now coming centre-stage before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity and we must not fluff our lines or miss our cue because if we fail, they will not forgive us." A lot of ageing backsides shifted uncomfortably in their seats and some sank visibly as if trying to hide their grey heads from view. It was not a good time for Joe Biden to appear to doze off, both in his seat and while standing in front of the podium where he delivered a lacklustre speech that drew snippets from every other speech he has ever made on climate but failed to package them into a greatest hits medley. Possibly two of the eldest lemons present sensed what was coming and gave addresses that took years off them - and put years on anyone listening. David Attenborough, more animated than ever despite his 95 years, pleaded with a passion and logic that cut through the clich\'e9s for a determined effort to stop the inevitable. "Is this how our story is due to end - the tale of the smartest species doomed by that all-too-human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in the pursuit of short-term goals?" he asked. "If working apart we are strong enough to destroy the planet, surely by working together we are powerful enough to save it." Antonio Guterres, a mere fledgling at 72, was on fire too. The UN secretary-general has begged, beseeched, appealed and urged leaders to get their backsides in gear on the climate issue in every way possible, but he managed to outdo even himself. "It's time to say enough," he said. "Enough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. Another reference to mortality. More discomfort. Fridays for Future, the school strike movement, brought Friday forward to Monday and held an impromptu gathering in a park on the fringes of the giant COP26 campus. Well, you would too if you were a climate-conscious teen and Greta Thunberg said she'd pop along. Greta seems likely to do this over the next fortnight - surprising city and summit officials with last-minute appearances that both draw attention to and from the formal activities taking place. For the thousands who'd spent up to two hours trying to get into the crammed COP venue yesterday morning, only to be warned later in the day that it was now too crammed for Covid safety and it would be appreciated if they'd take off home, word that the kids were outside in the fresh air engaging in an energetic show of defiance, determination and camaraderie was tantalising and tormenting. There was song and dance in the park too and though rather less contrived than Johnson's, it also held harsh truths. Because these are the people whose futures those on the inside can decide. And they won't forgive. \</doc>

Legacy [ leg-uh-see ]. Noun. Practices that are handed down from the past by tradition. Something left or handed down by a predecessor What will Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin's political legacy be? He will not have long in the big chair. He waited for a long time to sit in it, rode out the toxicity around his party, and has staved off - for now - those within Fianna F\'e1il who wish to see him toppled . It's fair to say that Martin is determined to make his relatively short time at the top of the Irish political tree count before he hands the warm seat back to Leo Varadkar in the next 18 months . The window of opportunity is short, but reputations last forever, and Martin apparently sees climate change as a way to cement his . Housing has been a busted flush for successive governments since the great financial crash, while the twists and turns of Brexit were largely handled well by figures in the previous government . He's got the 2004 smoking ban in public places to look back upon. That was an act of political courage that has, by any measure, saved lives . It's a fine achievement in the final analysis of 36 years in political office, but Mr Martin has been sullied by his involvement in a political system that brought the country to its knees in financial ruin in 2009 . However, the old political cat still hasn't used up all of those nine lives and, if the past two days are anything to go by, Martin is preparing to throw his chips in the highest poker stake political game of our time - climate change . He's all in. The assembled Irish media in Glasgow asked themselves if they were imagining it . "Is it just me, or is he becoming really strong on climate change language," reporters asked each other . Some even wondered aloud if he was turning into a Green as he enters the twilight years of his political life . "You don't have to be a member of any political party not to get this and understand this," said Martin . . "I think we can do an awful lot," he told reporters in response to his apparently Damascene-like conversion to tackling the climate crisis Even the most battle-hardened climate change warriors, cynical and weary after years of intransigence and lip service, wondered if Cop26 was a St Paul moment for the man from Turner's Cross . Long-time campaigning journalist John Gibbons, loathe to suffer any fools and unfailingly uncompromising when it comes to greenwashing or vacuous climate language, had his head turned, tweeting that he had to pinch himself at some of the strong rhetoric from the Taoiseach's mouth . Agriculture will have to do some of the heavy lifting, Martin said in recent days, while transport and industry, and every single person will have to play their part . He's not deviated from the script, instead going for even stronger language on the urgency of climate action as each day passed . For those who are (understandably) cynical, consider for a second where these statements were made - in front of the eyes and ears of the world at Cop26 in Glasgow If he fails to follow through, Martin will have perjured himself in the court of public opinion for all times - he may be a lot of things, but a fool he is not .

THE councillor leading Belfast City Council's climate working group has described government arrangements for a delegation to attend the Cop26 meeting as an "absolute dog's dinner". At the summit, countries will come under pressure to increase ambition and action to meet the goals of the Paris accord to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, beyond which the worst impacts of the climate crisis will be felt. Green party councillor Brian Smyth told this newspaper: "We have a bit of an idea of the programme, but we're still waiting on more information to come in. It is a matter of weeks away." Arrangements for Belfast City Council to attend the global climate summit in Glasgow, starting on October 31, are being handled by the Cabinet Office in London. But Mr Smyth described the set-up as "an absolute dog's dinner in terms of organisation". He also told how city council officers were "doing everything that they can with scant information". "It's just indicative of this government. This is a huge global event - it happens every five years - particularly when you think of how huge and how quickly climate has gone up on everyone's agenda," he added. The three councillors looking likely to attend the summit are Mr Smyth, councillor Aine Groogan, also from the Green Party, and Alliance Party Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl. Mr Smyth said it was a "new Belfast going into the conference", with representatives from the Green and Alliance parties and two out of three of them young women. "The landscape is changing, and for the better," he said, adding that the councillors would make their way to Glasgow via boat, not plane. "It's a hell of an opportunity for Belfast because it's right on our doorstep. It's a matter of hours away by boat and bus, and I think it's something that we need to be there for," he explained. "I think that we'll be ready for it. There's a good climate team in Belfast that is working around the clock for it. "I think it's really important for us to be there in terms of looking at other cities and talking to people in person." The representatives attending Cop26 will be hoping to find out more about potential solutions. Some aims for the Belfast councillors likely to be attending include preparing to decarbonise the city within a generation, retrofitting of housing stock, making way for more open green spaces, and being prepared "for the challenges and risks Belfast faces in the decades ahead". "For me, one of the legacies is going to be how we take what happens at Cop26 , with these massive strategic aims and global aims from governments, and translate that down onto the ground to our communities," Mr Smyth said. He added that he wanted to do it in a way that was "fair and equitable for everybody", including the working-class community. A Cop26 "Councillor Kate Nicholl, the leader of Belfast City Council, is a member of this council. "We are committed to ensuring an inclusive, whole of society Cop26 , representative of all of the UK." The Labour Party will today urge the Prime Minister to treat the climate talks seriously and prevent the event from becoming a "greenwash summit". In a speech, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband will set out the "undeniable and frightening maths" of emissions reductions that show the world is miles away from where it needs to be ahead of the conference. \</doc>

THE world is facing a climate crisis and failing to act would be "catastrophic", Stormont's leaders have warned. First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill were speaking ahead of attending the Cop26 World Leaders Summit in Glasgow today. The UN conference opened yesterday, with the UK pressing world leaders to sign up to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Ms O'Neill said failing to act would be a dereliction of leaders' responsibilities. Downing Street said Cop26 will be one of the biggest events the UK has hosted, with 25,000 delegates expected from 196 countries. Mr Givan said the eyes of the world are on Glasgow. "The scale of the challenge is such that everyone across society has got a crucial part to play," he said. "Governments, businesses and individuals must all shoulder their responsibilities to create a cleaner environment and it is important that the voice of the Northern Ireland Executive is heard at the summit over the next fortnight." He said the Executive's draft Green Growth Strategy, published last week, sets out the long-term vision for tackling the climate crisis. "There is much to do if we are to deliver on our commitments to build a more sustainable society," he added. "The Green Growth strategy sets out how we can get there and we must grasp this last opportunity before it is too late." Ms O'Neill said: "None of us should be in any doubt that we are in the midst of a climate crisis. The time to act is now and to do nothing would be catastrophic and a dereliction of our responsibilities as political leaders. "We have all witnessed the impact of climate change in our lives and if we are to make a difference, then we must all work together. The climate crisis is no respecter of different political views and the Executive stands ready to play its part in this global response. "For us, that means taking action locally and our Green Growth strategy sets out a holistic approach to tackling the climate crisis. It provides an opportunity to embed environmental considerations into all our decision making." Environment Minister Edwin Poots is also attending the summit, and said climate change was the defining crisis of our time. "It must be recognised that we cannot continue with a 'business as usual' approach, we must act now before it is too late," he added. "We have all seen first-hand the effects of climate change and there are other numerous challenges ahead - reducing our emissions, improving air quality, tackling plastic pollution, achieving zero waste, and the development of a circular economy. "The next decade must be one of urgent action, there is still time to make a difference, but we must act now and we must do it together." Mr Poots said the draft Green Growth Strategy was "a solid framework", balancing climate action with the need for a clean, resilient environment and economy. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who is also travelling to Glasgow, said "a radical plan" was needed. He said there was clear evidence from rising temperatures and climate events around the world that the crisis was worsening. "The Cop26 conference in Glasgow is a pivotal moment in our bid to tackle the climate crisis," he said. "This is no time for tinkering around the edges of the Paris Agreement. We need to get more than lip service from Cop26 , we need firm commitments from those with the power to enact change that they are ready to do what's necessary to protect our environment." Mr Eastwood said ambitious targets are needed to bring down emissions and safeguard our planet for future generations. "Anything less will be catastrophic for humanity," he warned. \</doc>

'How long are we to watch them die of thirst in the droughts? And gasp for air in the floods? What is the state of the hearts of the world leaders who watched this happen and allow it to continue? Our leaders are lost and the planet is damaged." That is the unacceptable reality of parts of Africa today, expressed by the young Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate. That reality should concentrate all minds at the UN's Cop26 , which opens in Glasgow tomorrow. But will it? The world's grotesque wealth and power imbalance is clearly reflected at this conference. Single delegations from the richest states outnumber those of the poorest, most vulnerable countries many times over. The richer countries, including Ireland, are also responsible for most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet the cost of the crisis is currently borne most sharply by those least responsible, and least able to withstand its impacts. Back in 2009, $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 was promised to redress this injustice. Shamefully, much less has been delivered. Cop26 must honour, and increase, this commitment. That said, the consequences of global heating are also already affecting many rich countries, much more rapidly and severely than even experts expected. This has been most visible in extreme weather events. The image of a German mayor breaking down in tears before the cameras of the world, after last July's floods devastated his region, epitomises this development. Less obvious, but even more menacing, are the tipping points we are approaching as ice sheets melt, the oceans rise, and thawing tundra emits more methane into the lethal mix of heating gases which we continue to pump into the atmosphere. However, there are now some slim grounds for hope that we may avert the worst of the crisis, following the recent pre- Cop26 surge in emission-cutting promises from many countries, Ireland included. Before the landmark Paris Cop21 in 2015, we were on course to heat the planet by four degrees at the end of this century, making most of it uninhabitable for our species. The latest commitments, if both feasible and implemented - and neither can be taken for granted - could bend the curve towards two degrees. But even that shift will still have catastrophic consequences. If we push heating down half a degree more, we could probably manage the crisis. That would demand unprecedented shifts in behaviour, locally and globally. But the alternative, already so starkly manifest, should surely galvanise us to radical, innovative action. The question to be answered in Glasgow is whether our leaders, and their peoples, can find the heart to make the necessary changes, and the ingenuity to make them work. \</doc>

Levels of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached record highs again last year, UN scientists have warned ahead of key climate talks. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere rose at a faster rate in 2020 than over the previous decade, and the trend has continued in 2021, the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said. The economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic did not have any discernible impact on atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and the rate at which they are building up, although there was a temporary decline in new emissions, the WMO said. If greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase at current rates, the world will see temperature rises far above globally agreed long-term targets to limit warming to 1.5C to 2C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Greenhouse gases are emitted by human activities such as burning fossil fuels for power, heating and transport, farming and deforestation, and they build up in the at mosphere where higher concentrations of the gases trap more heat, causing rising temperatures, extreme weather, and rising seas. WMO secretary general Professor Petteri Taalas said the latest information on greenhouse gases contained a stark scientific message for climate negotiators at the Cop26 talks, adding: "We are way off track." The last time the Earth had similar concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere was three to five million years ago when the temperature was 2C-3C warmer than now, and sea levels were 10-20m higher - but there were not 7.8bn people living on the planet then, he warned. Prof Taalas said: "Many countries are now setting carbon neutral targets, and it is hoped that Cop26 The latest annual greenhouse gas bulletin from the WMO shows that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 413 parts per million in 2020 - 49% above what it was in 1750, before human activity started affecting natural systems. The bulletin has been published as world leaders prepare to gather in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate conference in less than a week, where countries will be under pressure to take greater action to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that are driving rising temperatures. \</doc>

Never confuse movement with action. COP26 has finished, one could wonder where we are heading in the fight against climate change. Many may understandably feel we are still struggling to combat this existential crisis. However, there are significant grounds for hope and Cop26 has provided Ireland with a unique opportunity. Ireland's recent Climate Finance Week demonstrated not only that the financial services sector is committed to playing its part in the climate action agenda, but that we can help Ireland lead the global charge on this vital issue. As Stephen Nolan, Climate Finance Week's chairperson, said "addressing the climate emergency will be hard, but it can be done as long as multiple partners get stuck-in... only through Government investment and private capital can we address the major challenges we face". It is through the responsible, sustainable investment of private money that our sector plays its part. In lending money to companies and households transitioning from 'brown' to 'green' we are helping re-engineer and future-proof the economy. By investing in green infrastructure, carbon-neutral businesses and companies with Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) at their core, we amplify what good investing looks like. Our ambition though is not linked solely to supporting Ireland meet its 2050 net-zero emissions targets. Just as the Government has sought to broaden our global diplomatic footprint via its Global Ireland policy, we must be bold and ambitious to use our existing financial services strengths to become global leaders in sustainable finance. The opportunities to show international capabilities in this area are numerous. Ireland can lead on how sustainable finance is raised, deployed, controlled and reported, through the creation of a sizeable sustainable finance industry serving both Ireland and our global peers. While a small economy cannot ever hope to be the source of all the necessary funding to green the global economy, we can offer the expertise and administrative experience to get the money where it needs to be. A specific example is in the issuance of green bonds. Green bonds are financial instruments specially designed to facilitate climate change mitigation projects. With a bond issuance marketplace that is flexible and knowledgeable, Ireland has a community of experts with a world-class offering to anyone who wants to avail of its services. From a German motor manufacturer seeking to issue a green bond for its next range of electric vehicles, or a US fossil fuels company moving into renewables, Ireland and its financial services sector can be there for them. As with many sectors of our economy, there are multiple large-scale international financial services organisations with a substantial presence in Ireland. Many of these companies are leading the way in climate change mitigation and often have sustainable finance divisions based here - global roles that see the best and brightest help money flow to the kinds of projects improving our world. Government and business should now share the objective to bring more of these roles to Ireland, using the existing multinational ecosystem we have, together with indigenous company growth in the sustainable finance sector. Building on the efforts of State Agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Skillnet Ireland, this is eminently possible. In fact, as part of Climate Finance Week's talent and innovation session, Skillnet Ireland launched funding for a unique public-private sector programme to train compliance professionals in climate-related financial reporting and disclosures. The recent move by the Department of Finance to create a new Climate and Sustainable Finance Group to help shape its thinking on climate change issues is also a hugely positive step. In addition, Ireland will soon be home to the new International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence, in partnership with the UN - an early action of Ireland's inaugural Sustainable Finance Roadmap. It is against this backdrop that the world gathered in Glasgow. Cop26 set itself four goals, one of which centred solely on sustainable finance, and clear progress was made. Having committed over $500bn in climate finance since 2013, developed countries will aim to mobilise at least $100bn per year to 2025. International financial companies, through the Mark Carney-led coalition, pledged to deliver a staggering $130tn to secure global net zero. The financial services sector is already playing its part and stands ready to do even more. Significantly, Ireland has the chance to be at the centre of global sustainable finance and thus the climate change solutions.  Paul Sweetman is director of Ibec's Financial Services Ireland \</doc>

Tuesday The D\'e1il and Seanad are on recess this week, meaning a quieter schedule than usual . However, there are still a few things to watch out for: A farmer's work never stops and neither does the work of the Agriculture Committee, it appears. While the D\'e1il takes a week off, Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue will appear before the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee on Wednesday to discuss the SeaFisheries Bill. Wednesday World leaders will descend on Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). Given the focus on reduction of carbon emissions and the climate crisis, the discussions are likely to be watched tightly across the world. Calls have already been made on private financial institutions to announce new ambitious actions at COP26 . These would include credibly committing to net zero and setting science based targets for 2025/2030 as well as committing to phase out coal finance. Thursday Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman first promised that details of the redress scheme for mother and baby home survivors would be published in May. However, the details have yet to go to Cabinet. The Department of Children has indicated that the redress package will be finalised in the coming weeks. \</doc>

A delegation of Irish doctors attending the UN Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow said it "became abundantly clear how many planetary health issues revolve around social injustice, exploitation, and disregard for indigenous groups". Irish Doctors for the Environment (IDE) members said that the contrast in climate justice between Western people and indigenous peoples was striking, despite indigenous people being key in the global biodiversity crisis that has put at risk thousands of species of flora and fauna in recent decades. "While indigenous peoples make up 5% of the global population, they are the guardians of 80% of our biodiversity that our ecosystems and our own lives depend upon," IDE said after attending Cop26 , as well as the protest marches in the city centre, away from the Scottish Event Campus that 25,000 delegates attended. IDE is a group of medical professionals in Ireland that is focused on promoting and sustaining the health of people through environmental improvements. Its delegation included orthopaedic spinal surgeon, Dr Derek Cawley; consultant psychiatrist and IDE consultant board member, Dr Jeanette Golden; consultant chemical pathologist Ana Rakovac; chartered physiotherapist Maca Hourihane; and GP Dr Sean Owens. Climate change is a real and present health crisis, IDE said. "Having years of experience in advocating for planetary health and an understanding of how our health depends on complex natural systems, the delegation travelled to Glasgow for one pressing reason," IDE said. "Cumulative emissions have pushed several planetary tipping points to their limit: We need to stop emitting now." A tipping point for humans, animals, and plant life was approximately 15 years away without urgent action, the delegation said. "We have, perhaps, only 10-15 years of summer Arctic ice left before the polar regions, which are warming faster than anywhere else on the planet, go from global-cooling to global-warming mechanisms," IDE said. "This is a catastrophic tipping point. Due to accumulated ocean carbon dioxide, we have limited coral remaining, which supports 90% of marine species. "There is a concurrent crash in global biodiversity - which underpins human life - on land. This is also a catastrophic tipping point. "And we are pushing the Amazon from being a carbon sink to a carbon source. "This, too, is a catastrophic tipping point, and there are more tipping points for planetary and human health," IDE said. Meanwhile, a lobby group that includes Irish advocates, and which is calling for more sustainable fishing practices, addressed Cop26 delegates. Jointly organised by Our Fish and Open Seas, leading marine biologists, economists, NGOs, and political representatives called for acknowledgement by governments of the critical role played by the ocean in adressing the climate crisis. Rashid Sumaila, Killam professor at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: "While countries are promising to cut emissions, one of our biggest carbon stores, the ocean, is still not being counted or taken care of." Emissions from the fishing industry are not included in nations' climate action plans, which is a massive missed opportunity, Professor Sumaila said. \</doc>

The response on Friday from the British government to the burgeoning anger of young people over the destruction of the environment was ample evidence that this generation of political and social leaders just does not get it. Thousands of people from all over Britain and beyond, including Ireland, did not come to Glasgow's chilly November streets for a party or a fun day out, they came to tell global powerbrokers that enough was enough. Cop26 actually translated into clear, decisive action. UK education secretary Nadhim Zahawi's response to the palpable anger? That those taking part could face fines. "I have to say, I wish they were doing it on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time. I'd hate to get into a situation where headteachers and teachers are having to fine families and students," he told Radio Times . Even in a country where politicians have a spectacular ability to misjudge the mood of the next generation of voters, this was a doozy. It's been a long time coming, and politicians the world over must realise that anger over climate change peril will not abate, but will grow stronger and stronger as Cop26 rolls into Cop27 and Cop28. Because environmentalists have heard it all before - the dramatic speeches, the "this time it's going to be different" lines, the "we've changed, we promise", the blah blah blah. Remember these words? "What we are now doing to the world ... is new in the experience of the Earth. It is mankind and his activities that are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways. The result is that change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto. "Change to the sea around us, change to the atmosphere above, leading, in turn, to change in the world's climate, which could alter the way we live in the most fundamental way of all. The environmental challenge that confronts the whole world demands an equivalent response from the whole world. Every country will be affected and no one can opt out. Those countries who are industrialised must contribute more to help those who are not." Can't put your finger on it? Why are those words familiar, you ask yourself. Was that Boris Johnson on Monday at Cop26 ? Or was it Joe Biden? Maybe Justin Trudeau or Emmanuel Macron? You'll have to go all the way back to 1989 to find those words.

Record atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and associated accumulated heat "have propelled the planet into uncharted territory, with far-reaching repercussions for current and future generations", the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned yesterday. The past seven years are on track to be the seven warmest on record, according to the provisional WMO State of the Global Climate 2021 report. The report will inform Cop26 negotiations over the next fortnight. Data for the first nine months of the year, on which the report is based, shows a temporary cooling "La Ni\'f1a" event which means 2021 is expected to be "only" the fifth to seventh warmest year on record. "But this does not negate or reverse the long-term trend of rising temperatures," the report states. Global sea level rise accelerated since 2013 to a new high in 2021, with continued ocean warming and ocean acidification. The report combines input from United Nations agencies, national meteorological and hydrological services and scientists. It highlights impacts on food security, population displacement and crucial ecosystems that are undermining progress towards the UN sustainable development goals. "The report draws from the latest scientific evidence to show how our planet is changing before our eyes. From the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated. Cop26 must be a turning point for people and planet," said UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres. "Scientists are clear on the facts. Now leaders need to be just as clear in their actions. The door is open; the solutions are there. Cop26 must be a turning point. We must act now - with ambition and solidarity - to safeguard our future and save humanity," Mr Guterres said. Warming impacts WMO secretary general Prof Petteri Taalas summed up the unprecedented warming effects on the planet: "It rained - rather than snowed - for the first time on record at the peak of the Greenland ice sheet. Canadian glaciers suffered rapid melting. A heatwave in Canada and adjacent parts of the USA pushed temperatures to nearly 50 degrees in a village in British Columbia. "Death Valley, California, reached 54.4 degrees during one of multiple heatwaves, whilst many parts of the Mediterranean experienced record temperatures. Exceptional heat was often accompanied by devastating fires." "A second successive year of drought in sub-tropical South America reduced the flow of mighty river basins and hit agriculture, transport and energy production," Prof Taalas added. "Extreme events are the new norm. There is mounting scientific evidence that some of these bear the footprint of human-induced climate change." He said at the current rate of emissions' increase we will see a temperature rise by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. " Cop26 is a make-or-break opportunity to put us back on track." Snapshot The provisional report provides a snapshot of climate indicators such as greenhouse gas concentrations, temperatures, extreme weather, sea level, ocean warming and ocean acidification, glacier retreat and ice melt, as well as socio-economic impacts. It is one of the flagship scientific reports that will inform negotiations by almost 200 states in the coming days. Reacting to the WMO data, Prof Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading said: "As a scientist primarily studying floods and heatwaves, I believe 2021 should stand out as something of an annus horribilis. Devastating floods in Europe, China and South America, and killer heatwaves and fires in North America and southern Europe, for example, ought to serve as a canary in the coal mine to spur faster action to adapt society to the reality of a changing climate." She added: "We should remember this canary also represents thousands of unnecessary deaths and billions of dollars' worth of destruction." \</doc>

UPBEAT climate experts are hailing "momentum" towards a deal to halt runaway climate change, after a series of carbon-cutting announcements at the Cop26 summit. They are echoing Boris Johnson who said he is now "cautiously optimistic" that the global temperature rise can be limited to 1.5C - just days after lashing out at world leaders for their lack of action. The mood has shifted after India's breakthrough pledge to take one billion tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere by 2030 and the agreement to halt deforestation across most of the globe. Those moves were bolstered, on Tuesday, by almost 100 countries committing to slash methane emissions by 30% - and a deal to hand $8.5bn to South Africa to help it ditch coal as a fuel source. Before leaving Glasgow, Mr Johnson used a favourite football analogy to say the world is no longer 1-5 down in the fight against the climate emergency, but is making "progress". "We've pulled back a goal, or perhaps even two, and I think we are going to be able to take this thing to extra-time," the prime minister told a Press conference. Significantly, Rachel Kyte, a former United Nations climate change special envoy, echoed that view, saying: "It's very clear, by mid-afternoon of the second day, that there is momentum. "If we can carry this forward for the next 10 days, it puts us in a better place than we thought we would be coming in." Mohamed Nasheed, the respected former Maldives president and a UN 'Champion of Earth' was even more bullish, saying: "When you add up all the numbers, I believe that 1.5C is now reachable." Cop26 government officials are also encouraged by Vietnam's pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, believing it will put pressure on China to move further and faster. Despite the blow of Chinese premier Xi Jinping staying away, his envoy in Glasgow - Xie Zhenhua - is praised for being highly-committed and hard-working. But all involved know they still face a herculean task to strike an agreement to achieve only a 1.5C rise, with 2.1C forecast even if all pre- Cop26 commitments are kept. Just 7.5% of predicted annual greenhouse gas emissions would be chopped off by 2030 - far from the 47% reduction that is needed, the UN warned. Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow business secretary, poured scorn on Mr Johnson's comments, saying: "For all the prime minister's fantasy football, we're still a very long way behind. "There has been some progress, but the next 10 days needs to move beyond the pre-packaged announcements. We need a real negotiation to secure the concrete plans for this decisive decade to keep 1.5\'b0C alive." \</doc>

CLIMATE summits like Cop26 are a test of leaders' mettle. In every corner of the globe, the climate crisis is definitely upon us. We have even seen trains taking delegates and activists to Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit being cancelled due to extreme heavy rain in the north of England. All of this is proof that radical climate action is urgently needed, and that leaders must step up and face their responsibilities in Glasgow. Six years ago, real ambition and leadership was shown at Cop21 in Paris, but we remain dangerously off track from meeting those commitments to keep global temperatures to 1.5C. The Glasgow summit should have taken place last year, but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This postponement was understandable, but makes it even more important now for heads of state and ministers to act with real urgency. We are standing on the precipice of a climate catastrophe. Unless Cop26 Crucially, the world's leading industrialised countries - including the United Kingdom as Cop president - need to repair the trust deficit that has been worsened by the lack of solidarity and vaccine inequity that been accepted by richer nations. Inaction and insularity in the face of the climate crisis risk wreaking even greater damage on our planet and the multilateral system. Even at this late hour, there are still worrying signs that rich countries have not grasped the seriousness of what is at stake. The failure to honour the promise of $100bn made to developing countries made more than a decade ago bodes ill for the talks ahead. The Elders fully support the approach of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, who are calling for a package of $600bn by 2025 to make up for this missed target. We need a change of mindset across the board in international politics, finance, business and civil society - one that enables us to "keep 1.5 alive". This is a matter of climate justice. Those who have contributed the least to global warming are suffering the direst consequences, while the rich polluters are still failing to take seriously their responsibilities at a political and financial level. We have wasted too much time in the six years since Paris. The policies we need to cut emissions have been fitful, inconsistent and uncoordinated. The big question leaders must reckon with in Glasgow is whether their national plans add up to what is needed - and if not, how they will close the remaining gap. The difference between 1.5C and 2C of global heating is huge - it would mean 420 million more people exposed to extreme, potentially lethal heatwaves, and tens, if not hundreds of millions more people will be thrown into poverty. As Cop26 host, the UK has a particular responsibility to lead by example and galvanise all delegations into radical ambition, but this demands consistency, coherence and credibility. Reports that the UK is classifying its allocation of special drawing rights from the IMF as overseas aid, rather than using this money to increase its overall aid budget, have further damaged trust. Reversing this step would make a crucial difference to the political dynamics in Glasgow as negotiations get under way. I hope that the UK's leaders, and all others gathered in Glasgow in the weeks ahead, will not shirk this moment. They should heed the words of Nelson Mandela, the founder of The Elders: "It always seems impossible until it is done."

Sir - The COP26 I am certainly not hopeful that much will change as a result of the gathering of politicians and lobby groups at the star-studded summit. Perhaps it is age or perhaps I have seen too many conferences - but I have become cynical, very cynical. The Glasgow summit reminds me of nothing so much as the religious retreats we were sent on back in secondary school. For several days we vowed to give up our auld sins, go to mass every Sunday and generally dedicate our lives to God. Though there were always the few hard men who either didn't go or rubbished the whole God thing. But within a week of the retreat ending, the vast majority of us had drifted back to our old wicked ways. I think it's called human nature. I have little doubt that something similar will happen following COP26 . The practicalities involved in keeping their promises will dawn on world leaders, the everyday demands of keeping voters happy will kick in - and we will go back to our old wicked ways. And there are many countries who have no intention of making changes in the first place. Countries whose entire wealth is solely based on extracting fossil fuels. It's sad to say, but we all have a powerful addiction to our comfortable lifestyles. But because it is also human nature to hope for the best, I will try to do my bit to live a more sustainable lifestyle, reduce my carbon footprint and try not to damage our shared environment. But as I sit here writing, the messages coming from Glasgow are not encouraging. David Orford, Portarlington, Co Laois \</doc>

The world's two biggest emitters must help show the way on climate action, John Kerry has said as the US and China announced joint plans to boost efforts in the 2020s. In a move that could boost momentum going into the final 48 hours of the Cop26 talks, the two countries released a "joint Glasgow declaration on enhancing climate action in the 2020s" setting out how they would work together to cut emissions. The statement - which appears to have taken the UK hosts of the summit by surprise - recognises the urgency and seriousness of the climate crisis and the need to increase action to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius of warming or to 1.5 degrees. Advertisement Mr Kerry, who is the US climate envoy, said the statement commits to a series of important actions "during this decade when it is needed". That includes working together to limit the powerful greenhouse gas methane, setting out the need to phase down unabated coal in this decade, as fast as is achievable, supporting successful Cop26 talks and both countries agreeing to enforce their respective laws on deforestation, he said. Mr Kerry said: "The United States and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done. "This is not a discretionary thing, frankly, this is science, it's maths and physics that dictate the road that we have to travel. And we cannot reach our goals unless all of us work together. "Every country, China and the United States particularly, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way. "We need to raise ambition and we need to take action in this decisive decade." Mr Xie said: "We will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our national situations and circumstances to accelerate a green and low carbon transition." He said: "Climate change is a common challenge shared by humanity, it bears on the wellbeing of future generations. Advertisement "Now climate change is becoming increasingly urgent and severe, (turning) it from a future challenge to an existential crisis." He continued: "In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between China and the US than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for future cooperation. "We are two days away from the end of the Glasgow Cop so we are hopeful that this joint declaration can make China and the US's contribution to the success of Cop26 ." Boris Johnson's climate spokeswoman has welcomed the joint declaration to fight global warming but said time would be needed to consider the details. Allegra Stratton told Channel 4 News: "Clearly it is welcome that the world's two biggest emitters have decided to work together to bring down carbon emissions. "But you will have to give us time to digest the detail of what they are calling their declaration." \</doc>

THE Infrastructure Minister signed up to plans to accelerate the transition to 100% new zero-emission vehicle sales at Cop26 yesterday. SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans on behalf of the entire Stormont Executive. A first draft of a deal for the climate change summit also emerged, calling on countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting plans in the next year in a bid to keep a goal to limit warming to 1.5C within reach. It also calls for faster phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - a first for a UN deal - but there is likely to be strong resistance to this from some countries and it could be taken out of any final agreement. Developing countries and campaigners have also raised concerns over the provision of finance for poorer nations to cope with the impact of climate change. The draft "cover decision", the final version of which must be agreed by a consensus of nearly 200 countries at the Glasgow summit, was published as Prime Minister Boris Johnson headed back to the talks as they entered their final days. Ms Mallon said the declaration on zero emissions was "a critical announcement for governments, businesses and other organisa- tions with an influence over the future of the automotive industry and road transport". Cop26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero-emission cars and vans," she added. "Together, we are committing to rapidly accelerating the transition to zero-emission vehicles to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by agreeing that we will work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission by no later than 2035. "Across these islands, we have already seen significant innovation in transport decarbonisation, specifically in relation to zero-emission vehicles. Key investment in innovative projects is delivering new vehicle and infrastructure technologies. "These projects are providing economic benefits such as job creation and are unlocking private investment to support new technologies to come to market." Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will begin to be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century, but countries' plans for this decade leave the world well off track. The draft deal was published after analysis warned that existing plans for this decade put the world on track for 2.4C of warming - well above the goals internationally agreed in the Paris accord to curb temperature rises to "well below" 2C and to try and limit them to 1.5C. Cop26 president Alok Sharma has made it clear that there is no attempt to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but the draft document says the impact of climate change will be much lower with 1.5C of warming than 2C. It "resolves to pursue efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C", which will require more action this decade. The draft urges countries to "revisit and strengthen" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris temperature goal, which still covers both numbers, by the end of 2022. The document published yesterday also urged countries to set out their long-term strategies by the end of next year to reach net-zero emissions by about mid-century. \</doc>

Sir, - The successful launch of the Webb telescope adds another significant achievement to the long list of technological milestones in humanity's recent evolution ("New Nasa telescope launched on journey 'back to the birth of the universe'", Online, December 25th). As we witness the deployment as further evidence of human progress, the irony cannot be lost that while this drama plays out in deep space, closer to home we struggle to come to grips with the existential threat to human civilisation as we know it. Despite the hugely anticipated Cop26 meeting in October, global emissions continue to rise and needless destruction of the natural world is relentless. The pursuit of growth as some ideological sacred cow is blinding us to the impending catastrophe. We continue to lack the political will to acknowledge that consumer capitalism is leading us to the edge of a climate and biodiversity abyss. The Webb telescope may give us the ability to look back in time to try and understand our place in the universe, but we don't need technology to know what faces us if a radical pivot is not made. All of our marvellous technological progress is worth nought if we haven't the honesty to face up to this. - Yours, etc, BARRY WALSH, Blackrock, Cork. \</doc>

The chair of the Elders Mary Robinson has pointed the finger at countries who can help secure a more ambitious outcome at Cop26 but are not pushing for it sufficiently - and accused some of the world's major carbon emitters of blocking progress. "Some of the leaders at Cop26 who could do most are not in crisis mode," the former president said in media interviews. In contrast, she said poorer countries, notably those in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, were "in crisis mindset" and seeking a meaningful outcome. She warned global leaders: "This is on your watch . . . It's so important. We are literally talking about having a safe future. You can't negotiate with science. You can't talk about a glass being half-full. We have to get it down. We have to be on track to 1.5 degrees, and it is doable." Speaking to The Irish Times, she identified Saudi Arabia, Russia, Brazil, China and Australia as having not made sufficient commitments, and often being the main blockers to progress - though she accepted China often under-promised but over-performed, which was the opposite to many countries in the western world including Ireland. Mrs Robinson accused Saudi Arabia of "playing dirty games" in taking language out of a lot of texts, which included "the language of youth, human rights, gender, equality, sustainability", because not enough countries were in the negotiating room. Crisis mode "Australia, a wealthy country, is still in fossil fuels mode, not in crisis mode," she said. She added countries who were members of the High Ambition Coalition, which includes the EU and now the US, should highlight shortcomings in the draft text, "which is not actually aligning us with 1.5 [degrees]." In other developments, Ireland has backed international declarations on transport which will facilitate accelerated decarbonisation of road transport, shipping and aviation over the next 20 years. The endorsements at Cop26 - to make commitments on zero-emission cars, reducing fossil fuels in aviation and "green shipping lanes" - are all consistent with Ireland's ambitions across these modes of transport as set out in the Government's new climate action plan, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said. Zero emissions A UK-sponsored declaration commits to accelerating the transition to 100 per cent zero-emission cars and vans, and calls on automotive manufacturers, businesses, financial investors and governments to work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero-emissions by 2040, or by 2035, in leading markets. The Minister announced EUR 60 million is to be provided for community climate action projects across Ireland and the launch of a new national dialogue on climate action. The funding is to "support and empower communities to shape and build low-carbon, sustainable communities in a coherent way". Possible projects might include community EV charging points, small renewable energy projects, community EVs, cycle parking, repair hubs and community biodiversity gardens, he said. The Minister also launched a new national dialogue on climate action. It will facilitate public engagement, participation, community action, networking and capacity-building activities relating to climate action. \</doc>

ALMOST every country on Earth could experience extremely hot years every other year by 2030, according to new research highlighting the outsized contribution of emissions from the world's major polluters. The researchers found that 92% of 165 countries studied are expected to experience extremely hot annual temperatures, defined as a once-in-100-year hot year in the pre-industrial era, every two years. The modelling study combined data on historical emissions and pledges made before the COP26 climate summit for cuts from the top five emitters - China, the US, the EU, India and Russia - to make regional warming predictions by 2030. Speaking about the findings, Alexander Nauels of Climate Analytics, who coauthored the study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, told AFP: 'It just really shows the urgency and how we're heading into a world that is just so much hotter for everybody.' Lead author Lea Beusch, of the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich university, said the study found £ clear imprint' of the actions of top emitters on the regional scale. 'This is I think very important, because we usually talk about these abstract quantities of emissions, or global temperatures, which we know about, but we can't really feel,' she said. The researchers found the biggest impact in terms of the frequency of extremely hot years in tropical Africa. However, the authors of the study also stressed that the prediction for the frequency of extreme years could be changed if countries significantly step up efforts to cut pollution. \</doc>

BOTH expectations and emotions were running high at the beginning of Cop26 this week, and understandably so. The stakes are stacked for world leaders gathered in Glasgow. In days leading up to the climate conference, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry commented that the Glasgow summit represented the "last best hope for the world to get its act together". World leaders will not only set the agenda for national and international climate commitments, but also the direction of our futures. While many were highly sceptical of Cop26 before the conference had even began, as a young climate activist I have engaged in these climate negotiations as a stubborn Coptimist. #COPtimism is a hashtag trending on social media, spreading a message of hope while driving a desire for engagement, contribution, and commitment from world leaders at Cop26 . Let me assure you that this is not a blind hope. #COPtimism represents both an acknowledgement of the monumental challenge we face in Glasgow, and a gritty determination to meet that challenge. In some ways, small wins over the past few days at Cop26 have given many reasons for Coptimists to remain hopeful. We have seen a global commitment to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, and to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. This is no small feat. Nature is our most powerful ally, and the 100-plus countries who have committed to ending deforestation represent 85% of our global forests. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon also came forward with a \£31m pledge to help developing countries affected by "loss and damage" from climate change. The First Minister commented that this money will come from the Scottish Government's \£36m-a-year Climate Justice Fund. The Climate Justice Fund supports decarbonisation projects outside Scotland, in countries like Malawi and Zambia. Scotland is the first nation to pledge funding for vulnerable communities to repair and rebuild from climate-related incidents, such as wild fires and severe floods. Despite some raised eyebrows at the amount which has been pledged, this financial commitment is highly relevant. Some impacts caused by the climate crisis are already unavoidable. Unfortunately, we need to think about mitigation and adaption strategies, as well as how to continue to build resilience. While climate finance is a major theme for this Cop, we are still waiting for other richer nations to come forward with higher levels of both ambition and action. There is clearly a cost of this inaction. As Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley explained in her opening address: "The failure to create financial loss and damage is measured by [ ] lives and livelihoods of our communities. This is immoral and it is unjust." Notably, this same question of justice has been inextricably woven into climate negotiations this week. In his address to world leaders, Sir David Attenborough declared that "this story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today those who have done the least to cause this problem have been the hardest hit". Ms Sturgeon echoed Sir David's sentiment, commenting that: "Scotland continues to proudly support nations which - despite having done the least to cause climate change - are already suffering its impact." What strikes me about the First Minister's words, as well as the conference itself, is this sense of national purpose and pride. In an interview before the conference, Ms Sturgeon talks about wanting Scotland to "lead by example", positing this idea of "small countries" harnessing "big vision". Although we must recognise that we cannot solve this crisis without contributions from bigger countries too, small countries can clearly be entrepreneurial and creative in finding solutions and opportunities. On both an individual and corporate level, there is often a problem of people feeling "too small" to make a difference in the face of climate crisis. However, we can still play an important role - however small - in our collective efforts to address this global challenge. There is undoubtedly an exciting role for small countries to play as pioneers of innovation. Northern Ireland has an opportunity to show the rest of the world that we are not too small to make a difference. We talk a lot about the race to net zero emissions by 2050, and Northern Ireland is losing this race. We do not have a Climate Bill with legally binding emission targets, and we have the least protected environment in the UK and Ireland. We need to flex our muscles in Northern Ireland, and position ourselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis, rather than part of the problem. Our political leaders need to dramatically raise our ambition, and come together through strong, meaningful partnerships to restore our planet. What better national narrative for our leaders to unite around than solving the climate crisis? What better political mission for our leaders to push than securing a better future for humanity? What better legacy for our leaders to leave than the creation of a fairer, more sustainable world? As Sir David points out, the solutions are already there. We know how to stop climate change, and how to reverse it. This is a question of political will. Some groups in Northern Ireland underestimate whether we can achieve net zero at the same time as the rest of the UK. I would argue that we do not have a choice. We need to act as if the future of humanity depended on it. Because it does. Rosalind Skillen is a climate activist from Belfast and member of the Cop26 Future Leaders Network delegation \</doc>

UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres gave a mixed verdict on the climate change agreements reached at the Group of 20 summit, saying he hopes for more ambitious commitments to be made at the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow. G20 leaders agreed during their two-day meeting in Rome on ending financing for new overseas coal plants but did not set a specific year for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Group of Seven rich democracies have set 2050 for achieving that goal, while G20 members China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have set 2060. "I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled, but at least they are not buried," Mr Guterres tweeted. "Onwards to # Cop26 in Glasgow to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive and to implement promises on finance and adaptation for people & planet." Mr Guterres told the G20 that "greater ambition" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions was needed to put the world on a path to hold the global average temperature increase to 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century. The difference might seem slight, but the UN's scientific committee has underlined that the disruption from climate effects such as rising seas and extreme weather are much less at 1.5C than at 2C. \</doc>

Experts have suggested the "pomp and celebrity" of annual Cop global climate summits detract from the ability to make focused progress and that they should be held every second year instead. Speaking at a webinar hosted by the Institute of International & European Affairs and ESB, experts reflected on Cop26 , held in Glasgow last month, and lessons learned going forward. Connie Hedegaard, former European commissioner for climate action, proposed that the large-scale climate summ it should only be held every second year in future. "It's time to rethink the Cop system slightly," she said. "It is so good that they mobilise people but it also creates false expectations that each year something fantastic and new can be delivered, and that is unfortunately not the way the UN system works." Ms Hedegaard proposed that every second year should be a smaller-scale event, focused on a single issue such as adaption, loss and damage, or financing, which are problems so "big and complicated that they do not get the attention that they deserve at each Cop". Sin\'e9ad Walsh, climate director with the Department of Foreign Affairs, agreed that "maybe we don't need to have the big hullabaloo every year". She pointed out the extensive resources needed to prepare Ireland's heads of State for annual speeches and negotiations. However, Dr Walsh said the annual pressure to appear at Cop is often what pushes states to "go further" than they would otherwise. Dr Walsh also highlighted that the visibility of Cop as a meeting of world leaders is a huge driver of domestic climate action. "We have to remember that a big benefit of Cop is the conversation that it generates back home," she said. "Climate action will take place in domestic contexts in domestic political arenas and that's a 12-month challenge for all of us, it doesn't just happen in the two weeks of Cop." Alicia O'Sullivan, a law student and Quercus scholar in University College Cork who represented UCC and World YMCA at Cop26 , also supported the idea of a variation on the "chaotic" and "unfocused" climate summit. "Trying to do everything at once can lead to confusion and people leaving Cop with 600 different variations of what happened," she said. "I think public participation, and civil society being there in some respect physically, absolutely has to happen, but I also think that to focus and to create solutions to the real hard-hitting problems you do have to have a scale back. I think we were just trying to do everything at once, and I think it became unfocused." \</doc>

More than five billion people could have difficulty accessing water in 2050, the United Nations warned today, urging leaders to seize the initiative at the COP26 summit. Already in 2018, 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water for at least one month per year, said a new report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization. "We need to wake up to the looming water crisis," said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. The State of Climate Services 2021: Water report comes just weeks before COP26 - the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November. The WMO stressed that over the last 20 years, the levels of water stored on land - on the surface, in the subsurface, in snow and ice - had dropped at a rate of one centimetre per year. The biggest losses are in Antarctica and Greenland, but many highly-populated lower latitude locations are experiencing significant water losses in areas that traditionally provide water supply, said the WMO. "Increasing temperatures are resulting in global and regional precipitation changes, leading to shifts in rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, with a major impact on food security and human health and well-being," said Mr Taalas. 'We cannot wait' Meanwhile, water-related hazards have increased in frequency over the past 20 years. Since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134% compared with the previous two decades. "We have 7% more humidity in the atmosphere because of the current warming and that's also contributing to the flooding," Mr Taalas told a press conference. Most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in Asia, where river flood warning systems require strengthening, said the WMO. At the same time, there has been around a 30% increase in the amount and duration of drought events since 2000, with Africa the worst-affected continent. Mr Taalas urged countries at COP26 to raise their game. He said most world leaders were talking about climate change as a major risk to the welfare of mankind, but their actions were not matching their words. "We cannot wait for decades to start acting," he said. "That's also a message for countries like China which has said that they would like to become carbon neutral by 2060 but they don't have a concrete plan for the coming decade." He said the top priority at COP26 was stepping up ambition levels in climate mitigation, but more work was also needed on climate adaptations, as the negative trend in weather patterns will continue for the coming decades - and the coming centuries when it comes to the melting of glaciers and sea levels rising. \</doc>

GRETA THUNBERG lambasted world leaders yesterday, accusing them of too much 'blah blah blah' on green issues. The 18-year-old Swede chastised Boris Johnson and other politicians for 'empty words and promises' as she opened a youth climate summit in Italy. She later accused Britain of 'more or less' starting the climate crisis, telling Sky News: 'That's where the industrial revolution started. We started to burn coal there, so of course the UK has an enormous historical responsibility... the climate crisis is a cumulative crisis.' Hosting Cop26 Ms Thunberg spoke as thousands of young people converged on Youth4Climate in Milan this week, with 400 attendees from 190 countries set to meet policymakers to tackle global warming. Their proposals will be vetted by climate and energy ministers who are gathering at the same venue for their pre- Cop26 meeting later in the week, and the best will be sent on for consideration at the November summit in Glasgow. Ms Thunberg, who leads the global protest movement Fridays for Future, said emissions are still rising and the 'science doesn't lie'. Asked whether she expected much from the talks, she said: 'To be honest, not a lot... we are expecting it to be just like any other meeting, with lots of talking.' Echoing an April speech by Mr Johnson, who will host Cop26 , she chided: 'This is not about some expensive politically correct dream of bunny hugging, or build back better, blah blah blah, green economy, blah blah blah, net zero by 2050, blah blah blah, climate neutral blah blah blah.' To warm applause, she said: 'This is all we hear from our so-called leaders: words, words that sound great but so far have led to no action, our hopes and dreams drowned in their empty words and promises. Of course we need constructive dialogue, but they have now had 30 years of blah, blah blah. And where has this led us? Emissions are still rising. The science doesn't lie.' Cop26 is being billed as vital for the viability of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims for a warming cap of 1.5C. But six years later, there is no agreement as to how it will work in practice. The United Nations this month said the latest round of country emissions reductions plans still puts Earth on course for a 'catastrophic' 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.

Keith Lambkin of Met \'c9ireann's Climate Division has said that the data supplied by weather stations around the country will help provide "climate services" to ensure the country is "climate prepared". Speaking from the Cop26 conference in Glasgow on RT\'c9 radio's Morning Ireland, Mr Lambkin explained that climate data assists with predictive models which can help in making decisions such as what types of trees to plant, drainage and how high walls should be built and the impact all these decisions will have 50 years in the future. Met \'c9ireann's weather station at the Valentia Island observatory has been collecting data since 1860 and is one of a number of "centennial" weather stations identified by the UN, he added. Such data identifies climate signals and will be very important into the future. AdvertisementData from Valentia over the past 100 to 120 years has revealed that the average temperature in Ireland has increased by one degree which is "roughly in line" with the global average, said Mr Lambkin. Mr Lambin said that the message that will come from Cop26 is that "sums need to add up" and that the promises made under the Paris Agreement are fully funded under a legal framework which will ensure that targets are met. \</doc>

Cop26 president Alok Sharma told last night's opening session of the crunch climate summit in Glasgow that it is the last, best chance to keep temperature limits to 1.5C. The last seven years since 2015, when countries secured the Paris Agreement to curb temperature rises to 1.5C or well below 2C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, have been the hottest in records dating to 1850. This year is likely to end up being the fifth to seventh hottest year on record. While it is not quite as hot as some recent years, due to a La Nina weather phenomenon in the Pacific, it still averaged 1.09C above pre-industrial levels, the WMO said. Mr Sharma told delegates: "The rapidly-changing climate is sounding an alarm to the world to step up on adaptation, to address loss and damage, and to act now to keep 1.5 alive. "We know that this Cop, Cop26 , is our last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach." He warned the window to keeping temperatures to 1.5C - beyond which scientists warn the most dangerous impacts of climate change, rising seas and extreme weather will be felt - was closing. Pointing to devastating impacts around the world, including droughts, heat-waves, hurricanes, and floods, he said: "We know our shared planet is changing for the worse, and we can only address that together through this international system." Mr Sharma said he believed that the conference could resolve the outstanding issues that need to be agreed to implement the Paris deal, "move the negotiations forward and launch a decade of ever-increasing ambition and action". "Together we can seize the enormous opportunities for green growth for good, green jobs for cheaper, cleaner power," he said. "We need to hit the ground running to develop the solutions that we need. And that work starts today - and we succeed or fail as one." Concluding his speech, he said: "If we act now, and we act together, we can protect our precious planet. So, let's come together in these two weeks and ensure that where Paris promised, Glasgow delivers." At the formal opening of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa told delegates that the world stood at a "pivotal point in history". "Humanity faces stark but clear choices," she said. "We either choose to achieve rapid and large-scale reductions of limiting emissions to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, or we accept that humanity faces a bleak future on this planet." She said people can either adapt to deal with weather disasters, or "accept that more people will die, more families will suffer and more economic harm will follow". Editorial: 10 \</doc>

The climate agreement Fiona Harvey The Cop26 climate conference goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C will be based on five key strands. Current national plans on cutting emissions by 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are inadequate to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, and according to analysis published during the talks would lead to a disastrous 2.4C of heating. Only one major emitter - India - produced a new NDC at the talks, so the work of getting NDCs in line with a 1.5C goal was always going to stretch beyond the end of the Glasgow summit. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, nations are only required to return every five years to set new NDCs - and in 2025 are scheduled to discuss NDCs for beyond 2030. Sticking to that timetable would take the world well beyond 1.5C, so one of the crucial aims was to draw up a roadmap for swifter revisions. That was achieved. The question of revising NDCs will be on the agenda for next year's Cop in Egypt. Coal Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and the International Energy Agency has made clear if it is not rapidly phased out the world has no hope of staying within 1.5C of global heating. To hit the target, at least 40% of the world's 8,500 coal-fired power plants must close by 2030 and no new ones built. One of the hardest-fought phrases in the text produced at Glasgow was a commitment to "phase down" coal-fired power generation. Originally that was a phaseout, but India insisted on the change, despite pleas from other developing countries. It may seem incredible, given how central fossil fuels are to the climate crisis, but since the Kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 no Cop decision has made a direct reference to phasing out fossil fuels. So even the watered-down commitment was welcomed as a major step forward. Adaptation and climate finance Rich countries agreed in 2009 that poor countries would receive at least $100bn a year from 2020, from public and private sources, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. But by 2019, the latest year for which data is available, only $80bn flowed. Developing countries are angered by this, which was reflected at the talks, and have been promised that increases will follow in the next five years that will bring the finance for the next five years to $500bn. Crucially, they also want more of the cash to be spent on adaptation, rather than emissions cuts. Loss and damage Loss and damage refer to the ravages of the climate crisis that are too destructive for countries to prevent or adapt to them - hurricanes and cyclones, for instance, or the inundation of low-lying areas by storm surges. Many developing countries were hoping Cop26 could provide a further step towards some form of funding mechanism for loss and damage. That has not happened, and the issue will return to the talks next year. Reaffirming the Paris Agreement Some countries came to Glasgow opposed to stronger action and tried to suggest that focusing on 1.5C was "reopening the Paris agreement", the main goal of which is to hold temperature rises "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels while "pursuing efforts" to limit rises to 1.5C. There are also repeated references in the text to "the best available science", which has moved on since the Paris agreement to show even more clearly that 1.5C is much safer than 2C and that every fraction of a degree counts. So the argument at Glasgow was firmly won in favour of 1.5C - in itself an achievement. " Guardian \</doc>

More than 100 world leaders will sign up to a landmark agreement to protect and restore the Earth's forests. On the second day of the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow on Tuesday, leaders covering 85 per cent of the world's forests will commit to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030. But there were warnings that commitments needed to be delivered on, and standing forests must be protected, as well as there being a focus on restoring forests.

Professor Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, said tackling deforestation is an essential component of keeping global warming below 1.5C. "It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey," adding that it was particularly welcome that indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests. "However, the real challenge is not in making the announcements, but in delivering synergistic and interlocking policies and actions that really do drive down deforestation globally. Advertisement"Careful monitoring of the delivery of each initiative is essential for success," he said. Roberto Waack, Brazilian business leader and biologist and visiting fellow at international affairs think tank Chatham House, said: "The deal is a significant milestone on the road to protecting our precious forests and tackling the climate crisis. "The deal combines action to stop deforestation with support for indigenous peoples who are the forest's staunchest defenders. It also includes action to establish stronger sustainable forest economies. "Today we celebrate - tomorrow we will start pressing for the deal to be delivered." \</doc>

As COP26 got under way in Glasgow earlier this month, the global advertising community took stock of what it could do to help mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Given that the advertising industry was one of the engines that powered consumerism and consumption in the past, it also has a very important role to play in the future. While various professional advertising and marketing trade bodies around the world organised their own conferences and webinars to coincide with COP26 , the UK-based but pan-European organisation called the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN) fired off a petition to the leading social media companies calling on them to stamp out climate misinformation which, it alleged, is rampant on their platforms. While some of this misinformation was being spread by the usual crackpot climate deniers, it has become increasingly clear that more sophisticated actors have started to use these platforms to advertise and peddle their views, most of which start with the premise that climate change is one big fat hoax. Research carried out by Stop Funding Heat, a group which is concerned about how some media outlets, wittingly or unwittingly, reinforce these views, shows that many of these ads had appeared on Facebook in the months leading up to COP26 . Now, where have we heard this before? If we re-wind a few weeks to early October, Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager-turned-whistleblower, opened-up a can of worms for the platform when she claimed the company put profits before public good. She also claimed "the version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world". Possibly the most damaging allegation she made, however, was that the company was aware of the damage Instagram was causing to teen mental health and wellbeing yet did nothing to rectify it. Haugen is by no means the first person to have a go at Facebook and she certainly won't be the last. Cyber-psychologists, former founders and investors, politicians and presidents, suicide prevention experts, data protection authorities and civil rights organisations have all had reason to complain about Facebook at some stage over the last 10 years. One voice that has been conspicuously absent from the debate is the advertising industry. Apart from the recent petition by CAN and two separate and temporary boycotts - in 2020 to coincide with the Stop Funding Hate initiative and in 2019 after it livestreamed the Christchurch mass-murder - the advertising industry has largely refrained from passing any kind of judgment on Facebook. This is quite extraordinary for an industry that constantly dines out on social purpose and talks a lot about authenticity and transparency. Could it be that the two are co-dependent on each other to such an extent that both have a lot to lose? On the one hand Facebook is almost wholly dependent on advertising. In 2020, for example, it generated $84.2bn ((EURO)74.2bn) from advertising alone. That's a lot of advertisers and advertising agencies which it is beholden to. Indeed many of the large international advertising networks, consultancies and their subsidiaries are also beholden to the digital platforms like Facebook and Google. In fact, it would be hard to find an international network or consultancy group that doesn't count Facebook, Google or one of the other digital platforms or their subsidiaries as a client. So, not only are these digital giants the recipients of the substantial investment that is made in advertising, but they are also big spenders when it comes to marketing and advertising their own wares. Knowing which side its bread is buttered on, is it any wonder that the advertising industry has kept relatively schtum for so long? Frances Haugen's recent revelations about Facebook, however, have been likened by many to a Big Tobacco moment. It's an apt analogy. Surely the advertising industry must know what comes next? \</doc>

Today's newborns need to emit 10 times less than grandparents Children born today will have to emit less than 10 times the emissions of their grandparents if global netzero climate targets are to be reached by 2050, analysis by energy experts shows. International Energy Agency (IEA) modellers and analysts calculated the burden on the children of today by predicting the average lifetime carbon footprint, according to a person's year of birth. Laura Cozzi, Olivia Chen, and Hyeji Kim used the IEA's own Net zero by 2050 roadmap from May 2021 -- which sets out the very narrow global path to balancing the amount of greenhouse gases produced against those removed from the atmosphere -- to make their calculations. "In the IEA scenario where the world manages to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the average person born in the 1950s would emit 350 tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime. "Babies born in the 2020s would emit on average a mere 34 tonnes of CO2 each in the net-zero scenario. "In other words, the average Baby Boomer -- defined by the Pew Center as individuals born between 1950 and 1964 -- would emit 10 times more in their lifetime than the average member of Generation Alpha, which refers to those born today or in the coming years. "Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, would average 110 tonnes of CO2 over their lifetimes if the world manages to reach netzero by 2050," the authors said. Reductions will need to be greater in countries with historically high rates of emissions, the analysis found. "Countries with historically high per capita emissions, such as in North America and Europe, need to achieve much larger generational reductions than countries with historically low per capita emissions, such as India. "In our net zero emissions by 2050 scenario, the lifetime CO2 footprints of individuals born in the US or EU in the 1950s will be around 15 times greater than the footprints of their descendants born in the 2020s," it said. Encouragingly, today's generations are far more active in tackling the climate crisis, the authors said -- but that requires current governments and leaders to accelerate action to match the enthusiasm of young people. "Clean energy technologies require years of research and development to reach market. "Sweeping systemic decarbonisation is necessary, not only to allow younger generations more flexibility in their lifestyle choices but also to safeguard the future for younger generations. "This makes it imperative that today's leaders set in motion the necessary policies and investments right now," the authors said. The stark findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in the summer led to a range of new commitments at the UN climate change summit Cop26 in Glasgow in November. The IPCC report said the global temperature in 2020 was nearly 1.1C warmer than 19th-century levels, and that the evidence was clear and incontrovertible that people are driving global warming. \</doc>

THE head of the only Irish university delegation at COP26 has said the "penny has still not dropped" for most people about the kind of action needed on the climate crisis. Professor Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir is leading a group of academics and researchers from University College Cork (UCC) attending the UN climate summit in Glasgow. He said despite the scale of the event, its core message had not filtered down to much of the public and many people in policymaking roles. "What really strikes me, not just in an Irish context but internationally, is that the penny hasn't dropped at all about what we need to do both in terms of changing things so that we are not releasing massive amounts of emissions, but also in terms of adapting to climate change," he said. Prof \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir, whose expertise is in energy engineering, took part in a seminar on climate change and health at COP26 . He has worked with the World Health Organisation's healthy cities programme, applying the principles to planning and infrastructure in Cork. The seminar heard that state authorities will have to prepare for the health impacts of extreme weather, in particular the rise in temperatures even in relatively cool countries in western and northern Europe. New UCC research published to coincide with COP26 has also found a startling link between mental health issues and extreme weather events. Researchers found the odds of developing mental health issues were 90pc higher for people exposed to extreme weather events - which are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Lead author Dr Jean O'Dwyer said: "This research highlights the somewhat hidden impacts of the climate crisis and emphasises that this global challenge comes with very local and personal consequences. "Whether you're in Ireland or Indonesia, if an extreme weather event threatens your home, your livelihood or your physical health, it will almost certainly impact your mental health too." Prof \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said there not only needed to be physical protections against extreme weather, such as flood barriers, but also a complete rethink of how society operated. "We talk about the technical fixes - switching to an electric vehicle rather than not driving - when so much of the transformation that's required in consumption is one that we haven't started to grapple with. UCC has a think-tank project with political scientists, engineers, philosophers, historians and other experts all focused on the issue of system change. Prof \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said it was looking at "the deep underlying inbuilt institutional system flaws that we have". "The systems, not just in terms of climate but in other areas - think of Covid - are not fit for purpose for the world in which we are living. We need to have a rethink," he said. States will have to prepare for health impacts of extreme weather Core message had not filtered down to much of the public \</doc>

TAOISEACH Miche\'e1l Martin has delivered his strongest arguments yet for climate action, signalling to critics in his own party and the opposition that there is no pulling back from the tough measures that lie ahead. Mr Martin will address the world leaders meeting at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow today, setting out his stall in front of the biggest gathering of heads of state seen in years. He will tell the gathering Ireland is pushing ahead with climate action through policy, law, finance and mechanisms such as carbon budgets. He will urge other countries to do the same and will insist that the poorest and most vulnerable nations are assisted by the richer to build resilience to the impacts of dangerous global warming. The two-day meeting of almost 120 heads of state comes at the start of a fortnight of intensive negotiations between 192 nations that ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement with the aim of achieving sufficient cuts to greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C. The collective effort has been inadequate and more dramatic cuts are now needed to keep the goal within sights. Speaking in advance of his appearance, Mr Martin said it was time for "action matching the rhetoric". He said he drew hope from the scale of involvement by world leaders in COP26 that real change was possible. But he also acknowledged that, on the home front, momentum was in danger of being stymied by scepticism around the relative costs and benefits of climate action. He launched a firm defence of the carbon tax which was raised again in the Budget, drawing criticism from the opposition and rumblings of discontent within his own backbench. Mr Martin said it was opposed by some "for electoral reasons" and stressed it was important for disincentivising fossil fuels while boosting revenues for spending on climate action programmes. "It gives valuable resources to Government to invest in retrofitting, for example, to invest in more environmentally friendly farming," he said. "We want to create income systems that reward farmers for protecting biodiversity, for protecting our water ways and for creating food production systems that will be less harmful in terms of emissions." Facing down the agrifood sector is a major challenge for the Government which is due to publish the revised climate action plan with a range of emission limits for individual sectors of society on Thursday. Ireland is signing up to an EU-US-led pact launched at COP26 to reduce global methane emissions by 30pc by 2030. That puts further pressure on Irish farming, which produces a third of the country's total emissions. There is not full agreement within Fianna F\'e1il on some of the higher emission limits proposed for agriculture, even though they are lower than the average of 45pc-50pc cuts set to be imposed on other sectors. Mr Martin said no economic activity would be untouched by the climate crisis. "It will not be economically sustainable to carry on the way we are carrying on, either nationally or globally," he said. He said, however, that there was work to be done to win over the public to this view. "We have to work with people and bring people with us. There is a significant communications campaign required." Mr Martin spent much of yesterday in informal meetings with other heads of state, including US President Joe Biden, who reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday Agreement as tensions continue over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol. He also attended a world leaders £ction and solidarity' event at which he confirmed the Government's pledge to more than double Ireland's contribution to climate finance for developing countries from (EURO)93m a year currently to (EURO)225m by 2025. "In acting as a global community, climate justice must be at the centre of our efforts. Countries and communities struggling to cope already must have our support," he told the round-table event hosted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He said: "We must have the courage to take action now and collectively secure a safe and sustainable planet for generations to come. "We have a unique opportunity before us to step up our ambition to turn the tide on climate change." \</doc>

Funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) and delivered by KNIB, the initiative aims to inform teachers, youth leaders and young people about the future challenges of climate change and, importantly, how they can take positive action to be part of the solution. Teachers who participate in the training will also be well placed to deliver a new Open College Network accredited GCSE entitled \' Reducing Carbon Footprints Through Environmental Action\' . The initiative follows the first ever Carbon Literacy Day, organised by the Carbon Literacy Project, which coincided with the first day of the UN COP26 negotiations in Glasgow last month. The Carbon Literacy training is designed to build confidence, knowledge, skills and motivation to empower individuals and organisations to play a critical role in responding to the climate crisis. KNIB aims to help embed Carbon Literacy education into schools across Northern Ireland, to change lifestyles and promote behaviour that leads to positive, individual action in reducing carbon emissions. The programmes, which include \' Carbon Literacy for Teachers,\' \' Carbon Smart Students,\' \' Carbon Literacy for Youth Leaders,\' and \' Carbon Smart Youth Groups,\' will deliver targeted training to teachers, youth leaders and young people in a variety of settings. Commenting on the new programme, Environment Minister Edwin Poots said:  My department is investing in Carbon Literacy programmes to help educate this and future generations about the threat of climate change and the impact their day-to-day behaviour has on our climate.  Delivered by Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, the project will help people improve their knowledge and understanding of carbon and how their daily activities like travel, energy use and food consumption impact on emissions. They can then better understand the positive changes they need to make in terms of how they live, study and work, both as individuals and organisations, to help in the fight against climate change. Research has shown that 75% of teachers say they feel they have not received adequate training to educate students about climate change, while 69% of teachers feel there should be more teaching about climate change in schools. Meanwhile 68% of pupils want to learn more about the environment and climate change. Dr Ian Humphreys, Chief Executive of Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful said:  Having recently returned from the COP26 conference, it is clear that more and more young people are demanding information and action in response to the climate emergency. We need to see environmental education becoming a formalised part of the Northern Ireland curriculum and we can\' t afford to wait years to see this happen. In the mean-time the carbon literacy programmes will provide vital training for educators and young people and our hope is that they will then go on to influence others. Lorraine McCool, a teacher from Loreto College in Coleraine, who has already taken part in the training, said;  My Carbon Literacy Programme training was extremely useful and interesting, with excellent support offered both during and after the course. I\' m now much more confident in discussing climate issues with my students, and excited for the changes that I can make in my own life from what I\' ve learned. I highly recommend Carbon Literacy training to anyone who works with young people. The Carbon Literacy Programmes are delivered in partnership with the registered charity, the Carbon Literacy Trust, which was founded in 2009 and operates in 14 countries worldwide. Schools and community groups, teachers and youth leaders across County Derry who are interested in booking a place on a Carbon Literacy training course should visit: HYPERLINK https://www.keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org/carbonliteracy https://www.keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org/carbonliteracy If you are interested in finding out more about the Carbon Literacy accredited programmes and/or the Open College Network GCSE \' Reducing Carbon Footprints Through Environmental Action\' email HYPERLINK mailto:kate.gormley@keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org kate.gormley@keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org or HYPERLINK mailto:scott.howes@keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org scott.howes@keepnorthernirelandbeautiful.org \</doc>

The COP26 climate conference continues in Glasgow today examining issues around energy and coal in particular. It is one of the areas the UK government wanted to make progress in on the run-up to the event. There has already been an announcement of finance to help South Africa transition away from its use of coal for power generation. The UK will spearhead a non-binding deal among at least 19 countries to end the financing of fossil fuel projects abroad. The burning of coal, oil and gas over decades since the Industrial Revolution is mainly responsible for the carbon dioxide emissions causing climate change. More countries also may join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, led by Denmark and Costa Rica. But that effort, which commits members to phasing out fossil fuel production within their own borders, will formally be launched until next week. Poland, Vietnam, Chile and other countries will pledge today to phase out coal-fuelled power generation and stop building new plants, in a deal the UK said would commit 190 nations and organisations to quit the fuel. COP26 President Alok Sharma has urged delegates to make this UN climate summit the one where rich nations "consign coal power to history". Banks and other financial institutions including the ADB, Citi and HSBC are also expected to step up to the call, announcing financial mechanisms to help countries quit coal. Earlier this week, countries including the United States revealed plans to crack down on emissions of methane, the second-biggest cause of climate change after CO2 emissions. More than 100 nations pledged to slash methane emissions by 2030 from 2020 levels. But as the world ditches dirty fuels, there is urgent need to boost renewable energy sources. Solar and wind power, along with clean-burning green hydrogen, will come into the conversation, as well as projects aimed at capturing and keeping carbon emissions from the atmosphere. For industries unable to decarbonise immediately, some of these developing technologies are seen as key. HYPERLINK Latest COP26 Major companies have been asked to join the "Race to Zero" pledge to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. UN climate envoy Mark Carney said yesterday that private finance was set to help with that goal through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, whose members control assets worth $130 trillion. Delegates are also still wrangling over the rules around Article 6, the section of the UN Convention on Climate Change that deals with markets for trading carbon emissions that continue to be emitted. One of the toughest tasks will be in synchronising global rules around these markets, as well as in agreeing on a global price for carbon. Set too low, the price would offer little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; but a price set too high could end up stymieing industry. Yesterday, banks and finance companies promised to channel "trillions" of dollars towards meeting climate change goals by 2050. There is cautious optimism that progress can be made at the summit with Mr Sharma saying the energy brought by world leaders at the outset is being replicated in the negotiating rooms.

IHAD a little smile, this week, at the announcement by Stormont leaders that it was "important that the voice of Northern Ireland should be heard" at the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow. Amid the roar of billionaires' private jets landing, the cacophony of statements from the rich, the famous, the world's leaders and Earth's eco elite, it might be hard enough, I thought, for little old us to get a word in edgeways. Still you have to admire the chutzpah of the Executive. Stand aside Sir David Attenborough, make way Greta Thunberg - the planet may be at risk but Stormont is on the ball. Flying into the conference were our two top caped crusaders, Super-DUPer Man, Paul Givan and Wonder Woman, Michelle O'Neill. "The Executive stands ready to play its part in this global response," declared Michelle. Given that this is the same Executive which can't even deliver a shopping voucher scheme without messing up, poor old Mother Nature may not see that offer as the sturdiest of straws to be clutched at. The hypocrisy in Glasgow this week was eye-watering. Somewhere in the region of 400 private jets flew in for a conference on how to curtail harmful emissions. There were thousands of attendees, billionaires, politicians and their enormous retinues of spads and specialists, plus business leaders and the world's media (the American section of which, strangely, chose to hang out in Edinburgh). Anybody who was anybody was there - along with everybody who has everything. Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates were centre stage. Prince Charles. Leonardo DiCaprio. Joe Biden was ferried to the gig in a limo that does a mere eight miles to the gallon (petrol). Outside, an unusually cheery-looking Greta Thunberg was thrilling fans with her trademark "blaa, blaa, blaa" chant and some bad words. Boris Johnston said it was one minute to midnight. If even half conference attendees had stayed at home we could maybe have squeaked another minute out of it. How much will COP26 actually achieve in the long run? China's Xi Jingping and Russia's Mr Putin, representing two of the world's major polluters, stayed away however. And for many of the world's poorer developing nations, while zero emissions is seen as a fine aim, there's the small question of how their already meagre economies stretch to the changes required. Big business has jumped on the sustainable bandwagon but is accused of rampant "greenraised washing" i.e. posing as environmentally sound whilst being nothing of the sort. In much of the world of commerce, "green" is a marketing strategy not a principle. Outside the conference Greta Thunberg - who dismissed whatever the eff (her word) world leaders were doing in there - suggested that she and her over-excited followers might be able to effect change without intergovernmental assistance. I'm not so sure. People power is a great thing. But right now people are wearied with message overkill - all that preaching and "awareness raising." Is there anybody, anywhere whose awareness has not been about climate change? There's a fine line between raising people's awareness and raising their blood pressure. The numpties gluing themselves to roadways and stopping workers and emergency services getting through are damaging the green message. The billionaires in their private jets are demeaning it. The greenwashing giants in the business world are prostituting it. Mega rich attendees at COP26 were talking about "offsetting" their private jet emissions - that old green get-out trick. They take us for fools. Boris Johnston posed in his sustainable suit - so described because it was rented. Couldn't he just have worn an old one? Meantime there was a reminder of that other current threat to the human race with the revelation that Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan had breakfast with the Mayor of Los Angeles who subsequently tested positive for Covid. How much of that got carried back across the globe? How long before we have the COP mutation? Back here, there was, as per usual, a bust-up. As our leaders set forth for COP26 , there was a row about how they were getting there. Should they have flown in (as several did) or gone for the eco-option, boat and train? One thing we can depend on at least, in this uncertain world of ours, is that whenever, wherever, Northern Ireland's voice is heard - it's always going to be fractious. Right now people are wearied with message overkill \</doc>

MICHE\'c1L Martin has said it is  absolutely essential that every country steps up to deal with the climate change challenge  quickly and urgently . Ahead of attending the Cop26 global climate conference in Glasgow today, the taoiseach stressed how all states needed to play their part in tackling climate change. He said through research technologies the Republic could significantly improve its capacity to reduce emissions in agriculture, transport and energy.  Every sector of our society will have to contribute to the reduction of emissions but the parallel side of that is, it will create opportunities, it will create jobs, it will create a healthier world, and a healthier country in Ireland, he said.  We will transform, for example, active travel; we will take the fossil fuel-powered buses and cars off our streets. One of the big polluters in our streets is fossil fuel driven cars and buses. Mr Martin said that President Joe Biden\' s decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement gives a  good platform and safety net to the current Cop26 . The north\' s devolved administration is the only one in Britain and Ireland without climate change legislation. Last week, the executive published a draft of its so-called Green Growth strategy. Ms O\' Neill said a failure to address the climate crisis would be  catastrophic and a dereliction of political leaders\' responsibilities. The Sinn F\'e9in deputy leader said that no one should be in  any doubt that the world is in the midst of a climate crisis. Mr Givan said the  eyes of the world will be on Glasgow for the COP26 climate summit.  The scale of the challenge is such that everyone across society has their part to play, he said. He said there was  much to do if commitments on building a more sustainable society were to be met. Mr Poots, who tabled his department\' s climate change legislation in June, said  creating green jobs and nurturing opportunities through investment and innovation needed to be the focus of the executive. He described climate change as the  defining crisis of our time on a global scale .  It must be recognised that we cannot continue with a business as usual approach, we must act now before it is too late, he said.  We have all seen first-hand the effects of climate change and there are other numerous challenges ahead - reducing our emissions, improving air quality, tackling plastic pollution, achieving zero waste, and the development of a circular economy. The next decade must be one of urgent action, there is still time to make a difference, but we must act now and we must do it together.: Mr Poots said the Green Growth strategy was an  over-arching multi-decade strategy that sets out a  long-term vision and a solid framework for tackling the climate crisis by balancing climate action with the need for a clean, resilient environment and economy . \</doc>

ACTIVISTS from the north have called for the United Nations\' Cop26 climate summit to be a watershed moment in the global battle against climate change. Dozens of activists will travel from Northern Ireland to attend the Glasgow summit, which begins tomorrow. Jacinta Hamley (24) who grew up near Crossgar in Co Down, said she wants to see real change.  A lot of people are claiming this is the last best chance for the world... But on the other hand there is a lot of rhetoric that this will be big words and empty promises that will not be met with concrete action, she said.  It\' s such a vital time and I feel it\' s my civic duty to go there as one of the citizens who are trying to put pressure on the decision makers. Ms Hamley, who is travelling to Scotland by ferry and bus, said countries must be held legally accountable if they do not meet their climate commitments.  The (2015) Paris agreement talked a lot about goals [to keep the mean global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius] but it didn\' t offer strategies on how to achieve them, she said.  Ideally stronger, grounded commitments would come out of this that are binding. Ms Hamley set up Climate Craic - Northern Ireland\' s first climate festival - which was held in September. She wants to see governments, including the executive, give strong financial support to help citizens buy greener technologies, including home heating pumps. However, she said people also need to alter their behaviour.  I\' m not saying that everyone has to be vegan but if you eat meat three times a day you really need to re-think that, she said. She said the north needs to do its part to meet the UK\' s climate commitments.  I find it challenging living in Northern Ireland and navigating this landscape between what Britain says and does and what Northern Ireland does, she said. She added:  Sometimes Northern Ireland can get away with not doing as much. A lot of things seem to slip by. Rosalind Skillen (23), who lives in east Belfast, is attending the conference as a representative of Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful in the first week and the Future Leaders Network in the second week.  There\' s been such an emphasis on Cop26 being the last chance for humanity to save itself from damage and halt or reverse ecological decline. It\' s really important to have an awareness of what\' s going on, she said.  In the second week I\' m going to be working on a research report with the Future Leaders network to try and help analyse the state of engagement of young people with Cop26 . I think a lot of young people don\' t actually know what it is, why it matters and what is being discussed.  I really want to go over so I can keep people updated on what is being discussed and how it will affect us. Ms Skillen wants richer countries to give more money to mitigate the effects of climate change in the developing world.  One of the big things for me is climate funding - richer countries funding the $100 billion a year to vulnerable countries that was promised at Cop15 in Copenhagen, she said.  That money hasn\' t been seen... We have to make sure that justice is at the centre of Cop26 and making sure all our decisions - whether that be phasing out fossil fuels \- will help those most affected by the climate crisis but have the least amount of responsibility. A sustainable future has to be a just one. Northern Ireland has no climate change legislation. A private member\' s bill, brought forward by Green Party leader Clare Bailey, aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the north to zero by 2045. The agriculture minister, DUP MLA Edwin Poots, has brought forward his own, less ambitious, legislation. Ms Skillen, who joked that she is a \' coptimist\' , said people should not lose hope around climate change.  When we talk about the race to net zero Northern Ireland is often lagging behind the race, she said.  (Scottish First Minister) Nichola Sturgeon has talked about a new green politics for Scotland. Everyone wants this green legacy.  If leaders in Northern Ireland could see this as unifying people and bringing communities together it\' s a really good mission to get behind. \</doc>

Tuvalu is looking at legal ways to keep its ownership of its maritime zones and recognition as a state even if the Pacific island nation is completely submerged due to climate change, its foreign minister said on Tuesday. "We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged," the minister, Simon Kofe, said. "We're looking at legal avenues where we can retain our ownership of our maritime zones, retain our recognition as a state under international law. So those are steps that we are taking, looking into the future," he said. Images of Kofe recording a speech to the United Nations Cop26 climate summit standing knee-deep in the sea have been widely shared on social media over recent days, pleasing the tiny island nation which is pushing for aggressive action to limit the impact of climate change. HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkSrtlapZQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkSrtlapZQ "We didn't think it would go viral as we saw over the last few days. We have been very pleased with that and hopefully that carries the message and emphasises the challenges that we are facing in Tuvalu at the moment," Kofe said. Tuvalu is an island with a population of around 11,000 people and its highest point is just 4.5m above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels have risen about 0.5cm per year, according to a 2011 Australian government report. Cop26 on Tuesday, in a place that used to be dry land, adding that Tuvalu was seeing a lot of coastal erosion. When asked what Tuvalu's people think about the rising sea levels, Kofe said some of the older generation say they are happy to go down with the land, while others are leaving. "The one thing is clear is that the people have a very close tie to their land," Kofe said. \</doc>

Energy producers gathered in Abu Dhabi after the COP26 UN climate talks have today called for greater inclusivity that would see more investment in hydrocarbons for energy security as they work to reduce emissions while developing their economies. The world could not "simply unplug" from hydrocarbons and the oil and gas industry needed to invest over $600 billion a year until 2030 just to meet expected demand, said Abu Dhabi National Oil chief executive Sultan al-Jaber. He was addressing the start of ADIPEC oil and gas forum, at which the energy minister of top oil exporter Saudi Arabia stressed that climate efforts should provide equal focus on energy security and economic growth in developing countries. The COP26 OPEC oil producers had defended a future role for fossil fuels at the talks, arguing that the world could slash greenhouse gas emissions without moving away from oil and gas. "To be inclusive you have to look at first emissions, not resource, two it must be all greenhouse gases, it must be all sectors," Saudi Arabia's Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al-Saud said. "We have to be mindful of national circumstances." Advocates of oil, gas and coal argue that technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration - in which emissions are captured and stored underground - can allow economies to keep burning fossils. Climate activists reject that, saying such technology is expensive, unproven at scale, and only provides cover to polluting industries to continue operating. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said the conversation "is gradually being taken over by emotions" and hoped upcoming COP summits in Egypt in 2022 and the United Arab Emirates in 2023 would take a holistic approach. ADNOC's al-Jaber said the Glasgow summit "on balance, was a success" but also urged greater pragmatism, saying a successful energy transition required hydrocarbons. "We cannot simply unplug from the energy system of today. We cannot just flip a switch." He said ADNOC was expanding its carbon capture and storage capacity from 800,000 tonnes a year to 5 million, and as of January, would use nuclear and solar for its grid power. \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has urged the UK government to act constructively in a post-Brexit fishing row with France. Speaking at the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, Mr Martin said Ireland stands in solidarity with other EU countries amid fresh tensions with the UK over fishing. He said that there was a concern that the UK has not been engaging with the EU in a "constructive manner". "We believe the European Union and the UK government need to engage constructively on a whole range of issues, not least fisheries." "I believe there is discussion under way between the UK government and the French government and that they may be in a position to get that issue resolved." "We would like to see that resolved, independent of the protocol," he told reporters. AdvertisementThe fishing row adds to the tensions around UK-European Union relations, with the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol also causing a diplomatic row with Brussels. The dispute with France was triggered by decisions made by the authorities in the UK and Jersey over licences for small French boats to operate in British waters, with officials arguing permission can only be given to vessels which can demonstrate a history of fishing there.

French president Emmanuel Macron, who held talks with British prime minister Boris Johnson at the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday and was welcomed to the Cop26 climate change conference by Mr Johnson in Glasgow on Monday, said the ball is in the UK's court. "If the British don't do any significant move, measures starting from November 2nd will need to be implemented," he warned on Sunday. The Irish Government has been to the forefront of the ongoing row between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Unionists and loyalists remain deeply opposed to the creation of fresh checks on trade between the North and Britain. On Monday, a bus was hijacked and set alight in Newtownards in an attack which politicians in the North have linked to loyalist opposition to the protocol. Advertisement The UK and EU have recently brought forward proposals in a bid to resolve the dispute. Mr Martin said that he believed negotiations can still be a success. "If there's a will there now, the presentation that the Commission has made, gives the platform to conclude these negotiations rapidly if people want to because I think Europe has come a long way in respect of the operation and details of the Protocol," he said. "Huge progress has been made and I believe the UK government should respond in kind. "It is in the best interests of the Good Friday Agreement and in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland." "The signals are not that strong but we will work with our European colleagues, with the United Kingdom government, as there is some distance to go yet." He said that the UK and the EU need to move on from "micro-disputes" and that many issues can be resolved with "common sense". "To allow these issues to fester is not good," he warned. \</doc>

Countries backing a strong deal in Glasgow to cut emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5C say momentum is growing for their cause. The "High Ambition Coalition" is calling for countries to submit more ambitious national action plans in the next year that will help keep temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the most dangerous climate impacts will be felt. The coalition said former US president Barack Obama had given his support for their push for an outcome that limits warming to 1.5C at a private meeting at Cop26 on Monday. And 13 new countries have signed up to the High Ambition Coalition statement calling for ambitious action at Glasgow, ranging from Canada, Italy and Ireland to Uruguay, the Seychelles and Angola. The coalition said it now has 41 supporters, including the chairs of three country groupings that represent dozens of the poorest countries and those at-risk from climate impacts such as small island states. AdvertisementUS president Joe Biden, Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron have also signed up to the statement. Along with country plans in line with 1.5C, the statement focuses on action on coal, fossil fuel subsidies, methane, and transport, and calls for the delivery of the long-promised 100 billion dollars a year for poorer countries to deal with climate change and more money for helping them adapt to its impacts. The growing momentum comes as fault lines in the Cop26 climate negotiations become clearer with the arrival of ministers from countries around the world to take over the reins to hammer out a deal in Glasgow. As countries met for a presidency update on the first week of the UN conference and progress of the negotiations, it was clear that increased action this decade to limit dangerous warming and finance for poor countries were key. The latest national plans by countries for action this decade still overall leave the world far off track to meet the internationally agreed goal of trying to limit global warming to 1.5C.

AdvertisementWhile some countries such as those that are part of the High Ambition Coalition want to see new action plans that are in line with 1.5C within the next year, others are pushing back on the bid for accelerating action from the existing five-yearly cycle for revisiting the plans. There have also been concerns over finance to help poorer nations tackle climate change, with developed countries failing to deliver on a long-promised 100 billion US dollars a year by 2020 until at least next year. Over the weekend, the UK Cop26 presidency published a summary of what could be in the final statement from Glasgow - although a draft version of the text is not expected until Wednesday. It flags the need for urgent action up to 2030 and efforts to scale up finance, among other elements. Cop26 president Alok Sharma struck a seemingly optimistic note at a press conference on Monday, citing progress made on a framework to address loss and damage from climate impacts in vulnerable countries. Mr Sharma said: "Those of you who have followed this process will know that loss and damage has historically been seen as a polarising issue, but I am encouraged that the mood music has changed somewhat and there is now a practical recognition that action is needed on this topic in the face of growing impacts." AdvertisementHe cited the extreme weather seen in developed nations, such as the wildfires in North America and Australia and the flooding in China and Central Europe, as one of the catalysts of this shift in mindset. "Climate vulnerable communities are particularly at the forefront of my mind and will be so throughout these negotiations," he said. "They and the generations to come will not forgive us if we fail to deliver in Glasgow."

Hundreds of young people have taken part in protests across the island of Ireland to demand urgent action to tackle climate change. Events organised for Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Galway were among similar demonstrations staged around the world. The climate strikes saw students and schoolchildren call for radical intervention to address global warming with the event slogan "Uproot the system". They accused governments of failing to act decisively enough on the issue.

"Today is the global strike, with all sorts of environmentally conscious NGOs and groups over the world doing a protest with the hashtag 'uproot the system'," she said.

Ms Laverty said the pandemic had taken some momentum out of climate activism. "I think now we've reached the right time where it's OK to gather together and have a safe protest," she added. The Belfast activist said she hoped Cop26 would inspire discussion and more public discourse about the issue. "We're hoping to probably organise a few events around that locally here and just really draw as much attention to it as we possibly can," she said. \</doc>

MORE than 100 world leaders have committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. The pledge, made at a COP26 event yesterday, amounts to almost (EURO)16.5billion in public and private funding. Forests are the lungs of our planet, absorbing about one third of the global CO2 released from burning fossil fuels every year, but we are losing them at an alarming rate. An area of forest the size of 27 soccer pitches is lost every minute. Countries endorsing the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use pledge include heavily forested nations such as Canada, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Together, they contain 85% of the world's forests, an area of more than 33million square HYPERLINK http://www.kilometres.UK www.kilometres.UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the event, said: 'With today's unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity's long history as nature's conqueror, and instead become its custodian.' Indonesian president Joko Widodo said: 'Indonesia is blessed as the most carbonrich country in the world on vast rainforests, mangroves, oceans and peatlands. We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations.' Campaigners welcomed the initiative. Justin Adams, executive director of the World Economic Forum's Tropical Forest Alliance, said: 'What we're seeing at COP26 could finally be the start of something transformational when it comes to stopping deforestation. If we fail to stop deforestation, we will fail to limit climate change. He continued: 'The Glasgow declaration provides a strong political signal, and the powerful collective force of business and finance, which aligns considerable economic muscle with these efforts, can shift our food and land use system in a way that we desperately need - for farmers, for consumers and for the planet.' \</doc>

SCOTTISH First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will call on world leaders to take "credible actions" to achieve net zero in a speech ahead of the Cop26 UN climate change conference. She will say that keeping the prospect of limiting global warming to less than 1.5C alive cannot simply be a "face-saving slogan" but must be real. In a keynote speech to an audience of young people and students in Glasgow, she will call on international leaders to act to limit global temperature increases and deliver a fair financial package for the global south. Cop26 summit, which takes place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. The first minister will say that Scotland is in a unique position to make the event a success and will act as a "bridge", creating spaces and dialogues and promoting understanding. She will say: "We will take seriously the responsibility of all governments, at all levels, to show ambition, and to galvanise action. If we do that, we can all contribute towards a successful summit. "I have said that small countries can lead the way in this, and they can, but in the coming days, it is the countries which emit the most, who most need to step up. They need to make ambitious pledges to achieve net zero. "And those pledges must be backed by credible actions. "The idea of 'keeping 1.5 alive', cannot simply be a face-saving slogan. It must be real. And there must be progress in Glasgow which makes that outcome more likely." The talks in Glasgow have been billed as the last best chance to limit global warming to 1.5C in the long term. \</doc>

The world has not done nearly enough to tackle the climate crisis, and curbing rising temperatures will be hard - but humanity has done hard things before, Barack Obama has said. In an often personal speech to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, the former US president said there were times he felt doubtful humanity could get its act together before it was too late and "images of dystopia" crept into his mind. But he warned that "cynicism is the recourse of cowards" and the world had to muster the will, passion and activism of citizens to push governments, companies and society to meet the challenge. He took a swipe at China and Russia's leaders for failing to attend the conference and said their national plans for climate action "reflect a dangerous lack of urgency and willingness to maintain the status quo". \~ While advanced economies like the US and Europe needed to lead on climate, so did major emitters including China, India, Russia, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil, he said. "We can't afford to have anyone on the sidelines," he warned. And in directing a large portion of his speech at young people, he said they were right to be angry and frustrated - and urged them to channel it, keep pushing and to gird themselves for a marathon not a sprint in solving the issue. He told them to "vote like your life depends on it, because it does", to put pressure on companies to take action and to educate their parents, relatives and teachers. He added: "I recognise that many young people may be cynical about politics, but the cold, hard fact is we will not have more ambitious climate plans coming out of governments unless governments feel some pressure from voters." Mr Obama also said that while protests were necessary, there was also a need to listen to ordinary people who might be reluctant over climate action and help persuade them, instead of yelling at them or saying they were ignorant. "It's not enough to inconvenience them by blocking traffic in a protest - we actually have to listen to their objections and understand the reluctance of some ordinary people to see their countries move too fast on climate change," he warned. Quoting Shakespeare's line from Othello asking "what wound did ever heal but by degrees", Mr Obama said: "Our planet has been wounded by our actions. "Those wounds won't be healed today or tomorrow or the next, but they can be healed by degrees. "If we start with the spirit that each of us can fight through the occasional frustration and dread, if we pledge to do our part and follow through on those commitments, I believe we can secure a better future. We have to." He also told delegates in a socially-distanced but full conference hall that America was back and\~the US is now "moving more boldly" after fours years of "active hostility" from the administration of Donald Trump. But he warned: "Collectively and individually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis." AdvertisementHe told delegates that keeping the rise in global temperature to 1.5C, necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, "will not be easy, it's going to be hard". He said existing political institutions moved slowly, international cooperation was difficult and made harder by misinformation on social media, and getting people to work together on a global scale took time which the world did not have. But he said: "The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before. I believe we can do hard things again." He said victories would be incomplete, and there would be setbacks, and imperfect compromises, but they would "move the ball down the field".

An adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has quit after a video surfaced of her laughing and joking about a party in Downing Street during a Christmas Covid-19 lockdown last year. Allegra Stratton, who was most recently Mr Johnson's COP26 spokeswoman, was his press secretary at the time the video was recorded in December 2020. "My remarks seemed to make light of the rules, rules that people were doing everything to obey. That was never my intention. "I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and offer my profound apologies to all of you for them," Ms Stratton said in a tearful resignation statement outside her home. "Working in government is an immense privilege. "I tried to do right by you all, to behave with civility and decency and up to the high standards you expect of Number 10." She said she understood the "anger and frustration" people feel. Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference this evening there was "no excuse" for the video showing No 10 aides joking about an alleged lockdown party. He said Allegra Stratton had been a "fine colleague" and he wanted to pay tribute to her "in spite of what everybody has seen, and again, I make no excuses for the frivolity with which the subject was handed in that rehearsal that people saw in that clip". Mr Johnson said Ms Stratton had "achieved a great deal in her time in government, and was a particularly effective spokesman for COP26 ".

He apologised "unreservedly" for the offence caused by the footage, but he insisted that he had been repeatedly assured that "there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken". Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case "to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible - and it goes without saying that if those rules were broken then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved". Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: "I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures. "I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules because I was also furious to see that clip.

INDIA dealt a blow to hopes of an urgent climate deal last night, despite the UN warning that the world is 'digging its own grave' by failing to cut emissions. The Asian country's prime minister Narendra Modi said the world's third largest polluter would not become carbon neutral until 2070. Major countries are being pressed to agree to a target of 2050 at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. And in a further blow, China last night confirmed it would not attempt to reach the goal until 2060. The underwhelming commitments added to the growing sense of crisis surrounding the two-week summit, which opened formally yesterday. More than 120 world leaders have travelled to Scotland for the conference, which has been billed as the last chance to limit climate change to manageable proportions. At one point Joe Biden appeared to doze off during a speech at the event. Earning his 'sleepy Joe' nickname, the US president folded his arms and closed his eyes for about 20 seconds - before an aide seemed to wake him up. Boris Johnson was also photographed with his eyes closed for a few seconds duralso ing the conference. But a No10 source said it was 'nonsense' to suggest the British prime minister had fallen asleep. Speaking at the opening ceremony yesterday, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned that the world was 'digging its own grave' by failing to act more quickly. Mr Guterres said mankind was guilty of 'treating nature like a toilet'. And he lambasted leaders for failing to keep to past promises on the issue. During a busy day in Glasgow: \'f7 Chinese premier Xi Jinping snubbed the summit by not even recording a video statement, after failing to accept an invitation; \'f7 Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan pulled out of the meeting, after reportedly complaining he had been refused permission to bring his own security team; \'f7 Thousands of delegates faced a chaotic start as long queues formed to get through security at the site; \'f7 Leaders were poised to agree a deal to end deforestation by 2030; \'f7 Downing Street confirmed Mr Johnson will fly home from the event today, despite criticism of world leaders for jetting to a summit designed to cut emissions. Mr Johnson attempted to put a face-saving gloss on India's announcement last night, describing a commitment to generate half its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as £mbitious'. He said the UK would now 'work with India to make even more progress'. But one UK source acknowledged that the 2070 target for net zero was disappointing, adding that Mr Modi had made £n interesting political choice to kick it further down the road'. The UK official also criticised China, saying: 'We are not seeing the sort of leadership people want to see' from the world's biggest emitter.' David Attenborough made a passionate appeal to leaders, giving a speech in which he said that the 'human story' could come to an end on Earth unless immediate action is taken to tackle climate change. 'Is this how our story is due to end?' he said. 'A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals?' The 95-yearold broadcaster - who received a standing ovation from an audience including Mr Biden - said the stability of the Earth's climate over the last 10,000 years had allowed humanity to flourish. He said future generations would judge leaders on whether the sumtight mit succeeds in reducing the intensity of carbon in the atmosphere. Mr Johnson used his own speech to urge countries to act more quickly. He said leaders had to answer the challenge from climate activist Greta Thunberg that their promises amount to little more than 'blah, blah, blah'.

The leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies should use a meeting this weekend in Rome to agree how to transfer surplus Covid-19 vaccines to low-income countries, a group of former presidents and prime ministers has said. In a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, 100 former leaders and government ministers from around the world urged him to use the G20 summit to address what they said was an unfair distribution of vaccines. "It would be unethical for all these vaccines to be wasted when globally there are 10,000 deaths from Covid-19 every day, many of which could be averted," said the letter, whose signatories include former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former British prime minister Gordon Brown. The group said the World Health Organization's aim for 40% of the world's population to be vaccinated by the end of the year could only be met if the G20 made a joint decision to order an emergency transfer of their excess vaccine supplies. "Vaccine inequality also constitutes a threat to us all," it said. "We are all not safe until everyone is safe. Without urgent and widespread vaccination, variants will continue to arise in unvaccinated regions, and may well spread from there to challenge the vaccine protection achieved hitherto in more vaccinated countries." G20 host Italy had hoped the G20 summit would see all leaders meet face-to-face. However, China's President Xi Jinping will participate via video link, while Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will also not attend in person. US President Joe Biden has arrived in Rome to attend. The G20, whose countries account for 80% of global carbon emissions, is considered an important stepping stone before the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Scotland, which begins on Sunday. Mr Xi is also not expected to attend COP26 in person, which could indicate that the world's biggest CO2 producer has already decided that it has no more concessions to offer at the UN COP26 climate summit after three major pledges since last year, climate watchers said. The G20 also aims to underline that rich countries should stump up $100 billion per year to help poorer nations adapt to climate change. This goal was supposed to be achieved by 2020, according to an agreement reached in 2009, but has not been met. The head the Health Service Executive's Vaccine Programme has said that Ireland recently completed a delivery of 340,000 vaccines, which were at risk of expiring, to Uganda. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, Damien McCallion Ireland has sufficient vaccine stock to support its booster programme and has ceased delivery of all its vaccines. He said Ireland has committed around 1 million vaccines under the international COVAX programme by year's end. Where there are vaccines in danger of expiring, he said, bilateral agreements with other countries that need them will be undertaken. \</doc>

A sharp reduction in carbon emissions recorded last year at the height of the Covid-19 crisis has proven short-lived, with scientists projecting a bounce back to near pre-pandemic levels this year. Global emissions fell 5.4 per cent in 2020 amid strict lockdowns and restrictions, but a report from the Global Carbon Project forecasts an increase of 4.9 per cent to 36.4 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent this year. The research team - including scientists from the University of Exeter and University of East Anglia - says a further rise in emissions next year "cannot be ruled out if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use is stable". "The rapid rebound in emissions as economies recover from the pandemic reinforces the need for immediate global action on climate change," said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein of University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute. Delegates at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow are attempting to forge a global agreement to halve emissions by 2030. Reaching net zero by 2050 entails cutting global emissions by 1.4 billion tonnes each year on average, Prof Friedlingstein said. "This highlights the scale of action now required, and hence the importance of Cop26 discussions." For China, a major manufacturing hub, the response to the pandemic sparked further growth in emissions, pushed by the energy and industry sectors, the report says. Emissions in the US and EU should rise above last year's reduced totals but will stay some 4 per cent below those seen in 2019. China is this year projected to emit 11.1 billion tonnes of CO2 - 31 per cent of global emissions, the analysis says. The US is projected to emit 5.1 billion tonnes of CO2 - 14 per cent of the total - and EU states are forecast to emit a combined 2.8 billion tonnes (7 per cent), a similar percentage to India. The figures exclude international transport including aviation. \</doc>

A billion people could be living with potentially lethal levels of heat stress if global warming were to reach 2C, research has found. Heat stress - a combination of dangerous heat and humidity - currently affects 68m people globally. New modelling from a consortium of academics and the UK Met Office showed that under a 2C scenario, the number of people living in these conditions could rise 15-fold. Heat stress is defined as a wet bulb globe temperature - a measurement taking into account temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation - of above 32C. It can induce heat exhaustion, with symptoms including heavy sweating and a rapid pulse, which can in turn put a strain on the heart and other organs. The elderly, those with pre-existing health conditions and those with physical, outdoor jobs are at the greatest risk. According to analysis, the earth was on course for 2.7C of warming under countries' carbon emissions reduction pledges going into the Cop26 climate negotiations. US climate envoy John Kerry said if the pledges made so far during the summit are kept, it would put humanity on course for 1.8C, the International Energy Agency has said. The Met Office warned that in a future where runaway global warming reaches 4C, half of the world's population would be living with heat stress. The heat stress maps are part of research projecting the future impacts of different consequences of climate change under 2C and at 4C, and also look at river flooding, wildfire risk, drought and food insecurity. It was conducted by an international team of scientists in the EU-funded Helix project, and led by the University of Exeter. Dr Andy Hartley, climate impacts lead at the Met Office, said: "Currently, the (heat stress) metric is met in several locations, such as parts of India, but our analysis shows that with a rise of 4C, extreme heat risk could affect people in large swathes of most of the world's continents." Prof Richard Betts, of the University of Exeter and Met Office, who led the Helix project, said: "It is still possible to avoid these higher risks if we act now." \</doc>

On Monday morning at the Cop26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Mary Robinson is sitting beneath a huge revolving replica of planet Earth. She lays out the stakes for me: how the world needs to keep within the 1.5 degree temperature increase aspired to five years ago in Paris; how scientific advances have made things far more measurable; and how young activists deserve "action" not "blah, blah, blah". But she also worries because countries like China aren't in attendance and that poorer countries are underrepresented. "We're not going to have enough of the real voices, because they can't get to the Cop. It's a bit too white and elite, frankly, because of Covid and [because] they didn't manage the security and the prices." She's still optimistic. "I have to be a prisoner of hope." The Action Hub, in zone B of the Scottish Event Campus, is the bit with the aforementioned globe. There's a Forest of Promises, which is an artificial tree covered with leaves on which children have written things such as "I promise to use public transport" and "I will use les electrisity". And there's an LED tickertape circling the venue to remind everyone where they are and who the partners/sponsors are. The furniture is from Ikea and the television networks have set up studios here. I see Ed Miliband and the actor Mark Strong. Most people I speak to on my first day at Cop26 have Robinson's feeling of worried hope. There are an estimated 30,000 attendees, although several thousand of those spend the morning outside queueing in the icy Glasgow cold. That group included Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir and his colleagues from UCC's Environmental Research Institute, who are here as observers. Like Robinson, he's conscious of the failure to meet the goals set in Paris, but he also stresses how much good collaborative work gets done in the connections that are made here. We've been watching Cop26 's people's advocate, David Attenborough, deliver his speech on a big screen. \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir notes something Attenborough said about how the countries suffering most from climate change aren't the ones causing it. His colleague, philosophy lecturer Kian Mintz-Woo, concurs. "Both morally and practically, it's really important for the western world [to fund] the developing countries to mitigate and adapt. At a symbolic or moral level, it shows that we're in this together." In zone D there is a huge room full of "delegation pavilions" at which various countries, NGOs and companies have demonstrations and talks and, sometimes, free coffee. Prime minister Stefan L\'f6fven is speaking at the Swedish pavilion. The Environmental Defense Fund is promoting a satellite it is launching to monitor methane emissions. Many smaller countries argue for climate justice. At the pavilion of the endangered archipelago of Tuvalu, people are getting selfies with sculptures of polar bears in life jackets and a penguin hanging from a noose. These are the work of Taiwanese artist Vincent JF Huang. "Sea level is rising. We predict that [there's] only 20 or 30 more years the Tuvaluans can continue staying on their island. This is quite an urgent situation. Tuvalu was always ignored but I try and use the power of art to help them get more media." Is it working? He smiles. "You saw a polar bear and you came over." Two Swedish girl scouts are being encouraged to create a viral moment by a woman with a phone; "1.5 to stay alive," coaches the woman, filming it for TikTok. They're here as observers representing the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. "Our focus is to show politicians and negotiators [that] we young people are affected by their decisions," says 20-year-old Siri Ankorfor. "I'm a little bit frustrated because due to the pandemic, they've banned all observers from all negotiations . . . We can follow online, but we can't be in the room. We can't show our faces to them so they can see who they're fighting for. I think they forget about that in meetings with only other people like them." Zone F, where all the negotiations are taking place, smells like new carpets and looks like a fancy co-working space. Most here are dressed in sober, well-cut outfits (apart from a few dapper military figures). The space leading to the meetings operates a little like a red carpet, flanked by photographers. At one point a security man guides me gently but firmly out of the path of the fast huddle in which Ursula von der Leyen is travelling. At Cop26 there are two forms of movement. Negotiators walk in packs at speed but everyone else, aware of their mileage, moves more slowly. At the boundary between zones D and F, there's a beautiful wooden installation promoting the Eden Project. "A completely destroyed piece of land we turned into a beautiful garden," explains educator Bran Howell. "Humans are actually quite cool and we are really good at fixing things if we work together . . . The future's whatever we want to make. If we can turn this area into something beautiful, then we can do that anywhere in the world." \</doc>

The Dublin Climate Dialogues has called for an immediate end to investment in fossil fuels in an attempt to help accelerate global actions to address the climate crisis. The Dublin Declaration also calls for a global commitment to phasing out coal power generation by 2025; a quadrupling of installed renewable energy every year over the coming decade and rapid electrification of the global economy. It puts "just transition at its core, recognising the need of the poorest and most vulnerable" and calls for strong public policy, support for developing countries in making the investments they require to embrace renewable energy and measures "to incentivise a shift from carbon technology". The document was produced following the convening of the Dublin Climate Dialogues, a two-day virtual conference. It sought to prompt greater climate ambitions at the critical UN COP26 summit in Glasgow in November, which is being hosted by the UK government. "Globally, nationally, locally, corporately, collectively, and individually it is not too late to choose," the declaration states. "We each have a voice, a duty of care to act and a moral responsibility to make our world a better place to hand on to our children and future generations." COP26 requires global leaders, it notes, "to make their policy ambitions commensurate with and reflective of the promised aim of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees, and given the grave risks, to strive for 1.5 degrees". The call was endorsed by US climate envoy John Kerry in his address to participants at the conference, hosted by University College Dublin. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney welcomed the thrust of the declaration before it was handed over to the UK government representative and COP26 envoy John Murton in a virtual exchange. The contributions "remind us again that climate change has implications across all aspects of our society as well as our financial, economic and political systems", Mr Coveney said. He highlighted the daily challenges and fears of climate change in vulnerable countries including small island states. "This is why the transition must be a just one," he said. Dialogues chairman Pat Cox said the declaration "does not purport to represent the official position of any governmental or non-governmental participants or their organisations", but accurately reflects the views of participants including representatives of major carbon emitting countries - the US, the EU, China and Japan - who account for 58 per cent of global emissions. It came with the message that the world has to immediately face up to "the drastic urgency of dealing with climate change" underpinned by climate justice, he added. This required admitting "real delivery did not happen since Paris" - a reference to landmark climate agreement signed by 197 countries in 2015. "To succeed, collaborative engagement at every level of governance, public and private, has to be at the heart of this transformative transition," he added. Speaking at the handover, Mr Cox said COP26 "is truly a date with destiny, globally and locally. The stakes are too high to contemplate anything other than a firm collective resolve to act with a sense of urgency and acceleration". \</doc>

The COP26 UN climate talks in Glasgow have finished and the gavel has come down on the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed by all 197 countries. If the 2015 Paris Agreement provided the framework for countries to tackle climate change then Glasgow, six years on, was the first major test of this high-water mark of global diplomacy. So what have we learnt from two weeks of leaders' statements, massive protests and side deals on coal, stopping fossil fuel finance and deforestation, plus the final signed Glasgow Climate Pact? From phasing out coal to carbon market loopholes, here is what you need to know: The Glasgow Climate Pact is incremental progress and not the breakthrough moment needed to curb the worst impacts of climate change. The UK government as host and therefore president of COP26 wanted to "keep 1.5C alive", the stronger goal of the Paris Agreement. But at best they can say the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is on life support \- it has a pulse but it's nearly dead. The Paris Agreement says temperatures should be limited to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and countries should "pursue efforts" to limit warming to 1.5C. Before COP26 , the world was on track for 2.7C of warming, based on commitments by countries, and expectation of the changes in technology. Announcements at COP26 , including new pledges to cut emissions this decade, by some key countries, have reduced this to a best estimate of 2.4C. More countries also announced long-term net zero goals. One of the most important was India's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Critically, the country said it would get off to a quick start with a massive expansion of renewable energy in the next ten years so that it accounts for 50% of its total usage, reducing its emissions in 2030 by 1 billion tonnes (from a current total of around 2.5 billion). Fast-growing Nigeria also pledged net zero emissions by 2060. Countries accounting for 90% of the world's GDP have now pledged to go net zero by the middle of this century. A world warming by 2.4C is still clearly very far from 1.5C. What remains is a near-term emissions gap, as global emissions look likely to flatline this decade rather than showing the sharp cuts necessary to be on the 1.5C trajectory the pact calls for. There is a gulf between long-term net zero goals and plans to deliver emissions cuts this decade. The final text of the Glasgow Pact notes that the current national climate plans, nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in the jargon, are far from what is needed for 1.5C. It also requests that countries come back next year with new updated plans. Under the Paris Agreement, new climate plans are needed every five years, which is why Glasgow, five years after Paris (with a delay due to Covid), was such an important meeting. New climate plans next year, instead of waiting another five years, can keep 1.5C on life support for another 12 months, and gives campaigners another year to shift government climate policy. It also opens the door to requesting further NDC updates from 2022 onwards to help ratchet up ambition this decade. The Glasgow Climate Pact also states that the use of unabated coal should be phased down, as should subsidies for fossil fuels. The wording is weaker than the initial proposals, with the final text calling for only a "phase down" and not a "phase out" of coal, due to a last-second intervention by India, and of "inefficient" subsidies. But this is the first time fossil fuels have been mentioned in a UN climate talks declaration. In the past, Saudi Arabia and others have stripped out this language. This an important shift, finally acknowledging that use of coal and other fossil fuels need to be rapidly reduced to tackle the climate emergency. The taboo of talking about the end of fossil fuels has been finally broken. Developing countries have been calling for funding to pay for "loss and damage", such as the costs of the impacts of cyclones and sea level rise. Small island states and climate-vulnerable countries say the historical emissions of the major polluters have caused these impacts and therefore funding is needed. Developed countries, led by the US and EU, have resisted taking any liability for these loss and damages, and vetoed the creation of a new 'Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility', a way of supporting vulnerable nations, despite it being called for by most countries. Carbon markets could throw a potential lifeline to the fossil fuel industry, allowing them to claim "carbon offsets" and carry on business as (nearly) usual. A tortuous series of negotiations over article 6 of the Paris Agreement on market and non-market approaches to trading carbon was finally agreed, six years on. The worst and biggest loopholes were closed, but there is still scope for countries and companies to game the system. Outside the COP process, we will need much clearer and stricter rules for company carbon offsets. Otherwise expect a series of expos\'e9 from non-governmental organisations and the media into carbon offsetting under this new regime, when new attempts will emerge to try and close these remaining loopholes. It is clear that powerful countries are moving too slowly and they have made a political decision to not support a step change in both greenhouse gas emissions and funding to help income-poor countries to adapt to climate change and leapfrog the fossil fuel age. But they are being pushed hard by their populations and particularly climate campaigners. Indeed in Glasgow, there were huge protests with both the youth Fridays for Future march and the Saturday Global Day of Action massively exceeding expected numbers. This means that next steps of the campaigners and the climate movement matter. Read more: HYPERLINK Latest climate change stories \</doc>

Climate and environmental sustainability students in Dublin City University (DCU) have been walking the walk for the past 30 days, taking on sustainability challenges such as washing clothes by hand; eating insects; and avoiding car travel, fast fashion, and single-use plastic. In the run up to Cop26 , DCU lecturer Darren Clarke challenged his first-year students to set their own personal sustainability challenge for 30 days. "By asking students to take on a sustainability challenge related to climate change and Cop26 , even for 30 days, they embrace change immediately and begin to notice the opportunities that this presents for wider societal change," said Mr Clarke. "The experiment has been like a living lab for students, who have successfully influenced and engaged family, friends, and industry on improving sustainability and addressing climate change. It has proven to be a very useful and practical tool to understand and support individuals, businesses, and Government to adopt pro-climate behaviours and policies." Students shared daily blogs on their experiences, on ripplesofchange.cchallenge.no/group. Katherine Molloy challenged herself to only use environmentally friendly cleaning products at home. "People are operating on autopilot when they go shopping and don't put too much thought into what toilet cleaner they are using and the implications of that product on the environment. When you start looking at the ingredients in 'normal' products, you start to question why you would use those chemicals in your home or on your body when more natural alternatives are available," she said. Aaron McNiffe and Uma Isselee decided to commute in more environmentally friendly ways. Mr McNiffe swapped four wheels for two and, after 30 days, is seriously considering trading in his car for an electric bike. Ms Isselee challenged herself to steer clear of public transport for 30 days, choosing instead to walk or cycle. Leo Carroll decided to incorporate more insects as a sustainable source of protein. "I've found the switch to the insect diet to be surprisingly doable. I will definitely continue to eat insects in the future. Their unexpectedly delicious nutty flavour and satisfying crunch make them a perfect snack, either on their own or as part of a meal," he said. "I can definitely see some people incorporating insects into their diet in the near future." \</doc>

Pope Francis has called on political leaders heading to Cop26 to urgently tackle the climate crisis to give "concrete hope to future generations" . He said "radical decisions" are needed as the world faces a "succession of crises" in healthcare, the environment, food supplies and the economy . In a special Thought for the Day message for BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the leader of the world's Catholics warned against countries taking an isolationist approach, and called for a "renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world" . His comments come as world leaders prepare to head to Glasgow for the crucial climate summit, where countries are under pressure to increase their ambition to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change . The Pope said: "We have lost our sense of security and are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and loss of control over our lives." He said the crises being faced "forecast a perfect storm" but also provide opportunities . . "The political decision-makers who will meet at Cop26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations . "And it is worth repeating that each of us - whoever and wherever we may be - can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change and the degradation of our common home," he said . The two-week climate conference is being seen as key to increasing action on cutting emissions to deliver on the pledges in the global Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to "well below" 2C, and try for the safer 1.5C goal . Countries, in particular major emitters, are facing calls from across society, from UN chiefs to religious leaders and campaigners, to increase action to keep the 1.5C goal in reach and avoid catastrophic climate impacts . There will also be pushes to phase out coal power, boost electric vehicles and protect forests, while developed countries also need to deliver finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and cope with the already inevitable impacts of a warming world . In an interview for BBC Radio 4's 39 Ways To Save The Planet , Hollywood star, former California governor and climate campaigner Arnold Schwarzenegger said everyone has to work together to tackle the issue . He said it is "great when leaders get together every year and talk about what they can do", but he added he is not a big fan of making everything rest on the annual "Cop" conferences . Mr Schwarzenegger said: "It's very important that we have a positive attitude, that we can see it and we all work together because not one person can deal with it themselves. It's a huge undertaking. It takes the political arena, it takes the public sector, the private sector, the non-profit sector, the academic sector, ordinary folks. And then I think we can do it." \</doc>

WHETHER we like it or not, addressing the climate crisis is the responsibility of all of us. Some may sit back, put their hands up and say: "Not my problem." Or ask: "Sure, what can I do about it?" But that defeatist attitude won't wash with the next generation, who will look back at all of us in years to come and say: "You knew about this. Why didn't you do something when there was still time?" Cop26 in Glasgow has once again shone a light on what the world is facing. On pages 2-3 of today's paper we highlight some of the simple things we can all do. They may not seem much individually, but the force of millions of people combined is the most powerful tool we have. It's the youth of today and the children of tomorrow that this matters most to. They are the ones who do not yet have the power to make political change, but they do have voices, they can make their feelings known, and they will be the voters of the future. They will be watching what the leaders of today do, and they will hold them to account eventually if the cycle of failure continues. Today local youths are planning to march on Belfast City Hall in a show of collective unity. They want the change to happen now. If you're in the city around noon, speak to any of them. They'll tell you they're frustrated. They'll tell you they hear the words of our political leaders from across the world at Cop26 , but they don't believe them. Until they do, we can all take matters into our own small hands, show we care about the world we live in, and protect it for those generations to follow. The adults are supposed to be the responsible ones. How times have changed. Our world has given us all we need to live. We must thank it - and give back what it needs to live itself. \</doc>

Boris Johnson will tell world leaders that "it's one minute to midnight" as they gather in Glasgow today at the start of a two-week meeting United Nations experts view as crucial to averting climate disaster. The British prime minister will call on them to take concrete steps to phase out the use of coal, accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and halt deforestation. "Humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change. It's one minute to midnight and we need to act now. If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow," he is expected to say. "We have to move from talk and debate and discussion to concerted, real-world action on coal, cars, cash and trees. Not more hopes and targets and aspirations, valuable though they are, but clear commitments and concrete timetables for change. We need to get real about climate change and the world needs to know when that's going to happen." The Cop26 Britain has halved its annual international aid budget until at least 2024 but Mr Johnson will today pledge an extra \£31 billion in climate finance by 2025. Speaking at the opening ceremony in Glasgow yesterday, Cop26 president Alok Sharma promised transparency and inclusivity during the talks. Ambition "We can move the negotiations forward. We can launch a decade of ever-increasing ambition and action. Together, we can seize the enormous opportunities for green growth, for good green jobs, for cheaper, cleaner power. But we must hit the ground running to develop the solutions we need. And that work starts today. We will succeed, or fail, as one," he said. Britain's presidency of the Cop26 has been overshadowed by a row between London and Paris over post-Brexit access to British coastal fishing waters for French boats. France has threatened to stop British boats from unloading their catch at French ports and imposing more onerous checks on British lorries if its fishers do not receive more licences from authorities in Jersey and Guernsey. A 30-minute meeting between Mr Johnson and French president Emmanuel Macron on the margins of the G20 in Rome yesterday failed to resolve the dispute and the two sides gave conflicting accounts of what happened. French government sources said the two leaders agreed to de-escalate the conflict and to hold discussions "in the coming hours and days on fishing licences". But Mr Johnson's official spokesman said Britain's position that France's threats were in breach of the post-Brexit trade agreement was unchanged and that the requirements for fishing licences would not be relaxed. "It will be for the French to decide whether they want to step away from the threats they've made in recent days about breaching the Brexit agreement," he said. "We stand ready to work with the French government and individual fishermen on further licences if they have the requisite evidence, but our position has not changed. So there's no further work from us." \</doc>

W HAT with governors' elections, January 6 prosecutions and finagling over the Democrats' 'Build Back Better' agenda in Washington DC last week, one could almost forget that a major UN climate conference - the "last best hope" for the world to pull itself together and avoid catastrophic climate change - was happening across the Atlantic, in Glasgow, Scotland. Still, the conference - COP26 - was never too far out of mind, in large part because of the flood of video and photographs it produced: protesters protesting, global leaders hobnobbing, Leonardo DiCaprio just ... present, I suppose, and oddball environmentalist Prince Charles finally getting his due. Perhaps one of the most eyecatching images featured US President Joe Biden appearing to fall asleep during other world leaders' speeches on Monday. Not that anyone can blame the man. Who among us, after a trans- Atlantic flight, a bevy of conference events and multiple, doubtless pro forma speeches, wouldn't be tempted to rest one's eyes? (And besides, the entire world now knows that it was Britain's Boris Johnson - maskless, rumpled, unserious - who was really asleep.) The snoozy snapshots might have been amusing, but they also seemed symbolic of the approach much of the US leadership has taken to climate issues: eyes closed. By the end of the week, Biden was pushed out of the climate-related spotlight by images of Democrat West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin - taken not at the conference, but in Washington - pushing young climate protesters aside with his silver Maserati, on his way out of his yacht club's garage. Biden does actually seem to care about climate. Hours after being sworn in as president, he announced that the US would rejoin the Paris climate accord - an agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally below 1.5 - reversing his predecessor's abrupt withdrawal. And Biden's Build Back Better plan contains a historic $555bn ((EURO)479bn) in climate change mitigation investments, even if the overall infrastructure package has shrunk significantly in size due to congressional objections to the multi-trillion-dollar price tag. And Manchin? Does he care? Absolutely not. In fact, Manchin has almost single-handedly been holding up parts of Build Back Better, with particular animus toward the bill's clean energy measures. (Manchin is the top Senate recipient of campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry this election cycle and has personal financial stakes in fossil fuel companies.) It was reportedly for fear of alienating Manchin that the US declined to join the COP26 pledge to phase out coal. Here's the problem for Democrats: The public cares very much about climate change, especially younger voters who are the party's future. The protesters who blocked Manchin's luxury vehicle were part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth activist group focused on climate change and other progressive causes. Five of their number had just ended a hunger strike for climate justice. One, a 24-year-old whose strike ended after doctors told him he was at risk of cardiac arrest, held a sign on the strike's first day that read: "Hunger striking for my future children." That was a comparatively optimistic pronouncement, considering the growing number of young people who are deciding not to have children at all due to fears of climate crisis. One survey found that at least a third of American adults under 45 expected to either not have kids or to have fewer due to climate change. And a poll last year showed that one-in-four childless adults cited climate change as one reason they hadn't reproduced. At this point, 60pc of American adults told the Pew Research Centre that they were worried about the personal impacts of climate change. In another Pew survey, 67pc of Gen Z respondents and 71pc of millennial respondents said climate should be a top priority. The issue, much like the planet, is only getting hotter. Which brings us back to the images from COP26 and what they really say. My takeaway? Biden needs to wake up and get his party in hand. It's Manchin, not the protesters, who must get out of the way.

SCHOOLS are banning non- biodegradable glitter and looking to ditch Christmas crackers amid calls to introduce more eco-friendly festive initiatives. One school asked pupils to bring in Christmas jumpers to swap them instead of buying them new, and in another school the nativity scenery and costumes were all reused or recycled. Eco-conscious pupils, parents and teachers are demanding more action on the climate crisis in schools \- and Christmas is no exception. It comes after youth activists took to the streets of Glasgow during school time last month alongside campaigner Greta Thunberg to demand action on climate change during the global Cop26 summit. The young Swedish activist has inspired many pupils in Britain and Northern Ireland to call for greater change in recent years. Jane Prescott, head of Portsmouth High School and former president of the Girls\' Schools Association (GSA), said students\' interest in sustainability has been  gaining even greater momentum . This year, for the first time, Portsmouth High School ran a festive jumper swap among its pupils to reduce the purchasing of new seasonal clothes every year.  It was really welcomed by the parents, but also by the girls. They\' re quite environmentally conscious and they\' re very into sustainability and they like the idea that something that isn\' t worn out they can recycle and pass on to somebody else who can use it the following year. Glitter is not allowed at the private girls\' school due to its impact on the environment.  At one time prep schools and primary schools were full of glitter, at this time of year we have banned it, the head added. Some schools also tried to reduce the amount of festive decorations \- such as Christmas crackers and table cloths \- they use to reduce waste.  I think crackers in schools probably have had their day and we probably won\' t have crackers at all next year, Mrs Prescott added. Graham Frost, head of Robert Ferguson Primary School in Carlisle, has banned non-biodegradable glitter from this year due to environmental concerns.  I have outlawed the plastic glitter for craft activities so essentially anyone who puts an order through the school office they will be vetted and turned back if they try and order regular plastic glitter, he said.  My hope is that if more schools take that line then the suppliers that supply schools will think very carefully about sourcing things which are more in keeping with our environmental sensitivities.  I think there is a growing feeling that if we\' re in the business, as we are, of preparing children for the future, with that future being imperilled by climate change, it is therefore imperative that we as schools do all we can to be a force for change and, to some extent, a force for influence. James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders\' union NAHT, said:  Young people are especially passionate about doing more to protect the environment and schools are responding to that.  Christmas can be a time of excess and it is more and more causing people to think about how that impact can be mitigated.  We know that pupils are so much more aware of their environmental impact these days and at this time of year in particular it is they who are asking questions about how they can enjoy a more environmentally friendly Christmas. Whether it\' s recyclable wrapping paper and Christmas cards, or the reduction of plastics in presents, many are thinking about how they can make a difference. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:  Schools put a great deal of focus on the environment in all that they do because of the vital importance of this issue in general and particularly for their pupils who rightly feel very strongly about the need for a greener world.  The recent Cop26 climate change conference may well have intensified that interest and Christmas provides a great opportunity to channel this enthusiasm into practical activities. \</doc>

Kim Stanley Robinson's 2020 novel The Ministry for the Future tells a horror story of climate breakdown. Deadly heatwaves that kill millions in a week, devastating acts of eco-terrorism, acute water shortages and accelerating extinction rates. The book can be read as "a vast scenario exercise showing how the transformation of finance becomes part of the solution to the climate crisis," according to Nick Robins, professor of sustainable finance at the London School of Economics. In the book, the Ministry for the Future, a fictional body set up under the Paris Agreement, issues a new currency called the Carbon Coin, in support of projects that sequester carbon from the atmosphere such as forestry. In the novel, the world of finance takes this shift in its stride and the carbon coin becomes just like every other commodity, in the process "hedging the apocalypse". If only. So far there is little evidence that international emissions trading mechanisms have delivered meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. There has been much talk of the huge potential for trading in carbon credits to incentivise and reward mitigation. But is this just a euphemism for the creation of a new class of assets for speculators? Does trading really benefit the global atmosphere? We are about to find out. When delegates from the world's nations reconvene at the end of this month in Glasgow for Cop26 they will resume consideration of the last section of the Paris Agreement rulebook that has not yet been finalised - article 6. The purpose of emissions trading under article 6 is to allow parties to co-operate in pursuit of higher ambition. So far so good. Article 6.2 makes it clear that transfers of what are called "mitigation outcomes", such achieved emissions reductions, must be subject to robust accounting to avoid double counting of emissions reductions. Nationally determined contributions Basically this means that if country A overachieves its nationally determined contribution (NDC) it could "sell' the surplus to country B, but the emissions reductions can only be recorded on one party's inventory, not both. The Paris text tries to circumvent the potential for "hot air" by requiring "environmental integrity" and an "overall mitigation in global emissions", but there is no agreement yet on how to operationalise these aspirations in the draft rules. The Paris decision makes it clear that a corresponding adjustment must be made to the host country's inventory if mitigation outcomes are transferred. It should be noted that this principle may also apply to transactions under article 6.4 under the sustainable development mechanism, depending on what is agreed in Glasgow. Rules establishing common baselines for NDCs are still unresolved. Because many aspects of the Paris Agreement were deliberately vague to maximise the chances of agreement, countries have submitted NDCs that are often widely different in scope and coverage, with different base years and metrics. For instance, China is now proposing to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030, and to lower carbon intensity by over 65 per cent in 2030. Brazil's latest targets to reduce emissions are unchanged on paper, but a change to the base year means that Brazil can continue to increase its emissions and still meet its targets. The variety of NDC formats mean that drawing up rules for article 6 is extremely technically challenging and it is not a foregone conclusion that agreement will be reached in Glasgow. What would the implications be for carbon trading if there is no agreement on article 6? In the real world, the voluntary carbon market is exploding, given the desire of companies, countries and even individuals to offset their emissions. Essentially, they are paying for the moral right to pollute. Voluntary carbon offsets are generated and verified by private entities such as Verra or the Gold Standard and sold onwards to anyone who wants to buy them. But all carbon credits, whether for compliance or voluntary markets, make the same fundamental and often dubious claim: that one credit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon sequestered/drawn down. Offset mechanism In the absence of new regulated market under the Paris Agreement, the private sector has seen a global surge of demand for carbon credits that are now largely coming from forestry and land-use projects. The ratings agency Fitch recently estimated that demand for carbon credits will outstrip supply by 2025, and much of this demand is driven by the aviation sector's offset mechanism, Corsia. The rising demand for carbon offsets explains the spotlight on the potential for carbon credits from soils and forestry. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has sought legal advice to claim "ownership" of all the forest carbon on privately owned land, even where it was subsidised by the State. But if the IFA is successful, article 6 rules may require corresponding adjustments to the national inventory, which could further undermine Ireland's chances of meeting our own national targets for 2030. It goes without saying that we don't have any spare forest credits to be giving or selling away. Greenwashing by companies, and business-as-usual lifestyles and business models are driving this demand. It is possible to imagine a fictional world where a new carbon currency shifts finance to developed countries and where sequestration can be incentivised for the benefit of people and planet. But a Ministry for the Future, seeking to guarantee the survival of our civilisation, would not allow us to hedge that future.

Nicola Sturgeon has said Boris Johnson is taking a different approach than his predecessors when meeting devolved governments, suggesting it might be the result of a "fragile male ego". The Scottish first minister said most of Mr Johnson's interactions with devolved administrations were delegated to Michael Gove. She spoke to Vogue magazine ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, discussing the campaign for Scottish independence and her approach to climate change. \~ Asked about her working relationship with the British prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said: "He tends to delegate most of his interactions with the devolved governments to Michael Gove. "That's fine, Michael Gove and I work together well, but it's a different approach to his predecessors." Asked why she thought this was the case, she said: "Maybe it's just a bit of a fragile male ego. Advertisement"He seems to have a disinclination to be, metaphorically speaking, in the same room as me. It's odd." On her campaign for Scottish independence, the first minister said: "There's no status quo: the UK that people wanted to stay a part of in 2014 arguably does not exist any longer." She also spoke about the importance of the Cop26 summit's attempt to limit global warming to 1.5C. She said: "It probably is the last chance the world has to reach an agreement that is specific enough to meet the Paris 1.5 degrees target. "It's a massive opportunity, but I think there will be a real difficulty if that opportunity is not taken." Discussing the future of the oil and gas industry, she said: "This has not been an easy thing for somebody in my position and in the political tradition I come from to say, but we have to ask ourselves whether new exploration for oil and gas is consistent with meeting the climate change imperatives." \</doc>

GREEN Party leader Eamon Ryan described the COP26 decision to weaken commitments on phasing out fossil fuels as 'gutwrenching' - but urged people to 'look at the bigger picture'. A global agreement to keep temperature rises below 1.5C was reached at the climate conference in Glasgow, but a commitment to 'phase out' the use of coal was changed to 'phase down' following interventions by China and India. Delegates from 197 UN member states agreed to the climate pact following a tense 24 hours of additional negotiations. The Environment, Climate and Communications Minister said the move was 'disappointing' but necessary to secure the agreement. 'We shouldn't let that gut-wrenching amendment at the very last minute distract from that bigger picture. It wasn't in the actual legal structures. That political wording can be changed,' he said. 'It has taken us six years, which is too long, too slow, but what was significant in Glasgow was it put legal bones on the Paris Climate Agreement.' The minister added: 'It does actually give us real strong confidence that the whole economic system, the finance system, is going to have to switch to this decarbonised direction.' Mr Ryan said the compromise was necessary in a deal which was agreed by 197 countries worldwide. He told RT\'c9's This Week that 'there isn't another way - it does require that seeking of consensus'. 'That won't stop and the search for greater ambition won't stop,' he said. 'But I think what we should do now is deliver on what was committed and deliver it here at home. This does give real momentum.' In addition to plans to cut carbon emissions by 2030, more than 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. More than 40 countries also agreed to shift away from coal as an energy source, and more than 100 countries - representing 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030. However, not everyone was happy with the deal that was struck at the conference. Former president Mary Robinson was almost in tears as she said that while the conference 'made some progress', it is 'nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster'. 'While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty,' she said. And climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted: 'The COP26 is over. Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah. 'The real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever.' 'Millions are already in crisis' \</doc>

The British prime minister has come under fire from the World Health Organisation's (WHO) special envoy for Covid-19 after being photographed without a face covering during a hospital visit. Asked about pictures of Boris Johnson walking through Hexham General in the UK without a mask, Dr David Nabarro said: "We all need to be able to do what we've got to do, regardless of what politics we adopt." He told Sky News: "I'm not sitting on the fence on this one - where you've got large amounts of virus being transmitted, everybody should do everything to avoid either getting the virus or inadvertently passing it on. Advertisement"We should do it all, and we should not rely on any one intervention like vaccination on its own. "So, please, would every leader be wearing face masks, particularly when in indoor settings. "This virus is unforgiving, and we need to do everything possible to prevent it getting in between us and infecting us." Dr Nabarro also told the broadcaster: "Perhaps that's the toughest thing about Covid, is that the responses get politicised - in some places if you wear a mask, you're taught to belong to a particular political party.

Over last weekend world leaders visited Rome, Italy, as part of the G20 summit, travelling on private jets from across the globe and taking part in elaborate cavalcades of 85 vehicles. Next, they sat aboard these planes once again and flew to Glasgow in Scotland in order to attend the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 - how do these people not see the irony of it all? Were they absent for the last two years as the rest of us became accustomed to using Zoom and other platforms to facilitate meetings? If you take Joe Biden for example, his participation in G20 and COP26 meant a 10,000 mile roundtrip from Washington to Rome and then home again via Glasgow. But as is customary with US presidents, he won't be flying in economy class. Instead his fleet consists of Air Force One, a Boeing 747, which carries the president, an identical decoy and two cargo planes to accommodate his stream of vehicles. In Rome, President Biden sat into his Cadillac named the 'Beast' - which is an apt name, given it only does about eight miles to the gallon. As part of the entourage, the Beast was joined by another identical decoy vehicle as well as 80 other cars - some of which were flown in from the States. One estimate indicated that Biden's trip to both international events was going to generate approximately 2.2 million pounds of carbon, which is almost 100t. While the amount of carbon a person creates in a year varies depending on where you live, globally the average stands at about 4t per annum. Reports indicate that the minimum a person produces, from the moment food is grown to when they consume it is 2t every year. Read More Meanwhile, it is believed that 400 private jets will be utilised to transport politicians and business executives in and out of the UK for the climate event, emitting an estimated 2t of carbon for every hour in the air. And yet fuel for planes, as well as ships, seems to be escaping from the carbon tax. In the lead up to COP26 I was very interested to hear the views of Dr Marguerite Nyhan, senior lecturer in future sustainability at UCC in one particular interview. She noted that half of the world's 4 billion population live in cities; and this figure is set to grow to almost 70% by 2050. As it stands, about two thirds of people live in urban areas in Ireland. But while cities only represent 3% of land cover globally, they account for 70% of global energy consumption and 75% of global CO2 emissions, the UCC lecturer outlined. And despite the world population continuing to grow, some of the proposals being discussed at COP26 In the next 30 years, the global population is set to grow by almost 2 billion people. A major reality check needs to happen when planning for the future. One item that needs to be addressed is the Mercosur trade deal. We all know the importance of the Amazon rainforest when it comes to climate change. Well, in 2020 it is reported that 1.7 million hectares of primary forest was lost in Brazil, a 25% increase on the previous year. How can we suggest to limit food production in sustainable parts of the world, while simultaneously encouraging deforestation in another? When you look at league tables, Ireland are far from table toppers. If you look at the worst polluters, China clearly tops the charts with 9.8 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions. The United States comes second with 4.9 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted, while India sits in third with 2.4 billion tonnes. Meanwhile, Ireland produced closer to 60 million tonnes - that's quite a difference. This week the Taoiseach Micheal Martin announced, what I believe to be, unattainable plans when it comes to decarbonising the transport sector here. The wish list includes electrifying bus routes, 2,000 extra on-street charging points for electric vehicles and retrofitting 75,000 homes per year. And while I accept that technology will progress and help us to reach some targets, we have to be more realistic. Show me a lorry that is powered by electricity; they just aren't available yet. The wave of lunacy around the climate change debate is just breathtaking at the moment and people need to come back down to earth and stop living in the clouds. The facts are that if the population continues to grow, then we must be able to feed them. This food should be produced in countries where it is sustainable to do so, and not involve the illegal deforestation of a rainforest. Instead of kicking the daylights out of farmers at every single turn, maybe we should be recognising what they are already doing for economy and the environment. Farmers are prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel, but the farmer bashing must stop. And if the migration of people to cities and urban areas is to reach 70% in the coming decades, one would have to wonder if the man power will be left in rural areas to continue to feed the rest of the world.

Under the rainbow of Cop26 , there is an underlying common goal of trying to create new partnerships between cities and regions, and doing so in a way that is genuinely sustainable." While Dublin and London bare their respective political teeth at each other in a Brexit standoff over the Northern Ireland Protocol, British ambassador to Ireland, Paul Johnston, is in Cork to talk a good game on cooperation and collegiality. There is life outside of the capital cities and political difficulties, as Mr Johnston - a Glaswegian native - understands all too well. That means strengthening links between cities like Cork and Coventry, and nurturing new academic and research links between Leeside and Plymouth in the southwest of England. For a career diplomat that has seen postings in the likes of Bosnia, Kosovo, the UN, Nato, and Sweden, the posting in Ireland brings a whole new diplomatic challenge, with climate change high on the agenda. "Whatever the short-term differences between the governments over certain aspects of important political issues, the more we create networks between people, businesses, institutions, activists, you strengthen that underlying web of relationships, which is the real resilience of the overall relationship," said Mr Johnston. "When I arrived in Sweden, I immediately started going to Gothenberg and Malmo and to the north of the country. "When I came here, Cork was going to be my first visit outside of Dublin, and I was going to go to Limerick, Galway, Donegal, Belfast. "I couldn't do that for most of my first year, effectively - although it has been a pleasure delayed - I think this visit to Cork is going to be one of the first of many, because as someone who comes from a place a long, long way from London, I'm strongly of the view that relationships are not just about capital cities," Mr Johnston told the Irish Examiner . "My hope is to be able to foster new-age partnerships between Cork and cities in the UK," he said. "My predecessor came here some years ago to inaugurate the Joining The Dots programme, and the whole idea of that was to get away from the exclusive focus on London and Dublin, and think about different parts of Ireland and different parts of the UK. "Coming here to Cork is sort of opening a new chapter on that. You look at the potential, whether it is in business or academia, or culture, for how we can create new networks and connections between Cork and different parts of the UK." The two-week UN climate change summit in his native city means partnerships and good relations between Ireland and Britain are more important than ever, according to Mr Johnston. "At an event in the embassy soon after I arrived looking at renewable energy, offshore wind, one of the things I heard about was that UCC has a big emphasis on sustainability, ranked one of the highest universities in the world in terms of its sustainable impacts," he said. "In a way, there can be no more suitable days in coming to Cork than on the day Cop26 is looking at the role of cities and regions in the longer-term sustainability. "We are looking in cultural terms at building up the connections between Cork and Coventry, which is the UK City of Culture next year. We are also keen to build in the areas of science and innovation. I think that renewable energy, offshore wind, sustainability more generally means I am really keen on meeting so many colleagues here. It's a timely visit." The UK has become a world leader in the offshore wind energy sector, and there is "enormous potential" for working in partnership with Ireland in the ever-burgeoning sector, he said. "One of the things I did when ambassador in Sweden was encourage Swedish investment in the UK renewable energy sector," he said. "The big Swedish energy companies were some of those in the early stage offshore wind in the UK. "Even the last 10 or 15 years, it's interesting - back in the early days, we had to as a government put a lot of money into subsidising that investment, because the technology was a bit unpredictable, the market wasn't very clear. "Some overseas investors really needed to be persuaded that there would be a guaranteed level of price for their electricity. "Now the technology is advanced, the whole transition towards electric vehicles and decarbonising the economy has meant the market situation is very different and now, your renewable energy, while not selling itself, has become much more marketable as a proposition." There is no getting away from the current political tension, he conceded. But it is solvable, the career diplomat is keen to stress. "I think the two governments want to have a really strong relationship," he said. "The societies, economies, and their people are so intertwined, that I think we see very common agendas. "If you look at the emphasis on the Irish Government's National Development Plan, so much of it overlaps with what our government is trying to do in its Levelling Up agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity, connectivity across the countries. "Clearly we are having an important discussion at the moment with the EU on the protocol, Britain and Ireland have very shared interests and objectives in terms of peace and stability in Northern Ireland, and to make sure the balances in the Good Friday Agreement for a really strong north-south connection, and east-west connection, are developed. "It is not a great secret that there are differences of approaches between the British and Irish governments in terms of aspects of the details, but as the Taoiseach has said in the D\'e1il, and our minister has said in the House of Lords, we both want to focus on trying to get a negotiated solution, because that would be the best and most sustainable way forward. "The good thing about having a really strong established set of relationships, as between Britain and Ireland, is that you can have honest, candid conversations, you can have differences of opinion ... I am confident we have shared medium and long-term objectives, we sometimes differ over the short-term strategy or tactics. "If you stand back a bit and look at the wider world, we as European democracies have so much in common, obviously in terms of Northern Ireland and preserving the gains in the Good Friday Agreement. "But if you look at some of the challenges that liberal democracies face in other parts of the world, from state and non-state actors, it is really important that countries like Ireland and the UK work together, as we do on the UN Security Council, as we're doing this week in climate change negotiations, and some of the agendas of the future, such as renewable energy, digital health - there are tremendous possibilities." Cop26 must be a turning point for the world when it comes to forging lasting partnerships for sustainable living, economies, and societies, Mr Johnston said. "If we have learned anything in the last few years, it's the value of a more healthy lifestyle, walking, trying to use more public transport, trying to innovate in how we live. If you look at what we have been trying to do at Cop26 , taking carbon out of our economy, getting people into more healthy lifestyles, breathing more life into city centres, I think this needs to be a turning point for the planet. "I was reflecting on Armistice Day at Glasnevin Cemetery, and one of the former soldiers read out the famous words: 'For your tomorrow, we gave our today.' "What everyone at Cop26 should be doing is something today and the day after for the whole planet." \</doc>

Environment Correspondent Researchers at University College Cork (UCC) found that women and those from minority groups are particularly at a higher risk of psychological impairment when exposed to extreme weather. Citing figures from the Centre of Epidemiology of Disasters that reported a tenfold increase in the number of climate-related disaster events in the last 70 years, the researchers looked at previous studies that examined psychological impairment among populations exposed to extreme weather. Some 59 reviews published over 20 years were identified, with data from almost 61,500 people exposed to extreme weather events. A majority were assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder (77.4%), followed by depression (40.3%), and anxiety 23.4%), the UCC study found. The odds of developing a psychological impairment were approximately 90% higher among individuals exposed to extreme weather events, the data shows. Lead author Jean O'Dwyer of UCC's School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Science, and the Environmental Research Institute, said the study shows "the somewhat hidden impacts of the climate crisis". "It emphasises that this global challenge comes with very local and personal consequences," said Ms O'Dwyer. "Whether you're in Ireland or Indonesia, if an extreme weather event threatens your home, your livelihood or your physical health, it will almost certainly impact your mental health too." Women were found to be at a higher risk, often regardless of income, due to cultural, socio-economic, and physiological factors, the study found, as were also likeliest to experience postevent violence.

David Attenborough has issued a warning ahead of the UN climate summit in Glasgow that leaders must act now or "it'll be too late" for the planet. COP26 has been billed as the last best chance to keep global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C, with Mr Attenborough critical of those who deny the climate crisis. In an interview with the BBC, the naturalist and broadcaster said: "Every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects." He added: "If we don't act now, it will be too late. We have to do it now." Wealthier western countries have a "moral responsibility" to help refugees displaced by climate change, the 95-year-old said. "We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility," he said. "Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything. Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?" Earlier in October, Mr Attenborough, who will be present at the summit, said the possibilities of COP26 "For the first time people around the world will hear the arguments as to what we should do, the analyses as to what the problems are and what the solutions are," he said. "Those two things bring me some hope." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will welcome world leaders to Glasgow for the summit which begins on Sunday after saying it was "touch and go" whether key goals would be met as the heads of some major polluting nations are set to skip the event. Recent analysis suggests that even with the latest pledges and targets, the earth is heading for around 2.4C of warming in the long-term. \</doc>

The Wombles are collaborating with Sir Paul McCartney on a project to encourage people to eat less meat for the sake of the environment. As part of the #OneStepGreener campaign for Cop26 , the classic children's characters are joining forces with Sir Paul's campaign Meat Free Monday. The children's show has championed positive environmental behaviour since it first aired in 1973 as it is about a family of litter-picking creatures who live on Wimbledon Common.

The furry creatures are supporting the campaign with the creation of two family-friendly plant-based recipes. Each of the recipes will be presented in a short, animated film featuring one of the famous Wombles characters - Madame Cholet's Chilli Non Carne and Tobermory's Corn and Courgette Fritters. The recipes will be published on November 1, World Vegan Day, and November 8th on the Meat Free Monday website. The Beatles star, 79, also composed the song which features in the recipe films.

TAOISEACH ACCUSED OF 'COP OUT' ON COP26 COMMITMENTS BEFORE THE 'INK IS DRY' By James Ward, PA Taoiseach Micheal Martin has been accused of a ``cop out'' on commitments made at Cop26 before ``the ink is dry on the agreement''. At the climate conference in Glasgow this week, Ireland signed up to a global pledge to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. But the Government has indicated that the pledge will not be included in Ireland's forthcoming carbon budgets, which will target a 10% cut in methane, as well as larger reductions in other gas emissions. Social Democrats co-leader Roisin Shorthall questioned if the Government's actions on climate will meet its rhetoric. Speaking during Leaders' Questions in the Dail, she said: ``The omens are not good, it has to be said. ``Yesterday you said Ireland would sign a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30%, before hastily adding that this was a global target and not a national one. ``We hear the climate action plan contains a target of just 10% reduction and the Tanaiste also used this 10% figure yesterday. ``Can you explain the purpose of publicly signing up to a 30% reduction target, when it seems you have no intention of even even attempting to achieve that?'' Ms Shorthall said that if every country took that approach there would be ``zero chance'' the targets would be met. ``Why are you making commitments at Cop that you cop out of as soon as the ink is dry on the agreement?'' she asked. Responding, Mr Martin insisted the Cop26 agreement of a 30% reduction in methane is a global target, towards which individual countries will have to contribute. He accused Ms Shorthall of an ``abundance of negativity''. He said: ``You seem to persistently want to seek to undermine what are genuine and transformative decisions by this Government to step-change our response to climate change, which we have done through the climate action legislation, through the establishment of the climate council and the carbon budgeting that will occur. ``On the global methane pledge, I think the deputy is being somewhat disingenuous here. ``Read the pledge. Read what people have signed up to. It is a global pledge. ``So globally, collectively, in different ways and through different mechanisms, countries who sign up will contribute to that overall 30% global reduction in methane.'' Mr Martin said the Government's climate action plan will ``deal with every sector'', including energy, transport, agriculture, land use and deforestation. Ms Shorthall also asked the Taoiseach for clarity on plans to cull the national herd as part of Ireland's climate goals. She noted that the Green Party has called for a reduction in size, while members of the other coalition parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, have ``mysteriously started to use the phrase ''stabilisation``. Mr Martin did not respond to the question despite repeated requests from Ms Shorthall. Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows we are facing a ``code red for humanity''. ``The carbon budgets proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council (was published) last week and that's what we're looking at in the Climate Action Plan - that hasn't come to government,'' she added. ``I'm going to be in the climate committee, so it hasn't been agreed yet but I think everything we do, we have to remember that we're in an existential crisis here. ``Every thing has a benefit and there are co-benefits and whatever targets - when it comes to emission reductions - you have to look at cleaner air and public transport increasing, and less traffic congestion and more jobs. ``So I'll be in that climate committee this afternoon and that's when things will be agreed.'' She said the Green Party is ``making a change'' in its time in Government. Ms Martin added that the public has to remember the benefits of reducing emissions. ``Instead of them and us, we must try and approach this in a more together atmosphere and look at the benefits of cleaner (air), less traffic congestion, and more public transport,'' the minister added. end \</doc>

Cop26 : We must not forget millions in global south Now that the Cop26 Whilst there has been progress, with the critical climate change crisis placed firmly on the global agenda, we are still on course for 2.4 degrees warming. And there is deep disappointment that powerful states did not flex all their muscles to go that extra step to steer current and future generations to safety. For example, Tr\'f3caire was particularly disappointed at the omission of Loss and Damage financing from the final Cop26 agreement. This was a missed opportunity by powerful nations, who have contributed most to climate change, to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. However, it is vital that we don't lose heart. And now that the focus will move to other issues it is critical that momentum created by Cop26 is not lost. It is up to all of us to build on the achievements secured, to bridge the gaps, and to pressure decision-makers at home and abroad to continue to act with urgency. It is easy to label Cop26 a cop-out. But a lot can and must be achieved before nations reconvene in Egypt for Cop27. Ireland can play its part. We must not forget the millions in the global south who are most impacted by the climate crisis, and whose young people are now mobilising to demand change. They have done least to cause this crisis. This is a matter of climate justice. Caoimhe de Barra CEO, Tr\'f3caire Maynooth Co Kildare Let's treat addicts as patients, not criminals Of course ordinary citizens wish that the forces of law and order would put an end to the scourge; lock up the miscreants, confiscate their ill gotten wealth and be relieved of all of the burdens that the trade imposes on our societies. However virtuous, such an approach is not going to succeed. Why? Because of the unimaginable amount of monetary gain it offers to the criminals involved. Our conception of the shady characters on street corners and back alleys being the drug pushers is wrong. Most are just sad misfits operating as powerless retailers. We clog our court systems and expensive jails with them with very little hope of rehabilitation, because they know no other life. For every one we deprive of liberty, there are dozens of replacements. Some amongst them are more dangerous, prone to violence, and with ambition to move up the gang ladder. That is still not a full picture, but a nicely sanitised one that can be attributed to the supposed low life who live in the inner cities. Meanwhile, the drug lords are swimming in an ocean of cash of such volumes that it cannot be dealt with without large numbers of bankers, financiers and accountants. Even the wealthy, who can afford recreational use of cocaine, are guilty of supporting a rancid industry. Because of the hurricane of illicit wealth being produced by the trade the one possibility of ending the plague lies in choking off the money supply, and the only hope of achieving that aim is to legalise and nationalise the entire industry. We can begin to treat our addicts as patients, not as criminals. Vast sums of money will start to re-enter the visible economy. Gun crime will reduce in many parts of the world as drug gangs' wealth is reduced. Frank Kennan Mountrath Co Laois Hats off to those protecting our health Very few have the skill and composure to manage a major crisis. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, and Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan and others are doing an amazing job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances with constant pressure on themselves and their families. Meanwhile, the "hurlers on the ditch" can focus on finding fault without almost any fear of vigorous questioning of their propositions or motives. For instance, nightclub owners can rush to the media looking for "clarity". The notion that Miche\'e1l and Tony et al should spend time working out how nightclubs should be run safely in a pandemic is preposterous. Nightclub owners have had 18 months to do scenario planning, as good managers should do, rather than looking for specifics from Miche\'e1l, Tony and others who are hardly nightclub boppers, but are expected to solve all their woes. Pat O'Mahony Westport, Co Mayo We need to give the Government a break I wonder if I am the only one sick and tired of having people demand a plan from the Government to get us out of this pandemic? It is asking the impossible. You can't plan for the completely unpredictable. We'd all love for it to end and go back to 'normal'. In the meantime we need to make the best of it and be grateful we have a reasonably sensible and stable government who are trying their best. Patrick Browne Skehard Rd Cork Restricting nightclubs a no-brainer It's infuriating that a few bad apples have refused to assume social awareness and responsibility during Covid. Not even I can blame the government for anything! Dr Florence Craven Bracknagh Co Offaly No sympathy for drinking den owners I haven't much sympathy for anybody who owns and operates what are ostensibly glorified drinking dens charging exorbitant prices to clients to achieve blotto-ness, sooner rather than later, so that they can count their extortionate profits while it's still dark. The government has now performed so many U-turns on any subject you care to mention, that it is now in lockstep on an ever decreasing circle, which is only going to end when it disappears up its own commodious backside. Dundalk Co Louth Employers' approach to recruitment poor I write regarding the current difficulties employers are having in recruiting staff. So far, all of the emphasis in this debate has been on the attitudes of workers and potential workers; but I submit that employers in all industries need to have a long hard look at themselves and their approach to recruitment. For example, employers' representative groups often talk about the need to 'think outside the box' (in order to find new ways to attract staff); I suggest employers stop 'thinking outside the box' and start using their common sense instead. An example of this common sense would be if employers and the State agencies set up programmes of training for the long-term unemployed, in various industries; these programmes would have to be accompanied by tangible (paid) work experience during the training and good rates of pay and proper working conditions, when trainees are fully qualified and gainfully employed. Participation in such programmes would have to be entirely voluntary, from the point of view of the unemployed person, with no compulsion of any kind. The long-term unemployed have, for a long time, been fobbed off with £ctivation' schemes which are utterly futile and waste an awful lot of taxpayers money every year. Another area where employers need to have a long hard look at themselves, is in their approach to job interviews. Over the last number of years, I have found the standard of interviewing skills within recruitment agencies and company interviewing panels to be very poor, as a rule. This is my experience of both multinationals and Irish-based companies. Interviewers and agency representatives don't prepare sufficiently (for the interview), they don't read CVs properly and there is a total lack of focus on the 'business at hand', for example finding the right person. It will come as a surprise to many employers, but a small bit of common decency, common courtesy and basic professionalism would go a long way towards attracting workers into any reputable industry.

GRETA Thunberg may not have been officially invited to the landmark Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, but on the first day of the conference she was making her presence known. The Swedish teenager, who is something of a rock star for climate activists around the world, is among the thousands of activists who are descending on Glasgow for the UN Climate Change Conference, which kicked off on yesterday. They are calling on world leaders take bold action to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Thunberg said that the 1.5C goal was "possible in theory" but "it's up to us if we want that to happen". Thunberg arrived in Glasgow on Saturday night and was quickly surrounded by about a hundred people at a Glasgow train station. Several police officers escorted her away from the throng. "Finally in Glasgow for the Cop26 ! And thank you for the very warm welcome," tweeted the 18-year-old, who included a picture of her giving a thumbsup to the assembled crowd. Scotland's Sunday Mail newspaper dubbed the scene 'Greta Mania'. Thunberg travelled by train to Glasgow from London, where she had taken part in a protest demanding that financial institutions stop funding fossil fuel extraction. In the BBC interview, Thunberg said that sometimes anger was the right response as part of environmental demonstrations. She was asked about the protest tactics of campaigners in the UK who in recent weeks have been blocking roads. "To make clear, as long as no one gets hurt... then I think sometimes you need to anger some people," she said. "Like, for instance, the school strike movement would never have become so big if there wasn't friction, if some people didn't get ped off." Thunberg is expected to take part in a demonstration on November 5 organised by the Scottish arm of Fridays For Future, the student movement Thunberg founded in 2018. She is also scheduled to speak at a demonstration the following day. In the BBC interview, Thunberg said she hadn't "officially" been invited to speak at the conference. "I think that many people might be scared that if they invite too many radical young people, then that might make them look bad," she told Marr. She raised her fingers to make air quotes when she said the word "radical". She told Marr that the conference needed "more representation from the so-called global south, from the most affected people and areas". "It's not fair, when, for example, one country sends lots and lots of delegates, and then another country is very under-represented. That already creates an imbalance, and climate justice is at the very heart of this crisis." The Cop26 They said that people have been kept from getting to Glasgow by a range of obstacles, including lack of access to vaccines and travel and sky-high accommodation costs. About 25,000 international guests from nearly 200 countries are expected to attend the 12-day summit - Downing Street said it was one of the largest events the UK has ever hosted - and prices for some shortterm rental rooms have soared. One American delegate shared on social media his exchange with a property owner who asked for an extra $2,000 after realising that the rental period overlapped with the summit. Leaders from over 100 countries are expected in Glasgow for crunch talks today and Tomorrow, but there are notable absences, including the leaders of China and Russia. Earlier this month the Queen appeared to express irritation at world leaders who wouldn't commit to the summit. Asked about the monarch's remarks, Thunberg said that she thought most people would concur with the Queen. "Yeah, I think most people agree with that," she said. (C) The Washington Post \</doc>

A decision to trigger Article 16 would have ``far reaching implications'' for the UK Government's relationships with Ireland and the EU, the Irish premier has warned. Micheal Martin said the trade agreement between the UK and the EU was conditional on the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit deal being implemented. The British Government has threatened to trigger Article 16, a move that would effectively unilaterally suspend the treaty, and is calling for the removal of the oversight role European Court of Justice in its operation. The Taoiseach said that such a move would be ``irresponsible, unwise and reckless'' and would shake the foundations of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland. Mr Martin said he had spoken with US President Joe Biden at the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow this week, who told him ``how the Good Friday Agreement matters very deeply to his administration'' and that this position had been made ``unequivocally clear'' to the British Government. Speaking in the Irish parliament on Wednesday, Mr Martin said: ``In my view, it would be irresponsible, it would be unwise, and it would be reckless to invoke Article 16 as a response to the proposals from the European Commission. ``I think if such an act was to be taken by the British government, I think it would have far reaching implications for the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. ``I think it also would have implications for the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the Irish Government, because such an action would not be in accordance with the spirit of partnership that has informed the peace process from the get-go. ``And that has informed the creation of the entire architecture that underpins the Good Friday Agreement. That is my very strong view.'' Mr Martin suggested a move to invoke Article 16 could have implications for the post-Brexit trade deal struck between the UK and the EU. ``The British Government signed up to the protocol as condition of the trade cooperation agreement'' he said. ``The trade cooperation agreement would not have been signed off by the European Union without the protocol having been signed off in advance. ``So the British Government knowingly signed up to that.'' He said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Charles Michel had been ``very clear in terms of the implications that would arise if such a decision was to be taken''. He also revealed that US President Joe Biden had used the Cop26 conference to underline his support for the Irish peace process. Mr Marin said: ``At the Cop26 President Biden did ask for a brief conversation with me after one of the sessions, he called me over. ``He reiterated to me in the strongest possible terms, how the Good Friday Agreement matters very deeply to his administration, and to President Biden himself. ``He said to me that he had made this unequivocally clear to the British Government. Mr Martin hit out at the UK's demands on the ECJ in response to efforts by the European Commission to ease the implementation of the Protocol. He said proposals brought forward by the Commission's vice president Maros Sefcovic ``went beyond what many people thought the European Union would present''. ``In respect of SPS, for example, you're looking at an 80% reduction in checks, in respect of customs a massive reduction in checks, and in respect of medicines, a full solution to that and then said he's open for discussions with people,'' he added. ``The interaction between Maros Sefcovic and the main sectors in Northern Ireland confirmed that it was operational issues that concern them the most in terms of checks, and in terms of operation of the protocol.'' ``Because anybody who knows about this knows that in respect of any issues that arise from the operation of the single market the ECJ has to be the governing body, that's accepted. ``It's in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland that they have access to the single market.'' end \</doc>

Sir, - Despite your excellent coverage of Cop26 , I'm baffled as to why you publish correspondence from people who don't understand the scale of the climate crisis we are facing, along with the myriad of social problems caused by the dominance of the car in our cities and country. To address David Reddy's letter (December 4th): Dublin City Council already uses the Scats traffic management system to adapt to congestion caused by motor vehicles. He can see for himself that this does not have a significant impact on congestion or air pollution when so many people continue to drive into the city. The European cities he wishes to emulate instead address traffic and air quality issues by taking space away from private drivers and installing safe infrastructure like cycle tracks and plazas. Reducing vehicle numbers is the most effective way of achieving his goals, so he should be careful what he wishes for! As for John Griffin's alleged "psychological and therapeutic benefits" for drivers (Letters, December 6th). If these exist, they are far out-weighed by the injuries and deaths on our roads in crashes, the destruction of our countryside and biodiversity to create more roads and car parking, and the damage to our lungs and brains from air pollution. Instead of seeking to return to the womb, perhaps he should grow up? - Yours, etc, BRIAN McARDLE, Leixlip, Co Kildare. \</doc>

The Taoiseach has said Ireland has an opportunity to work with the farming sector to make sure there is a sustainable future for young farmers, but said that everyone must also deal with the realities of climate change and "how much the land can take". "We have no choice here. The climate change will catch up with us. It will catch up with our farming. It will catch up with our agriculture if we don't take action," he said. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, Miche\'e1l Martin said he believed that there needs to be a switch to giving income to farmers to protect biodiversity that will enable them to grow native tree species and clean waterways. He said he did not accept that reports in the Irish Farmers Journal that emission cuts of 21% could result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and warned against "scaremongering". There have been many headlines over the last number of weeks that are creating the impression that these goals are outlandish, he said, but "we have no choice here". Mr Martin has joined other world leaders at the COP26 in Glasgow and will deliver Ireland's National Statement to the summit today. The Taoiseach warned that failure to take action on climate change will result in climate change undermining Ireland's economic viability, given the impact that weather events such as storms have on economic life. HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/news/world/2021/1102/1257266-cop26-forests/ COP26 : Leaders vow new drive to save forests HYPERLINK //www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories He said the Government's climate action plan will contain specific sector by sector details outlining the measures be needed to be taken over the next decade in order to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, and to go climate neutral by 2050. Mr Martin said he expects the Cabinet sub-committee will give the plan the green light tomorrow, adding "no sector will escape and it will be very challenging". He admitted that Ireland has missed targets in the past, but said the passing of the climate law means legal imperatives have been set that this Government and future governments must achieve. Pursuing the unpopular carbon tax approach disincentives the use of fossil fuels but also gives the Government funding for schemes, such as retro fitting of homes and more environmentally farming, he said. The Taoiseach said reports that Ireland is on track to increase its emissions this year could be true and said many of the steps that will be taken soon will not have an impact until the latter half of the next decade. He said there needs to be buy-in from the general public and the Government needs to do more in terms of communicating the message. He added that young people are "absolutely committed to this" and should be "our inspiration". In different sectors of the economy "we must engage more about the reality of this" and the need to take this action, he warned. This will take an educational process and working with people to bring them around, Mr Martin added. Temperature increased in Ireland by 1C in 120 years Speaking on the same programme, Keith Lambkin said the forecaster is working with its partners to use climate information to help to climate-proof infrastructure given the impact of rising temperatures. He said that all sectors have to make important climate decisions in areas, including flood defences, drainage, tree-planting and Met \'c9ireann is helping to ensure that infrastructure that is built is fit for purpose. Mr Lambkin said the data taken from its flagship weather station at Valentia is "priceless" as it has been recording weather signals since 1860. He said that this will continue into the future and the World Meterological Organization has launched initiatives at COP26 to have more stations like Valentia Observatory in parts of Africa and in island states. \</doc>

A dispute between the UK and France over post-Brexit fishing rights has escalated significantly after a meeting between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron, with Downing Street rejecting a French claim that the two leaders had agreed a path towards resolving the issue. Mr Johnson and the French president met alone for half an hour yesterday morning on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rome, where they discussed next week's Cop26 climate summit, as well as tensions over Northern Ireland and fishing. French officials said, after the meeting, that there had been agreement over a path towards de-escalating the fishing dispute, in which Paris has raised the threat of trade barriers over what it says is the unfair allocation of post-Brexit licences to fish in UK waters. The two countries had agreed to work on "practical and operational measures" to resolve the dispute in the coming days, Mr Macron's officials said, adding: "We are giving ourselves the space for de-escalation in the coming hours." When asked about this, however, Mr Johnson's spokesman denied any agreement had been reached, or that there were even formal plans for more talks to discuss the situation. "I've seen some of the same reporting following that meeting," he said. "It will be for the French to decide whether they want to step away from the threats they have made in recent days about breaching the Brexit agreement. Of course, we would welcome that if they want to de-escalate the threats that they have made." French government Asked whether this meant no agreement had been reached, the spokesman said: "You would have to ask the French government about whether they want to proceed with the threats they have made." Questioned about the comments by French officials that the leaders had agreed to more "exchanges" between the two sides, Mr Johnson's spokesman said: "If the French government wishes to come forward with how they want to de-escalate the threats that they have made then we would absolutely welcome them. "The position we are in is that the French government has made a series of threats about what they will do, and they have imposed their own deadline. It is now up to the French government about whether they wish to resile from that position, but our stance has not changed." The conflicting briefings come a day before Mr Johnson is due to formally open the Cop26 meeting in Glasgow, one the prime minister has repeatedly said is crucial to the future of humanity. Downing Street officials declined to say why, in their view, the French had given a seemingly misleading account of the meeting, but they did raise the possibility that the "mooted" exchanges were a reference to more standard, lower level contact between officials that would be expected anyway. Mr Johnson had sought to play down the dispute earlier at the G20 gathering, when he stressed his close links to Mr Macron, and said he had "bigger fish to fry" in terms of preparing for Cop26 . Mr Johnson's Brexit minister, David Frost, has been more outspoken, expressing alarm at French threats to impose barriers on trade, and potentially on energy supplies, from tomorrow if there is no progress on fishing licences. Downing Street has said if such measures were taken, it would view them as breaching the post-Brexit trade and co-operation agreement, and the UK could formally begin a dispute under the terms of the deal. Downing Street's formal account of the Johnson-Macron meeting said the prime minister "reiterated his deep concern over the rhetoric emanating from the French government in recent days, including the suggestion by the French prime minister that the UK should be punished for leaving the EU. "He expressed his hope that the French government would de-escalate this rhetoric and withdraw their threats." - Guardian News and Media 2021 \</doc>

he tiny hillside village of Nodeirinho only had one child. T Dina Duarte's voice shakes as she says the name. The loss of four-year-old Bianca Antunes Henriques Nunes was the cruellest blow. She died in the terrible fire that tore through the central Portuguese region of Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande on June 17, 2017. It killed 66 people, injured 254, destroyed more than 500 homes and 50 businesses and incinerated 530 sq km of farms, forest and landscape. Eleven died in Nodeirinho, almost a third of its population, and reminders of their loss are everywhere: in the ruins of buildings, the still-blackened hills and the suffering of the bereaved. A child's laughter would be like a flower in the debris. From her home in the village, Duarte, president of the Association of Victims of the Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande Fire, tells of the immense sorrow that hangs over the region. "Most of the victims, they want to suffer their pain in solitude. They do not open their hearts so easy," she says. "They could not say goodbye to their dear ones. They do not understand how their children died, how their mother and father died. It's still very difficult to accept their loss." There were many contributory causes of the fire. The region's small farms and native forests of fire-resistant cork oaks and chestnut had been replaced with commercial plantations of eucalyptus and pine. Fast-growing eucalyptus does well in the climate and produces not only timber but oil, which increases its flammability. The plantations supply the international paper market, providing the raw material for everything from office paper to toilet roll. Duarte despairs of how the land is used, but the social and economic reasons behind it are complex. Small farmers cannot make a living in an agrifood industry dominated by multinationals. "In the past, everybody made terraces on the hills to plant the crops. It's hard work, fixing the terraces, catching the water, growing the crops. And very little money," she says. "So people sell the land and the big companies plant the eucalyptus and the pine." The lack of opportunities is the reason young people leave the region and families do not return to settle there. It is the reason Nodeirinho had only one child. Roadsides and power lines were meant to be kept clear of growth because of the fire risk, but this was neglected in Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande. Lack of a proper warning system meant vital information did not get shared. People did not know the fire was out of control, or the directions it was travelling, or the roads that were still clear enough to provide escape routes. Multiple prosecutions of local officeholders, state employees and power company representatives are working their way through the Portuguese justice system. But behind all this is a force more threatening than negligence and the quest for profits. "That summer was too much," says Duarte (51). "It was too dry. It was too hot. It really changed since I was a child. We have more heat, more heatwaves. "The days in summer were always hot but the evenings were cool. That summer, it was hot all the time." Fireman Rui Rosinha, who was severely injured while fighting the flames, would give evidence to the official inquiry that on the morning of the fire it was already uncomfortably hot at 6am. There was also a fierce wind, a summer oddity that Duarte recalls bent small trees in the morning. It spread flames at terrifying speed in the afternoon, Rosinha would testify. "The climate is changing, here and all over the world," she says. SHANNON FLOODS Along the banks of the Shannon where it straddles the border of Galway and Offaly, Michael Silke watches the water assiduously. It has been a particularly dry autumn, following a settled summer. Although the rain has returned in recent days, the river poses no threat. But he doesn't relax. When the rain comes more regularly, which it assuredly will as winter draws in, he will begin assessing the likelihood of flood, wondering which grazing land will be lost, which homes will be hit again and which new areas the water might reach this time. "There were always floods," says Silke, whose farm lies half in the Shannon Callows, the river's natural winter flood plain, and half on higher ground. "The biggest was in 1954 and people thought they'd never see the likes of it again. Then in 2009 we had what we thought was the mother of all floods. It was 2ft above the 1954 level. We were told this would never happen again in our lifetime." It was an event that would occur only once in 150 or 200 years, they were told. "Then in 2015/2016 we had an even greater flood again than 2009. It was 8in higher. And then again in February 2020, we had another one on a par with 1954." As in Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande, there are various factors at play. Silt has built up on the riverbed from 60 years of industrial peat extraction across the midlands. Towns and villages along the river have expanded, laying concrete and tar on ground that used to soak up high waters, creating overflows further along. Levels are artificially managed in places by locks, weirs and sluices. It is argued by some, Silke among them, that there has been mismanagement. But then there is also the strange weather, with its repeat summer floods and its sudden, intense downpours that send tributary waters torpedoing into the Shannon. "These events keep coming and coming and coming," says Silke. "They're happening on a much more regular basis than before." Communities such as Duarte's and Silke's all over the world could be affected by the outcome of the make-or-break UN climate summit beginning in Glasgow tomorrow. The Cop26 The precise cause of the Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande fire cannot be determined. Either an overheated power line ignited matchstick-dry vegetation or it was a lightning strike from a dry thunderstorm. Possibly both. Yet, says Dina Duarte, little has changed since, either in how the land is managed or in the protections in the event of another fire. "We still have the same fear, but worse because now we know the consequences, and because we know the changes that are happening in the environment and the climate of the world," she says. "That was a warning for everyone to change, not to think always of making profit. But nothing really has changed." The events of June 2017 are making their way to a court outside Portugal too. In September last year, six children and young people from Portugal, four of them from the region surrounding Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande, filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights against 33 countries, arguing they were failing in their obligation to fight climate change. The 33 defendants include all EU member states plus the UK, Russia, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. It is contended that their climate action measures have been ineffective and that the court must order them to do better. Their case is as much an indictment of the 25 Cops that have gone before as it is of individual countries' behaviour. The children are represented by Glan, the Global Legal Action Network, a legal charity based at the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway and also in London. Dr Gear\'f3id \'d3 Cuinn, its director, is analysing the defences from the 33 countries, Ireland among them, and preparing the detailed responses, to be filed by early January. The fact that the 33 are defending their efforts is disturbing to the young people whose everyday lives are affected by extreme heat, who have breathed in the smoke from the burning land around them and watched in terror as ash fell on their homes. When the smoke cleared on that day in June 2017, they learned that nine children were among the dead, aged from two to 15. "The fight against climate change is a fight against time," says 18-year-old Martim Agostinho, one of the six taking the case. 'STRESSED OUT' Fear is also ever-present along the Shannon. "There are properties that were relocated after they flooded in 1954 and they have flooded again in the last 10 years in their new sites," Silke says. Silke is chairman of the Save Our Shannon Organisation, which is campaigning for a single authority to oversee the management of the river, in place of the current multitude of agencies and local authorities with separate, linked, overlapping and conflicting roles. Like Duarte, he is frustrated at the lack of effective political action and planning. "I'm not sure it's even been discussed - what will happen if climate change makes things even worse here," he says. He does not believe that communities like his or voices like theirs would be heard at an event like Cop26 . Disconnects abound in discussions of climate change. The Cop26 It already happens, just not in a globally regulated way. If you want to offset the emissions from your Ryanair flight, the company will add a few euro to your fare and pay for carbon-cutting projects abroad. One of those projects is replanting forests burnt by wildfires in Portugal - wildfires that are intensifying because of climate change caused by activities such as flying. 'Adaptation' is also on the agenda. Nobody likes to talk about it because it means accepting that climate change is permanent and that our buildings, infrastructure, health systems, food production and lifestyles cannot remain the same. In 2017, the Government in effect implemented that policy here when it set up a homeowners relocation scheme with funding to permanently move people whose houses were severely damaged during the 2015/2016 floods. To qualify, there had to be a "significant probability" of similar repeat flooding and no feasible means of preventing it. Local authorities identified 174 properties they felt fell into this category. Just 11 households have moved so far. Others did not ultimately meet the criteria. Engineering solutions were devised but many did not engage with the scheme at all. Silke is not surprised. "It's not the solution," he says. "After 1954, people were moved from the flood plains and new houses and cattle sheds were built, and then in 2009 and 2016 they were flooded. Are we going to keep moving people further and further away?" The answer to that is: possibly. The Government is considering another relocation scheme, this time for farmyards and buildings. Silke isn't ready to give in yet and he says the current generation of young farmers are even more defiant. "They are far more proactive than the older generation. They won't facilitate politicians who sit around waiting for the next flood. They're more outspoken and they have to be, because this is their livelihood, it's their future." Dina Duarte is prepared to keep fighting too. But she says the story of what happened in Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande needs to be told to as large an audience as possible. "I tell what happened because we hope not to be forgotten," she says. "If we are forgotten, nothing will change." 'We were told at the time this would never happen again in our lifetime... Then in 2015/2016 we had an even greater flood again' \</doc>

Protecting forests, changing diets, and altering farming methods could contribute around a quarter of the greenhouse gas cuts needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations' climate panel. But the changes are unlikely to happen unless governments act to spur them along, the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released on Monday found. "We are in the early stages of climate and agriculture policy development, but we need to start with acknowledging the urgency of the challenge," said Ben Lilliston, director of rural strategies and climate change for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. "The IPCC warns that governments thus far have not been up to the task." About 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors in 2019, the report said, around half of which were from deforestation. Much of the rest came from the combustion of fossil fuels. Mitigation measures in those sectors - including protecting forests from clear-cutting, sequestering carbon in agricultural soils, and more sustainable diets - can provide as much as 20%-30% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that is the threshhold at which climate change risks spinning out of control. "Indigenous Peoples, private forest owners, local farmers and communities manage a significant share of global forests and agricultural land and play a central role in land-based mitigation options," the report said. While the changes required in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors - dubbed AFOLU by climate specialists - would not cost much to implement, there is little momentum so far to trigger them, the report said. A lack of institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term tradeoffs of how land is managed, and the dispersed nature of private land holdings have hindered implementation so far, it said. "Land provides us with so much, for example, food, nature, and our livelihoods," said Di\'e1na \'dcrge-Vorsatz, vice chair of the IPCC working group that authored the report. "These competing demands have to be carefully managed." One major obstacle is that dictating diet is divisive. The IPCC panel's initial report summary included a recommendation that consumers shift to plant-based diets and reduce their intake of meat, according to a draft seen by Reuters. But the final version of the summary included a recommendation instead for balanced diets that include sustainably produced animal products alongside plants like grains and legumes. Asked about the changes, Joanna House, an expert on land use at the University of Bristol and an author of the report, said she could not comment on why the changes were made but said the issue of dietary changes is complex. "If meat is produced sustainably, it can be low carbon and support soil carbon and nutrients," she said. "If produced unsustainably, particularly in intense systems requiring large amounts of animal feed that result in deforestation, it can cause large net emissions." Global demand for livestock products is growing, a headwind to cutting agriculture's emissions, the report said. The reaction to the report has been one of considerable concern. "We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report's release. "But current climate pledges would [still] mean a 14% increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfill even these inadequate promises." At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity. "It's now or never," IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said on the report - the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years. While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions - making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments. Some scientists described the process as "excruciating", and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday. Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording. "Different countries have different interests," IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx. "Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word." Upon the report's release, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans urged European policymakers to redouble efforts to end reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil. "The war in Ukraine has only increased our sense of urgency because now nobody can find an excuse, in my view, to not speed up the end of the overuse of fossil fuels," Timmermans told the European Parliament. "We cannot continue to import massive amounts of fossil fuels." Cutting demand While past IPCC reports on mitigating carbon emissions tended to focus on the promise of sustainable fuel alternatives, such as solar and wind power, the new report uniquely highlights a need to cut consumer demand. Without shrinking energy demand, the report notes, reducing emissions rapidly by the end of this decade to keep warming below 1.5C will be almost impossible. "Accepting a lower consumption lifestyle is almost the only fast-acting policy move we have left to prevent the disastrous impacts of climate change," said Daniel Quiggin, an environmental researcher at the UK policy institute Chatham House. This "demand-side mitigation", as the report puts it, places the onus on governments to pass policies that incentivize sustainable choices. One example would be investing in bike lanes and public transport while blocking cars from city centres to sway public choice. Such action may slow economic growth by a few percentage points in the short term, the report said, but those losses would be outweighed by economic benefits from preventing extreme climate change. A decade ago, demand reduction was "politically unpalatable," Quiggin said. "But now, with both the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis, we're seeing ... the beginning of political willingness. "When people truly appreciate the scale of a crisis and the problems it can create, they are willing to reduce consumption." The report lays out several paths for greenhouse gas emissions that could limit climate change or, alternatively, see it spiral out of control. Grouping 1,600 potential path ways within eight broad categories, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes how different government policies and industrial activities would influence the rise in global temperatures up to 2100. Only two categories of pathways - dubbed "C1" and "C2" in the report - could keep the world to its 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to within 1.5C of preindustrial temperatures. C1 pathways would mostly hold temperatures at that threshold, whereas C2 pathways envision a temporary overshoot up to about 1.7C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by century's end, a situation that could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs. The world would need to invest big in renewable energy and make dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in this decade, including a massive scale back in use of coal, oil and gas. But that alone wouldn't be enough. Some carbon dioxide (CO2) would also need to be removed from the atmosphere through increasing global forest cover as well as with nascent technologies such as direct air capture. \</doc>

There is a man in a Darth Vader costume greeting arrivals off the train to the COP26 venue with an array of posters and a karaoke kit. He is in the groove of a 1970s disco hit. "Love is good, love can be strong," he sings, urging passers-by to join in. "We gotta get right back to where we started from." Jamen Shively is co-founder and president of Radish, a collective of "solutionaries" committed to thinking their way to resolution of the world's biggest problems. Today's problem is global warming and Shively, a former Microsoft corporate strategy manager in the US, thinks he has the solution. It involves using ships to draw water from the ocean and shoot it high into the air where the liquid would evaporate, leaving the salt particles behind to bulk up and whiten clouds that would block the sun and aid cooling. Shively cannot claim the idea as his own - numerous scientists have proposed trials on the technique - but he says the politicians are not listening, so he is going to bring home the message with song and Star Wars. Outside the several rings of security gates, various protesters and activists gather each day, some alone and silent, a solitary banner explaining their cause; others are in organised groups, well versed in oratory and the art of grabbing attention. How much of an impression they can make on the delegates is doubtful. The VIPs are swept through side gates while the rest join a morning crush for entry, frantically phoning their morning appointments with updates on their progress through queues and security checks or sneakily performing an onthe-move last-minute daily Covid test that must be presented for clearance. Even the activists on the inside, those who are registered participants as official observers, fringe event organisers and guest speakers, are having trouble making their presence felt. Places in the meeting rooms and speaking halls are very limited - it is Covid, you know? Live-streaming links are hard to find and the quality fickle - it is a new IT platform, did you not hear? Outcomes of meetings are sporadically posted online either in enough technical detail to smother an inexperienced reader or with such sparsity of information it is hard to trust the content. A hard copy would be good, so observers could sit down and analyse the text together, but it is a virtually paperless campus - saving the forests, can you not understand? It is causing cynicism and frustration among observers who hear the organisers speak about commitment to transparency of process and then are told to stand aside, please, this session is suddenly closed. It has not helped that several times last week, participants received notifications by early afternoon telling them the venue was now crowded past Covid safe limits and, if possible, would they mind going home? Many from the global south have travelled thousands of miles on tiny budgets, fought hard to access vaccinations and are sleeping on borrowed floors. Yes, actually, they would mind going home. Yet progress is being made - or so it seems. So far, there has been a commitment by more than 100 countries to a global methane pledge that aims to cut emissions by 30pc by 2030. Methane is a much more potent global warming gas than carbon dioxide, but because it is less prevalent and dissipates much more quickly in the atmosphere it has escaped the more intense spotlight. Not any more. A rapid, dramatic reduction just might give the world some breathing space to get carbon output under control. Another pledge sees more than 100 nations commit to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, although Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro spoiled the party somewhat by stressing his commitment was to halting "illegal" deforestation. Yet another has some of the biggest banks, insurers and investment houses in the world commit to using their combined $130trn of investment finance to back renewable energy projects and other no-carbon infrastructure. A 12-year-old pledge to create a $100bn annual climate finance fund for poor countries is inching toward fulfilment, although it may be 2023 before the full sum is in place. And the 120 or so heads of state who kicked off the proceedings with a two-day world leaders' summit made some very nice speeches. There are more than optics involved here. The sentiment behind the speeches sets the scene for the most crucial negotiations, which take place this week. Countries will try to find ways to increase their national emissions cutting commitments to collectively keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees - beyond which we may well all be asking Shively to share his karaoke kit. Many have travelled far to get here so, yes, they do mind going home \</doc>

Act now to meet net-zero carbon targets, warns global agency The transition to cleaner energy is accelerating but remains far too slow if net-zero carbon targets are to be met by 2050. That is according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2021, in which it urged world leaders to use the upcoming COP26 event in Glasgow to commit to "an unmistakable signal of ambition and action from governments" on the climate crisis. Net-zero describes the balance between the number of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere compared to what is removed through decarbonisation processes. COP26 is a United Nations climate change conference in which countries from all over the world will discuss progress in relation to the climate crisis. "A new energy economy is emerging around the world as solar, wind, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies flourish. But as the pivotal moment of COP26 approaches, the IEA's new World Energy Outlook makes it clear that this clean energy progress is still far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net-zero," said the IEA. The agency warned that its analysis of the current picture "delivers stark warnings about the direction in which today's policy settings are taking the world", but also "clear-headed" steps needed to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C and avoid the worst effects of climate change. It said that even as solar and wind go from "strength to strength", global consumption of coal has still grown strongly in 2021, pushing carbon dioxide (CO[2]) emissions towards their second-largest annual increase in history. "At the moment, however, every data point showing the speed of change in energy can be countered by another showing the stubbornness of the status quo," said the IEA in its executive summary. "The rapid but uneven economic recovery from last year's Covid-induced recession is putting major strains on parts of today's energy system, sparking sharp price rises in natural gas, coal and electricity markets." Public spending on sustainable energy in economic recovery packages has only mobilised around one-third of the investment required to jolt the energy system, it warned, with the largest shortfall in developing economies as they battle the current health crisis. The current global picture is a long way off the "narrow but achievable roadmap to a 1.5\'b0C stabilisation in rising global temperatures", it said. Pressures on the energy system are not going to relent in the coming decades, said the report. "The energy sector is responsible for almost three-quarters of the emissions that have already pushed global average temperatures 1.1\'b0C higher since the pre-industrial age, with visible impacts on weather and climate extremes. The energy sector has to be at the heart of the solution to climate change." Rising incomes are pushing up demand for energy services, and today's energy system is not capable of meeting these challenges, the analysis found. "A low emissions revolution is long overdue," it said. Despite the narrow path to a 1.5\'b0C stabilisation, much of the solutions are cost-effective, said the IEA. \</doc>

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain with posters disintegrating and banners battling the wind, 100,000 people marched to tell COP26 leaders their actions on climate were not good enough. Indoors, dry but not necessarily comfortable, the COP president tiptoed towards managing expectations. It was the second day of large-scale demonstrations in Glasgow, where the critical UN climate talks are about to enter their second week. School strikers led a crowd of 25,000 supporters through the streets last Friday, accompanied and addressed by their hero, Greta Thunberg. On Saturday, that number soared in a colourful procession of pageantry and protest replicated in about 200 cities around the world. Meanwhile, talks were continuing at the COP26 venue and the daily press conference brought a mix of hope, caution and diplomatic wording. COP26 Mr Sharma chose his words judiciously. "I completely understand and recognise the frustration and anger that I have seen and heard from young people," he said. "I think it is right that they make the point that, as countries', as parties' and as world leaders' commitments are made, what they want to see is delivery and this is the COP where we need to see delivery. "There were promises made in Paris so, if Paris promises, Glasgow must deliver." Next question. Well, the next question is, will it deliver? Pauline Sharp and Ailsa Short were adamant it must. They travelled from Dundee to tell the international delegates to get cracking. "It's not about us - we're not going to be around to see the damage that's going to be done," said Pauline. Ailsa, who has a granddaughter aged two and a half, felt the same. Back inside, Mr Sharma was counting the years too. "I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task ahead of us," he said when asked to predict how this coming week would go. "We have been discussing a whole range of these issues for six years without resolution. I think that shows just how challenging this is." More excuses, said Mary, from Bristol, part of a group dressed in homemade Ghostbusters costumes going around the streets 'greenwash-busting'. "Greenwashing is being done by the government, by the banks, the big oil companies, other fossil fuel companies and just general big business," she said. "They don't want to change so we're going to have to force them to. What they're doing is saying it will take a long time to change - it's a discourse of climate denial. We have to say it's not good enough." As the press conference continued, Mr Sharma turned to his lead negotiator, Archie Young, to help give a sense of how the talks were going. "It's tense right now," he said. Back at the march, four-yearold Saad Boutrid was the perfect tension-breaker as officers lined barricades to channel the already heavily policed procession through a junction. "Horseeee, horseeee," he squealed in delight at spotting the mounted unit. "He is here thinking about his future," joked his dad, Mouadh Boutrid. But Mr Boutrid, a meteorologist from Algeria now living in Glasgow, was thinking about his little boy's future. "All governments should do more. We are destroying ourselves by our own hands. We must be responsible for our kids' futures," he said. "He has a long life ahead and I am worried for him." "Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed." On that at least, protesters and politicians are of the same mind. \</doc>

But the mood around Cop26 is increasingly downbeat and a little anxious so that even Boris Johnson abandoned his standard boosterism this week to voice a note of caution. " Cop26 is both unbelievably important for our planet but also very difficult. It is in the balance," he told MPs. Queen Elizabeth has pulled out of opening the summit because of ill health, joining China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Pope Francis among the no-shows. Within the British government, rivals are whispering against the summit's president, Alok Sharma, blaming the former business secretary's low-key style for failing to extract more climate change commitments from other governments. Even the summit's mascot, Bonnie the Seal, is under attack, with the Daily Telegraph quoting a government official as saying it looked more like a rat than a seal. Some in Glasgow think a rat would be an appropriate mascot for their city, which saw its rodent population grow alarmingly during the coronavirus lockdowns. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken this week played down the scale of the problem, along with reports that council workers had been hospitalised after being bitten by rats. "There was I think one, possibly two, small incidents where an employee... where there was a health and safety incident and they were taken as a precaution to hospital for a very minor contact with a rat," she said. "It's not something that is unique to Glasgow. It is something that is happening right across the UK. All cities have rats." All these controversies will be forgotten if Johnson can persuade his fellow leaders to make binding commitments to take the steps necessary to reach the goals they agreed on in Paris in 2015. Chief among these was to limit global warming to between 1.5C and 2C by the middle of this century. Success depends on all countries reaching net-zero emissions - ensuring that the amount of greenhouse gases produced is no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere - as soon as possible. Each country has to produce its own national plan to reach the target and Johnson hopes that the ambition of Britain's strategy will give him the credibility to persuade others to take similar steps. Published last week, the 368-page plan is among the most ambitious and detailed of any major industrialised country, setting out how Britain will reach net-zero by 2050. "The UK is among the most ambitious countries in the world in terms of its net-zero by 2050 target. And it's a legally binding goal, which is not the case for the majority of countries with net-zero goals. There are some countries, such as Germany which has a 2045 target that is slightly more ambitious, and some smaller Nordics have got even earlier goals. But in terms of major economies, the UK's right up there," says Simon Evans, policy editor of Carbon Brief (carbonbrief.org), a British website covering climate science and policy. Serious ambition "This net-zero strategy means the UK now has a quite serious set of ambitions, phasing out combustion cars by 2030, sales of new ones, an ambition to end the sale of gas boilers by 2035, and an ambition for the electricity system to be fully decarbonis ed also by 2035. "Those are serious ambitions. We shouldn't pretend otherwise. As to whether there are credible policies to get us there, I think there are definitely gaps and some of the proposals aren't yet fully fleshed out." Heat pumps work like a reverse air conditioner, absorbing heat from the air outside into a liquid refrigerant which is then compressed to increase the temperature and condensed to release heat for radiators and hot water tanks. They cost about \£310,000 each and the government will offer \£35,000 to households who switch from gas boilers. Britain has dramatically cut its dependence on fossil fuels for electricity in recent decades and the net-zero plan says that all electricity should come from low-carbon sources. Apart from investing in offshore wind, Britain will explore new nuclear power options. Planting more trees will help to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere but Britain is also banking on carbon capture and storage to offset emissions. This involves separating and capturing carbon dioxide from other gases before it enters the atmosphere and converting it into liquid to be transported and pumped deep underground for permanent storage. The net-zero strategy includes five-yearly targets and an independent Climate Change Commission monitors the government's progress. But Tom Sasse, associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, warns that delivering policies involving huge numbers of actors across different departments will be very difficult. "Essentially, you need a kind of powerful mechanism in government to bring together lots of different policies in different sectors and make sure they line up and make sure they stay on track and, if they're not on track, to work out what the delivery issues are and unblock those. And we've seen previous examples in the Olympics, for example, where we had central units, an Olympics delivery agency, and so on for doing that within government," he says. "It's very reliant on the prime minister's particular whims. Last week was a week where he was very interested in it. There are lots of weeks where he's not. He's committed to it, which does matter. "I think what also matters from a delivery perspective is having a prime minister rather like Tony Blair with his hospital and education targets and so on, who would sit there with his delivery unit, who would haul the department in week after week after week and say, 'Why are you missing X target and what are you going to do about it?' - actually get into the detail of the policy. I think that's what we haven't got on net-zero." Sasse says the plan is very optimistic about the capacity of technology, warning that if things go wrong, the government could be tempted to pile more emissions into its carbon capture assumptions. Boosterism He believes one key question is the extent to which the government is transparent about the progress it is making, noting that the plan does not specify exactly what emissions reduction each policy is expected to deliver. Alongside the net-zero strategy, the treasury published a paper warning that the changes needed to reach the target could not be funded by borrowing. Sasse says that the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, may have political reasons to distance himself from Johnson's climate-change agenda but he believes the treasury is offering a useful corrective to the prime minister's relentless optimism. "There are clearly lots of people, on the Conservative back benches particularly, whose big concern is the cost. And the cost has almost become a kind of socially acceptable way of expressing climate scepticism. But actually if you dig into the treasury document, it is much more interesting than that," he says.\~ "It does pour a little bit of cold water on some of the kind of Johnson boosterism, as it were. The prime minister wants to say this is all just a good news story - more innovation, more jobs, richer, cleaner, etcetera. "And the treasury wants to say, some of these are quite difficult changes. They're going to cost money upfront. They will deliver benefits but there'll also be costs. Some of those costs are going to hit some people more heavily. "And they'll also make useful points, like actually if we decide to make investments in low-carbon infrastructure, it means we can't make investments in other things that we might have wanted to. That's a very treasury type of point to make, but it's absolutely true." \</doc>

Australia's prime minister has withdrawn a threat to skip next month's landmark UN climate summit, describing the meeting as "an important event". "I confirmed my attendance at the Glasgow Summit, which I'm looking forward to attending," Scott Morrison told journalists. Britain, which hosts the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow on 31 October - 12 November, is seeking to get big power support for a more radical plan to tackle climate change. Under mounting pressure to adopt more ambitious climate targets, the conservative leader had suggested he would not join other heads of government in Scotland's largest city. His comments angered climate activists and were seen as a direct diplomatic snub to the UK, a close ally and the summit host. In a rare foray into politics, Britain's Prince Charles expressed surprise at Mr Morrison's reluctance and said it would be a "disaster" if leaders did not take firm action to arrest climate change. Widely seen as a climate laggard, Australia is one of the world's largest coal and gas exporters and has long resisted adopting a carbon-neutral target. While Mr Morrison has inched toward setting a target date of 2050 for that goal, he has refused to make the target binding and has yet to commit to more meaningful 2030 emissions reduction targets. The 12-day meeting in Scotland will be the biggest climate conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015 and is seen as a crucial step in setting worldwide emissions targets to slow global warming. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to snub the conference in Scotland, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told. "It is now pretty clear that Xi is not going to turn up and the PM has been told that," according to a report in The Times quoting an unidentified British source. "What we don't know is what stance the Chinese are going to take," the source said. The Times said British organisers fear that Mr Xi's decision to stay away could be a prelude to China refusing to set new climate change goals amid an energy crunch.

The queen, who is due to attend the conference said she still did not know who was coming. "Extraordinary isn't it. I\' ve been hearing all about Cop," the 95-year-old monarch told Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of her son, Charles, Prince of Wales and the presiding officer of the Welsh assembly. "Still don\' t know who is coming..." "We only know about people who are not coming... It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do," Elizabeth said in a conversation picked up by a microphone. \</doc>

Proposed 2028 target not achievable, councillors told Cork City Council does not have the money to fund an ambitious proposal to plant 1m trees citywide by 2028, councillors have been told. However, a draft estimate has been set aside in the city's parks budget to plant around 2,000 trees this year - a significant increase on the planting rate of recent years when just a few hundred trees were being planted annually. Officials have also said the draft new city development plan will feature significant tree planting and "greening" projects, which will see more trees planted not just in city parks and green spaces, but also in suitable urban locations. The news came following the most recent meeting of the city council where a motion was proposed calling on the council to set an ambitious target to plant 1m trees by 2028. The motion was tabled by councillors Lorna Bogue, John Sheehan, Oliver Moran, Colette Finn, and Dan Boyle. They said the 1m trees target for Cork was inspired by Glasgow's plan to plant 18m trees over the next decade arising out of its hosting of the Cop26 climate conference. The number of trees being planted in Glasgow is equivalent to 10 trees per resident. The urban forest, to be known as the Clyde Climate Forest, will be planted in and around Glasgow over the next decade to create a series of interconnected woodlands and will be part of the city region's commitment to reaching net zero. It will increase woodland cover in the area from 17% to 20%. The motion tabled by the five Cork City councillors said setting such an ambitious target here would signal the city's commitment to climate action. However, in a written response to the motion tabled last year and before council last week, David Joyce, director of services in the council's roads and environment operations directorate, said a 1m tree planting target by 2028 would mean the planting of 125,000 trees every year from 2021 to 2028. "Planting 1m trees over a period of eight years has major resource implications in terms of land availability, cost of trees, preparation and planting and maintenance of the street trees and woodlands into the future," said Mr Joyce. "The preparation of a 'tree strategy' for the city is currently under way, and it is hoped to have a draft ready at the end of quarter one, 2022 for consideration by members. The draft strategy will explore various options for street tree, parkland and woodland planting and the requirements in terms of suitable land, financial resources, and timescale to implement." Mr Joyce said that there is provision in the 2022 parks draft estimates to plant around 2,000 trees this year. \</doc>

As 20,000 descend on Glasgow next week for the UN climate change conference, Cop26 , the lives of millions of people in some of the world's poorest countries will hang in the balance. These lives are dependent on the decisions made over the coming fortnight and whether or not they are subsequently delivered. For millions of people in the world's poorest countries, climate change is dramatically impacting their lives today and threatening their very existence. Two million Kenyans are currently experiencing the latest in a series of increasingly frequent droughts. Approximately 500,000 Bangladeshis are annually forced by rising sea levels and flooding to leave their homes in low-lying coastal areas to move inland into overcrowded cities. The impact of climate change is very real and immediate today. The climate crisis is a key driver of world hunger. Climate models project higher average temperatures in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in the majority of inhabited regions, and heavy precipitation and ever-greater probability of drought in some areas. The implications of these projections are much greater in South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara - regions currently with high concentrations of poverty and hunger- where agriculture is highly dependent on rainfall and susceptible to even small changes in temperature. Large populations (up to 80% of rural households in some countries) depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The 2021 Global Hunger Index, published earlier this month, shows that hunger levels are significantly higher in countries that are most sensitive to rainfall and temperature extremes characteristic of climate change. Unless urgent action is taken to help mitigate the impact of these changes and help communities adapt, the crisis will only get worse. A recent analysis showed that climate change could see the number of chronically hungry people increase by 78m by 2050 unless action is taken. There is an urgent need for proper investment in climate mitigation and climate adaptation measures and funding to address the losses and damages from climate impacts already being felt today. All eyes will be on global leaders at Cop26 to see if they deliver on the key issue of climate finance and then subsequently deliver on commitments made. Delivery will be key. In 2009, high-income countries made a commitment to allocate $ 100bn annually by 2020 to help developing countries address the impacts of climate change. However, this commitment has never been met. An analysis by the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance in 2020 found that, not only was there insufficient investment provided to enable lower-income countries prepare for the impacts of climate change, but funding that was provided was not going to the countries and people that need it most. The longer that adaptation and risk-reduction efforts are put off by chronic underfunding, the more difficult and expensive it will be to manage adaptation and the harder it will be to save lives and mitigate suffering. Inequality is at the heart of this issue. Many of the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis are currently paying the highest price. They also do not have the financial resources to address the issue and protect their populations. Their needs and the issue of climate justice must be top of the priority list of global leaders.

TAOISEACH Miche\'e1l Martin has said countries in the developed world have £n obligation' to support the nations worst affected by climate change. Speaking at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Mr Martin announced that Ireland will more than double its contribution to climate finance for developing countries from around (EURO)93 million to (EURO)225 million by 2025. Ireland aims to reduce emissions by 2030 to 51% below 2018 levels and reach climate neutrality by 2050. The Taoiseach said that young people must not be left to worry that there 'will be no worthwhile future for them to inherit'. He said: 'If we act decisively now, we will offer humanity the most valuable prize of all, a liveable planet. 'We can achieve a cooler world. A biodiverse world. A world with healthier air for us to breathe, healthier soil for things to grow in. 'A world in which people can live more sustainable lives, handing a healing and enriched planet to future generations.' He added: 'Those of us in the developed world - those who have, frankly, contributed most to the problems that confront us all - have an obligation to support those who are most acutely challenged by their consequences. Ireland accepts that obligation.' He said Ireland did not 'believe or accept' that the transition to climate neutrality has come too late, would be too costly or that someone else should 'shoulder the load'. 'Our young people worry that there will be no worthwhile future for them to inherit,' he added. 'Workers worry that their jobs will disappear, leaving them without a livelihood. 'Consumers, already feeling the impact of energy price rises, feel that the transition will be too costly for them to bear. 'In response, I say I will do everything in my power, working with all of the leaders here today, to make sure that it is not so.' Earlier, Mr Martin said Ireland has no choice but to respond to the threat of climate change as he hit back at 'scaremongering'. The Taoiseach offered a stark warning to critics of his Government's policy on climate change. 'We have no choice here. Climate change will catch up with us. It will catch up with our farming, with our agriculture, if we don't take action,' he said. \</doc>

IRISH delegates have joined global representatives at the Cop26 summit in Scotland, where attendees must  thrash out a plan to tackle the climate crisis once and for all , SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has warned. The Foyle MP is among Irish politicians attending the UN\' s global conference on the threat of climate change, and he described the summit, attended by world leaders including US president Joe Biden, as a  pivotal moment . Mr Eastwood is bringing forward a Climate Change and Green Jobs Bill at Westminster which he hopes will  force the British government to declare a climate emergency along with establishing a date to achieve net zero carbon emissions.  This is no time for tinkering around the edges of the Paris Agreement, Mr Eastwood said.  We need to get more than lip service from COP26 , we need firm commitments from those with the power to enact change that they are ready to do what\' s necessary to protect our environment.  People need to get their heads out of the sand \- the evidence of the worsening climate crisis is right before our eyes.  We have seen temperatures rise and climate events across the world, including in our own backyard.  Nowhere is exempt from the effects of the climate crisis. Meanwhile, Sinn F\'e9in deputy first minister Michelle O\' Neill attended the summit with party colleagues including North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan, who made the journey to Glasgow by bicycle in order to raise awareness of the need to reduce carbon emissions.  Sinn F\'e9in will launch a document on green energy and tackling the climate emergency, Ms O\' Neill said.  Just like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change does not recognise borders and we need an all-Ireland approach.  We must secure a fair transition to a low carbon economy, and provide increased support for rural communities. She added:  Climate action and social justice must go together to make people\' s lives better and more secure, that\' s what we\' re committed to delivering. The Republic\' s environment minister Eamon Ryan said ahead of yesterday\' s summit schedule that the event was an opportunity to  strengthen the Paris Agreement on climate signed in 2015. \</doc>

The world is on track for "climate catastrophe", the UN warned, as it published a report showing countries' plans to cut emissions still fall far short of curbing dangerous warming. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said even with new and updated plans and pledges from countries for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade, the world faces global warming of 2.7 degrees by 2100. But reductions of 55 per cent are needed to meet the goal to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees - beyond which more severe impacts of climate change will be felt, from extreme weather to rising seas. Some 49 countries and the EU have pledged long-term targets to cut emissions to net zero, which could bring temperature rises down to 2.2 degrees, but only if they are fully implemented, with action in the next decade, it said. Emissions And the report showed that just a fifth of the recovery investment to help reboot economies after the pandemic had gone to supporting green measures - missing an opportunity to drive action to slash emissions. Launching the report before world leaders head to Glasgow for crucial Cop26 climate talks, UNEP's executive director Inger Andersen warned: "The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. "Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem," she said. And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that less than a week before the talks, "we are still on track for climate catastrophe", warning there was a gap in leadership on tackling the crisis. It is the latest warning over the climate crisis, as emissions of the gases that drive global warming are set to bounce back after the pandemic, and reached record concentrations in the atmosphere in 2020. Countries at Cop26 are under pressure to deliver on promises made in the global Paris Agreement to hold global temperature rises to "well below" 2 degrees and to try to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But the national plans countries previously put forward for the Paris deal left the world well off-track for the 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees limits, so they have had to submit new or updated plans for action up to 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs,) by Cop26 . It finds the impact of the new and updated plans will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by just 2.9 billion tonnes in 2030 compared to the old NDCs, while including pledges announced by China, Japan and South Korea will reduce emissions by four billion tonnes. Pollution Emissions need to be reduced by another 28 billion tonnes in 2030 to keep the world on a path to keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees - equivalent to nearly halving current levels of pollution of just under 60 billion tonnes a year - on top of cuts already planned, the report said. To limit temperature rises to 2 degrees, emissions must be cut by an additional 13 billion tonnes in 2030. The analysis also found that just under half of the new and updated plans submitted by countries will lead to lower 2030 emissions than their previous NDCs, while nearly a fifth (18 per cent) will lead to the same or higher levels of emissions. Tackling methane emissions using low-cost or money-saving technology, for example capturing methane released in fossil fuel extraction, could reduce emissions of the gas by around 20 per cent a year, helping curb warming in the near term. - PA \</doc>

THE Catholic Primate of All Ireland has suggested that the Church could have done more to bring healing and peace to communities divided by the partition of this island. In his New Year message, Archbishop Eamon Martin expressed sadness and loss at the division of Ireland, and said churches should have helped people from different backgrounds to understand each other better. Reflecting on October's multi-faith Service of Reflection and Hope, which marked the centenary of the partition of Ireland, he said it was young people who would help overcome the mistrust and divisions of the past. 'As we begin a new year, conversations are already taking place about what constitutional change and greater sharing on this island might look like,' Archbishop Martin said. 'Intergenerational dialogue has much to offer these conversations - balancing reflection on the past with hope for the future. Clearly, the issues of legacy and the reality of trauma experienced by many families here must be included and handled sensitively in these conversations.' He continued: 'Victims have spoken about the importance of continued access to justice, together with meaningful opportunities for truth and information HYPERLINK http://www.recovery.No www.recovery.No line can easily be drawn on our past and there is clearly much work to be done in exploring and building a unity of hearts and minds towards a shared vision for our future in this island.' Archbishop Martin said dialogue between the generations about the global climate crisis was also needed. He said young people who spoke at the COP26 conference in Glasgow had been committed to the mutual respect between faith and science, while remaining determined to call out needless waste, ruthless exploitation and destruction of the planet's resources. Referencing Pope Francis's writings on related issues, Archbishop Martin added: 'After all, they argue, the world not only belongs to us but to the generations who will follow us. In this case, therefore, intergenerational solidarity is not just an option, "but rather a basic question of justice".' \</doc>

China has submitted a new national plan for climate action to the UN ahead of key Cop26 talks which does not increase its existing targets. Countries have been under pressure to make greater strides to cut emissions in the next decade to meet globally-agreed targets to curb dangerous climate change. A lack of increased ambition from the world's biggest polluter could undermine efforts to drive momentum at the two-week conference in Glasgow, which kicks off on Sunday. The world is currently well off track to deliver the kind of cuts to greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other sources that are needed to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt. Earlier this week, the UN warned that the latest national action plans submitted by countries under the global climate treaty the Paris Agreement for action up to 2030, along with pledges from key countries including China, put the world on track for a "catastrophic" 2.7 degrees of warming. AdvertisementChina has now submitted its national plan, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris accord - but has not included new targets beyond those already announced, with the goals labelled as\~"disappointing". It aims to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 and peak emissions before 2030, and lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 per cent from the 2005 level. And it plans to increase the non-fossil fuel share of energy consumption to 25 per cent, increase forests and bring its installed capacity of wind and solar to more than 1,200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. The targets are more ambitious than those it outlined six years ago before the Paris Agreement was secured, but do not increase its ambition from announcements made by the country in the past year. Bernice Lee, from international affairs think tank Chatham House, said: "We can't sugarcoat it: Beijing's new climate plan is disappointing and well off where the world's biggest emitter needs to be. "China has low-balled its target and missed a chance to be recognised as a global leader. "The plan says emissions will peak before 2030 - for all our sakes we need that date to be far sooner." She added: "But we also need to recognise this is a symptom of a wider malaise where big economies are announcing plans and failing on finance promises, but manifestly failing to deliver the level of emissions cuts we need to avoid brutal climate impacts." AdvertisementLi Shuo, policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said the decision "casts a shadow on the global climate effort". "In light of the domestic economic uncertainties, the country appears hesitant to embrace stronger near term targets and missed an opportunity to demonstrate ambition. "The planet can't afford this being the last word," he said, and warned Beijing needed to come up with stronger implementation plans to ensure emissions peaked before 2025. He added China's choice not to further increase its ambition epitomised the lack of determination among some of the major economies to step up climate action - as well as the country's mistrust of the US and whether it would be able to fulfil its carbon reduction and climate finance targets. "There's real fear that Washington's empty words will intensify an already unfair global climate order." Nick Mabey, chief executive and co-founder of E3G climate think tank, said it was "very disappointing that despite massive fall in clean technology costs and increased climate impacts that China won't clearly commit to decrease its carbon pollution over the next decade". He said it was hopefully not the last word from the Chinese and that President Xi would say more on coal and peaking emissions going into Cop26 . And he warned that as it stands, China's plans for 2030 were not consistent with its pledge to reduce emissions to net zero by 2060. \</doc>

For the next two weeks, Glasgow's sprawling Scottish Event Campus on the north bank of the Clyde will be neither British nor Scottish but United Nations territory. The Blue Zone of Cop26 has become a diplomatic enclave patrolled by UN personnel as representatives from almost every nation on Earth try to agree the necessary steps to avoid climate catastrophe. On the other side of the river is the Green Zone, where the activists who have pushed climate change into the centre of the global debate have a parallel programme of events to keep up the pressure on the negotiators. But many delegates, activists and journalists were struggling to get to Glasgow yesterday as storms disrupted rail services from London, prompting some to travel by car or plane instead. Britain's president of Cop26 , Alok Sharma, sounded downbeat yesterday morning ahead of the official opening, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr that it would be "very, very tough" to agree action to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees, before identifying the guilty parties in the event of failure. Commitment "This is on leaders. It's leaders who made the commitment, it's leaders of the biggest economies meeting now at the G20, and they need to come forward and collectively we need to agree how we're going to address this gap," he said. This was supposed to be a showcase for Boris Johnson's vision of "Global Britain" as a convening power but, like the G7 in Cornwall in June, it has been overshadowed by friction with France. Last time, the drama surrounded Emmanuel Macron's remarks about the Northern Ireland protocol which Johnson distorted to claim he was questioning the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom. This time the row is over licences for a few dozen French boats to fish off Jersey and Guernsey, which Britain has been refusing to grant on the grounds of insufficient evidence of a history of fishing in those waters. Downing Street's threats might be more credible were it not for the fact that the only action more disruptive to the British economy than France hitting British exports would be Britain hitting European imports. London and Paris disputed one another's accounts of a meeting between Macron and Johnson yesterday, leaving enough ambiguity for a compromise just in time. \</doc>

PRESIDENT Joe Biden announced more than $500billion ((EURO)428billion) in climate change spending last night as he vowed to cut the US's greenhouse gases by half. The deal, which has not yet been agreed, was designed to put the US in the lead in the fight against climate change ahead of Cop26 Glasgow summit. In a press conference yesterday, President Biden said his spending bill was the 'most significant investment ever' on climate and is 'beyond any other advanced nation in the world'. He vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, equivalent to a billion metric tonnes of emission reductions. He had hoped to set an example to other countries but haggling in Congress over the legislation meant the deal still hasn't been agreed. His plans include hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in clean energy, more solar panels and replacing diesel school buses with electric ones. However, some aspects - such as a programme that would reward electricity companies for investing in renewables and penalise those that did not - have been cut from the legislation. While the bill is likely to pass, the delay will come as a disappointment to the president as he tries to reposition the US as a leading figure in the battle against climate change. His predecessor Donald Trump withdrew the world's largest economy from the Paris accord to limit global warming - a move reversed by President Biden. Yesterday, it emerged the president of the world's largest emitter - China's Xi Jinping - will not be attending the COP26 conference, starting this Sunday. China submitted a new national plan for climate action to the UN yesterday ahead of the summit - but it failed to increase its existing targets. The world is currently far from agreeing desperately needed cuts to greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other sources. This agreement is needed to limit temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt. Earlier this week, the UN warned that the latest national action plans submitted by countries for action up to 2030 put the world on track for a 'catastrophic' 2.7C of warming. China has now submitted its national plan, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), although it has not included new targets beyond those already announced. \</doc>

AG Barr expects annual profit to exceed pre-pandemic levels and beat current market expectations, with "on the go" and hospitality sectors remaining particularly strong, the Scotland-based soft drinks maker said. The company, best known for fizzy drink Irn-Bru, forecast both annual revenue and pretax profit ahead of current market expectations, despite ongoing near-term operating cost pressures. Irn-Bru was in the spotlight earlier this month when Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon handed US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a can of the orange fizzy beverage at COP26 in Glasgow. Ocasio-Cortez gave the cherished Scottish drink a thumbs-up. AG Barr expects full-year revenue of about \£3264m and profit before tax of around \£341m for the 12 months ending January 2022, compared with \£326m last year. The company, which has seen a revival in demand since Covid-19 curbs were relaxed earlier in the year, said the fast-moving pandemic situation remains a risk but it still expects its revenue momentum to continue into 2022. The emergence of a new variant of coronavirus late last week has raised questions of increased curbs ahead of Christmas, with Britain announcing some new measures to try and slow the spread. \</doc>

The rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said. He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week's summit. "It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone," he told a press conference in Glasgow. "I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition." Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26 , which is due to end by 6pm today but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a "very bad signal" if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit's final statement . "It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. "Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure," he said. \</doc>

IRELAND has joined an alliance of countries that has pledged to phase out the production of oil and gas to tackle climate change at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Denmark, Costa Rica, France, Wales, Sweden, Greenland and the Canadian province of Quebec are also core members of the alliance, which has committed to end new licensing for oil and gas exploration and set an end date for their exploration, with globally agreed goals to limit dangerous warming. Commenting on the significant move yesterday, Climate Minister Eamon Ryan said: 'Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.' Mr Ryan added: 'Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences.' In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, Ireland is £lso legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale', the minister also confirmed. Meanwhile, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has hailed a pact made by the US and China at the COP26 climate summit. The two superpowers, who are the world's biggest emitters of CO2, pledged to act in a joint declaration made in a surprise announcement in Glasgow on Wednesday. Both nations agreed to 'recall their firm commitment to work together' and to close the 'significant gap' to achieving the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Yesterday, Mr Martin praised US president Joe Biden for bringing America back from the point of being in 'climate denial' under the Trump administration. He said: 'The most important thing that happened in the last year and a bit has been the election of Joe Biden as president of the US in respect of climate change. 'That's my view because prior to that we were facing a fairly depressing scenario where you had an administration that was almost in climate denial. 'Why is that important? You can see already leading into COP26 that the European Union, which is a leader in terms of climate change, is now partnering with the US and the Biden administration with John Kerry as a special envoy, and driving the global agenda. 'Now this morning, we hear about a very good partnership announcement between the US and China.' Mr Martin also said that 'John Kerry's saying he's had 30 meetings with his counterpart in China'. The Taoiseach continued: 'They're reaching agreement. The Chinese envoy on climate is now saying this is an existential crisis, we're partnering with the world and with the US to deal with this. This is progress.' Mr Martin also said Ireland has much to do on the climate change front. 'Speed is everything here and we in this country are behind,' he told Dermot and Dave on Today FM. 'We need to move, because it's about the generations, it's about my children, the children coming after me. That's what this is about.' The Taoiseach said it was important not to 'vilify' certain sectors on the issue, but instead work together to find solutions. He referenced a meeting with 15-year-old climate activist and farmer Liadh Dalton, from Belmont, Co. Offaly, who spent a day working in the Taoiseach's office this week as part of a Unicef programme. Mr Martin said: 'Her main concern, she's a young farmer from Offaly, is very committed to climate change, but feels that we're not building bridges between communities. That rather than vilifying, say, the agricultural community, we should be engaging and building bridges with the agricultural community; working out projects through research as to what will help them reduce methane, get better practices, technologies. And it was very interesting.' Mr Martin also said that he thought 'it was a good insight for me'. He added: 'Here's a young person whose future is at stake, who loves the land, is on the land for generations and wants to be a part of the solution. 'That has to be the spirit that informs how we approach this into the future.' HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ie news@dailymail.ie 'It was a good insight for me' \</doc>

BORIS Johnson has said the success or failure of the Cop26 summit is a "question of will". The Prime Minister claimed the world could "take heart" from what had been achieved in Glasgow so far but also warned that the planet's future "still hangs in the balance". Speaking in the Commons following two days at the summit, he said unless words were turned into action, "every summit going back to Rio de Janeiro in 1992 will have failed because we will have allowed our shared aim of 1.5C to escape our grasp". "The negotiations have almost two weeks to run, but we can take heart from what has been achieved so far," he added. "The UK has asked the world for action on coal, cars, cash and trees. We have begun to make progress - substantial, palpable progress - on three out of the four, but the negotiations in Glasgow have a long way to go. Far more must be done. "Whether we can summon the collective wisdom and will to save ourselves from an avoidable disaster still hangs in the balance. We will press on with the hard work until the last hour. "In the end, it is a question of will. We have the technologies to do what it is necessary. All that remains in question is our resolve." The DUP's Sammy Wilson questioned the Prime Minister's net-zero strategy, asking: "Does he really believe that, given the huge natural forces which have changed the world climate continually, somehow, by reducing CO2, we can turn the world's thermostat up and down at will?" The Prime Minister noted Mr Wilson's " big objection... to the science", adding: "He is obviously a completely climate sceptic." Mr Wilson replied: "I'm not, I'm not." Meanwhile, fashion designer Stella McCartney gave Prince Charles and Leonardo DiCaprio a glimpse of her environmentally friendly pieces at the summit. The Oscar winner chatted with the prince after McCartney showed them her innovative sustainable garments and accessories in a display described as the "future of fashion". DiCaprio's appearance at Cop26 caused excitement around the conference. After rumours surfaced that he may make an appearance, he was finally spotted yesterday. In the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery, a masked DiCaprio looked at McCartney's luxury handbags, made from vegan, labgrown mushroom leather, and futuristic vegan football boots, created in collaboration with Adidas and Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba. The actor left the hall where the exhibition was staged before Charles arrived. After the prince viewed the items, he was introduced to the film star in a quiet area of the gallery, with the celebrity quickly pulling off his face mask as he greeted the royal. The actor was a guest of Mc- Cartney's, and the trio spoke together for around 10 minutes before Charles left and the designer joined a live discussion with industry experts about stopping the use of animal leather and fur. Later, hundreds of climate activists marched through Glasgow as part of an Extinction Rebellion demonstration staged for the summit. Police Scotland said two people were arrested after a number of officers were sprayed with paint. Cans of spray paint were also seized. The marchers set off from the city's Buchanan Street steps just after midday before being held at a police cordon on Sauchiehall Street. Among yesterday's protesters was the famous teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joked she would hit a personal net-zero target by balancing out her swearing. She made the pledge on Twitter after being filmed hyping up crowds in a protest outside the Cop26 venue. She told the demonstrators: "No more blah, blah, HYPERLINK www.blah.No more whatever the f they are doing inside there." She was also filmed singing: "You can shove your climate crisis up your a." She later tweeted: "I am pleased to announce that I've decided to go net zero on swear words and bad language. "In the event that I should say something inappropriate, I pledge to compensate that by saying something nice." \</doc>

Apparently the Taoiseach went overboard on the haggis in Glasgow. "The biggest issue facing us is wind," he warned solemnly. But the chamber doors are kept open these days for ventilation purposes, so no harm done. Miche\'e1l Martin was back for Leaders' Questions after his big trip to Scotland, where he hobnobbed with world leaders and global billionaires. After one of the Cop26 sessions Joe Biden, no less, came looking for a chinwag. "He called me over," confided Miche\'e1l yesterday and "reiterated to me in the strongest possible terms how the Good Friday agreement matters very deeply" to him and his administration and how "he had made this unequivocally clear to the British government". The US president and Miche\'e1l met on the margins on Monday. Then Joe fell asleep in the conference hall. Having rubbed shoulders with political and business giants at the start of the week the Taoiseach suffered the indignity of a return to Dublin to face the usual wretched cast of thankless minnows in the D\'e1il. No wonder he was a bit tetchy. He nearly bit the head off socialist Mick Barry, who interrupted his dissertation on the nature of emissions. "And methane emanates, as we know, from a range of human activities, including oil and gas extraction, which we have taken steps in this House to limit . . ." "Bizarre," harrumphed Mick. "Deputy Barry, it's not your turn," snapped the Taoiseach, mid-sentence. Mick shut up sharpish, because it's not like Miche\'e1l to be so venomous. Eyebrows raised all round. R\'f3is\'edn Shortall, co-leader of the Social Democrats, got under his skin too. She niggled away at the "ambitious" commitments made at the UN climate conference and wondered if his Government's action on climate change would match his "climate rhetoric". "Will the kudos you got be short-lived, Taoiseach?" "Why are you making agreements at Cop that you cop out of as soon as the ink is dry on an agreement?" she wondered. Miche\'e1l was disappointed in her and all the others who criticised his noble intentions. "I just have to say that you suffer, at times, from an abundance of negativity," he sniffily informed R\'f3is\'edn. Targets will be set Because the Taoiseach was full of zeal following his two days in Scotland. Targets will be set and will have to be met because "we don't have time, as a race, to hang around any longer without dealing with climate change". The Government is determined Ireland will do its bit. "That is reflected in our increased commitment, over and above what we committed to in the programme for Government." The changes will be "significant" and will be unveiled in today's long-awaited Climate Action Plan. Deputy Shortall, unmoved by Miche\'e1l's stirring version of The Commitments, harried him for specific examples of how these targets will be reached. She also demanded a straight answer on the vexed question of reducing cattle numbers. Presumably the answers will come with the new plan, because they didn't come from the Taoiseach. Like everyone else, he must have been waiting for the final draft to emerge. R\'f3is\'edn wondered if Miche\'e1l was really serious at all with his carbon footprint promises. "Yes. Yes. Absolutely" he cried. "And I would prefer if you were a bit more engaging and more of an advocate for change as opposed to nitpicking all the time." Earlier, he took a swipe at Sinn F\'e9in's whatever-way-the-wind-blows attitude to a carbon tax. "It's about time you got off the fence," he told party leader Mary Lou McDonald. "You're having an each-way bet, every week, every month in this House for the last number of years on the issue." Meanwhile, Mick Barry got his chance to speak on behalf of People Before Profit/Solidarity. He rose to his feet, still smarting from that earlier slap-down. "So. It is my turn now, Taoiseach." The glory in Glasgow didn't inspire him and he said it certainly doesn't impress young people. Mick wouldn't have much time for the bigwigs at Cop26 . A shower of Bs in his eyes: Biden, Boris and Bezos. No, he certainly doesn't have any time for Joe Biden. And as for Boris Johnson, he may have opened the conference dressed in green but the young people know "this is a man who slashed tax on domestic flights and supports subsidies for the fossil fuel industry". They have seen Jeff Bezos, "the rocket man", pledge $2 billion to protect the environment while Amazon emitted more CO2 this year than the annual emissions of two-thirds of the countries in the world. And he is typical member of a global corporate elite pulling the strings of capitalist politicians at the climate summit. "Why on earth should the young generation place one iota of faith in these politicians to solve the crisis?" Mick is off to join them. "Tonight, I will pack my waterproofs, set my alarm and get ready to travel to Glasgow in the morning," he announced. "Myself and a busload of young Socialist Party colleagues will join the International Socialist Alternative contingent, which will be part of the 100,000-strong protests on the streets of Glasgow this weekend." Old Doc Martens You couldn't begrudge him. He'll be happy out, digging out his old Doc Martens and reliving his young student firebrand days when he sold the Socialist Worker on the streets of Dublin. Had nobody a good word to say to the Taoiseach after his efforts on his country's behalf at Cop26 ? "Taoiseach, I have to take the opportunity to thank you and to congratulate you on your performance and your contribution to Cop26 in Glasgow. While it's been met with a lot of cynicism from Opposition, I firmly believe that it was, by far, the best contribution by any Irish leader at any Conference of the Parties held to date." Fair play. Miche\'e1l must have been feeling a little bruised. He hadn't even been hanging out with the billionaires. "In fact, I met with a farmer. I didn't meet the Jeff Bezoses of this world at all. I met a Tom Galvin from Dingle, who travelled to Cop with a group from the Dingle peninsula who are a very innovative and creative group of people who want to create a particular approach across the peninsula to this climate issue." And the Taoiseach is all the richer for it. \</doc>

November was a busy month for second-year geography students in CBS The Green in Tralee as they took part in something called the '30 Day Earth Month Challenge'. The month-long challenge saw the boys -\~under the guidance of teachers Rebecca\~Tobin and Karen Tobin -\~commit to doing something small every single day that would have a positive impact in\~the area of climate change.\~The project was all part of the school's ongoing commitment to being leaders in climate change. Influenced by the COP26 climate change conference that took place in Glasgow last month, each student received a 30-day card which they used to\~chart\~their progress. On the final day of the challenge, the staff and students teamed up with Tralee Bay Wetlands for a tree-planting exercise which saw them plant over 100 trees. Teacher Karen Tobin said that the exercise was a great "hands on" activity for the boys to do to help then be more aware of the natural world around them. "This was a unique collaboration with our neighbours over in the wetlands, the students planted over 100 native tree species both in the wetlands and the school grounds. It is hoped that this active hands-on engagement will encourage the boys to become more environmentally aware," she said. Finally, Karen said that the students\~know that awareness and knowledge along with action is key to moving towards protecting our environment. With that in mind, she said that they are also creating a visual display to kick-start the conversation of change among the school community. "They believe that by showing example through their challenge initiative that it may influence the attitudes and behaviours of our school community," she finished. \</doc>

BISHOP of Kerry Ray Browne has said the public have been a source of constant inspiration throughout the pandemic for the 'great love and selflessness' people have shown. His remarks came in the course of his annual Christmas message; this time focusing on the trials of the battle with Covid two years into the pandemic. "A word of thanks to all who through their work, their community and parish involvement, or their homes have responded so well to the great, great challenge presented by Covid," Bishop Browne said. "Again and again in the pandemic, we have seen the great love and selflessness of so many people - all ages and all situations. You have been an inspiration to us all," he stated. Both the health and climate emergencies of the current age impel a response in keeping with the message of the age-old Nativity, he said: "This year of Covid and of Cop26 , the infant Jesus in the crib points to two appropriate Christmas responses: love and care for each other; love and care for our planet. "The love Jesus had for everyone he met, the love of God for every human being, calls out to us to love one another, to love our neighbour. The earth is God's gift to us, we need it for food, for water, for air, for everything. Jesus in the crib gently calls on us to appreciate and take care of the world God has given to us and to hand it on with great care to the children of today." Bishop Browne urged people to continue to transcend the negative effect of the pandemic. "This Christmas we can all rise above the negative effects of the Pandemic. Trust there will still be more than enough you and your loved ones can do to have a happy, meaningful Christmas. Ensure that all children have a good Christmas. If you can afford it, give generously to St Vincent de Paul and other local voluntary organizations," he advised. \</doc>

WE heard a lot from world leaders and experts at the COP26 conference in Glasgow. The main outcome was to meet again next year to review climate change then. In the meantime, Irish farmers are very worried about agriculture and do not have any great guidance about their future, in an industry employing more than a quarter-of-a-million people on-farm alone, as well as producing the best quality food in the world. A few approximate statistics on climate change may be useful. Ireland produces about 0.1pc of world greenhouse gases. That's one thousandth of the world production. Agricultural activities are responsible for just over one-third of this, with the remaining two-thirds attributed to industry, fossil fuel burning, transportation and other causes. China produces about 30pc of the world's greenhouse gases, the United States about 15pc, followed by India, Russia and Japan. If Ireland ceased agricultural activities next year, the effect on world climate change would be almost negligible. While improved farm management to play our part in the control of harmful emissions would be welcome, it should not unduly interrupt our agricultural sector or cause undue stress on farm families and should be in proportion to the climate change that can be achieved.

Wealthy nations will not deliver a long-promised $100 billion ((EURO)86bn) a year in climate finance for poor countries until 2023, three years late, a report has found. Public and private finance totalling $100 billion a year by 2020 - to help poor countries develop cleanly and cope with the impacts of global warming - was first promised at troubled UN talks in Copenhagen in 2009. Cop26 president Alok Sharma describing it as "a matter of trust".

The plan, which aimed to provide clarity on when and how developed countries would meet the goal, draws on analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and includes new pledges of financial support made by countries up until October 20th.

But he added: "We can and must do more to get finance flowing to developing nations. "So in the lead-up to Cop26 , it's vital we see further pledges from developed countries and action on key priorities such as access to finance and funding for adaptation." AdvertisementCampaigners warned that developed countries needed to do more to provide finance for developing nations. Teresa Anderson, climate policy co-ordinator at ActionAid International, said delivering an average of $100 billion a year was the bare minimum to build trust in the talks. \~ She said it was vital support was provided as grants, and at least 50 per cent went to efforts to adapt to climate extremes. "World leaders must recognise and address the glaring gap between the current 100 billion-a-year target and the trillions needed to tackle the scale and urgency of the crisis," she added. The plan comes after analysis by the OECD found that climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries was just short of $80 billion in 2019. It also found the majority of the money came from public sources in 2019, with private finance flows underperforming, though the majority of public money was loans rather than grants. Far more money went towards financing emissions cuts than helping countries and communities adapt to extreme weather and rising seas, despite calls for funding to be divided equally between mitigation and adaption. The plan sets out measures to deliver on the finance promise, including increasing money for adaptation, prioritising grants for the poorest and most vulnerable, improving access to finance and working with multilateral banks to increase climate finance. Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said: "One hundred billion dollars is less than the UK alone is spending on the HS2 rail link, yet the combined wealth of all the world's developed nations refuses to stump up the cash to help tackle the climate crisis." He described it as "utterly shameful", adding: "The leaders of the developed world need to pull their finger out and get this money on the table if Cop26 is going to be a success." \</doc>

A pledge to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent, agreed by global leaders at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow and signed by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, will not form part of the Government's climate action plan which is expected to be published tomorrow. Instead the plan is understood to include methane reductions of about 10 per cent but with larger reductions in other greenhouse gases to meet Ireland's target of a 50 per cent reduction by 2030. This will include reductions in nitrous oxide emissions which like methane emanate from the agriculture sector. The climate action plan, which will detail the measures to be taken in various sectors to reduce emissions for the rest of the decade, is likely to be signed off at a Cabinet committee meeting today and approved by the full Cabinet tomorrow. Sources say that an agreement on agriculture emission reductions - politically the most sensitive part of the plan - has largely been reached between Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan. It is expected that the reduction in agriculture emissions will be in the range of 22-30 per cent down from 2018 levels. In total, this means a reduction from 23 MtCO2eq (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) to 16-18 MtCO2eq. It is expected that half of emission reductions will be achieved through carbon capture and storage. The emissions reduction from land use changes and afforestation will be not be linked to the agriculture targets but is expected to be of the order of 2.4 MtCO2eq. Some of this, however, will be "borrowed from future savings", it is understood. More than 100 countries signed up to the Cop26 pledge led by the European Union and the United States to cut global methane gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. 'Cautiously optimistic' British prime minister Boris Johnson said he was "cautiously optimistic" that the summit in Glasgow would succeed. Mr Martin addressed the summit yesterday, saying the impact of climate change was already visible and it was intensifying. He said human actions could still determine the planet's future but immediate, large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were essential if global warming is to be kept below 1.5 degrees. Director of Friends of the Earth Ois\'edn Coghlan described the Taoiseach's address and related comments to the media yesterday as "a step change in political leadership on climate". Mr Coghlan said: "I've never heard a Taoiseach speak so convincingly on the need for climate action." \</doc>

T HE latest IPCC report makes for heavy reading. The report was released last week, but with public attention understandably focused on the acute geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, this IPCC report received less media attention than normal. Given the highly technical nature of IPCC reports, they often do not reach mainstream audiences. This is a huge problem because these reports reveal important information about the climate and nature crises. It is therefore vital that the findings contained in the IPCC reports are communicated to the public in digestible and readable ways. To begin, it is important to understand what 'IPCC' refers to. IPCC stands for 'Intergovernmental panel on climate change', and this panel was first established by the United Nations in 1988. The panel is composed of a group of climate scientists who assess published research on the state of climate breakdown, subsequently outlining actions we should take. Before Cop26 One could therefore consider this report as a projection. A projection of what would the world look like if we continued to operate in 'code red', as UN Secretary General formerly put it. It was worth noting the tremendous effort and expertise underpinning this report. 270 scientists reviewed over 34,000 research publications, assessing 127 risks that we currently face. The following question therefore arises: what did they find? In accordance with previous IPCC reports, we are once again reminded that if humanity breaches 1.5 degrees of warming, we will no longer be able to adapt to harmful impacts of climate change. This is very frightening. Africa is responsible for just 3% global greenhouse gas emissions, but feels severe climate impacts, including droughts, storms and floods which impact food security and urban development. However, in contrast to previous reports, this report highlights how climate impacts have become increasingly widespread. Scientists cite that 3.3 to 3.6 billion people currently live in contexts highly vulnerable to climate change. Indeed, the unpredictable weather patterns and storms that we have recently witnessed reveal how the UK is already experiencing what other countries have experienced for years. Clearly, climate change affects all of us. Adaptation certainly seems like a more attractive alternative to death, but what does it really mean to £dapt' to climate change? Adaptation means changing our lifestyles and infrastructure to cope with the changing climate. It refers to how we produce our food, how we build our cities, and crucially, how we invest our money. In contrast to previous reports, this IPCC report makes much stronger reference to the economic case for investing in adaptation. The report highlights how investing in climate resilience and development makes sense for the economy, as well as our health and that of the planet. The message is clear: the economic impact of inaction far outweighs the economic implications of action. The cost of inaction is expensive. The cost of keeping to 1.5 degrees of warming will be far lower than the cost of loss and damage. With a return of investment ratio of 4:1, Patrick Verkooijen explains how investing in climate adaptation is not charity. It is what he calls 'smart economics'. There are therefore compelling market reasons to address the climate crisis. The strong economic argument which shone through in this report may be considered a narrow approach to some. However, in many ways, this argument may represent the next step in the adaptation agenda. Every 10% of carbon increase makes adaptation more difficult, and is therefore vital that we act at scale and with speed. The economic support of multinationals, finance ministers and corporations will help accelerate this. However, we would be entirely misguided to believe that the climate as we know it today will be the climate that we know tomorrow. Indeed, the report refuses to let us ignore the terrifying question: how far can we adapt to the climate emergency? Depending on levels of temperature increase, by 2040 we will still face many of the 127 risks outlined in the report. These risks could also be much higher. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the last IPCC report as 'code red for humanity'. He calls this one £n atlas of human suffering'. The report therefore acts as a sombre warning. We will not eliminate them. Scientists behind the report observe this fact with a high degree of confidence. This is a sombre warning that should wake us all up. Understandably, many are panicking - especially young people. After all, a '2040 world' is our world. However, we should remember that there is nothing inevitable about this 'code red' situation we are in. In fact, none of the findings in this report are inevitable. They are a direct result of human activity and political choices. Things may be bad, but they don't have to be. 'None of the findings in this report are inevitable. They are a direct result of human activity' \</doc>

China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has failed to increase its commitments to address the climate crisis as demanded by other countries at the Cop26 climate summit. In a written address yesterday to the gathering of world leaders in Glasgow, China's president Xi Jinping called on developed countries to "provide support to help developing countries do better" in dealing with the consequences of global warming. He also urged all parties to take stronger actions to "jointly tackle the climate challenge", and said his country would "speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations". 'Disappointing' Before his arrival in Glasgow, US president Joe Biden said the focus should be on what countries like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are not doing to address climate change. He called it "disappointing" that those nations "basically didn't show up, in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change". Earlier, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change said Mr Xi would be the only leader to address the "first part of the high-level segment for heads of state and government" in a written statement. He had previously been expected to appear by video link. China is critical to a Cop26 agreement to ensure a better chance of containing global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees this century. Despite this, Mr Xi, who has not left China since last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, had not been expected to attend the conference in person. Balance He participated in the G20 summit in Rome over the weekend via video link, and spoke to those there at length about the climate crisis, urging countries to "balance environmental protection and economic development, address climate change and safeguard people's livelihood" - and accepted "major economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard". In updated pledges, China confirmed to the UN last week it would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and cut them to net zero by 2060. It also promised to raise total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030. However, it was hoped there would be pledges to cap energy consumption and ensure an earlier start to reducing China's use of coal, currently scheduled to begin in 2026. It has committed, however, to end foreign investment in "unabated" coal-power plants. Russia approved a long-term government climate strategy yesterday, targeting carbon neutrality by 2060 and rejected US allegations it was not doing enough on climate change. \</doc>

THE deputy chairman of Stormont\' s agriculture and environment committee plans to make the 400km round-trip to Cop26 by bike in an effort to raise awareness of the climate crisis and active travel. Sinn F\'e9in MLA Philip McGuigan will leave his home in Dunloy, Co Antrim tomorrow morning bound for Belfast, where he\' ll take the ferry to Cairnryan before cycling on to Glasgow. The 47-year-old keen cyclist, who less than six months ago suffered a cardiac arrest while undergoing routine hospital tests, says politicians  need to lead by example . Cop26 is hosted this year by the UK government and will see many of the world\' s leaders gather in Scotland to discuss climate change and how to tackle it. Mr McGuigan, who is a co-sponsor of Green leader Claire Bailey\' s climate change private member\' s bill, told The Irish News he using his pedal powered trip to highlight the need for climate action and the role active travel can play in reducing carbon emissions.  I believe politicians need to lead by example and by doing this I hope to highlight how we can help mitigate the impact of climate change and live more sustainably through our own actions, he said last night.  It may be a small step given the scale of the problem we\' re facing but in addition to its environmental benefits, cycling is also good for our physical and mental well-being. The North Antrim MLA said Stormont needed to  significantly increase investment in active travel, which he said was a  just a fraction of what the Scottish executive spends.  Investing in the infrastructure for active travel, be it improving access public transport or expanding the greenway network, is a win-win in terms of health and environmental outcomes but at the minute we are lagging far behind everywhere else on these islands, he said. In June, Mr McGuigan revealed how his heart stopped while undergoing a procedure at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The Stormont committee deputy chairman, who suffers from arrhythmia \- commonly known as irregular heartbeat \- has been diagnosed with early onset heart disease and is likely to be on medication for the rest of his life. Nevertheless, he is an advocate of taking regular, moderate exercise and cycles up to six hours every weekend, as well as running. On arrival in Cairnryan tomorrow afternoon, he plans to wait until most of the HGVs have embarked on their journeys before heading north to Glasgow, with the latter part of his journey in darkness. He will return home on Monday, by a slightly shorter route via the ferry to Larne. \</doc>

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a parliamentary grilling today over charges of sleaze within his Conservative party and lacklustre leadership at the COP26 climate summit. Mr Johnson will be quizzed by the heads of parliament's cross-party select committees at 3pm for a stock-take of government policy, typically held three times a year and which can prove uncomfortable for under-fire leaders. This session - Mr Johnson's sixth since becoming prime minister in mid-2019 - coincides with a simmering crisis over MPs' conduct, primarily from his own ruling Conservative party, over potential conflicts of interest and lucrative second jobs. On the eve of his appearance, the British leader sought to get on the front foot by writing to parliament's speaker to say he will back proposals to bar MPs from acting as paid political consultants and advisers. The move came as the main opposition Labour party prepared to introduce a vote to bar MPs from such roles, as well as being paid directors, which its leader Keir Starmer said had forced Mr Johnson's hand. MPs are permitted to hold outside roles, as long as they declare them, but are not allowed to use their parliamentary offices or resources for such work. Paid lobbying is also forbidden, with wrongdoing accusations probed by parliamentary standards watchdogs. Scrutiny The current scandal mushroomed this month when Johnson tried - and failed - to overhaul how that watchdogs system operates after MP Owen Paterson faced suspension over lobbying ministers for two firms that had him on the payroll. It soon emerged numerous other MPs had high-paying second jobs, in particular lawyer and former attorney general Geoffrey Cox. He has been accused of using his parliamentary office for outside legal work, which has netted him more than \£36m (\€ 7m) since becoming an MP in 2005, on top of his annual MP's salary, which is currently around \£382,000 (\€ 97,586). Mr Paterson has resigned from parliament, while Mr Cox denies breaking the rules. The saga has seen support for both Mr Johnson and the Tories drop in recent polls. Today's questioning session will also see Mr Johnson quizzed about Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which ended last weekend HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/2021/1114/1259875-glasgow-climate-pact/ with nearly 200 nations signing a deal to try to halt runaway global warming . However, two weeks of painful negotiations - and two personal visits by the British leader - fell short of securing what scientists say is needed to contain dangerous rises. Opposition politicians have accused Mr Johnson of failing to take the summit seriously enough, after returning for less than a full day following the initial gathering of world leaders at the start. The senior MPs will also grill him on government efforts to respond to violence against women and girls, following several high-profile cases that have rocked the country and led to an outcry. The British leader has previously proved reluctant to face the watchdog committee, reneging on multiple invitations in 2019 and only appearing before it for the first time nearly a year after taking power. He was last quizzed by the panel in July. \</doc>

UN CONFERENCE host Britain said 77 countries had pledged to phase out coal, as a study showed the carbon dioxide it released into the atmosphere had rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels. "We were expecting to see some rebound," said the study's lead author Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate modelling researcher at the University of Exeter. "What surprised us was the intensity and rapidity of the rebound." COP26 conference in Glasgow, said the two-week meeting was on its way to gradually ending use of the world's most widely used fuel - for which demand is set to hit a new record this year. He said yesterday 77 countries had signed a pledge to phase out coal-fuelled power plants - which produce more than 35pc of the world's electricity - and to stop building new ones. "Today I think we can say that the end of coal is in sight," Mr Sharma told the conference. But the hurdles to reach the UN goal of "net zero" global emissions by 2050 are still enormous. The British government said on Wednesday it expected 190 nations and organisations to sign the non-binding pledge, in which richer countries would phase out coal power before 2040, and poorer countries before 2050. But the list published yesterday left out both India and China which is home to almost half the over 2,600 coal-fired plants operating or under construction around the world. And the International Energy Agency, the world's energy watchdog, this year said to achieve the UN goal of net zero emissions by 2050, no new fossil fuel projects should be approved after 2021 - a goal the latest pledge is sure to miss. In 2020, carbon dioxide emissions fell by a record 1.9 billion tonnes - a 5.4pc drop - as countries locked down and economies ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic. The new report, produced by the Global Carbon Project, forecasts emissions will rise by 4.9pc this year. At least 20 countries plan to commit at the summit to stop public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of next year, according to two people familiar with the COP26 talks. There was a sharp reverse, however, for one of the most eye-catching announcements of the conference - a pledge by more than 100 world leaders to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade. Indonesia, home to huge tropical rainforests, said that Monday's agreement was at odds with its own development plans. In 2019 alone, an area of Indonesian forest and other land half the size of Belgium was burned for palm oil plantations. \</doc>

THE hunt for the mole who leaked a video of British government staff joking about holding a Christmas party was stepped up by Downing Street yesterday. Following denials such a party took place, the hugely embarrassing footage cost Boris Johnson's aide Allegra Stratton her job and forced the prime minister into a grovelling apology. Questions were being asked yesterday as to whether a broadcast technology whizz and former ITV newsreader may have played a role - or know who did. Chris James, 40, was brought into No.10 at the time of the filmed rehearsals last December to help Ms Stratton and other staff get to grips with the \£32.6million press briefing room installed at No.9 in an attempt to mimic White House briefings. The idea was later scrapped and Ms Stratton was moved to a role as spokesman for the Cop26 climate change sum- mit. A source told the Daily Mail that Mr James's name had entered the mix as the potential whistleblower after he was named in connection with a leak in March of photographs of the new briefing room. That story was revealed by a young ITV producer with whom Mr James had previously worked. Tuesday's footage was also revealed by ITV, with the same producer involved. Contacted via an intermediary, Mr James declined to answer questions about any alleged role in the leak. It is likely that the leak will form part of Simon Case's investigation into the party. \</doc>

The history of climate change is a history of inequalities: the cumulative emissions of the Western industrialised world dwarfs those of developing countries. As a matter of distributive justice, what does this imply about Ireland's role, or of the Western world more generally? A simple, but fair, answer is that those who contribute to the problem need to contribute to the costs of cleaning it up, or "polluter pays". However, that's a lot to swallow. How do we do it? Can we do it? Those are the questions that resonated around yesterday's meetings at the 26th Conference of the Parties ( Cop26 ), where the world co-ordinated the means to pay to help countries adapt to, and address, the effects of climate change. By 2030, this will require flows of trillions of euro, which is rather stunning, as Nicholas Stern told us. As a moral philosopher, I am interested in both questions of what is owed and what is needed. The first point is about what is owed. Cop24 agreed to finance a green climate fund with $100bn a year by 2020. We did not get there and, as Nicholas Stern pointed out, what is promised should be delivered, since that is a matter of trust and a point that we are together in this struggle. Molwyn Joseph, environment minister for Antigua and Barbuda, called this funding an "acid test" for global co-ordination. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England (and, as a native Canadian, I feel obliged to note a fellow Canuck), has co-ordinated a large funding coalition to help fund net zero targets. The headline figure, $130tn ((EURO)112tn), is almost certainly overly optimistic, but if it can even approach that figure, that would make a huge difference. The second point is about what is needed. Many countries (Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) have raised what they are giving over the past couple of days, but the question is where this should go. We also need to protect low-lying countries from rising water and flooding risks, and conserve other lands that help protect communities. The basic question comes back to whether the global community can put its money where its mouth is and meet its promises, which is necessary to make sure we can have a truly just transition.

A bog project has been hailed as a "superstar" among community-based conservation projects. The Ballydangan Bog Red Grouse Project, in Co Roscommon, is being held up as a leading example of how to manage raised bogs for Red Grouse and breeding Curlew \- both highly threatened birds in Ireland. Reflecting on the origins of the project in 2009, manager Pat Feehily said: "We had seen a big decline in red grouse on this bog. We would have grown up as young lads here and grouse were fairly plentiful. "So, we noticed that there was a serious dwindling in them, and we set about seeing if we could do something to stop the full extinction of them." The Red Grouse was once a familiar sight in heather upland areas in Ireland. However, the population experienced a 50% decline between the early 1970s and 2008, partly due to changes in land use and habitat loss. At Ballydangan, community hunters, environmentalists and farmers have worked together to save the local population from being wiped out. "We set up a committee. With our local CE Scheme, we were given four workers to help us out and Bord na M\'f3na gave us a lease on the bog," Mr Feehily explained. "We cut the heather. That provides food for the grouse. They like the nice young heather because it's high in protein. "We have to establish some grit piles as well. It will keep them from moving off the bog to get grit. They use it for digesting their food. "We have learned a very big amount about grouse and what they like. Even the bog itself - heather, how to cut it. All that had to be learnt." The 800-hectare restored raised bog is now home to two pairs of red grouse as well as other rare flora and fauna. Mr Feehily said: "The big wins are chicks on the ground. You can win awards and you can win everything, but it doesn't really matter. What really matters to us is to see a bird with fledglings at the end of the season." Environmental consultant, David Scallan, said: "Ballydangan is a fabulous story about community-based conservation. It\' s the local community. "The initiative came from the local gun club, as they were really concerned about the loss of grouse in the region which was mainly due to raised bogs being lost. "It was everyone coming together because we want a future for red grouse. We want our children to see red grouse. Top-down initiatives often don't work, but bottom-up initiatives really do." David Fallon, who is the project\' s ecologist, presented the story of Ballydangan bog at last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Mr Fallon said: "It can\' t be overstated how important Ballydangan bog is. An intact raised bog and a restored raised bog like Ballydangan is much better at storing and sequestering greenhouse gases than an equivalent area of rainforest. In Roscommon, this is our rainforest. There\' s 10,000 years of carbon locked in there. "In Ireland, we have looked at bogs as waste lands over the years, but they\' re global superstars. And Ballydangan is a superstar. It\' s the mosaic of everything - rare plants, birds and insects." The National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) has begun a new national Red Grouse Survey to determine numbers in Ireland. As part of this survey, NPWS and the National Biodiversity Data Centre have teamed up to seek the assistance of recorders to submit sightings. The last count in 2008 estimated the number of red grouse in the Republic of Ireland at 4,200 birds, with a further 202 pairs in Northern Ireland. Reflecting on the work carried out to save the local population at Ballydangan, Pat Feehily said: "When you grow up with something and then it starts to disappear you get sentimental, I suppose when you get on in life. And we decided if we could do something, it would be great and we did." \</doc>

You will be hearing a lot about COP26 in the coming weeks. For the unfamiliar, events around the climate change conference in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12 can seem like an alphabet soup of acronyms and jargon. COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and the "parties" bit refers to the countries that are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some 150 countries signed the framework at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. There are now 197 signatories. The UNFCC set up a decision-making system involving a climate conference - a COP - every year. These take place in November or December, and are preceded by a flurry of diplomatic activity by the UN and by the host country to sound out members as to what is achievable. Much depends on the drive and ambition of the president of the COP, who is appointed by the host country. In the case of Glasgow, the president is Alok Sharma, a rather anonymous British MP and formerly business secretary in Boris Johnson's cabinet. Sharma deliberately cultivates a boring image, but was drawn into controversy for flying to more than 30 countries in recent months without observing Covid regulations. Environmental campaigners were also dismayed when he continued with his day job in addition to his COP duties. Eventually, he moved full-time into the climate role. Another key figure is the UN's climate chief (officially called executive secretary of the UNFCCC), who also chivvies and chases countries to increase the ambition of their climate policies in advance of the COP. The post is currently held by Mexican diplomat Patricia Espinosa. These two - the COP president and UN climate boss - need to work well together. Observers read much into their appointment: getting a heavy-hitter as COP president is seen as a sign of commitment by the host. Johnson's choice of Sharma did not inspire confidence initially, but his quiet application may produce results. Once the conference starts, things soon get interesting. Countries form alliances and pool their influence. The list of coalitions can seem bewildering, but the tension usually centres on countries pushing for more radical Johnson's the British president (and necessary) climate action versus those in favour of a more incremental approach. The African Group (54 countries) will push for more finance for developing countries, while the Umbrella Group, which includes some heavily fossil-fuel dependent countries such as the Russian Federation, Australia, Norway and Ukraine, are often seen as more conservative. This group also includes the US, which has become more ambitious on climate under president Joe Biden. Some of the most impactful contributions to the debates come from the Small Island Developing States (Sids), a grouping of 40 low-lying islands, mostly in the Pacific, whose existence is threatened by climate change. It was the intervention by this group that led to the strengthening of the language of the agreement reached at the Paris COP in 2015. The BASIC grouping (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) is also influential, and much diplomatic effort is expended in getting them to move towards more meaningful action. Ireland negotiates as part of the EU group, and is a signatory of the three main international climate agreements, the original UNFCCC (1992), the Kyoto Protocol (1997), and the Paris Agreement (2015). HEAVY LIFTING Under the terms of the agreement reached in Paris in 2015, countries must submit their emissions reduction commitments in advance - these are called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - and are expected to ratchet up over time. In advance of the Glasgow conference, countries will be under pressure to increase the ambition of these NDCs. Some will already be at the level necessary to keep global warming below 2C and to aim for 1.5C, while others will be some way off. The heavy lifting at the COP involves drafting and redrafting the text of a potential agreement. Some items get dropped from the text because agreement cannot be reached. For example, the regulation of emissions from planes and ships was omitted from the Paris Agreement. Some COPs end in relative failure, producing a very weak and place-holding text at the end, as happened in Copenhagen in 2009. But this year, when the impacts of climate change have been so evident, and with the words of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report ringing in their ears, delegates are expected to agree on a document that will be equal to the moment.

AT nearly 14m sq km in area, Antarctica is a gigantic land mass, around one and a half times the size of the continental US. The ice shelves perched on top of this vast southern continent contain an almost unimaginable 26m cu km of frozen water. A single cubic kilometre of ice weights 1bn tonnes. This frozen giant has lain dormant for at least the last 15m years. Now, there are worrying signs that it is beginning to stir from its deep slumber. In recent days, scientists have reported that temperatures in parts of eastern Antarctica have risen by 40C above normal for three consecutive days. The Vostok research station, located close to the south pole at an elevation of nearly 3,500 metres, is the coldest place on the planet, having recorded a temperature of -89.2C in 1983. However, in recent days, Vostok experienced an almost balmy -17.7C, an astonishing 15C warmer than ever recorded at that location. Computer simulations and observations across Antarctica indicate that in some locations, temperatures may have risen by up to 50C above normal. To visualise how dramatic a shift this is, consider that in Ireland, the average March temperature range is from 5.2C to 10.7C. Now, try to imagine a March heatwave in Ireland with temperatures above 50C. "I have never seen anything like this in Antarctica," said Ted Scrampos, ice scientist at the University of Colorado, who has recently returned from a research expedition to the region. Isolated from the world's continental landmasses by oceans and in continuous darkness for its four- to five-month winter, Antarctica to a large extent generates its own weather systems. Except for its vulnerable western Antarctic peninsula, which has shown worrying signs of ice shelf collapse, the main continental shelf hasn't been considered to be at significant risk of warming. In fact, it has been warming more slowly than the world as a whole. Polar scientists believe the recent heatwave event is linked to a giant atmospheric 'river' that has drawn in masses of warm, wet air from the Pacific ocean. "The moist air has trapped heat over the continent, resulting in the warm surface temperatures... this is an extraordinary event," said Australian climatologist Julie Arblaster. Reliable long-term temperature records in the Antarctic only go back as far as the late 1950s, making it difficult to assess just how unusual the current heatwave really is. Weather systems on the frozen continent are notoriously fickle; in 2021, the south pole recorded its coldest ever April-September, yet last month, the level of sea ice surrounding Antarctica fell to its lowest on record. While attributing a specific meteorological event to climate change is especially challenging in Antarctica, the warming global climate is "loading the dice" to make extreme instances like this ever more likely, according to Jonathan Wille, a French polar meteorology researcher. Temperatures like this, he added, "are never supposed to happen". As scientists pinch themselves in disbelief at the extreme and unprecedented heatwave racking Antarctica, at the other end of the world, weather stations in Greenland and Norway recorded temperature spikes in the Arctic region 27C higher than normal for this time of year. Overall, the Arctic is heating three times faster than the global average, with temperatures in the region having increased by a full 1C in just the last decade. This in turn is leading to a sharp rise in extreme events. Temperatures deep in the Russian Arctic hit 38C during the summer 2020 heatwave. Unlike the Antarctic, almost all the Arctic ice cap is floating on open ocean, but sea ice has been thinning precipitously as temperatures in the region increase. A phenomenon known as the 'ice albedo effect' explains why Arctic temperatures are rising so quickly. An intact ice sheet reflects almost all incoming sunlight back into space. However, as soon as it begins to thin and expose the ocean beneath, up to 90% of incoming solar energy is absorbed by the dark waters, causing ocean temperature to begin to rise. As this happens, more ice melts, and so the cycle of warming accelerates. A so-called 'blue ocean event' is where the Arctic ocean is virtually ice-free during the summer, something that has not occurred in at least 2.5m years. Scientists now believe this could happen within the next 10-12 years, with profound consequences for the climatic system in the entire northern hemisphere. The loss of polar ice cover across the entire Arctic region would be the equivalent of suddenly shutting down a gigantic air conditioning system that helps regulate both temperatures and weather patterns across the northern hemisphere, with profound consequences that scientists are only beginning to fully grasp. Former Nasa chief scientist James Hansen and his colleagues have researched the likely effects of ice melt on ocean currents and weather systems. The giant Greenland ice shelf is losing an average of 1m tonnes of ice per minute. In 2019, this amounted to 600bn tonnes of ice melt. This massive influx of cold fresh water into the north Atlantic could trigger the shut-down of the Gulf Stream, the warm current that transfers huge amounts of heat energy from the tropics and keeps north-western Europe several degrees warmer than its latitude would suggest. Such an event would have catastrophic consequences for Ireland, causing our temperatures to plummet and our grass-based agricultural system to fail. In addition, a sudden increase in the temperature gradient between the tropics and the northern hemisphere would, according to Prof Hansen, "fuel super-storms stronger than any seen in modern times". "All hell would break loose in the north Atlantic," he added. The profound energy imbalance that is causing these seismic events at both poles is driven by the annual emission of around 40bn tonnes of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the global atmosphere, mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning. To understand just how dramatic these changes are, scientists estimate that the world's oceans are heating at the rate equivalent to the energy released by five Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs per second, or nearly 160m Hiroshimas a year. A small reminder of just how rapidly the Arctic system is changing occurred in November 2020, when a time capsule was washed up on the coastline at Gweedore, Co Donegal. The capsule had been embedded deep in the sea ice at the North Pole just two years earlier, in August 2018. Some time later, due to rapid thawing, it had come adrift and floated over 3,700km on the currents before arriving in Ireland. The seemingly remote Arctic and Antarctic regions are intimately connected with the very waters that lap our shores and the atmosphere above us. What happens at the poles profoundly affects all life on Earth. Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow last November, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned that humanity is "digging our own graves" through failing to tackle the climate emergency. "Our addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink," he said. "We face a stark choice: either we stop it, or it stops us". The only question remains: Will we choose to act, or cling to denial as we stumble towards a climate apocalypse?  John Gibbons is an environmental journalist and commentator \</doc>

Unprecedented amounts of private-sector finance from many of the world's richest economies have been committed at the UN Cop26 summit to funding a reduction in carbon emissions linked to human activity to zero. With most national leaders having left Glasgow after pledging to reduce methane emissions and halt deforestation, yesterday's talks were dominated by climate finance issues. The most significant announcement was $130 trillion in funding over three decades through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero (GFANZ). Banks and asset managers representing 40 per cent of the world's financial assets, involving 450 firms across 45 countries, pledged to meet the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, said UN special envoy on climate Mark Carney, who is co-chairing the initiative with US businessman Michael Bloomberg. "Ramping up adoption of clean energy and other sustainable infrastructure fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change will require trillions of dollars in new investment - likely in the ballpark of $100 trillion," the GFANZ co-chairs said. "Most of that will have to come from the private sector, especially after the enormous toll that the pandemic has taken on governmental budgets." Speaking in Glasgow after British chancellor Rishi Sunak announced details of the GFANZ package, Mr Carney insisted the money "was ready" for the climate transition but it "desperately needed net zero ready projects". "Right here, right now is where private finance draws the line. The $130 trillion is more than is needed for the net zero transition globally and a pool of that capital is being carved out for the transition to a low-carbon economy in emerging and developing countries," he said. "There's a way to turn this into a very powerful virtuous circle. This is what we need to crack over the course of this year." While there was a broad welcome for the announcement, some climate NGOs were less supportive. Dorothy Guerrero, head of policy at Global Justice Now, said many of the financial institutions involved had "made a killing from the climate and ecological crisis" and that observers should be "deeply suspicious of any attempt to spin them as the heroes". "Governments must regulate the process and lead the transition, instead of just handing it over [to] the corporations," she said. Meanwhile, US climate envoy John Kerry told a meeting of mayors that emission reduction pledges made to date gave the world only a 60 per cent chance of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees - the key Paris accord target. He said he had not seen a sense of urgency similar to that at Cop26 at previous summits. Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told an event hosted by the think-tank Policy Exchange that he doubted efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees would succeed. \</doc>

Cop26 is the "chance to win a victory for the next century, for life on this planet", US climate envoy John Kerry has said, while warning all big emitters must take action on climate change. Speaking at London School of Economics before the Cop26 United Nations climate summit kicks off in Glasgow, Mr Kerry said there was "real, meaningful, and growable" momentum among countries and businesses to drive a shift to green economies. However, he warned that there was still a gap between action pledged by countries in the next decade and the levels of cuts needed to avoid dangerous warming. Glasgow could be a new beginning to drive action on tackling climate change over the next "decisive" decade, he suggested. Mr Kerry said all countries must work together, with G20 countries, the world's largest economies including China and India as well as the US and Britain who account for 80% of emissions, particularly responsible for action. He criticised those countries such as China who were arguing they deserved "carbon space" because other nations had developed in the past when they had not, and therefore they should be allowed to pollute more. Scientists say the world must cut carbon by at least 45% by 2030 to be on a path to "net zero" emissions by 2050 to limit global rises to 1.5C, but emissions are likely to rise 16% by 2030 on 2010 levels on current efforts. Mr Kerry said: "We must significantly accelerate our efforts. That is a judgment not of me, or President Biden or of anybody in politics. It's the judgment of the best science and mathematics. "That's what this is about, not ideology, not politics, it's about mathematics and physics," he said, adding scientists had warned of the "devastating consequences" if global temperatures rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world was already at around 1.2C of warming, and "we're no longer talking about impacts in the future, we no longer need scientists to tell us what will happen because we're seeing it happen now already", he said, pointing to heat waves, superstorms and floods this year. He said the world faced destruction of crops at coral reefs, the melting of glaciers that provide water for millions, migration destabilised regions, and collapsing economies beyond 1.5C of warming.

Countries are setting out efforts to bring about the end of coal power after 250 years as the Cop26 climate talks focus on pollution from energy. The move at the crucial conference in Glasgow comes as scientists warn that carbon emissions from fossil fuels look set to rebound to close to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 - and could even rise further in 2022.

AdvertisementMore than 40 countries have signed up to the statement, including 18 committing to phase out and not build or invest in new coal power for the first time, such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile, the UK government said. Separately, 28 new members have signed up to the "powering past coal alliance", to phase out the use of the most polluting fossil fuel. Efforts to swiftly end the use of coal - the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions - are seen as key to cutting carbon enough to get the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5C, beyond which the worst impacts of storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising seas will be felt. Since the Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C was agreed in 2015, there has been a 76 per cent cut in the number of new coal plants planned. But while it appears the world's use of coal peaked in around 2014, it is still not falling significantly, with heavy use and even increases in countries such as China. \~ In May, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that investment in new polluting coal power plants and mines, and new oil and gas projects, had to be stopped from 2021 in order to effectively tackle climate change. Under the latest push, major banks including NatWest have committed to ending finance for coal, in a move coming after commitments from China, Japan and South Korea and the G20 to end overseas finance for coal generation.

UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: "Today marks a milestone moment in our global efforts to tackle climate change as nations from all corners of the world unite in Glasgow to declare that coal has no part to play in our future power generation. "Spearheaded by the UK's Cop26 presidency, today's ambitious commitments made by our international partners demonstrate that the end of coal is in sight." \~ Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said any progress towards powering past coal is welcome, but there were "glaring gaps" such as a lack of commitment from China and other large emitters to stop increasing coal at home - and nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas. AdvertisementBut Leo Roberts, from climate think tank E3G, said: "The past few days in Glasgow have shown that momentum away from coal is gathering pace, with new partnerships, tools and money coming together to consign coal to history." He added that the breadth and depth of announcements and initiatives being announced on Thursday were an indication of how rapidly the shift away from coal is gathering pace, saying: "These announcements collectively demonstrate the era of coal is coming to an end." The announcements come as analysis from the Global Carbon Project showed the scale of the challenge, with coal - and gas - emissions set to rise to above 2019 levels in 2021, although oil pollution remains below pre-pandemic levels. The rapid rise could be a temporary "sugar hit" from stimulus packages that focused on industry, such as in China where emissions continued to rise during 2020, and drove an increased use of coal. But a further rise in emissions in 2022 to new highs cannot be ruled out if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use does not drop back again after the "over-correction" of pandemic stimulus, they said. \</doc>

W HILE COP26 undoubtedly plays a vital role in bringing world leaders together, and hopefully pushing global climate ambition closer to agreeing that 1.5-degree ceiling that scientists tell us is our best bet at a safe future, the lessons of past COPs must also be heeded. For each of the previous 25 years of pledges, the world is still hurtling towards a catastrophic future. Decades of inaction now mean that this generation must deliver the most ambitious reductions in emissions, in the shortest timeframe, that we have ever attempted. While this burden will weigh heavy on our shoulders, it is a privilege to have the certainty of the science and the power to do something about it. In Ireland, our plan for climate action is becoming clearer. We are now committed to a 51pc reduction pathway to 2030. The Climate Action Plan provides more sectoral detail, and we have carbon budgets that provide us with annual targets. Unlike typical budgets, we cannot overdraw on carbon budgets and pay them back. Carbon budgets reflect planetary limit thresholds. Once we exceed those thresholds, we take the risk of pushing our planet beyond climate tipping points we cannot come back from. That is a risk our children will not thank us for taking. While a more positive landscape for change is emerging, and undoubtedly has been hard-won, it is not going to be enough. If we are going to bridge the gap from intention to implementation, we must learn from the past and get ahead of the barriers. Everything from siloed decision-making, unaligned initiatives, short-term thinking, unintended consequences, and lack of accountability must be addressed. Most difficult may be breaking our dependence on the excuses of old and being bound by business-as-usual concepts that have no place in this transition. Nothing about this transition will be usual. While not having the same gloss as the big announcements, now is the time to lean into the seemingly mundane, but necessary, details. The governance, the methodologies, the sanctions, the rulebooks will all need to be forthcoming. Less of the waffle, more of the specifics. But to get there, we very quickly need to move the conversation on from emphasising the costs and challenges of climate action. Delaying climate action is not a neutral decision and there is a growing cost to pay for each day we hesitate to act. Any debate that looks to delay action, or minimise a sector's contribution, needs now to be countered with an analysis of the costs of not taking action. And there are many. While the costs of the physical impacts of climate change may be more obvious, there are also the costs of not responding to shifting market demands, the risks of being exposed to growing climate litigation, our lack of preparedness for supply chain disruption, our inability to attract talent and finance, and the negative impacts to our reputation. That's before we even address the moral argument that it is our responsibility, as a wealthy nation, to do all we can to lessen any further impacts on those least responsible for climate change but who are paying the highest price. We're also going to need to stop the whataboutery. What about China? What about Brazil? These arguments neglect to account for our own contribution to emissions, fail to understand that any delay to engage in climate action and become more resilient will be to our own detriment, and neglect to take account of the wider global shifts that are occurring. While COP26 There is likely to be a growing anger as we begin to understand the scale of what we are going to be asked to do. We will need more honesty and humility from our leaders. An emissions reduction of 51pc by 2030 is not just "a little bit greener". It is a complete transformation. While our leaders will rightly play a vital role in creating the policies and landscape for ambitious change, it will be up to all of us to make this happen. Are we going to stand up and support ambitious climate action, and are we going to challenge any call for slower or lesser action? It is yet to be seen where Ireland will fall in terms of the climate ambition scale. We may continue to try and give the perception that action is being taken without the numbers adding up. Or we could go big and see a dogged commitment to climate action. We have never let our size restrict ambition when it comes to our global influence, our trade goals, or our reputation. To go small on climate would assign us to the wrong side of history, and we will get left behind. Graphic Solutions: Campaigners in George Square, Glasgow, yesterday, during the COP26 summit.

THE past year has seemed overcast with gloom. But there is as much brightness as dark on the horizon up ahead. Everywhere that there is oppression there are people fighting back. It is on the outcome of these struggles that the future depends. The key reason the earth is at risk of climate catastrophe is that production is not organised in the interests of the many but is geared instead to profit for the few. Despite all the fine words at Cop26 , investment in fossil fuels is as high as ever \- because that\' s where capitalists reckon the highest profits can be made. The pursuit of profit is the source of most of the world\' s ills. In Ireland, women have made great strides through fearlessness, organisation and struggle, and have been at the heart of everything good that\' s happened in 2021. Women\' s liberation can free us all. In Ireland, Britain, the US, across Europe and the wider world, the trades union movement is stirring again. Rank and file groups are pushing union leaderships into action. The docks strike in Derry, the actions throughout the public sector, the Debenhams stoppage and many more examples show that workers are full of fight when their power is let loose. The brilliant campaigns in the US for union rights at Starbucks, Amazon and beyond show the way forward. Pressure for change from below is as strong as ever. The possibility of a New Ireland has been widely discussed in 2021. But only a strong socialist presence can ensure that it\' s the content of society which must be transformed, not just the constitutional arrangements. It\' s easy in the face of the multitude of problems that assail us to conclude that the world is going to hell in a handcart and there\' s nothing much we can do about it. That\' s wrong. There\' s always something we can do, if we do it together, in an organised way, according to the politics of liberation \- that is to say through socialist struggle. We mustn\' t wait to discover what the new year has in store, but begin to organise action \- in workplaces, communities, campaign groups, everywhere \- to bring about a better world, starting with our own little patch of the world. On the many crises with which we are faced, time is running out. Action is needed. Only socialist politics can unite the struggles. That should be our watchword for 2022.

collectively reduce our methane by 30% by 2030, and I think we could probably go beyond that," he said. "Today it's approaching 100 countries that are signing on. That's nearly half the global methane emissions... It's going to make a huge difference." He added: "One of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade to keep 1.5 degrees is reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible. "It's one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is. It amounts to about half the warming we are experiencing today." European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was "proud and happy and grateful" that over 80 countries signed up to the pledge to slash methane emissions : "Methane is 80 times more global warming than CO2. And today, global methane emissions grow faster than at any time in the past. "So cutting back on methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming and keep 1.5C. It is the lowest hanging fruit." President of the Pacific island nation of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, told the Cop26 summit that island nations such as his own are seeing their future being robbed from them : "We see the scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat, the warming sea is invading us and the winds are blowing us every which way, our resources are disappearing before our eyes and our future is being robbed from us," he said. "Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death - you might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and painful demise." The prime minister of Rwanda \'c9douard Ngirente told the Cop26 summit of how his country has witnessed the impact of climate change first hand : "We have fallen short of our duty to both people and the planet if we don't urgently address climate change. In Rwanda, we have seen first hand the impact of climate change - floods, droughts and landslides have cost livelihoods ... and cost many lives." Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the steps taken in the first days of the summit in Glasgow have been positive "I think all of these steps forward are positive and I think it's really important to retain a sense of optimism and forward momentum," she said. "I think it's really important - to look at the announcements that are being made at the moment and assess the extent to which they move forward from commitments that had already been made, or are they re-statements of commitments? "I think yesterday there was a sense of momentum but where that momentum will take us over the next couple of weeks remains to be seen." \</doc>

An all-island partnership between leading researchers on climate change and biodiversity will attempt to tackle what has become a "wickedly complex" challenge. That is according to Professor Peter Thorne, the Irish lead scientist on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the precursor to the UN climate change summit Cop26 in Glasgow. The director of the ICAR USC limate Research Centre at Maynooth University was speaking as the All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network was launched in a bid to tackle the crisis. Founding members include Prof Yvonne Buckley, vice president for biodiversity and climate action at Trinity College Dublin, and Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir, director of the Science Foundation Ireland MaREI Centre in Cork. Prof Thorne said there is a "real need for diverse expertise and perspectives to be bought together if we are to solve the wickedly complex challenges before us" when it comes to climate change and biodiversity. The All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network brings together researchers from a range of disciplines across the island of Ireland who are undertaking research in climate and biodiversity topics. Ireland is facing an unprecedented crisis in biodiversity; it is only the second country in the world to declare the situation a national emergency. However, there has been criticism from environmental and nature organisations since. A Citizens Assembly on how best to deal with the crisis has still not been established. The All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network "has never been more critical", according to Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, who is on hand along with the North's deputy first minister, Michelle O'Neill, for its launch today. "Climate change and the loss of biodiversity is one of the biggest threats facing humanity. It is a crisis and challenge shared by all on this island; it will require collaboration, research, and innovation across all sectors of public, private and civil society," said Mr Martin. Prof Buckley said the climate and biodiversity crises "transcend national, disciplinary, and sectoral boundaries". She said: "We all live on the same planet and urgently need to fulfil our international commitments to reducing greenhouse gases, while protecting and restoring the ecosystems that sustain our lives, livelihoods and wellbeing. "Researchers from different disciplines across both jurisdictions on the island have grasped this challenge and are working together through the the All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network to find those solutions." \</doc>

Andra Vladu Follow on twitter @Andra4Nature Youth activist for Youth Climate Association Northern Ireland, the 19-year-old A-level student at Strathearn is hoping to study biological sciences at university. "I was born in Romania and I grew up in the countryside surrounded by a load of nature. It was incredibly hard to get me in the house because I loved being outside so much," she explains. "I think I really developed such an interest in nature from a young age and I think that's what led me to be involved in the climate movement at a campaigning level. "When you start reading things like the IPCC report and the State of Nature report, then that kind of brings it home so much more. It was kind of a mixture of adding fuel to the fire of what I was already caring about." "I think we're all very good at looking after each other as well because climate activism can definitely lead to a lot of burnout." Working for a common goal is one thing, as is individual effort, but what is vital is speaking to those in positions of power to effect positive change. "It is kind of frustrating when you hear people say, 'I care, but there isn't much I can do', and I think that's a sort of negative approach to take to it because there is so much that every single individual can do. "I'm not talking about individual change to a really high level, because it's not fair to put everything on an individual. "We really, really need adults to support us in this movement as well. We need them to understand the scale of the crisis and to communicate that to the politicians and to talk to them about the fact that we do want fast and deep and meaningful actions. "It's a matter of getting involved in the community and being an active citizen because we are currently in such an awful situation. "We're facing the climate crisis and facing the nature crisis as well and I think people maybe don't really realise that because it's not incredibly obvious here. "We're not really feeling the impact, but if we're looking at countries who are suffering from droughts and floods and all these extreme weather events caused by climate change, I think that brings it a lot more closer to home." Kay Laverty Follow on Instagram @kay.laverty A youth climate activist for Fridays For Future Northern Ireland, Kay is studying English and Politics at Queen's. Each Friday for the past 130 weeks Kay and Anna Kernahan have embarked on strikes for climate awareness and she speaks about the importance of global grassroots groups. "In pretty much every country over the world there is a youth climate strike of sorts. Anna and I went to Cop26 and were meeting people from all over the world," she says. "I remember when I was a really small child my cousin was making a 'Save the Planet' poster. "I was about 15 when I got properly concerned and started doing the school strikes. It's annoying because you have to balance it out: is it passion or is it fear? I think it's a bit of both." Grassroots movements are getting the message across, which Kay describes as ironic. "We're literally just a bunch of teenagers/young adults trying our best and posting stuff on social media. It can feel quite surreal when people go: 'Yes, it's really important that you guys are there and it's essential'. But it's: 'Should we even be doing this?'" However, climate literacy and raising awareness are vital if we are to fully engage with making effective changes. "I would also say climate literacy, climate education is not promoted enough. Teaching kids the science and letting them know what is happening is important. "Before Covid, we'd have hundreds of people out for the strikes and you have a lot of teachers bringing along these little kids, and that would be great." Climate change is not somebody else's problem but while a certain level of personal responsibility is needed, so too is looking at those who can make widescale change. "A lot of people feel the climate emergency is some sort of political stance as opposed to something that's actually real and affects everyone equally and non-discriminately," says Kay. "We need to look at these big, powerful companies and the government because those are the only people who can make the actual change. "We can do our recycling or buy a bamboo toothbrush or whatever, but what we need to do is to hold people accountable and create systematic change as opposed to individual change." Rosalind Skillen Follow on twitter and Instagram @rosalindskillen Highly technical, industry specific vocabulary around the climate crisis can alienate those who potentially want to be involved, says the activist. "I think the climate crisis is a crisis of communication. People know that climate change is happening and they know all about climate breakdown, but it's just not resonating with people and their hearts and minds because we're communicating in a language that people don't understand," says Rosalind (23). "People are really afraid of not being an expert. There is this idea that you need to be an expert to be involved in the movement." Seeing the crisis as a human rights issue, Rosalind's interest was sparked in learning about the harmful nature of fast fashion on garment workers and their rights. "Then looking at a lot of environmental degradation and damage and how that was affecting people and continues to affect people every day and people living in poverty, it's a social justice issue," she explains. It can be difficult for those living here to adequately understand the climate crisis considering many impacts are almost imperceptible. "When it comes to language, I think it's to do with speaking to people in a language they understand, but also understanding how you can deliver value for them. So Tearfund [NGO Rosalind volunteers for], for example, is a Christian organisation, and if I were to go into a church or faith community and talk about the climate crisis and why churches should begin to address it more, we're talking to them in terms of language like creation care, stewardship, we're not talking necessarily of climate change science. "If you go into a business corporate context, we talk about it in terms of economic opportunity and great growth. The overall collective goal is the same: you're wanting to engage that group of people or that organisation in the climate crisis. But you're angling it in a way that resonates with them. That's what people need to do more - understand their audience." Having worked on a mural to unite communities into backing significant climate change legislation, Rosalind sees the benefit of engaging creative and cultural sectors. She will be speaking in "It's just so important for people from different cultures and communities to be together. Also, even from a language perspective, so much of this is in English and I know there's a new movement of people talking about how it's really inaccessible to people who don't speak English as their first language. That's also something we don't always bear in mind either." Dakota Reid Follow on twitter @ThisisDakota The Environmental Management postgraduate at Queen's has always been interested in nature and became more involved in activism at the beginning of the pandemic. Given the swift reaction that countries had to Covid, she is optimistic change in terms of the climate crisis can occur. "Yes, it does make me feel optimistic that I can see how we can really change and treat something like a crisis when we want to," says the 22-year-old. "Obviously we don't want to have to be dealing with either a global health emergency, nor climate emergency, nor nature emergency. "But at the end of the day, I think it is possible to react to these things quickly and ultimately we are investing in the measures we need to be taking now and we save ourselves a lot of economic and social environmental damage in the long-term. "I think it does give me hope that we can act urgently and we can act radically, but obviously we're yet to see governments really adopt that thinking and urgency to the environmental crises." Like Rosalind, Dakota is keen to use language that conveys the situation's urgency and also that we understand the words we're using. "A lot of the words and phrases in the media, there's a broad understanding. The phrase 'greenwashing' is something I've heard people use and people look blankly. It's not a word that people necessarily understand yet it's a really important word to convey the challenges we're facing right now. "It is important that people are aware of some of the jargon around these things. It's also important that the language reflects the urgency. Instead of talking about climate change, which sounds quite incremental or not necessarily that concerning, going for things like climate crisis or climate emergency." Compassion for others, she says, is important and goes a long way. "I think it's as important to act for the other people as opposed to the people in Northern Ireland. "I think it is important that we lower our emissions for the people in Bangladesh, people in Fiji and other places that are being affected now. But we will be affected. "We see the projected levels of sea level rise. It's going to affect a lot of people in Belfast. It's going to affect the city centre. It's going to affect a lot of low income communities in north and east Belfast. Ciara Henry Follow on twitter @CiaraHenry_1995 The Green Party representative for Bangor East/Donaghadee has had a lifelong love for animals which gradually saw her move into conservation projects and issues of species loss and biodiversity. "Slowly but surely that branched off into greater interest in green economy and green politics and environmentalism as a whole, and transition politics," says the 26-year-old. She has been involved with the Greens since she was 18 and studying for a B.Tech in Animal Management. "It wasn't a mainstream ideology, but with such heavy coverage of things like Cop26 , the IPCC report, I definitely think people are more aware, and not just people, specifically young people," she says when we chat about how the issues put forward by her party since its inception are gaining traction. Again, like many interviewees, she sees the benefit of collective campaign, but says: "You don't need campaign groups and you don't need young people on the street shouting and screaming if the things that are happening are working." Ciara worked with Ulster Wildlife's Our Bright Future programme, a focus of which was outdoor education in secondary schools. "There's such a heavy push obviously in the early years to get kids outside, especially in nurseries and creches, and even at the start of primary school, but it seems to be once you get to key stage three and onwards, and certainly into secondary school, that completely falls by the wayside," she says. "How can you expect people to love, respect and want to learn about nature if you don't get them outside and get them involved in it?" Teaching climate education in schools is also important, she says. "With a much heavier push on green education, green politics and politics as a whole," she explains. "Bringing the A-level Politics class up to Stormont to tell them how the political system works is great, but they're the students who already know how to do it. We want to be telling kids in Citizenship in third year how to contact a councillor, what a councillor does, what a MLA does, what's the difference in those jobs." Ciara also stresses the importance of getting more women in political roles and getting more men involved in campaign work, given that environmental campaigning is often viewed as women's work.

A Dublin native has become the first Irish person in recent times to be inaugurated as Lord Mayor of the City of London. Vincent Keaveny was sworn in today at the Royal Courts of Justice and is the 693rd person to hold the office. The Lord Mayor of London serves as the elected head of the City of London Corporation and their terms last one year. A spokesperson for the office told RT\'c9 that other mayors with Irish links included William McArthur, who assumed office in 1880 and was from Co Donegal. "Vincent is the first Irish person in recent times to take the role," he added. Mr Keaveny assumed office yesterday and today's Lord Mayor's Show - which dates back to the 13th century - is the first official engagement of a new mayor. The procession included full-size model elephants, Japanese drummers, and a horse-drawn bus, while the state coach is the oldest ceremonial vehicle in the world still in regular use, according to show organisers. Footage shared on social media showed activists blocking the route of the parade, forcing riders on horseback to stop and the new Lord Mayor's golden state coach to come to a halt. Police officers were seen dragging people out of the road while crowds who had lined the streets watched on. A City of London Police spokesperson said: "We are aware of a group of protesters in the City today. "City of London Police officers are engaging with the group to minimise disruption. A number of arrests have been made." Delighted and honoured to have just taken office as the 693rd Lord Mayor of the City of London, at the silent ceremony in Guildhall.

The organisation said the action was in response to the "failure" of COP26 , and protesters dressed up wearing giant heads depicting British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak while others locked themselves together in the roads. Miranda Duncombe, a mother and member of the XR Families group, said: "COP has failed to deliver the transformative changes needed to keep us at 1.5C of warming, a complete betrayal of our children. "If the City of London was a country, it would be the ninth largest emitter in the world. The City's banks and asset managers provide loans and investments for the projects and companies that are killing us. "I am here for my children's future. Our government has failed to act to protect them. "I'm calling for the City of London to divest from fossil fuels immediately for the children everywhere who are dying due to the climate crisis and those who will die in the future." \</doc>

The Economic and Social Research Institute has said carbon taxes directly applied to aviation fuels would do more to reduce emissions and would cost less to the aviation sector than indirect charges on passengers. In a study published today, the ESRI examined the European Commission's "Fit for 55" proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It models the impact on the aviation industry and the wider economy of various proposals as part of its Aviation Carbon Tax Project in cooperation with the Department of Transport. The proposals include phasing out the exemption from taxation of kerosene - used as jet fuel - and the removal of free Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances for airlines. It also examined levying VAT on flights. COP26 negotiations highlighted the need for all sectors, including aviation, to lower emissions. The ESRI noted that, as with most taxes, if the price of aviation were to be increased, demand would fall and so would economic activity. However, it noted that the percentage reductions are small as are the expected reductions in emissions. It said there would need to be a big increase in the cost of flying to affect decisions by individuals to fly, particularly from an island such as Ireland. It believes the most efficient method to lower emissions from the sector would be to phase out free ETS allowances for airlines and to tax kerosene jet fuel. It noted there would be spillover affects to sectors such as tourism. Senior Research Officer with the ESRI and co-author of the report Kelly de Bruin said: "There is increasing commitment to decrease EU\' s aviation emissions and we can expect increasing taxation on aviation  in the case of Ireland, as a small island state, the lack of substitutes for aviation requires in-depth considerations of further policy actions." \</doc>

HEADS of delegations at the COP26 climate summit are scheduled to meet this morning to review a second draft of an agreement expected to be delivered to them overnight. A first draft that was delivered early yesterday morning got a mixed response. Its wording was stronger than previous COP agreements, but not strong enough to achieve the ambition of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. A key feature of the text is a call to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". It is the first time that the phasing out of fossil fuels has been included as a declared intention in a COP agreement, but it was not expected to survive redraft, with the main oil-producing countries expressing early opposition. The text reiterated the aim of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement in that it "reaffirms the long-term global goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C". It increased the ambition of previous agreements by stressing the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 45pc by 2030 relative to 2010, and to net zero by "around mid-century". But despite the new emphasis at the talks over the last week and a half on urgently reducing methane emissions, the text only "invites" countries to "consider further opportunities to reduce non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions". Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan, who is leading the Irish delegation at the talks in Glasgow, said there was some strong language in the text but added: "It's not enough and we need to go further and do more. Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, who attended the talks yesterday, said there was disappointment among EU countries that no formal mechanism was included in the text to provide for a 'loss and damage' fund to ensure ready access to emergency funds for countries suffering climate-related disasters. Countries met separately and in group sessions from early yesterday morning to assess the text and deliver responses. By late afternoon, it was clear there was opposition to parts of it. British Prime Minister Boris "There is a huge amount to do," he said. He warned failure to secure an ambitious agreement would cause public anger. "The backlash will be immense and it will be long-lasting and we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium," he said. The talks were boosted last night by a joint statement between the US and China announcing their joint commitment to enhanced action on emissions. COP26 president Alok Sharma said his team would revise the draft text overnight and call all countries together this morning. He said he still hoped to wrap up the summit tomorrow evening. 'It's not enough. We need to go further and do more' \</doc>

Climate change experts and campaigners, including participants in the Dublin Climate Dialogues, were asked what their COP26 expectations are, and whether they are optimistic about the summit's ability to meet the climate threat. Lorna Gold Climate justice campaigner As COP26 is taking place in my home city, I have a particular interest in seeing it succeed. All COPs are billed as "the most important yet", but this one in my eyes is hugely significant because unlike the last few, it offers real hope. Trump is gone, and whilst Biden faces an uphill struggle on climate, there is no shortage of goodwill and ambition. The pandemic, moreover, is teaching humanity some sobering lessons regarding the consequences of science, as well as the need to work collectively to tackle threats to human survival. This COP has to seal the rule book on how the Paris Agreement will be delivered and address the thorny issue of "loss and damage" - historic claims on climate harms inflicted by wealthy nations. The single most important issue, however, I believe is money. Wealthy countries have utterly failed to deliver on their promise of $100 billion per year to support poorer countries, which are already feeling the brunt of climate breakdown. New finance mechanisms to tackle climate change are emerging but these are largely through private sector initiatives. Can real progress be made? The pandemic has blown a massive hole in public finances globally and it is hard to see how new public resources to support global climate action will emerge. This could yet derail the whole process. P\'e1draic Fogarty Irish Wildlife Trust ecologist & biodiversity champion Loss of biodiversity must be a central concern at COP26 , all those "net zero" targets implicitly need some means to take carbon dioxide from the air. Why pin our hopes on a technological breakthrough when nature has been sequestering carbon for aeons? While land use and forests are already accounted for in national greenhouse gas emissions inventories there is no accounting for the enormous role played by our oceans. Bottom trawling was recently shown to release as much carbon dioxide as the aviation industry while it's also a highly destructive way to catch fish. Bringing it to an end while establishing marine protected areas will help store and draw down carbon while reviving marine life. Globally, forests need to be better protected (and restored) but there is no differentiating between natural, biodiversity-rich forests and monoculture plantations which are not as effective in storing carbon. In Ireland, our peatlands could be climate heroes but only emissions from "managed" peatlands are counted, so emissions from fires and overgrazing by sheep get a pass. This must change. Rewilding our land and oceans, while regenerating agricultural soils, are among the cheapest, easiest and most effective forms of climate action. I hope COP26 will recognise this. Can real progress be made? We are fortunate in that we know what needs to be done and we have the tools to do it . . . I feel there is progress but the pace is way too slow. Saoi O'Connor Climate activist & FridaysForFuture leader Many governments bemoaned the loss of COP last year, but have not taken any steps towards real climate action during the 25 previous COPs. Many governments have appropriated the radical language of peoples' movements for climate justice in saying the COP is urgently needed because "we need action now". This is not untrue, but the lack of action from leaders in the Global North is not down to a lack of conferences, it is due to a lack of willingness to act. No amount of COPs will change this, because the people who hold the power in those negotiations do not want it to change. In addition, due to vaccine inequity and the Covid-19 pandemic, this COP will most likely be excluding those people who need to be heard most around these tables - civil society, and those from the peoples and areas most impacted by climate change. Can real progress be made? It won't come from those sitting around the decision-making table. The potential for climate solutions and for dismantling the systems that created this crisis comes from the people; it always has. Prof John Sweeney Maynooth University climate scientist & COP veteran The choreography leading up to COP26 has been remarkably similar to that which preceded the ill-fated COP15 Copenhagen event in 2009. Once again we see efforts to reach a pre-meeting agreement by the world's two largest polluters: China and the US. Once again the EU has increased its emissions reduction target, now at least 55 per cent by 2030. But will the Glasgow COP overcome the five-year logjam that has occurred since the 2015 Paris Agreement? Agreeing the rules for carbon trading, and transparency in reporting, remain the main stumbling blocks. Countries such as Brazil, Australia and China were identified at the last COP as actively blocking agreement. Tied to this will be the running sore of whether rich countries will implement their commitment to supplying the finance necessary to assist transition in developing countries, and easing debt repayments to aid their post-Covid green recovery. Can real progress be made? Experience suggests we should temper our expectations of success. Negotiators' briefs prioritise national self-interest over global community good. The best we can hope for is further incremental progress, but not enough to turn around the climate and biodiversity emergency. Sin\'e9ad Walsh Irish Climate Envoy & DFA deputy director general for Irish Aid and Africa My first hope for COP26 is that representatives of people on the front lines of climate change will be able to participate actively, despite Covid. Linked to this, there is a real issue of climate justice that this COP has to tackle. We must meet our global commitment to increase climate finance to $100 billion per year and spend much of this helping the poorest countries adapt to climate impacts, which are destroying lives and livelihoods and driving conflict. I would also highlight the need for a strong focus on oceans at COP, a key priority for Minister Simon Coveney who frequently points to how coastal communities are some of the worst affected. Finally, of course, emissions reduction. Our own Climate Bill is very ambitious and necessarily so. Can real progress be made? I am certainly more optimistic than I was at the end of last year. We are making good progress domestically. The US Earth Day Summit has given a great boost to mitigation ambition and Dublin Dialogues next week will be helpful too in keeping momentum going. Prof Andrew Keane Director of UCD Energy Institute With COP26 , we have a real opportunity to act together in the interest of our planet and our people. From my perspective, the key areas for agreement are ambitious emissions targets in line with the best science and engineering, backed up by financial commitments and a robust governance framework. Mandatory targets will provide a focus for investment in technologies, infrastructure, education, and research. Significant progress is being made with an acceleration of technology development, but this needs to be supported by a political and financial framework that brings communities and citizens on the journey. A net-zero energy system in 2050 can be a reality and requires investment and transformation of our infrastructure with energy being transported from areas with high renewable potential to areas of demand. There is a major opportunity for Ireland given our rich offshore wind resource, along with opportunities for an improved quality of life and environment for our citizens. Can real progress be made? With major nations now signalling real intent, I am more optimistic the world will get the agreement it needs. Research will play a key role in unlocking many of the opportunities. Dr Hannah Daly Emissions expert at UCC MaREI institute The pledges made by the Paris Agreement in 2015 need to be greatly strengthened: current commitments would lock in 2.7 degree warming by 2100, way off course from meeting the Paris Agreement goals. How far the new pledges go in closing that gap will be a key measure of the summit's success. My hope is that very strong near-term targets are set - we know that an immediate and steep decrease in global greenhouse gas emissions is needed to prevent the worst impacts of climate change - and that pledges are backed up by concrete policy measures and financing, such as phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels and setting timelines on ending coal power. Can real progress be made? I hope the summit will be a catalyst for reinvigorating public and media pressure for global action, led by young people, which was halted by Covid-19. Dr Aidan Farrow Air quality scientist at Greenpeace Research Labs, University of Exeter It is well-established that air pollutants from fossil fuels are responsible for chronic and acute illnesses, damage to ecosystems, the economy and millions of premature deaths each year. Today these harms are often felt disproportionately by marginalised and poor communities. When it comes to cutting emissions there is no time for delay. There can be no higher priority at COP26 than to achieve credible emission reduction pathways, plugging gaps between the Paris Agreement and fully implemented policy. The urgency of the climate and air pollution crisis demands direct fossil fuel phaseout. Solutions such as carbon markets and offsetting schemes, which allow emissions to continue do nothing to protect human health, human rights or biodiversity today and are no substitute for emission cuts at source. Can real progress be made? Past national and international efforts to improve air quality have achieved significant success, and have a track record of boosting the economy through improving our health and environment. COP26 presents a historic opportunity to tackle the immediate and long-term impacts of air pollution and climate. Compiled by Kevin O'Sullivan \</doc>

From cartoon apes to video clips, sales of NFTs reached some $25 billion in 2021 as the speculative crypto asset exploded in popularity, data from market tracker DappRadar shows, although there were signs of growth slowing towards the end of the year. Prices of some non-fungible tokens, crypto assets representing a digital item such as an image, video, or even land in virtual worlds, rose so fast last year that speculators sometimes 'flipped' them for a profit within days. The art world has been quick to cash in, with auction houses selling NFTs representing simple cartoons for millions of dollars with no physical objects changing hands. One NFT artwork fetched a record $69.3 million at a Christie's sale in March. Meanwhile, some of the world's top brands, including Coca Cola and Gucci, have also sold NFTs. NFT sales volume totalled $24.9 billion in 2021, compared to just $94.9 million the year before, DappRadar, said on Monday. DappRadar collects data across ten different blockchains, which are used to record who owns the NFT. Estimates of volumes vary by different data provider, depending on what is included. CryptoSlam, which also tracks multiple blockchains, said the 2021 total was $18.3 billion. NonFungible.com, which tracks the ethereum blockchain only, put 2021 sales at $15.7 billion. This means the money spent on NFTs in 2021 is roughly equivalent to the amount pledged at COP26 to help countries phase out coal, or the funding made available by the World Bank to buy and deploy Covid-19 vaccines. Sales peaked in August, then declined in September, October and November before picking up again in December, data from the biggest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, showed. This does not appear to be correlated with fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies, which are often used to buy NFTs, as bitcoin and ether rose in the September to November period. While the most expensive known NFT sale was $69.3 million, a common price range was $100 to $1,000, NonFungible.com said. Prices of the most sought-after NFTs were highly volatile. By December it had fallen to around $350,000, CryptoSlam data shows. Collectible NFTs were the most popular category, followed by art, NonFungible.com said. Some of the most eye-watering NFT sales have been for land in online metaverse environments. Virtual real estate investor Republic Realm bought land in the virtual world The Sandbox for $4.3 million in November. \</doc>

Thousands of activists have taken part in climate protests across the island of Ireland. Dublin and Belfast witnessed two of the largest demonstrations, while events were staged in a variety of other towns and cities including Cork and Londonderry. Katie Harrington was among the crowds who gathered at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin for a march through the city to Government Buildings. ``For me it's extremely important that we use our voices,'' said the Dublin woman. ``I'm not here for myself, I'm here for future generations. We need our government to actually act on climate change and the climate crisis, not just keep talking and not just keep making plans. ``It's really important for us to use our voices and march on these streets so we're heard.'' Among those to address a rally at Belfast City Hall was acclaimed teenage author and naturalist from Co Fermanagh Dara McAnulty. ``We are at a junction as a species and there are two paths in front of us,'' he told the crowds. ``One - we change our future, we make a difference, we go on the road to restorative justice and climate action. ``Or we can go down the path of further destruction and inevitably the demise of our species.'' The events on the island were part of a global day of action aimed at increasing pressure on world leaders attending the Cop26 conference on climate change in Glasgow. Catherine O'Rourke from Liverpool was in Dublin to visit her daughter. She said she felt compelled to come down and join in the protest. ``I am very concerned about the future for my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and we've got to make a difference,'' she said. ``We can't just hope for it, we've got to do it. We've got to make our governments wake up before it's too late. It's already nearly too late. I had to come - I'd no choice.'' Susan Rossney from Dublin credited the Irish government with making ``good progress'' on climate action. But she added: ``It still bears repeating every day and in every possible format that everyone has to take action on the climate crisis. ``It's for us now, it's for the entire world and it's so unjust that so much pollution is being created by the developed world and the developing world is bearing the brunt of this.'' Daithi McKay, the vice chair of the NI Climate Coalition, helped organise the event in Belfast. ``We've heard a lot of promises, we've heard a lot of pledges,'' he said of Cop26 . ``But we need much more than that - we need immediate action.'' Chloe Ferguson, the chair of Queen's University Students' Union Climate Action Group, said street protests could have a ``massive impact''. ``When we look at what politicians and what our leaders respond to, they listen to what's going to cause them the most bother publicly,'' she said. end \</doc>

The fossil fuel industry benefits from subsidies of $11 million (EUR 9.5 million) every minute, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF found the production and burning of coal, oil and gas was subsidised by $5.9 trillion in 2020, with not a single country pricing all its fuels sufficiently to reflect their full supply and environmental costs. Experts said the subsidies were "adding fuel to the fire" of the climate crisis, at a time when rapid reductions in carbon emissions were urgently needed. Explicit subsidies that cut fuel prices accounted for 8 per cent of the total and tax breaks another 6 per cent. The biggest factors were failing to make polluters pay for the deaths and poor health caused by air pollution (42 per cent) and for the heatwaves and other impacts of global heating (29 per cent). Setting fossil fuel prices that reflect their true cost would cut global CO2 emissions by over a third, the IMF analysts said. This would be a big step towards meeting the internationally agreed 1.5 degree target. Keeping this target within reach is a key goal of the UN Cop26 climate summit in November. Pricing of pollution Agreeing rules for carbon markets, which enable the proper pricing of pollution, is another Cop26 goal. "Fossil fuel price reform could not be timelier," the IMF researchers said. The ending of fossil fuel subsidies would also prevent nearly a million deaths a year from dirty air and raise trillions of dollars for governments, they said. "There would be enormous benefits from reform, so there's an enormous amount at stake," said Ian Parry, the lead author of the IMF report. "Some countries are reluctant to raise energy prices because they think it will harm the poor. But holding down fossil fuel prices is a highly inefficient way to help the poor, because most of the benefits accrue to wealthier households. It would be better to target resources towards helping poor and vulnerable people directly." - The Guardian \</doc>

As the world marks Earth Day 2022 today, countries across Europe are grappling with how to wean themselves off fossil fuels, especially oil and gas from Russia. Some environmental campaigners are even cautiously optimistic that the war in Ukraine could provide the push needed to finally move the west towards more renewables. "The best way to cure an addiction is to get off it completely and not go looking for another dealer," said Tara Connolly, Senior Gas Campaigner at Global Witness. Eight weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe\' s dependency on fossil fuels has been brought into sharp focus. Here are three ways in which the EU is trying to cut back on fossil fuels in response to the crisis. But as soaring living costs put pressure on governments, there is a danger that some poorer European countries outside the bloc, will turn to short-fix solutions, meaning vital climate targets are missed. Despite its pledge to cut off Russian energy supplies by 2027, in the short term, the EU remains dependent on Moscow for 26% of its oil imports and 40% of its gas - importing 155 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year. This week, the European Commission vowed to assess whether it could accelerate this shift away from Russia, by working towards a higher target of a 45% share of renewable energy by 2030, instead of the current target of 40%. "We are working on it at full speed," Mechthild Woersdoerfer, deputy director-general of the Commission's energy department, told a meeting of EU lawmakers on Wednesday. All this builds on the landmark 'Green Deal\' put before the European Parliament at the end of 2019, which marked an ambitious policy shift for the European Union, in which it determined to become the first "climate-neutral bloc" by 2050. Russia is currently the EU's top gas supplier, but the bloc now expects to reduce European demand for Russian gas by two thirds by the end of this year, before phasing it out completely by that deadline in five years\' time. "It\' s quite a jump from where we are now," says Luke O\' Callaghan-White, Senior Researcher at the Dublin-based Institute of International and European Affairs. "But it speaks to the seriousness with which the commission is finally recognising the European over-dependence on Russian energy, but also Europe-wide over-dependence on fossil energy." He said the main obstacles standing in the way are political. Italy imports all of its gas and the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Russian supplies cannot be cut off overnight, with its sights now set on phasing them out by the end of this year. "Countries like Poland are incredibly dependent on oil and gas imports from Russia whereas in Ireland, we import through pipelines from the UK, so there\' s a divergence of priorities that are there," he added. But she added: "NGOs had been looking for a 45% target eight years ago the last time Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, so it's disappointing that it's taken a brutal invasion for Europe to fully acknowledge the benefits of renewables." Global Witness believes an even higher target of 50% should be looked at by the EU for 2030. It is also calling for an immediate embargo of Russian fossil fuels as one of the best ways to end the war and "stop bankrolling Putin\' s war machine". 2. Harnessing the sun and the wind The EU already gets 22% of its gross final energy consumption from renewables such as wind, solar and biomass, according to the latest figures from 2020. The share varies widely between EU countries, ranging from more than 50% in Sweden to below 10% in Luxembourg. In its plan published next month, the European Commission is expected to outline legal proposals to make it easier for renewable energy projects to get permits. Luke O\' Callaghan-White said only a big move towards renewables in the next few months has the potential to pull Europe - and the west - out of the economic chaos caused by Russia\' s war in Ukraine. He pointed to the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found opportunities to cut global emissions affordably had risen, but only if governments take hard and fast action. "Otherwise we are not going to meet our Paris climate obligations and the most important work really needs to take place right now, not in the future," he warned. There's a price, invisible and sometimes not so invisible, that we\' ve all been paying for our reliance on fossil fuels./n But Mr O'Callaghan-White believes there is some cause for optimism: "It is clear we have all the technological capabilities and financial pathways are available. "All that\' s missing is the political will and it's a welcome development that the Commission and the Parliament have been looking for an increase in the share of renewable energy mix by 2030." He believes that in Ireland\' s case the real opportunity is in wind energy, and not in the construction a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal here, which he said could take years to develop and ultimately prove to be a "white elephant". It could also cause serious political fall-out among current coalition government partners, due to opposition from the Green Party over the potential import of fracked gas. "Even if An Bord Plean\'e1la gave permission for the LNG plant terminal to go ahead tomorrow, gas wouldn\' t come on stream for ten years," he added. Instead, Mr O'Callaghan-White said a more joined-up approach was needed across Europe, pointing to a Danish proposal this week to ramp up the wind power it can provide from a series of energy islands across the North Sea. "Denmark and Europe must be free of Russian fossil fuels as fast as possible," Denmark\' s Minister of Climate, Energy, and Utilities Dan J\'f8rgensen said of the plans. "The North Sea holds the wind potential to cover the energy need of millions of European homes." Luke O\' Callaghan-White agrees: "This has the ability to provide power to ten million homes in Europe, Denmark has a population of just under six million. "So, through greater inter-connection between European countries there is an opportunity for those countries  less disposed to a speedy transition to renewables." Industry groups such as SolarPower Europe are also urging Brussels to do more to ease delays in issuing permits and has warned there is also a shortage of installers. The European Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson, told the Solar Power Summit late last month: "We need to bring manufacturing back to Europe, and the commission is willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen." She said this would include help to finance projects. The Commission has said 170 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas could be replaced with 480 gigawatts (GW) of wind and 420 GW of solar capacity by 2030, representing a tripling in wind and solar capacity. 3. People power - individuals urged to cut down on their energy consumption to help Ukraine The International Energy Agency and the European Commission yesterday outlined a range of measures. Simple steps, they said, would allow people to reduce their energy usage and save money amidst mounting bills. The IEA said just adjusting boiler settings, driving more slowly and swapping short-haul flights for trains, could help consumers reduce reliance on Russian energy and cut their bills. "This would have the potential ... to fill 120 super tankers or save enough natural gas to heat almost 20 million homes, if adopted by all EU citizens," the watchdog said. "Faced with the horrendous scenes of human suffering that we\' ve seen following Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine, people in Europe want to take action," IEA Executive Director Dr Birol said. Balkan nations are among those turning back to the most polluting fossil fuels of all./n "Using less energy is a concrete way to help the Ukrainian people \- and to help ourselves. This guide has easy-to-follow steps that with little or no discomfort on our part can reduce the flow of money to Russia\' s military and help put us on a path to a cleaner and more sustainable planet." Addressing the IEA meeting, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said all these smaller efficiencies could quickly add up. "That saves consumers money, it reduces the amount of gas that we buy from the market and therefore revenues going to the Russian government, and it's a step in the efficiencies direction, where we need to go anyway," he told the meeting. Luxembourg\' s Minister for Energy and Special Planning Claude Turmes warned that concrete regulatory measures were needed such as a coordinated speed limit across Europe. European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul J\'f8rgensen said it would take time to regulate across Europe and there was a lot that could be done at an individual level in the meantime. Luke O\' Callaghan-White said that while such individual actions do count for something, it is most important for political leaders themselves to show the change. "When you start to prioritise individual actions, you do show a gulf between those who can afford some of the more expensive retrofit schemes, and those who can\' t." The danger of the old reliables While larger and richer economies such as Germany are accelerating the adaptation towards renewables, the rising cost of living and energy prices in some poorer European countries - which are outside of the EU - are being pushed towards coal. Balkan nations are among those turning back to the most polluting fossil fuels of all, raising fears among environmentalists that they are rowing back on commitments to phase it out. North Macedonia, once a frontrunner in attracting renewable energy investors, said earlier this month it planned to open two new coal mines to supply power stations. "With the start of the energy crisis, not just us but all nations in Europe have immediately increased the production of electricity from coal because it is the cheapest and most secure (source)," said Vasko Kovacevski, CEO of state-owned power utility Elektrani na Severna Makedonija (ESM). Kosovo, meanwhile, said foreign companies - including from Germany - had also inquired about buying coal. Kosovo has the world's fifth largest deposits of lignite, a soft coal whose relatively low energy content translates to especially toxic pollution when burnt. Serbia has said it is increasing coal production due to insufficient rain for hydro-electric plants, and that it will import 500 tonnes of coal per day from Montenegro. Bosnia, the only Balkan country that exports electricity, says it will delay plans to shut down coal-fired power plants due to high energy prices and the impact of war in Ukraine. Russia is also redirecting its energy exports from the west to friendly countries, such as China and India, which have refused to condemn its actions in Ukraine and continue to buy Russian crude. India, the world's third largest oil importer, has booked at least 16 million barrels of Russian oil since the invasion began, almost as much as it bought in all of 2021, according to calculations by the news agency Reuters. Meanwhile, oil producers from the Middle East, who said they felt treated like outcasts at the COP26 The US has challenged oil companies to drill more in an attempt to bring down soaring gasoline prices there - going against President Joe Biden's own stalled greener policies. "They definitely feel that they are back on people\' s Christmas lists, as such, but it's very up in the air at the moment," said Tara Connolly of Global Witness. "It can be a bit murky because everyone is throwing the kitchen sink at this problem." However, she thinks the war in Ukraine has opened many people\' s eyes to the darker and dirtier side of energy supply and hopes this change is here to stay. "I think I\' m more optimistic because the world has realised that gas is not reliable, it's not cheap and it's not clean and it's not good for global geo-stability either," she said. "There\' s a price, invisible and sometimes not so invisible, that we\' ve all been paying for our reliance on fossil fuels, and I think the awareness of that is now much greater than it would have been last year." \</doc>
